The storyline was excellent with a strong, smart, beautiful woman in the lead, countered by a handsome sheikh! The buildup to Delaney and the Sheikh getting together was excruitiating, but worth the wait. My only complaint is that the book wasn't much longer. I wouldn't mind reading a sequel or two on those hunky brothers of Delaney's either! A quick but satisfying read."},{"Title":"Delaney's Desert Sheikh","review":"Story: GOODIntimacy Level: GOODEnjoyment: VERY GOODI CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE giving this book less than 5 stars. Its really good and man o man o man, I read it and love it, you just have to read it, words can not express how good this book was as and well written and the family now that's a family I would love to call my own but mines are prefect the way they are.....Jamal and Delaney's story was pure pleasure to read. This book long ago introduced me to Brenda Jackson. This is only the beginning as the brothers and cousin's stories are just as good."},{"Title":"Delaney's Desert Sheikh","review":"I've been avoiding this book for a while and decided to finally buy it based on the reviews. This is easily one of the best books she has ever written. Some of her books read the same but this was hot! I was wondering how they would be together because of his desire to have a mistress and her desire to be the only woman. It was a page turner. The chemistry was hot and realistic and made you want them to be together. One of my all time favorite books!"},{"Title":"Delaney's Desert Sheikh","review":"Ok there should be more books like this one! I had to read it twice because it was so good this book is my second favorite book!! Delaney and Jamal should have a sequel. I didn't want the book to end. I found myself a couple having to take a breather because the erotic sex seems got me a little excited. Brenda will you please consider writing a sequel to this amazing book???"},{"Title":"Delaney's Desert Sheikh","review":"Because this book is written for the Desire series let me just say that the book is really based on the attraction and eventually the love that blossoms between the two main characters. This story is about love, sacrifice, and family ties. Not much plot not much danger however the way that both characters deal with their families their views on family is quite heart touching. For those of you looking for a romance book that deals with racism since both the heroine and hero are not of the same race than this is not the book for you. In fact, the author did not make it an issue in the book and what a sigh of relief! In conclusion this book was great!"},{"Title":"Delaney's Desert Sheikh","review":"As usual, Brenda Jackson gives readers more than a mouthful of flavor with her unique style of writing.Jackson again has created a true to life romantic saga that only she is capable of doing. Nobody tells a tale of love like my girl. The plot, setting,theme,and the characters in this book all mixed together produce another best-seller with a fabulous flavor.She by far is my favorite author."},{"Title":"Delaney's Desert Sheikh","review":"I take my hat of to Mrs. Jackson. Delaney was a strong woman that know her mind. I loved the fact that she gave Jamal Ari a hard time, good looking men need humbling. I enjoy the plot of Jamal being a prince, I think that was a wonderful twist to the story. Two people from two total different worlds falling in love and willing to make chances in order to be together. I cried when Jamal was willing to give up becoming king for the woman he loved. It can't get any stronger then that. Mrs. Jackson keep up the good work and I look forward to reading more from you."},{"Title":"Delaney's Desert Sheikh","review":"This is the 1st. book I have read by Brenda Jackson & just loved it. I checked out her web site & found it is the 1st. in a long series & couldn't wait to get on to the rest.I just love the characters in this book, especially her brothers. I can't wait to read their stories. I'm just about to start \\"A little Dare\\" (bk 2).

This book is different in that it focuses on the totality of the individual(i.e. demeanor, looks, speech patterns etc.). Most of the information in this book is common sense, therefore people tend to take these things lightly. When one takes things lightly, they tend to slip and cause us not to be mindful of things we should be mindful of in interviews. Things such as crossing your legs, twiddling your thumbs, using non-fluentcies such as \\"er\\" and \\"ah\\" and slouching in your seat can destroy a person's credibility and hence cost him the job. The overall opinion of you is determined within a matter seconds when meeting the employer for the first time. Therefore it is imperitive that one is mindful of his nonverbal image and practice it in everyday life so it becomes automatic. Other things contained herein are very seldom noticed by interviewees.The negatives of this book are few, but I do find them irritating.1) The word \\"convey\\" is overused.The author should have invested in a thesaurus.2) The author seems to think that it's not appropiate to go to an interview with a shaved head or very short hair.The book was published in 2000, so I'm sure short hair and shaved heads were fairly popular in all professions then.3) the author seems to think that all black men have dark hair.In suggesting what color suit people should wear, the author overgeneralizes about blacks hair color. I for one have light brown hair and many other light-skinned blacks have red hair. Also, what about albinos? No suggestions are given for people who just may happen to be albino.The book really makes up for these negatives in the other useful parts, so it's worth buying."},{"Title":"The People, Yes.","review":"I first read, &quot;The People, Yes&quot; in 1966, while I was still a high school student. I discovered then that reading and writing poetry was cool. More than anything I had ever read before that it spoke to me in such a personal way, that poetry could be warm, sad, funny and powerful all at the same time. While my friends talked about Kerouac, and Ginsberg, and of course Catcher in the Rye, I read everything Carl Sandburg ever wrote. I used my original copy to teach my high school students with until the cover fell off and the pages came apart. It has always held a special spot on my bookshelf, and now I have given this book to my daughter, and she carries it with her everywhere with her own copy of &quot;Always The Young Strangers&quot;. She said she never knew poetry could be so powerful, yet easy to understand. Until I gave her this book, she said she hated to read the poetry they assign in school because &quot;this is poetry. It has so much to say, and I know he wants me to understand his words, and he doesn't hide behind archaic language, literary symbols or obscure references that seem irrelevant.&quot; The Poetry of Carl Sanburg is timeless. I never understood why his place in American Literature was not much higher. To me he is the best American poet of the twentieth century, in a class by himself. After thirty years and hundreds of readings, I still find something new every time."},{"Title":"The People, Yes.","review":"Oh, my! To think I never read this before. I knew of it, of course, fromquotes and snippets (my mother took me to see &quot;The Family of Man&quot; at the Museum of ModernArt in New York in the fifties). Why doesn't Sandburg rank higher in our artistic pantheon? Too left wing? Not pretentious enough? More like Woody Guthrie than like T. S. Eliot? Anyway, this is wonderful stuff, reads aloud wonderfully, funny, wise, and you'd better believe it has a message for the nineties. &quot;Another baby in Cuyahuga County, Ohio--why did she ask: 'Papa, what is the moon supposed to advertise?'&quot; &quot;The public has a mind? Yes. And men can follow a method and a calculated procedure for drugging and debauching it? Yes. And the whirlwind comes later? Yes.&quot; A treasure. And fun to read."},{"Title":"The People, Yes.","review":"I was amazed to read Carl Sandburg's words and find that they apply to the word in 2012 as forcefully as they did in 1936. For example,in part 50 Sandburg talks about people who claim \\"I did that\\" without giving credit to others who were instrumental in their success. It was as if he was talking about the Republican convention. This work celebrates populism and should be read whenever you despair about \\"the people.\\" It's a wellspring of hope for mankind."},{"Title":"The People, Yes.","review":"Nothing much to say as you either like Carl Sandburg or you don't! I love his poems. If you are new to him I'd suggest if you like Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, etc you'll like Carl Sandburg as he's in the same genre."},{"Title":"The People, Yes.","review":"This is a facinating book that is very well written and interesting. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The People, Yes.","review":"Carl Sandburg the Master of words. This book of his magical positioning of words is hard to put down. He describes the time of the great depression so very poignantly. The struggles of the ordinary person. Their trials and tears. The need for survival with the very basics of life and sometimes even without the basics. He lived it, and he wrote about it. He was a genius at his craft.

This is especially true if one's geneology is Rabbinic in nature.This book deals with only certain families and is rather terse.BUT....for what it touches on, it opens to its readers a whole new world. Its subject is the Katzenellenbogen family - which had ties into almost every major European Rabbinic family.

Most customer service material is geared toward the private sector - retail, manufacturing, etc. Advice on such topics as winning customer loyalty, pricing, word-of-mouth advertising, etc. doesn't always apply to the world of the government agency, the university, or the Motor Vehicles Department. In many public sector jobs, telling people &quot;no&quot; and telling them what they &quot;must&quot; do is a regular part of the job - and this leads to a natural increase in hostility from patrons. I have researched countless customer service books, programs and resources to use here at our public institution. Not only is Robert Bacal's material one of the only sources geared specifically to the public sector, it is also one of the best sources on handling upset, angry, or hostile customers that I've ever seen - for any type of workplace! Beginning with a four-part model (or process) for defusing hostile customers, he then goes into countless specific tips and techniques that are as practical as they are effective. He goes so far beyond the trite techniques found in other customer service materials to cover topics such as: how to tell someone &quot;no&quot; in a way that doesn't elicit hostility handling non-verbal intimidation verbal self-defense a step-by-step process for &quot;solving&quot; customer problems dealing with threats and much more! Examples of dialogue and written exercises in each section help readers apply the material. We have tried these techniques here at work and the results have been outstanding. I highly recommend this book for anyone who encounters customers, clients, patients, students, or members of the public - whether you work in the public or the private sector. This is the best source on handling customers you can find!"},{"Title":"Defusing Hostile Customers Workbook (Public Sector)","review":"I just wanted to tell everyone that I am very satisfied with this book and the delivery of it was ahead of schedule. There is a ton of very informative and useful information in this book. A MUST READ! for anyone who is a government employee or call centre rep who deal with people on a daily basis. I am about to work for a call centre and I find this book easy to understand and easy to learn. I am one very satisfied customer indeed. thank you."},{"Title":"CMM in Practice: Processes for Executing Software Projects at Infosys","review":"Though I havn't read this book, but I have taken few courses under the author as an undergrad student at IIT Kanpur.

Here is a book that tells you all about the CMM model, based on the practices in an organization that is assessed at Level-4 in the model (the organization, Infosys, is assessed at Level-5 just when this book is released). The author gives a lucid, simple and down to earth account of the practices at Infosys and how they fit into the CMM model. The organization of the book in 3 parts in terms of Project Initiation, Project Planning and Project Execution is extremely logical and reflects the flow of a project in an organization. He has documented some of the standards for various processes as seen at Infosys. He has also discussed some of the challenges to be overcome on the road to software engineering process improvements/ implementation. The chapters on Process Tailoring, Process Capability baselines, and Peer Reviews are special and note-worthy. Many organizations will find the templates very useful. The Appendices are also informative and useful. The book is excellently produced and we have not come across a similar book on this topic in the market."},{"Title":"CMM in Practice: Processes for Executing Software Projects at Infosys","review":"There are many excellent resources that provide information on SW-CMM and how to implement it, but this book by Pankaj Jalote stands out distinctly as it offers a comprehensive account of software process practices at Infosys Technologies - arguably India's most admired software company, rated at SEI-CMM Level 5. Jalote has nicely packaged all the established software engineering practices used at Infosys and real examples that show its readers &quot;How to actually do it and be successful?&quot; This book provides helpful insights and experience-based guidance to those who want to successfully implement CMM.Take a look at the Table of Contents and you will easily notice the richness of coverage. The book is organized in three parts: Part I captures all the practices related to Project Initiation, Part II focuses on practices for Project Planning, and the Part III is about approaches and processes for Project Execution and Termination. Among the topics covered in the book are requirements specification and management, process definition and tailoring, process asset database and process capability determination, metrics and statistical process control, estimations, risk management, project monitoring and tracking, and defect prevention.Also, There are two useful Appendices in the book: one on transitioning from an ISO 9001-based practice to CMM-oriented practice and the other provides experience-based guidelines on managing a software process improvement project. A running real-life project case used throughout the book is a useful feature.However, the book's title could be misleading! The title gives an impression that book covers the implementation of the CMM in its entirety, whereas the book's scope is actually restricted up to Level 4. Also, I would have expected to see an explicit coverage of 'software product engineering' and 'intergroup coordination' KPAs in the book. Some coverage of how the process automation was dealt with as well as the benefits derived from it could have made the book even more attractive. As Infosys Technologies is engaged in servicing a large number of diverse set of clients around the globe, some discussion on dealing with and avoiding conflicts relating to different customer quality systems would have made the book more valuable.Overall, this is a good book and I would certainly recommend this book to any one who cares about better software engineering practices to improve performance - whether or not interested in implementing CMM per se. It must be kept in mind, though, that the practices and approaches described in the book are based on a particular company's business context and, therefore, how and to what extent they would directly apply to other organizations has to be judged by its readers."},{"Title":"CMM in Practice: Processes for Executing Software Projects at Infosys","review":"This is THE book for all the professinals belonging to Software Industry.The book gives Pragmatic understanding of SEI-CMM Model addressing all possible stages and activities of Software Project Life Cycle.Correct weightage has been given to Engineering as well as Managerial perspectives of software project execution details.All Key Process Areas (KPA's)have been explained by mapping them with day to day activities in live project scenarios. This not only authenticates the explaination but also introduces the reader with state-of-the-art Software Practices.The illustrations given by Prof. Jalote in this book give concrete proofs of seemingly abstract concepts introduced in KPA's of SW-CMM.Important fact revealed in this book in the most convincing way is that CMM is more of a common sense and not a just another stringent standard.Having read this book one acquires clear understanding of SW-CMM, Software Project Activities and their inter-relation.This book is very much free from any kind of theoritical bias.It is something like the book written by the hardcore software professinal for all software professinals.The book is equally helpful for Software Engineers, Project Managers, Business Development Executives, CMM Implementors and for CEO's as well."},{"Title":"CMM in Practice: Processes for Executing Software Projects at Infosys","review":"Excellent book! I work for an ISO 9001 certified software company since 1999, which is in the process of getting a CMM level 4. Although is a book about CMM, we would have saved one year in our journey to ISO if we would have had this book four years ago.Its approach is clear, pragmatic and logical. It covers most of the important issues in CMM, from planning to closure of software projects, giving examples of a real-life project where they are needed.If you are a beginner and want to embrace best practices and standards, I would recommend you to study this book first, and then The Capability Maturity Model. You will be surprised how clear it will appear to you. Same for ISO practitioners, especially ISO 9000/2000, which contains many more requirements on SPC compared to ISO 9000/94.If you have been working with CMM for a while, reading this book could give you a better understanding of it."},{"Title":"CMM in Practice: Processes for Executing Software Projects at Infosys","review":"This title seems to be on every CMM person's shelf, based on title alone. However, covering up to level 5 in one book means that it is not a practical reference for a journey to any particular level. It seems to gloss over just about every topic, and fails to provide the level of detail to really be a useful guide. I have stopped using it at all as a reference."},{"Title":"CMM in Practice: Processes for Executing Software Projects at Infosys","review":"Typically I seldom buy a SW Eng. book, since it's a Have-Your-Habds-Dirty engineering, there is not much formulars, recipes and tricks for you to learn.We started our SW outsourcing last year with an office set upin China. Though we gained lots of experiences through painfultrial process, I think we would have saved much more time andenergy on both business and technical sides in dealing with our clients, should we owned the book earlier (we did not buy that from Amazon unfortunately)Since the author was a one time insider of the well known, NASDAQ listed Indian SW outsourcing company, along with his rich academia experience, the book is full of a ciombnination of engineering praticalness and acdemia sophiscation, and is well orgnized and well written. It touches not only the state-of-the-art, like tracability, impact analysis, risk management, SW metrics and effort estimation, but also addreess pratical issues like contract/agrement drafting and negotiiation, which we found is very useful.One thing confuses me is that asides from most of start-of-the art techniques adopted by InfoSys, why they use a revised Waterfall process model instead of popular evolutionary process.Is that because they are in the SW outsoucing busienss?Another suggestion is that, the book may looks like betterif it can adopt a evolutionay/iterative/incremental way ontelling people the story and the theory/practice behind them.Some popular books on UML are using this Unfidied Processway, evn on writing books.

We are in the process of implenting process to meet up to the requirments of level 4.In my openion the &quot;Guidelines for improving the software process&quot; written by Carnegie Mellon university (SEI) is a good book to be referenced as a CMM standard and the &quot;CMM in practice&quot; is a good reference book to know how the KPA's can be interpreted and implemented in an organisation from a practical standpoint.Due to the almost inexistant (affordable) professional training available in the subject of CMM, books such as this goes a long way in filling that gap. However, i would say that this book throws light till level 4 only. If you are looking at guidance to implement level 5 KPA's this is not the book.The examples given are quite clear and helps understand the requirements of CMM better."},{"Title":"CMM in Practice: Processes for Executing Software Projects at Infosys","review":"Very good reading for anybody who is responsible for the software engineering and project deliverables.

Rolheiser has given us a wonderful gift in this compelling spiritual guide. I was especially inspired by his use of the stages of motherhood of the Virgin Mary and our own stages of faith. I loved his book &quot;The Holy Longing&quot; but I think I like this one even better. If you're on a spiritual journey, Catholic or otherwise, this is a real treasure."},{"Title":"Against an Infinite Horizon: The Finger of God in Our Everyday Lives","review":"Christian books often become cliche, filled with the same old rhetoric and dogma that leaves us cold and searching; however, \\"Against an Infinite Horizon\\" is very fresh in its approach to seeing God in every moment.I can't think of one aspect of living that Rolheiser omitted. He discusses social justice, marriage and sexuality (His assertion that sex is a sacrament still has me thinking!), death, the gender of God, and the simple act of being grateful.I didn't always agree with his premises, but Rolheiser gives so many unique perspectives from which to view the ordinary in our lives that you will simply devour this book. He challenges the reader to reconsider our lives and how we view ourselves \\"against the infinite horizon\\" of God. There were times when, with my mouth open, I had to stop mid-paragraph and think about what he had said. Nothing revolutionary, just a fresh approach.This is an excellent book for group discussions,or, like me, for personal growth. Read it and think!"},{"Title":"Against an Infinite Horizon: The Finger of God in Our Everyday Lives","review":"I am a fan of Rolheiser's books and his weekly column. He sees scripture as a whole work, woven together as only The Master would have it. Rolheiser is able to relate various scriptural passages in a way that makes sense and relates to our everday lives.The title, \\"Against an Infinite Horizon,\\" asks us to view our lives against the infinite horizon of God's love and power. Not only does that put our earthly troubles into perspective, but it also unleashes the great power of God's love to change the world. Regardless of whether you tend to liberal, conservative or middle-of-the road, this book will challenge you to live your faith more fully and meaningfully. In one section, he states that the problem with modern Christianity is that the \\"liberals are not pious and the pious are not liberal.\\" What if they were? he asks, stating that we are called by Jesus to be both pious and work for change, both in compliance with Divine will.The only down side to this book and more generally Rolheiser's work is that he tends to be repetative. Sometimes this is to the good; you don't miss anything. Other times it's laborious."},{"Title":"Against an Infinite Horizon: The Finger of God in Our Everyday Lives","review":"I found this book enormously rewarding. Fr. Rolheiser is one of the sharpest Catholic writers out there today. He really \\"gets it.\\" He is very gifted in articulating some very profound ideas in very real, human terms. Some of these ideas could be a bit shocking to someone used to more traditional Catholic books (esp. his thoughts on Eucharist). However, don't let that initial shock throw you. I truly believe he is not trying to be provocative for the sake of getting attention. Rather, the ideas he explores are truly a way to go deeper into some of the most profound Divine mysteries. And when we break through the superficial and enter honestly and deeply into those mysteries, the rewards are enormous.I am grateful to Fr Rolheiser for sharing his insightful writing talent. Too often Catholic writing are nice, but can be too intellectual/theoretical or historical. At some point we need to move beyond the dry/clinical talk and dive into the deep... the honest places that we are sometimes afraid and/or ashamed of... the real and gut-wrenching places were we risk exposing those hidden parts of ourselves to that Infinite Horizon. If we never get to what is truly real and honest, then what is the point? In this book, Rolheiser leads us into those real places... and the view is spectacular.I have read a few Rolheiser books. All have been good, but I thought the Shattered Lantern was a little dry. However, when he hits the mark, he is excellent. In addition to this book, I highly recommend Forgotten Among the Lilies. Another true gem."},{"Title":"Against an Infinite Horizon: The Finger of God in Our Everyday Lives","review":"This has been one of the most inspiring books I have ever read.

This really keeps your interest. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because of content. I don't believe everything in the book follows the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC). In one specific incidence, the writer states you are able to receive Holy Communion even if you have committed a mortal sin and haven't gone to confession. This is not permitted in the CCC. I think that any Catholic that reads this book should be firm in what they believe and don't take this book as a source of what is right and wrong.

That was the discussion of the Coup De Grace of a fellow soldier. During my research I found that virtually no one had ever written (either in books or screenplays) about this with the exception of Bierce. It is an interesting paradox to ask yourself whether you would have the capability to put a friend out of their misery rather than let them suffer if you knew that help was not available. In fact, Bierce's short story is entitled, &quot;The Coup De Grace&quot;. You'll find it and 27 others in this volume. The most famous is, &quot;An Occurrence At Owl Creek&quot;. A story that was made into a short film and was the Short Subject winner of the Cannes Film Festival in 1962, and earned an Academy Award in 1964 as best Foreign Film.All of the stories you find in this book are told with the tight, economical style of Bierce and many have an O'Henry or Sterling twist at the end. They are told in the frank and bloody prose that Bierce witnessed (and physically experienced) first hand as an Officer in the Union Army. As one reads these stories you can clearly see the basis for Bierce's caustic and acidulous writing style that stayed with him throughout his life including as a columnist for William Randolph Hearst at the San Francisco Examiner and until he walked away into the Mexican desert in 1913. His demise is the source of great conjecture (as he would have wanted it) but that is for other books about the man and his writing."},{"Title":"Ambrose Bierce's Civil War (A Gateway edition)","review":"Ambrose Bierce, a soldier in the Civil War, focused on the war in many of his short stories, which are truly phenominal.

Henry, Bierce deserves a place among our most treasured authors."},{"Title":"Ambrose Bierce's Civil War (A Gateway edition)","review":"Ambrose Bierce's Civil War has everything you could ask for from a non-fiction, storytelling book about the Civil War. It is filled will all sorts of war memoirs and stories from his experiences and experiences of others throughout the Civil War. There are gruesome explanations of brains oozing out of a head in the war memoir \\"What I Saw at Shiloh,\\" dead bodies covering the ground and endless thunderstorms. Alongside these dismal recounts of the Civil War, there are also stories of loyalty, family and courage. This contrast of the positives and negatives in the war makes this book very interesting. One page it will be raining and there are dead bodies on the ground. The next page is filled with sunlight and untouched and uninhabited forests. My favorite story would have to be \\"What I Saw at Shiloh,\\" but there are several that are very good. All of them are extremely descriptive, too. No details are left out. Anyone who stays tuned to all of Grandpas old war stories would definitely like this book. It is filled with enough non-fictional material to keep you on edge for quite some time."},{"Title":"Ambrose Bierce's Civil War (A Gateway edition)","review":"This book is divided into two sections. The first, \\"War Memoirs,\\" comprises about one quarter of the book; the second, \\"War Stories,\\" the remaining three fourths. I was really taken with Bierce's memoirs, so much so that I was sorry to see that section end so soon. I shouldn't have been, for, if anything, Bierce's war stories were even more interesting.Much to my surprise, Ambrose Bierce turned out to be not only a great author but also a great story teller, and, having fought through the Civil War (rising from the status of a 19 year old volunteer private with a three month enlistment to become a Captain in topography by war's end) he developed an innate understanding of what it is like to fight a fratricidal war from the very bottom up. His powers of observation and memory are unexcelled, most likely honed by his duties as a topographical engineer on the field of battle. These give life to his memoirs and when coupled with his vivid imagination and writing skills produce some truly remarkable tales.As I began reading those tales, it occurred to me that it was almost as if I was reading the scripts from Rod Serling's TV series \\"The Twilight Zone,\\" for every story was brilliantly conceived and ended with a twist -- some unusual and totally unexpected event. Then I ran into a story entitled \\"An Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge.\\" Gee whiz! I WAS reading stories very much like \\"The Twilight Zone.\\" In fact, that story was presented on \\"The Twilight Zone\\" and, to my mind, is the most memorable story that show ever produced. I couldn't help but wonder how many others of Bierce's stories Serling had adapted for his program, for those two men were obviously kindred spirits and had similar outlooks on life. (Serling got his while serving as a 5' 4\\" paratrooper fighting in the South Pacific during World War II.)I have read a lot of military biographies, and some stories, by and about numerous military figures -- Generals Sherman and Patton, Chesty Puller, Sergeant York, Audie Murphy, Manfred von Richthofen, Jimmy Doolittle, Pappy Boyington, etc. -- as well as the writings of Ernie Pyle and others, but I have never read anything like the writings of Ambrose Bierce. His memoirs and stories put you right in the middle of the action during the great battles and smaller skirmishes of the Civil War as seen and felt by the men actually doing the fighting. So, if you want to understand military terminology; learn something about military operations and history; experience the fog of war; and read some really great stories, you don't want to miss this one. But keep your dictionary handy."},{"Title":"Ambrose Bierce's Civil War (A Gateway edition)","review":"Ambrose Bierce's Civil War is a bit of a mixed bag; it contains a handful of non-fiction articles and a number of non-fiction \`War Stories.' All deal with topics common to war, some specific to the American Civil War - there are tales of courage, obedience, the foolishness of generals and the effect of civil war on families. And, as William McCann puts it in his introduction to this volume, \\"in these creations his lifelong obsession with death and the macabre calamity were fruitfully and not incongruously employed.\\"That \`obsession' becomes a little overbearing at times. In an otherwise pedestrian recollection in \\"What I Saw of Shiloh\\" the reader stumbles across this arresting image of a wounded Federal sergeant: \\"A bullet had clipped a groove in his skull above the temple; from this the brain protruded in bosses, dropping off in flakes and strings. I had not previously known one could get on, even in this unsatisfactory fashion, with so little brain. One of my men whom I knew for a womanish fellow, asked if he should put his bayonet through him. Inexpressibly shocked by the cold-blooded proposal, I told him I thought not; it was unusual, and too many were looking.\\" You either laugh, cringe, or close the book for good when you come across passages like this. In similarly expressive terms, in both fiction and non-fiction, Bierce describes the effects of wild swine on dead and wounded soldiers. If you're squeamish consider yourself warned.My objection to Bierce's \`obsession' is that it tends to unbalance his work. The images are so strong they tend to drown out the larger themes. In a month I will hard pressed to remember much of anything he had to say about Shiloh, but I'll long remember the Federal soldier with the drooling brain.Save for a sprinkling of startling images, the non-fiction pieces are undistinguished. You can go to a hundred other sources for more informative, and entertaining, reminiscences.The fiction is another matter. Bierce's justifiably famous \\"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\\" is included. In the compressed space of the short story, and some of these stories are very short indeed, Bierce treats difficult themes with surprising deftness and sensitivity. In \\"Parker Anderson, Philosopher\\" a Rebel spy is interrogated by a slower witted Federal general. The spy treats the threat of his imminent death, he is to be executed at dawn, in a cavalier manner. With great economy Bierce takes this tale of the meaning of courage and turns it upside down.My favorite piece in the book was \\"One Kind of Officer,\\" a tale which literally and figuratively treats the fog of war. A weaker entry is \\"One of the Missing,\\" a story of a sharpshooter in General Sherman's army who is pinned beneath a collapsed building with his loaded and cocked hair-trigger rifle pointed at his forehead. Bierce sometimes forces things and his work suffers for it. In another story it's more a disappointment than anything to discover that the cannoneer was bombarding his own home all the time, slaughtering his family because of orders from a twisted commander and a deeply ingrained sense of obedience. Too convenient, too contrived. It's an author going for the \\"Aha\\" moment, a cheap and manipulative trick that is beneath Bierce's talent.Civil War buffs should enjoy Ambrose Bierce's Civil War immensely. There are plenty of gems, and even the common stones have their moments."},{"Title":"Short But Funky","review":"short dog's in the house good rapping funky bassline classic jamers brown scratch from my thang it's all good."},{"Title":"Tales of New England","review":"The book contains:\\"Miss Tempy's Watchers\\"\\"The Dulham Ladies\\"\\"An Only Son\\"\\"Marsh Rosemary\\"\\"A White Heron\\"\\"Law Lane\\"\\"A Lost Lover\\"\\"The Courting of Sister Wisby\\"You can see the above stories online (free) by searching \\"Coe College + Jewett\\" on the internet.You can visit the house that Jewett lived in all her life, in South Berwick, Maine.

The cognitive dissonance inherent in the fact that those who call themselves Christians are not interested in reading a newly-discovered and unique gospel is enough to make one agree with Ron Miller that organized religion is more interested in controlling thoughts and political influence than in spirituality.Every Christian should be interested in the Gospel of Thomas. In this book, Ron Miller uses current scholarship, engaging prose, and an inimitably direct and open style of thinking to explain Jesus' message in the light of these newly discovered teachings. It turns out that Miller is an important contemporary thinker. What he finds will surprise you.There is one drawback to this book -- it does not contain all of the sayings in the Gospel of Thomas. For that, you must refer to The Gospel of Thomas Annotated & Explained, translated by Stevan L. Davies."},{"Title":"The Gospel of Thomas: A Guidebook for Spiritual Practice","review":"The Gospel of Thomas: A Guidebook for Spiritual Practice is an academic and spiritual commentary upon the Gospel of Thomas, a text discovered in Egypt in 1945 that brings new light to Jesus Christ's teachings, offering insights in following in His footsteps and in effect, becoming His \\"twin\\". Sections titled \\"Practice\\" drive one to reflect upon how to apply the wisdom and selflessness of Christ's teachings to daily life, while questions entitled \\"Reflections\\" urge the reader to consider such tasks as \\"How can I be a more prayerful person while still being true to my understanding of the spiritual universe?\\" A vessel for personal and spiritual self-growth as surely as it is an analytical dissection of religious text, The Gospel of Thomas is an excellent guide for anyone seeking to explore what this holy text has to say about belief, life, God's Kingdom and the way of Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"The Gospel of Thomas: A Guidebook for Spiritual Practice","review":"If you want to really know Christ as God has intended him to be known and as Jesus himself wanted his followers to know him then read this book.

This is a must read for ANYONE who calls themselves to be \\"Christian.\\""},{"Title":"The Gospel of Thomas: A Guidebook for Spiritual Practice","review":"This book was exactly what I was looking for. It took verses from the gospel of Thomas and discussed their meaning, put it in context, and gave you spiritual practice ideas to \\"live\\" the concepts. This is not the full gospel of Thomas, however for me it was more useful than merely reading a translation. This is more like a study guide to practice the book of Thomas than to study it. It is the best spiritual guide book I have read in years!"},{"Title":"The Gospel of Thomas: A Guidebook for Spiritual Practice","review":"Not much exists from the time of Jesus. The four Gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were written at least 30 years after Jesus died. The Gospel of Thomas was written much earlier and gives us great insights into the person and message of Jesus. Ron Miller does an excellent job of allowing us to see Jesus even more clearly."},{"Title":"The Gospel of Thomas: A Guidebook for Spiritual Practice","review":"This gave me a much better insite to the bible and what Jesus is trying to teach us.

I have never been able to embrace organized religion because of the guilt and shame, the rigidity of the rules, the waiting for joy in heaven. I want to be happy and experience love right here on Earth. This guidebook will help you find the joy and comfort you deserve as a child of God."},{"Title":"The Gospel of Thomas: A Guidebook for Spiritual Practice","review":"Ron Miller's book opened with a promising introduction but went downhill from there. The author was a self-professed Catholic during his formative years before graduating into becoming a full-fledged proponent of pluralism (\\"...if one religion is true, then all religions are probably true...\\"). The book reflected much of his conversion experience. However, for a book touted as \\"A guidebook for spiritual practice\\", I found the short 123-pager particularly dissatisfactory as it completely ignored the important comparison (parallels or otherwise) between the Gospel of Thomas and the four canonical gospels of Mark, Peter, Luke and John. Further, the author's attempt to correlate the Thomas Gospel with myriad religious sayings and idioms, from Buddhism to Hinduism to Chinese proverbs, merely skimmed the surface if not haphazardly done. (Little wonder, as the author claimed to have written the bulk of this spiritual guide within 48 hours). Of the books written on the Thomas Gospel, I highly recommend Professor Stevan Davies' book on the same subject (also by Skylight Publishers) as it is the only definitive work presenting the full translation as-is with side annotations, stopping short of jumping onto the bandwagon of deciphering Jesus' cryptic sayings in an overly simplistic manner."},{"Title":"Men at war, (A Berkley medallion book)","review":"'Men at War' is a compendium of war stories edited by Ernest Hemingway. Most of the stories are historical or first-person accounts of actual events. Hemingway has selected the tales for their literary quality, insight and experience of war. He starts with Caesar's invasion of Britain; William the Bastard's 1066 invasion of England; American Civil War accounts and much, much more. He's even included his fictional--but excellent--\\"fight on the hilltop' from \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\\" A must read for Heminway fanatics."},{"Title":"Broken Brains or Wounded Hearts: What Causes Mental Illness","review":"Noticing than when he paid attention to the emotional pain that existed alongside a client's behaviour, the client's symptoms of paranoia disappeared, psychologist Ty Colbert realised that her behaviour was not &quot;dysfunctional&quot; but functioning quite effectively to protect her inner woundedness.This contrasted strongly with proponents of the biopsychiatry who present models of supposed biological-defect or chemical-imbalance. They sound quite convincing until Dr Colbert looked deeper into the actual research and found the claims to be very weak indeed. Meanwhile, the list of so-called &quot;mental disorders&quot; keeps increasing as does the medication of them. In this model, pain is denied, symptoms surface, but are seen as the product of a defect and are suppressed medically.Over 15 years he developed the &quot;Emotional Pain Model&quot; detailed in Broken Brains or Wounded Hearts - What Causes Mental Illness (Kevco, 1999). It represents a desire to take the mystery out of mental illness and provide a clear path for the future, allowing the reader to develop a proper understanding of any and all emotionally troubling conditions.Dr Colbert proposes a three-phase model for eliminating emotional disorders and developing emotionally healthy children: People are taught to ientify feelings and resolve conflicts; Symptoms are seen as indicators of an overload of emotional pain; Non-medical, non-abusive healing environments are developed.This book is an important contribution, validating an approach to therapy that is truly and wholly healing. As he says, &quot;To see emotional disorders as diseases to be drugged is to hide from our own pain, as well as the pain of the afflicted .... The more we see and understand their pain, the more we will be able to see our own pain and become unafraid to reach out.&quot;"},{"Title":"Broken Brains or Wounded Hearts: What Causes Mental Illness","review":"This book is very easy to read. It boils things down, but it is not simplistic. It incisively refutes the theoretical underpinnings of biopsychiatry, including the flawed and mis-stated studies which purport to show that \\"mental illness\\" is inherited, the simplistic and virtually unsupported chemical imbalance theories of \\"mental illness,\\" and the myths and hype surrounding psychiatric drugs.Colbert's own view of the causes and cures of \\"mental illness\\" is just one way of stating a general truth, but it zeroes in on the reality of what \\"mental illness\\" and its \\"cures\\" are all about. As he states at pages 116 and 117:\\"1. We all hurt each other at times, both unintentionally and intentionally.2.We all need others to heal those hurts.3. We all deny to some extent how we hurt others, and how we need others to heal our hurts.People create exotic theories about the causes of strange behavior and emotional disorders, because it's too uncomfortaable to admit our basic human need for each other, and because we don't like to face the fact that we can hurt and be hurt by our fellow humans....Let's not hide any longer behind our fancy theories and our often abusive cures. Let's learn what it takes to attend to and heal wounded hearts.\\"This may sound like wishful thinking, but Colbert makes plain that the real wishful thinking is done by biopshciatry, an edifice of mutually supporting empirical and logical errors, held together mainly by its adherents' own determination to be convinced of thier own preconceptions.I have read twenty-five books on this subject, most more technical than this one. The beauty of this book is that it accurately conveys the essence of a technical subject without itself being technical."},{"Title":"Broken Brains or Wounded Hearts: What Causes Mental Illness","review":"This book opened a new life for us. A close relative has suffered two years with schizo affective illness (between schizophrenia and bipolar). He's tried medications that disabled his brain to such an extent he couldn't function creatively or even normally, hospitals that take all control from the ill individual, and psychiatrists who see you for 10 minutes and prescribe a new medication. He's now in a clinic that uses no medication, probing the emotional-spiritual crisis that brought on all these symptoms of mental illness. this book explains these two radically different ways of looking at mental illness and opens a path to real healing and a productive normal life. He's in charge of his life now because of Ty Colbert's insight into the &quot;wounded heart.&quot; His brain isn't broken at all; he's beginning to understand the crisis that drove him. A &quot;10&quot; rating isn't high enough."},{"Title":"Broken Brains or Wounded Hearts: What Causes Mental Illness","review":"I am Dr. Colbert's former patient.I am a paraplegic,with a condition called Spina bifida.I have had MAJOR depression since second grade(when other kids discovered I was different, and, started making fun of me because of it)!!!Until I met Dr. Colbert,(and, read his book) I thought it was because there was something wrong with me!!! At that age , your subconscious mind does most of the work(since the concious is still developing).The subconscious mind does not have the ability to reason. It is just a computer. whatever gets in to the subconscious you will act upon as it it is the truth!!!If you put garbage into a computer, you get garbage out!!!Dr. colbert taught me this! THE MAN IS A GENIUS!!! If it weren't for him, I doubt I would still be here!!!I most likely owe him my life!!!"},{"Title":"Broken Brains or Wounded Hearts: What Causes Mental Illness","review":"The gist of this book is a contrast between what the author terms 'the medical model' (which claims that mental illnesses are biologically caused) and the 'emotional pain model' (which states that the causes of mental illnesses are to be found in emotional trauma and pain).The first part of the book is a sound and detailed critique and repudiation of 'the medical model', while the rest of the book is devoted to an in-depth exposition of the 'emotional pain model'.To me, it is really no great mystery why the psychiatric profession and society at large have chosen to believe that all mental illnesses are organic illnesses (i..e biologically caused), for that gives the simple and comforting illusion that these otherwise so perplexing and uncontrollable diseases have been understood and can be managed.It's just another case of the apparently basic abhorrence of the human mind for uncertainty and lack of control.Nevertheless, despite the (for so many) great and obvious appeal of the biological model, I think it is high time that we as individuals and as a society move away from it towards a sounder understanding of the causes of mental illness.For the biological model IS an illusion, make no mistake about that! (as the author does an excellent job of demonstrating in the first part of the book).While I do not believe that the emotional pain model can fully account for all mental disorders, I definitely think it is a huge step in the right direction.As someone who has carried the label of 'chronic schizophrenic' for nearly ten years now, this book has been a real eye-opener for me, and has resulted in a much broader and more sensible understanding of the sources of my troubles than biopsychiatry can offer.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Broken Brains or Wounded Hearts: What Causes Mental Illness","review":"This book solves problems and explains why and how to fix wounded hearts. We all have them from time to time. Dr. Colbert also gives a history of mental disorders and how we evolved into our system today. He should be making history and be in the press. We need his understanding and problem solving solutions in our schools, universities and businesses. If you are tired of drugs or just want an easier life, READ THIS BOOK. I highly recomment it to parents, preachers, teachers and bosses. It could change the world!"},{"Title":"Broken Brains or Wounded Hearts: What Causes Mental Illness","review":"A must read for those who want a deeper understanding to the extent that some individuals have experienced regarding many types of abuses, I have two extra copies at home that I keep to give to those who I think may need a little help dealing with the difficult situations they experienced as a child."},{"Title":"Broken Brains or Wounded Hearts: What Causes Mental Illness","review":"Dr. Colbert's book demonstrates the flawed history of the current medical model for treating mental illness and shows how destructive it has always been to people treated with unproven medications that relieve some symptoms, but cause more severe ones over time and impair or irreversibly destroy a person's ability to fully recover from the real cause of their problems, because these are never addressed.He shows what real treatment consists of and how it can help people damaged by being treated by the current medical model and restore them to valuable members of our society, who because of their experience can help others who have faced the same problems and ineffective treatments.It is a \\"horror story\\" when it describes the failure and a story of hope when he describes people helped by his approach of healing the heart and not drugging the brain. Drugs are about patient management and not cure, they are for the convenience of the staff, the family, and the psychiatrist. The patient may experience some benefit from the lessening of their symptoms, but must pay a price because the real underlying problem is not dealt with and their ability to fully experience their emotions have been dulled.Dr. Colbert's approach is to provide a warm, accepting, and supportive environment so that trust can be established and there is no longer a need to escape from life through the learned defense mechanisms put in place to survive a painful childhood. He sites cases where he has helped patients recover from the drug therapy model and how others have not only been cured with the approach he suggests but how some have become therapist and bringing this help to many others and challenging the flawed system that ultimately fails everyone it treats, because it does not deal with underlying causes, but only drugs people into more socially acceptable, even if impaired behavior.It is an insightful book for anyone who has experience with the current psychiatric model, personally or via friends or family."},{"Title":"The battle of the narrow seas,: A history of the light Coastal forces in the channel and North sea, 1939-1945,","review":"This is a rare book about the British light coastal forces (similar to the US PT boats) fighting the German forces in the English Channel and North Sea during World War II.

Even though this book was published in 1996, I am still surprised that there are no reviews here regarding it's importance or any negative or positive criticism.This book is a must read for somebody in the education or social services field. Vulnerable children today have grown since the book first published in 1996. We now have plenty of information via the internet and studies have been done since then regarding this population. Regardless, this book is informative and educational about the plight of today's children in vulnerable situations.The author does provide plenty of examples about children who struggle and the circumstances regarding their situation. As somebody with an educational background, I can see those circumstances everyday in the classroom. The struggling students are often the most obvious as are the students who seek to blend and assimilate into the classroom situation. If we had smaller class sizes, we would be able to attempt more contact or had an extra teacher or aide or paraprofessional in the classroom to assist some students.Students who are classified as special needs often face ridicule and stigma from the label. They often suffer self-esteem but some of them work harder than the rest to prove them wrong. Then there are those who suffer in silence. This book helps detail students in situations such as a one parent home, welfare, poverty, divorce, and even substance abuse. The children who live in homes where their parents are unable to provide an adequate learning and living environment are vulnerable children themselves. Sometimes, they have to act as parents to their own.This book may be a little outdated and could use some revision to 2011. The author does a service and this book should be read by those in the educational and social services field as a requirement in understanding the problems that occur when vulnerable children in our society."},{"Title":"The Berbers: The Peoples of Africa","review":"Very good information in this book, with comprehensive detail for the earliest times of the Berbers down to contemporary issues.

For example rather than simply accept older writings that allege sweeping invasions by \\"bearded men\\" from outside into Africa, or from elsewhere in the Maghreb, the authors reference hard anthropological data of actual specimens on the ground and find, Quote:\\".. the skeletons seem to show closer resemblance to groups from the upper Nile Valley than to contemporary material from the Maghreb.\\"Blood type analyses show linkages between the Black Northern Haratin of Algeria and ancient Egyptians as detailed by the studies of Paoli 1972.All in all a good roundup of information on the Berbers ancient and contemporary."},{"Title":"The Berbers: The Peoples of Africa","review":"Doing a research paper on the Berbers in Libya, I ordered several source books.

Because it is designed for kids, some of the tricks are pretty simple, but there is still a lot of good material here. Also, because the author is a magician, some of the tricks are really more magic tricks than haunted house tricks, like card tricks, cutting a string or piece of paper and restoring it to one piece again, and the ball that apparently moves across a table by itself. Cute, but not scary. More useful tricks for a haunted house are the talking severed head trick, the headless person, the hand reaching out of a box to grab things, and tips for faking a seance. The tricks are described in two sections, one telling what the audience will see and the other discussing the preparation and method for pulling it off.

Subsequently, the series was reedited, shrunk to 8 5/8 x 9 1/2 inches, and published by Electa / Rizzoli in 1985-9 with a few color photos added including each front cover. In the early 2000's, the series was reissued by Phaidon unchanged except for the front cover photo. It is a pictorial \\"Ferrari\\" of history of architecture books. Almost every page contains one or - usually - more than one illustration as photo, plan, section, elevation, axonometric view, etc. of the highest quality.

The Australian economy of 1848 struggled with a chronic labor shortage. Newspaper editors, anxious to retain the Australian labor force, tried first to conceal news of the discovery and, after the word leaded out, to discourage emigration.Ultimately, the failed attempts to discourage emigration gave way to a rush to be the first to bring foods and migrants to the California markets. This book brings out some facts which would otherwise be easy to overlook. Australia was one of the closest sources to the gold fields for goods and immigrants. The trip from eastern Australia was shorter than the trip from the eastern United States or Europe. This gave Australian merchants an advantage in the race to satisfy the ravenous appetites of the gold fields.The race to California was one with a prize for the swift. The laws of supply and demand work ruthlessly in an economy in which the total available supply of a commodity may arrive on one ship. Prices drastically diminish as each new ship reaches the pier.The description of life from San Francisco to the gold fields introduces the reader to the dynamic economy of the era. Just as the gold fields drained labor from Australia, so too did it attract crews from ships, workers from San Francisco and Sutter's Fort as well as migrants from Latin America and elsewhere. Machinery and other goods were imported from anyplace, including Australia, that could satisfy the roaring appetites of the boom economy.Although the Gold Fields attracted workers from near and far, a degree of xenophobia did arise. Although directed primarily at Latin Americans, Australians felt that they too were trapped in its snare.An interesting side story was the escape from penal exile of several Irish revolutionaries who used the turmoil to find new homes. Among them was Thomas Francis Meagher, who would later command the Irish Brigade during the American Civil War and serve as territorial governor of Montana.The effects of the California Gold Rush on Australia were not limited to what it lured out of Australia. It also affected Australia itself. A number of Australian miners noticed a similarity between the California Gold Fields and certain land in Australia. This led to the Australian gold rush at Bathurst.The discovery of gold in Australia led to a return to Australians who had tasted republican ways in California as well as the immigration of Americans who brought with them their own ideas of liberty. The volatile mixture of returned Australians, Americans republicans and rebellious Irish led to a minor rebellion in 1854 which was suppressed by Redcoats in a fifteen minute skirmish.All in all this is an interesting book from both the Californian and Australian perspectives. I recommend it to any with an interest in the history of either."},{"Title":"Blizzard Pass","review":"A treasure that had caused so much bloodshed hadto be worth dying for - or did it?"},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"its a wonderful book and makes for lovely reading. heyer wit and style will keep you entertained from the first page to the last.a must buy for anyone who enjoys heyer style romance."},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"This is Georgette Heyer at her best. it made me laugh out loud and cry and even at the same time!

The plot is fast paced. As always the side characters, especially Deb's aunt and her notion of economizing is hilarious :)) The best part of the book is the witty and clever exchange between Deb & Max. Each thinks he or she is going to 'teach a lesson' to the other and the result is amusing & heartwarming. Unlike other Heyers the ending in this one builds up a good steam and the resolution is very satisfactory. I think I read the last few pages about 10 times!!

A very cute story, humorous and well-written."},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"(Taken from the review i've written on Shelfari)When wealthy Max Ravenscar accuses Deborah Grantham of trapping his younger cousin and trustee into marrying her, she is enraged and vows to avenge his insults. And so begins their schemes for trapping one another into ruin. If Deborah is as stubborn as Max, how long will it take their game of cat-and-mouse to come to a stop?While Georgette Heyer's books are always a pleasure to read, recently though, the heroine's I've been reading about were all calm and collected. Thankfully, Faro's daughter (Deborah) is quite the opposite, she's very passionate and has a quick temper, and nothing ruffles her more than Max's vulgar remarks about her. This really was an enjoyable read-witty and hilarious."},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"This is one that is probably going to have to come from a library. It was originally a Chivers production, then Chivers was bought by BBC and now does not show as available on the BBC America audiobook site.Honestly, if an audiobook has already been produced putting it out on CD or as an audible release seems like an excellent idea. I know lots of women who who enjoy listening to a Heyer novel over the lastest slasher fiction on their way to work. I found the miles passed very quickly while I listened to this 8+ hour reading of one of Heyer's more charming novels, originally published in 1941.Eve Matheson, the reader, has a pleasant voice with no annoying habits. My only objection is that she sounds a bit middle aged for the majority of the characters. Her interpretations of characters such of Lady Bellington, the heroine's flighty aunt, and Adrian's mother are both letter perfect though. And surprisingly she does well with the ex-pugilist doorman, Wantage, and the slimy Lord Omskirk.If you get a chance, definitely listen to this one."},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"This one of the best novels by this superb writer; the characters are both fascinating and delightfully amusing.

After all, she founded the genre."},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The only downside to it is the slightly odd note the heroine strikes-- she is honorable and intelligent, yet does something very silly!Overall, a fun romp with a heroine who has a sense of honor, and a hero who makes a great mistake in his evaluation of her. Interesting because the setting and situations are very different than other Heyer books. A satisfying ending."},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"Shakespeare is always in her work and this is no exception. Was extremely disapointed when it ended as would like to have kept reading.

None of this matters, however, in the game of love and matrimony in Regency London, because Ms. Grantham earns her living playing cards in one of London's finest gambling houses. And marriage with such a gaming-house wench is just not done, especially not in the echelons of the &quot;ton.&quot; Young Lord Maplethorpe is willing to flaunt society and risk its censure to marry the beautiful Deborah for love. His unhappy mother seeks help from her stepson, the handsomest, cleverest, richest man about town, Max Ravenscar. This unrelenting bachelor meets Deborah, his new foe, across the faro table where they play for power, although they wager for money.And proud Ms. Grantham gives Ravenscar a run for his money as she proves to be more stubborn and high principled than he in this delightful romantic farce. Georgette Heyer writes one of her best novels with &quot;Faro's Daughter.&quot; The witty dialogue, the power plays between the intelligent Deborah, who does not want to be beholden to anyone, let alone to the arrogant Lord who is so willing to believe the worst of her, and the creative subplots and adventures showcase her talent.This is a winner, and a must read for all Ms. Heyer's fans!JANA"},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"&quot;Women of your stamp should be whipped at the cart-tail!&quot; Thus says Max Ravenscar to the woman he believes to be a scheming strumpet out to snare his young, impressionable, titled and rich nephew. This is not, however, the way to impress Deborah Grantham, who is in fact an entirely honourable young lady despite her presence in her aunt's gaming-house.So Deborah decides to spite Ravenscar; first she rejects out of hand his offers to buy her off, then appears in public with his nephew, Adrian, dressed and behaving as precisely the vulgar harpy her believes her to be. This, of course, only serves to infuriate him even more, and he ups the stakes further.There are some hilarious scenes in this book - the one where Deborah has Ravenscar kidnapped and imprisoned in her cellar (and then... oh, but no spoilers! &lt;g&gt;) is worth the price of this book all on its own.For a sparkling and determined heroine, and a hero who, despite his stiff-necked pride, has a very well-developed sense of both honour and humour, you can't go far wrong with Heyer's Faro's Daughter."},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"This was my first Georgette Heyer book and I can't tell you how much I enjoyed it! The way Ms. Heyer weaves humor and historical detail into her books is amazing and beautiful. I am so sad that most of her books are out of print, but you can believe that I will be faithfully searching every nook and cranny I can find to get my hands on more!Lord Mablethorpe is a man in love. Well... not exactly. He has proclaimed undying love to Miss Deborah Grantham, but it is painfully obvious that it is just a case of puppy love. However, this is not the story that gets to Mablethorpe's mother's ears.Lady Mablethorpe hears that a wench from the gaming table has ensnared her helpless son into marriage. As Lord Mablethorpe is of respectable lineiage and will come into a handsom fortune, Lady Mablethorpe will not let this come to pass. She has nothing better to do then to call on her nephew, Mr. Max Ravenscar, the richest man in London. Lady Mablethorpe begs him to save her son from the claws of the harpy, and so Mr. Ravenscare accepts. He intends to buy Deborah off at whatever price it takes. When he confronts Deb with the subject of her &quot;ingagement&quot; to Lord Mablethorpe, she is extremely offended. She never had any intention of marrying Lord Mablethorpe (of course she doesn't tell Ravenscar this) and she is not really a woman of the gaming houses. Oh, it's true that she does enjoy a bit of cards and she does run the E.O. table at her aunt's house, but this is because she and her aunt are in dire straits and desperately need money. As a matter of pride, Deb will not take the money from Ravenscar and declares that she will marry Mablethorpe (of course it is a lie) and she will bring him to utter ruin.Coming home in a fit of rage, Deb makes a resolution to act as the harpy that Ravenscar seems to think she is. She tranforms herself into a gaudy, chintzy, totally tasteless female and shocks everyone. The two thouroughly dislike each other, but... love and hate go hand in hand...Oh dear!It is such a shame that all of Georgette Heyer's books are not all in print. I was lucky enough to find _Faro's Daughter_ at my library, I storngly urge you to look for it too. This is what regency and romance is all about, my friends. This is it! The humor, the slang (&quot;I don't give a button what you think!&quot;) the love, the language, all of it. Georgetts Heyer's style of writing should be the basis of every author's book. She does not treat her readers as children and spell everything out for them. Indeed, reading one of her books is an interactive experience. Her plots are unique, if not the origionals. Her characters come alive and basically speek to you. The emotions that I felt while reading _Faro's Daughter_ cannot actually be said out loud... all I can say is read it. You must, you simply must. Georgette Heyer books are must haves for any true romance fan."},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"&quot;Faro's daughter&quot; is the name given to the beauties who grace gaming houses in Regency London.

Max is mad and determined to rescue his nephew from Deborah's clutches, but soon discovers that he wants only to replace his nephew in her heart.&quot;Faro's Daughter&quot; is the quintessential Regency novel, one of Heyer's very best. The scene where (almost) all is revealed never fails to make me cry, and when, at last, all ends happily, I always give a satisfied sigh. Deb's aunt is a foolish delight, and for the mawkishly sentimental, there is a happy pair of young lovers as well. A true delight"},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"The dialoge is witty, the characters are beautifully drawn, and the plot keeps you revited to the book. Faro's Daughter is a contest of wits (and wills) between the lovely Deborah Grantham and the wealthy Max Ravenscar. The two turn out to be an excellent match. My only complaint is that the story ended so quickly. It is one of those books you want to go on and on."},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"ALL OF MS. HEYER'S wonderfully enthralling heroines, are -- though living in the midst of the male-dominated English Regency period -- closet feminists! Or, at least, are those with whom I am acquainted. I have yet, it seems, to read all of her numerous and wonderous books. But I have, however, read FARO'S DAUGHTER, and know, from it and the other of ther novels that I have read, that I have many new treats in store for me, from reading the rest of her work! : ) This closet feminism of her heroines is all the more amazing, since Ms. Heyer wrote her novels in the only-slightly less male-dominated eras of the 1930's through the 1980's. Yet, her heroines do manage, (in spades!), to retain a definite femininity, and, usually, a great deal of charm. The difference between these very feminine, \\"closet-feminists\\", and, say, the \\"sweet little dears\\" portayed within the novels of Horatio Alger, (heroines who, it appears, did little more than cheer on Mr. Alger's brave male protagonists), is that Ms. Heyer's heroines had minds of their own, (as well as hearts and tender feelings), and, in her novels, it is not only battles with circumstance, and between the genders which is seen....one also sees a battle going on betwixt the heroine's head and her heart. Often, the head prevails...but the heroine's actions -- usually intelligent, well-planned ones, but often leading to hilarious and sometimes unforeseen results -- are always planned, and done, (whether she knows it or not), at the behest of the heroine's heart.This is amply shown in the delightful \\"FARO'S DAUGHTER\\". The heroine, Deborah Gratham, lives with her aunt, a proprietress ofa gaming house. This makes the heroine to be -- despite her wealth, beauty, lineage, (and, yes, brains) -- looked down upon by polite London society of the day. A (very) young aristocratic gentleman, Lord Maplethorpe, frequents the gaming house...and soon decides that he is in love with her...moreover, he is certain that Deborah is in love with him. Enter, (at the behest of Lord Mapelethorp's anguished mother), the young gentleman's uncle, Max Ravenscar...who intends to break up this horrendous affair before it seriously begins. What he doesn't realize is that the affair never began at all: Deborah is NOT in love with the very young Lord Maplethorpe, and is, indeed, at that very moment in the depths of considering how to let the youngster know she is not in love with him, without hurting his youthful, kind feelings. But....Max Ravenscar's bold and arrogant manner, which considers her, conclusively but without evidence, nothing more than a \\"gaming-house title-hunter\\", infuriates the proud and independent-minded Ms. Gratham...who vows revenge on the haughty, jumping-to-erroneous-conclusions Ravenscar.Including a race, a kidnapping, a hilarious dress-up, (and character) deception, and much else besides, this is indeed a most delightful reading romp! Indeed, this novel could well be sub-titled \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", (were not that title already the name of a novel written in similar, elegant fashion)...for truth, true love -- and lost stereotypes -- finally do win out, over Deborah's understandable, but at times over-weening pride, and Max Ravenscar's infuriating prejudices. This is the story of two very head-strong, yet very human people, who find themselves at first at odds, then in battle, but finally in love...as they realize their simularities far outweigh, and finally dissapate, any differences they may have.This is an enjoyable, enthralling book from its beginning to its end. Beneath the petticoats and starched collars, real people emerge...as in all of Heyer's romances. Who says elegance must be dull, or that \\"X\\"-rating is needed for excitement? Not I...and I hazard to guess, not other readers either, once they have read this and other Heyer books. You might, indeed, find yourself writing elegantly, after the 18th centry manner, as I have here-in tried to do, after reading it, and other Heyer novels! Of course, realizing (sadly?), that I am,for better or worse, still a person living amidst the hurly-burly of the 21st century, I do find myself so deeply wishing that at least one of Georgette Heyer's elegant and yet truly realistic novels would, someday very soon, be made into a motion picture! And, although I love all of her books, my vote would go for the hilarious, deeply-moving, fast-paced, insightful FARO'S DAUGHTER to be filmed, first!P.S.: Georgette Heyer's books are NOT for women only! Intelligent, thoughtful gentlemen, who wish to obtain some inkling as to what goes on with-in the feminine mind and mind-set -- today as well as in the past -- would do well to read Ms. Heyer's intelligent, involving, character-as-well-as-plot-driven novels, too!"},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"Saying typical Georgette Heyer is an accolade that most authors will never receive.

However, Deb is enraged that someone will think her so low and vulgar, and she desides to teach Mr Ravenscar a lesson by pretending the very sort of creature he thinks she is.

She was prolific. And Ms. Heyer's historical research into the social aspects of the Regency era shine through all her books.In Pharo's Daughter, there is this scene. They are going to the Theatre in a box. Her ensemble. Her dress, her accessories, her whole manner are pointedly dreadful. When I read it, I cackled and a guffawed out loud for such an extended period of time that my sister finally just had me read her the scene aloud.This is a love story of opposites attracting in the milieu of Beatrice and Benedict.Georgette Heyers make for marvelous Summer Beach reading or something to nibble on in the Winter chill on the weekend. Pharo's Daughter is totally worth your reading."},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"Georgette Heyer's books stand the test of time.

She is always meticulous and accurate about the historical settings of all her novels. Her knowledge of gaming houses in this novel surprises me but it is in this setting that the novel manages to weave its spell between two characters who are down on their luck and have to run the gaming house to enjoy an overlavish lifestyle and the 'aristocracy' who frequent this establishment. they always say that hatred and love make strange bed fellows and you will find both in close proximity in this novel Well worth reading!"},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"I love reading Georgette Heyer novels. I really enjoy the plots and the descriptions. She has such a wide vocabulary I learn new words from her novels all the time. Great way to escape from today's fast paced world."},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"I think this is one of Heyer's best. The play on words and the actions of our characters are supreme. I love how Deborah keeps finding herself in one scrape after another while trying to get her Aunt out of debt. The sport between Deborah and Max is just the best. Deborah has Max kidnapped. Her henchmen are a little overzealous and she's worried for him. Now why if she's that upset at him for insulting her is she in such a stir about how they abducted him. Max is not to be outdone. While he's in the cellar a would be rescuer comes to his aid. He doesn't want rescued he wants to find a way out of the mess himself. I laughed myself silly. And when it's said by the young suitor Adrian that he is perceiving that Deborah being a few years older than him gives her an advantage it's so right on the mark. It is just what one would perceive - if said person has a brain. I laughed out loud so many times during this novel that I can do nothing but recommend it to others. A mishap at the end that goes terribly awry puts Deborah right where Max wants her to end the game."},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"I loved it! Both the hero and heroine engaged in all sorts of ridiculous escapades, Miss Grantham most of all.

I also enjoy how her characters develop over the course of the book--usually for the better."},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"Going through a Regency romance (actual literature from the period, not bodice rippers) kick and having very little to chose from there, I managed to stumble across Heyer. I am so glad I did! As much as I love Austen, the sensibility at the time was certainly different than the modern perspective, and even though I love it it can often seem stiff or slow at times. Heyer is the perfect match up of painstakingly research historical accuracy with all the lovely witty dialog of a period novel and a peppier writing style with spunky young women that are easier for a post-women's-lib reader to relate to. The characters (men and women) are strong (even when they're a bit pitiable), likeable, and interesting, make enough mistakes to be thoroughly human, and their actions are always clearly driven by their personalities and circumstances rather than a need to move the plot along. The plots often take on the feel of a fast-paced comedy of errors akin to a good Shakespearean comedy, with all the romance of the Regency period.Now for this book, this is one of my top 10 easily. The characters are a wonderful example of just how sexy a good argument can be. The plot gets particularly madcap, but never pushes it to far. I highly recommend it! If you find you like it I'd also recommendDevil's Cub,The Grand Sophy,Sylvester: or The Wicked Uncle, andBlack Sheep."},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"It was summer and I just wanted to find SOMETHING new that was just as fun and of the same time period as \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" After days of hunting I finally found Georgette Heyer and this wonderful book.The heroine is every bit as clever and yet foolish as one of Austen's and I found myself laughing out loud more than once.OK, Ms. Heyer's does not write as well as Jane Austen, but Faro's Daughter is just plain fun to read.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"All Georgette Heyer's books are well written even if I don't always like a particular character. I found Deborah's behavior frequently childish and foolish. Sometimes even rude overbearing men are more appealing than a silly female."},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"I discovered Georgette Heyer on an \\"If you like Jane Austen you'll like...\\" list. Faro's Daughter falls very short of Austen quality!The hero, Ravenscar, spends 99% of the book trying to prevent his cousin from marrying Deborah Grantham because she is considered an unsuitable bride for a member of the \\"ton\\". Although he finally discovers that she is not the \\"harpy\\" that he originally believed, the actual interaction between the two protagonists is so little that a love match at the end is wholly unbelievable. In addition, a great portion of the book is wasted due to repetition and unnecessary conversations between Deborah and supporting characters.One redeeming quality is that there are sections that are genuinely laugh-out-loud funny, however, not enough to make it much more than unsubstantial and dull."},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"I downloaded the sample to read before buying this book, and found two 'typos' in the first two pages. Why should Amazon recieve $7.99 for a book that they have zero investment in, and nobody to pay royalties to? To issue these shoddy digital editions is terribly disrespectful to the author's memory."},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"This was my introduction to Ms. Heyer's works and I absolutely loved it. It is completely diverting - which is what I was looking for. While the book is predictable in its outcome, the journey along the way is anything but. I have read 5 of her books so far and have found them all delightful. My 25 yr old daughter has been stealing them from me and sharing them with her friends. Crazy twists, hysterical turns, anda satisfying end seem to be a hallmark of Ms. Heyer's regency romances. She has a gift for the absurd and her stories are immensely entertaining. They are also innocent enough, that they can be passed along to teenage nieces and daughters. Definitely well worth the read."},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"I have very strong feelings about Georgette Heyer's books. The writing is always impeccable. I love her style, love her masterful use of the English language. Whenever I read her books, I'm so glad I can read them in the original English so nothing is lost in translation. However, the plot is where it becomes hit or miss for me. Some books focus entirely on the rescue of irritating waifs rather than the main couple, or the heroine is really, really immature. I was annoyed the entire time I read April Lady and I couldn't really love Sprig Muslin. Luckily, Faro's Daughter is my favorite sort of Heyer: a lovely, concentrated battle of wits between a man and a woman with sparkling results. This book is laugh-out-loud funny and the hero and heroine are both incredibly magnetic. The pages flew for me, and I was sorry to see it end so soon.Max Ravenscar, one of the richest men in London and a confirmed bachelor, is called upon to save his young cousin, Lord Mablethorpe, from the clutches of a wench from a gaming house. Lord Mablethorpe has proposed marriage to this hussy, and it's Ravenscar's job to buy off this woman and save his cousin from a disastrous marriage. Miss Deborah Grantham, said wench, is actually a well-bred young lady who, along with her aunt, has fallen on hard times and must maintain the gaming house for income. She has absolutely no intention of marrying her foolish admirer until his overbearing relative arrives and flings his offensive money in her face. Completely insulted by Ravenscar's preconceived ideas about her lifestyle and his nasty slurs on her honor, she throws all caution to the wind. Deborah declares that she will marry Lord Mablethorpe, and, playing the role of the scheming gold digger, tells Ravenscar that she plans to drain his cousin for every cent he has. Infuriated, Ravenscar is now convinced of her mercenary intentions and becomes determined to find out how much money she's really holding out for. Meanwhile, Deborah gleefully gets into her role and dresses a little tackier, acts a little wilder in public, parading herself in front of Ravenscar on the arm of the unsuspecting Mablethorpe. Thus begins an engrossing and completely amusing battle of wills between two hard-headed people, each trying to call the other's bluff while frantically ignoring the growing attraction between them.I wish I could say more about the plot, except it's such fun that I don't want to ruin it for anyone. Suffice it to say, only Georgette Heyer could write an abduction scene with such mastery and make it believable and hilarious at the same time, while poking fun at the absurdity of the whole situation.Writers should get a clue from Heyer when it comes to writing heroines. Deb is fiery and witty without being a harpy, and utterly charming and sweet without being a coquette. She has an unfortunate tendency to get herself into scrapes, often with the help of her two doting friends, and embroils herself into the most embarrassing situations. Yes, Deb Grantham is one beleaguered woman. Not only does she have to deal with a very silly aunt, but also an army of young people confused about love and desiring her guidance. She also is in charge of paying the bills for her aunt's gaming-house, which leads to no end of stress. Fortunately, Deb has a great sense of humor, tempered with an overly-developed sense of pride. This pride is what gets her into the most trouble. Still, she is always kind and loyal to her friends, and her good nature always wins out in the end. I absolutely loved her.Ravenscar is a true Heyer hero: wealthy, a little hardened by life, charismatic yet intensely arrogant. He is baffled by Deborah and the mass of contradictions she presents; he is certain that she's only after his cousin's title, but as he spends time spying on her, is forced to notice her true goodness and loving disposition. He has a great sense of humor lurking behind his stern exterior, and it is so enjoyable to watch him suppress his amusement in a potentially explosive situation. I think he is a little harsher than the average Heyer hero, especially in the way he bitterly vituperates Deborah after a misunderstanding - but I believe his disappointment is so very deep that he is entitled to those words. Of course, he more than makes up for his bad behavior at the end, and I closed the book with an irrepressible smile on my face. It's hard not to love a self-assured, rigidly aloof man who becomes a big hothead over the woman of his dreams.As many others have noted, there are only kisses in Georgette Heyer's books, but this lack of explicit scenes does not in any way detract from the wonderful chemistry between the two protagonists. I hate using the phrase \\"sizzling chemistry,\\" but it fittingly describes Deborah and Ravenscar. They sizzle when they're together, and it's impossible not to enjoy every second of it.If you've never read a Heyer, I urge you to go read this one now. Even the worst Heyer is so much better than many romances on the market these days, and this is one of her best. I have secondhand copies of her books, mostly scrounged from used book sales. Luckily for us, Sourcebooks Casablanca is reprinting many of Heyer's books with gorgeous covers. I'm planning to buy every single one, maybe even duplicates of my favorites. That's how good she is."},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"Having previously read at least 9 or 10 Georgette Heyer Regency books and loving them all, I was still not prepared for the laugh out loud surprises that Faro's Daughter brought forth. I litereally laughed til tears were running down my cheeks at the antics of the combating hero and heroine. These two strong personalities were combustible both verbally and physically and upon finishing it the first time, I immediately read it again. I would love this book to be made into a movie. I can picture one of my favorite British actors (RA) as Ravenscar. There is so much witty reparte, humor, drama and romance that I put Faro's Daughter on my wish list. I don't mind borrowing from the library, but I want to own my favorites so I can grab them anytime I want to be transported. Asking someone to pick their favorite Georgette Heyer is like asking them to pick their favorite child. This one is definately a keeper."},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"When Max Ravenscar's aunt informs him that her son Adrian is in danger of being ensnared by a wench from a gaming house into a most unsuitable marriage, he resolves to do whatever it takes to save his hapless relative from a disastrous alliance. Deborah Grantham, the \\"wench\\" in question and the chief attraction of her aunt's gaming establishment, has beauty and brains to spare, but little in the way of money or societal approbation. Despite her family's money troubles - which seem to accumulate with alarming frequency - Deb is no conniving shrew, out to entrap an impressionable young heir into a mercenary marriage. When Ravenscar high-handedly assumes that Deborah can be bribed, she's outraged. Determined to give the insufferably proud Max his comeuppance, Deb exerts herself to play the role of tacky fortune huntress to the hilt. As the stakes rise and their battle of wills escalates, Deb and Max stand to lose their only chance at happiness if they can't overcome their stubbornness and pride. Rife with comic misunderstandings and outrageous escapades, Faro's Daughter is the unlikely love story between a couple who could make the perfect match - if only they didn't hate each other so much.In Faro's Daughter, Georgette Heyer delivers one of the most obstinate, headstrong romantic leads I've ever encountered in the pages of one of her novels. Max Ravenscar (LOVE that name!) is the Heyer Regency hero taken to the extreme - self-assured and arrogant, he possesses an annoyingly unshakeable confidence in his own judgment. Deborah, on the other hand, is perhaps one of Heyer's most interesting heroines - far from being a proper Regency miss, Deb is witty, resourceful, intelligent, and best of all, a bit scandalous thanks to her position as mistress of her aunt's gaming establishment. I found Heyer's recreation of Regency-era gaming parties to be fascinating - it's an aspect of upper-class life from that time period that I've never really seen explored in fiction. The gambling plotline, combined with Max and Deb's fiery, and often borderline venomous exchanges, brought a darker, edgier tone this novel that I'm not used to seeing in Heyer's Regencies. Generally I love a romance featuring couples attracted to each other in spite of themselves - i.e., Darcy and Elizabeth in Pride and Prejudice, or Beatrice and Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing - but Heyer takes things a bit too far until the final third of Faro's Daughter with Max and Deb for me to rank their relationship with those like-minded classics.Heyer had a gift for populating her Regency romances with laugh-out-loud, entertaining supporting characters and creating the most outlandish situations for her leads to navigate, and Faro's Daughter is no exception. I absolutely loved Deborah's aunt, Lady Bellingham, and her delightfully ditzy way of navigating through life. Her complete incomprehension of why she is beset by overwhelming bills, and the way Deborah's feud with Ravenscar is always about to give her the vapors provide some of the funniest scenes in novel. Lady Bellingham is a classic Heyer creation - over-the-top, lovable ridiculousness, as is the scenario that sees Deb overseeing Ravenscar's kidnapping and lock-up in her cellar. Ravenscar's reaction that indignity was priceless! Humor-wise I feel like Faro's Daughter was a departure for Heyer. I crave her humor and razor-sharp wit, but too often the dialogue that fills these pages felt barbed instead of hilarious. However, the last third of the novel returns to vintage Heyer territory, packed with comic misunderstandings, lightning-fast dialogue, and the emotional heart that I'd been missing earlier in the story. I wouldn't recommend starting with Faro's Daughter if you're looking to explore Heyer's Regencies. While it's not my favorite, Heyer's superb research and sense of time and place shine, and the wildly entertaining wrap-up to Ravenscar and Deborah's feuding made the journey for this long-time Heyer fan worthwhile."},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"Just wanted to leave a rating more then a review.Deborah Grantham's aunt has established a gambling house.

I wish some wonderful people would turn it into a movie, for it would certainly make a great romantic regency comedy.I found myself laughing out loud, and squealing with delight while reading this book. Our heroine, Deb Grantham, is wonderfully spirited and determined. Deb's aunt, Lady Bellingham, was constantly reaching for her smelling salts, vinaigrette, hartshorn, and having a case of the vapours nearly every time she's around our spirited Deb. The writing is sooo funny! Our hero, Max Ravenscar, is devilishly cunning and relentless. All of the secondary characters were interesting and added to the fun. There are many terrible misunderstandings, prejudices, and comedies of error! There are some hysterical one-liners. The tension was constant through the entire story, thrilling me as to \\"oooo, what's gonna happen next!!??\\" Wait til you read about Deb's plot to kidnap Max. I tell you, it is TOO funny!!!I have read Heyer's \\"Sylvester\\" and \\"Devil's Cub\\". I enjoyed both immensely, but \\"Faro's Daughter\\" is the funniest of the three, and is funny without sacrificing any of the romantic tension. I'll be re-reading this one."},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"*****Light SPOILERS*****I would give this one 3 1/2 stars, given the choice. The set-up is perfect, but the execution a bit flawed. The hero is a standard-issue sardonic Heyer hero, the heroine interestingly placed in life, and interestingly up against it. Like some of Heyer's other earlier novels, the book succeeds least in its plotting. Everything depends on an intelligent character behaving foolishly, because of a fit of pique, and everyone around her indulging that behavior. It's just a little much, especially when Deborah becomes so intent on teaching Max a lesson that she has him kidnapped. It's worth it, though, for the reactions of minor characters (\\"What good comes from teaching people lessons!?\\" wails the requisite silly old dowager) and for some of Max's reactions, especially during the ludicrous kidnapping sequence, which is redeemed in part by Heyer's apparent awareness that it is ludicrous. Even less-than-stellar Heyer is better than the vast majority of other genre writers."},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"When young Lord Adrian Maplethorpe proclaims to his mother that he wishes to marry a young lady from a gaming house, she is both floored and horrified. It's obvious to her that the girl must only want him for his money and title. And so Lady Maplethorpe immediately sends for her nephew, Max Ravenscar, to talk some sense into Adrian. He too is surprised at the news and decides to take a look at this girl himself.Max marches himself on down to St. James Square to the home-turned-gaming house of Eliza Bellingham in the hopes of meeting Ms. Deborah Grantham, Ms. Bellingham's niece and object of Adrian's affection.However, the girl he encounters is not the girl he had imagined. Beautiful, funny, smart and not in the least the loose, vulgar thing he was expecting - she quite takes him by surprise. Their first meeting leaves him unsatisfied and eager to find out more about her. They meet up again and Max unveils his proposal to pay her off to stay away from his cousin and that is when things get good!Deb is utterly offended and beyond rage at Max's offer and vows revenge. In a nutshell she tells him to take his money and shove it! She'd even go as far as taking Adrian up on his offer (even though shew had no intention before), even if it meant his ruin, just to spite the \\"most hateful, odious man I have ever met in my life\\". Max is flabbergasted at her rejection! What is this woman up to? She must be holding out for more money, of that he is certain. Thus begins a tug-of-war of wills between Max and Deb.What follows is an endearing and humorous story of two people who drive each other absolutely crazy and end up falling in love.Faro's Daughter is the first novel I have read by Georgette Heyer, the Mother of Regency romance and I can tell you with a certainty that it will not be the last! I'm not usually a romancy kind of gal, but I have to admit that I really enjoyed this novel. It was a light, funny read with memorable characters and some kidnapping thrown in for good measure.I recommend this book to any reader, of any age that likes a nice, sweet story of the heart.Amy says: 5/5"},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"Oh my. Georgette Heyer is amazing. I've read a handful or so of Heyer's novels and I can say that each time I read one, it becomes my new favorite. Such is the case for Faro's Daughter, though I'm unsure if any of her other books can top it for me. Basically, it follows the \\"hate at first sight\\" rather than \\"love at first sight\\". Personally, I've always preferred the former, it gives any novel more spice and vigor. The plot flows effortlessly as Deborah Grantham and Max Ravenscar each take their turn to \\"out stake\\" the other. The two characters are both part of a personal game to win against each other... but inevitably, their passionate hatred starts to resemble something else entirely.This book is absolutely and utterly delightful. It's one of those books that make you literally chuckle out loud and read with an unconscious smile lurking on your face. It's romantic, yet fun and sassy - you cheer for both Max and Deborah as each one gains the upper hand through a variety of surprising stunts. It's the type of book that you wish you could go back in time for, just to experience reading it again for the first time."},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"Deborah Grantham is a heroine delightfully reminiscent of Jane Austen's Elizabeth Bennet. Orphaned and left in the care of her aunt since childhood, she works in the family gambling establishment. (By the way, faro of the title is a card game that was popular in England and France during the 18th century.) Despite her family's less-than-respectable business, Deb is beautiful, smart, independent, loyal and kind.Max Ravenscar is Deb's Mr. Darcy. Enormously wealthy, gruff, completely lacking in social graces, yet full of integrity, and perhaps even a little kindness beneath that prickly exterior. The dialogue between Deb and Max felt very authentic to the time period in which the book was set, and at the same time was absolutely delicious, fast-paced and clever.I loved the fact that this novel reminded me so much of Pride and Prejudice. Besides time and place similarities, the writing style and dialogue between characters are pleasantly Austen-esque. There were enough differences, however, to make Faro's Daughter fresh and surprising.Sourcebooks Casablanca has recently re-released a number of Heyer's Regency romances. (Regency romance is a sub-genre of romance set in England between the years 1795-1837.) Though it took a few chapters to get into the groove of this book's style, it was well worth it and I look forward to reading more from this prolific and talented writer.More book reviews at [...]"},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"This is one of the best romantic comedies I've ever read, second only to 'Venetia' and 'Arabella' (both also by Heyer). The clash of wills between the proud, haughty Max Ravenscar and the indomitable Deborah Grantham are sure to delight and entertain even the most jaded reader. There are plenty of varied characters, a story that never slows down, an almost palpable chemistry between the main couple and lots of very funny moments. My only complaint about this book was that it was a bit short for my tastes, but then again, I much rather prefer a book like this than one that goes on and on and doesn't know when to stop. If you're tired by the campy trash that gets published today labelled as 'romantic fiction', or if you're simply enjoy a good book, you can't go wrong with 'Faro's Daughter'. Satisfaction guaranteed!"},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"Heyer's story of London in the very early 19th century is rather different this time: Deborah Grantham is the sort-of manager of the gambling house run -- very haphazardly -- by her widowed aunt, Lady Bellingham. The aunt's genteel card parties had been very successful and she thought to make enough operating a full-time establishment to get out of debt, but through a combination of bad luck and poorly managed expenses, they're on the verge of financial ruin. Meanwhile, Deborah finds that she has quite unintentionally swept the young Lord Mablethorpe (several years younger than her, in fact) off his feet and he has declared his undying devotion and made her an offer of marriage when he reaches his majority. She's being tolerant of him but his cousin and financial trustee, the formidable Mr. Ravenscar, a wealthy gambler and sportsman, decides on very little evidence that Deborah must be a fortune-hunter and sets out to protect the boy. He raises his eyebrows at her and insults her in a very ungentlemanly way and in her justified anger she determines to get her revenge -- even though she has no intention whatever of actually marrying Mablethorpe.And that's where Heyer rather loses control. The subsequent plotline is far less realistic than in most of the author's work. (\\"Realistic\\" being a relative term for a Regency romance.) But assault and kidnapping? Sexual blackmail? C'mon. And while period slang and cant is usually one of the pleasures (for some of us) of reading Heyer's books, she tends to overdo it this time. How many \\"yard of tin\\" and \\"planting a facer\\" and \\"beyond anything great\\" can one take in 275 pages? She also gives Deb's old friend, Lucius Kennet a ridiculously overdone bog-trotter manner of expression which often doesn't even scan properly, and which implies that her familiarity with old-style Irish speaking rhythms is clownishly superficial.Heyer's characters, even though they're often Romantic archetypes, almost clich&eacute;s, are generally pretty convincing -- but not this time. Ravenscar, the male protagonist, is an arrogant, self-centered, spoiled bully who becomes enraged if anyone thwarts his least whim. A very unpleasant person whom Deborah could well do without. But Deb herself is also rather self-centered and whim-ridden, as well as petulant, with a tendency to act without thinking and without considering consequences, and with a desire to have things both ways. Neither of them is particularly sympathetic. And yet we're supposed to believe she's secretly in love with Ravenscar? In fact, almost the only characters here one might reasonably care about are Lord Mablethorpe, who is merely nave and inexperienced, and the somewhat feather-brained but irrepressible Arabella, both of whom at least shows some spunk when pressed."},{"Title":"Faro's daughter","review":"I won't talk about the plot because other reviewers already did, I want to point out that I just love the interactions between the protagonists, if you like your heroine very smart and at the same time very endearing, none of that dumb stubbornness sometimes we found in other authors but a pretty female character, independent (like all other Heyer females!) and very interesting overall.

Familiarity breeds... if not contempt, then the ability to ignore things. These objects have become such common fixtures in our lives that we hardly even notice them (that is, until they break or stop working!!). However, as common as they may be, there was a time not so terribly long ago when they didn't even exist at all. \\"Toilets, Toasters &amp; Telephones\\" outlines the history and invention of some of these very common objects that we use ever day.Beginning with a chapter on bathrooms and the invention of toilets, sinks and bathtubs, Ms. Rubin takes us through the who, when and where of these object's creation. Yes, Virginia, there really was a John Crapper who developed a flushing toilet in 1872. He went on to invent the tank for holding the water and was even promoted to being the royal plumber. At one point he \\"installed more than thirty toilets in Sandringham Castle for Queen Victoria's son Edward, Prince of Wales. A Book about Crapper was called *Flushed with Pride*\\".Throughout the book Ms. Rubin discusses basic design and manufacture principals and history. The toaster, for example, arose out of a need to make toast without a burning fire, and the first ones made by General Electric in 1909 were made of a wire-heating element on a porcelain base (the toaster needed to be unplugged or else the toast would burn). At one point, toaster manufactures (and presumably other manufacturers of household objects) designed their product with \\"planned obsolescence\\" in mind. This meant that they would revamp the design each year so that consumers would buy the newest, newfangled toaster and toss out the old one, even if it was working fine. This would in turn make more money for the company. I'm sure this is a practice still in operation today--\\"hey! This thing broke!! I guess I'd better go buy a NEW one!!\\"Intended for younger audiences between 9-12, this is a combination history and social studies book. A number of objects in the pages still exist, but not at all like their first generation prototypes: phones and refrigerators have changed a LOT since their invention, and the chapter on typewriters may very well be the first exposure computer savvy children have to these machines (\\"where's the hard drive?\\" one of my students once asked me).The text is well written and flows very logically from beginning to end. There are some dryly funny moments, like the above-mentioned book, \\"Flushed with Pride\\" or early reports of people using the first shower. Generally, though, this is a scholarly work for young children that not only tells about the history of these great inventions, but also encourages children to look at the common with new eyes.The book is generously illustrated with photos of objects from the past, some of which are hardly recognizable next to their modern counterparts: a clothes iron that required charcoal and a hand bellows, for example. Some of the captions for the illustrations are a little thin on text, making the reader wish there was more explained just how this thing was supposed to work. However, outside of museums of technology, children are not likely to encounter these ancient objects, so it's worth pouring over the photographs of common objects long gone. For teachers, parents or students who wish to go above and beyond and read MORE about these objects and their inventors, there is an extensive bibliography at the back of the book.Ms. Rubin has clearly done her homework and provided students and adults alike with a book that is both informative and entertaining. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Toilets, Toasters & Telephones: The How and Why of Everyday Objects","review":"I know the author quite well, and let me say that this is by far the best book she has ever produced.

You will NOT be able to put it down. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"In Careful Thought","review":"This is a tale of self analysis, cleverly crafted to reflect the full range of one's unique characteristics. Fully self indulgent, this whimsically philosophical journey leads the reader down the rabbit hole of self absorption and into the wonderland of introspective pre-cognitive awareness. A blend of wit, charm and the ultimate chase to find the touchstone of our mortality and its meaning, the reader is none the less drawn into the dawning of the author's own awareness.In this treatise, the author presents a meeting of the mind with her psyche taking center stage. It is replete with many of the character manifestations of the Id participating in the final shaping of a more learned, if not wiser, whole persona. Thoughtfully presented, it is reminiscent of Rollo May's &quot;Man's Search for Himself&quot; albeit in a softer more digestible and entertaining style."},{"Title":"In Careful Thought","review":"This book took me by surprise on the first page, I didn't think I would like it but then I wasn't able to put it down.

The way that Gorman uses her \\"characters\\" to give insight on how to get to know yourself shows that she has actually got to know herself also. Giving examples of her real life experiences really helps the audience to relate to her personal experiences. Her style of writing gives her book a sort of adventurous feel to the story. I think this book would be a good book to recommend to someone looking to discover his or her inner self."},{"Title":"In Careful Thought","review":"Rita Gorman wrote this interesting book.

Adams Advertiser Features EditorThis slim collection reads like a pau hana talk-story hour with the guys gathered around the back of the pick up truck, slurping Buds and munching poke. Or what you'd hear around a campfire on a North Shore beach after a long day of surfing. Ted Gugelyk is one of a vanishing breed of Mainland surf bums who moved here in the '50's and '60's, took what ever job they could get in order to stay, and watched the Hawaii they loved go away.This particular surfer, now retired from the University of Hawaii where he taught sociology, has an eye for detail, an ear for the telling quote and a sensitive heart. In &quot;Mango Lady,&quot; for example, his juxtaposition of an aging Hawaiian woman with his immigrant Ukrainian grandmother is insightful and right on. Both, he writes, sufffered from &quot;the drawn-out fatigue that comes from bridging the old country to the new.&quot; This labor of love ranges from Waikiki to Russia to Vietnam and back, tracking gugelyk's life experiences. But like the best storytellers, he knows how to extract a little more than mere narrative from these tales - lessons learned, perspective gained. I can't help feeling, though, that what Gugelyk has here is a start: &quot;Mango Lady,&quot; especially, begs to be reworked into fiction: it's a powerful subject, but a journalistic treatment necessarily dulls the effect. Worth a look, anyway."},{"Title":"Electronic Plastic","review":"What's so striking about this book is its wonderful graphic design.

Hundreds of eletronic pre- video-game-era games photographed sometimes with its original boxes, fully illustrated, colored and detailed. But what is it about?

Cd: Going To The Mat Against Political Pawns And Media Jackals","review":"If you've read Tom Clancy's Executive Orders and the recent Bear and the Dragon, you know that Clancy's main protagonist, Jack Ryan, is the President of the United States. And because he is not a political operator, other politicians, the media and even other governments try to tear him down. Reading Jesse Ventura's book, I was struck by an eerie sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. The stories he tells of the political sniping he has had to endure from the established body politic and the media are remarkably similar to what Clancy described of Ryan's experiences.This book should be issued to all American civics classes in our schools. And the most important part, the part to be marked with the yellow highlighter, is the part that says that we, the voting public, must take back control of our government from the career politicians and spit-licking sycophants that surround them.What hurts the most for me is the (justified) media-bashing that Ventura does. As a member of the media, I have seen first hand the petty bias that my profession is capable of. That's why I won't run for office myself, because I know what my &quot;colleagues&quot; are capable of. I'd apologize for their behavior, but I'm not high enough on the totem pole to make it stick. Hopefully, I can reach that high someday, because I believe the power of the press can be used judiciously and properly.After reading this book, I remembered a line from the late Robert A. Heinlein's book, Time Enough For Love. To paraphrase; &quot;If you are part of a society that votes, do so. If you don't know who or what to vote for, then at least know what you want to vote against.&quot;If there was a space on the ballot to do so, I would write Jesse's name in for President. There isn't one, mostly because the career politicians don't want it there. Keep talking like this, Jesse, and we might just draft you for the job."},{"Title":"Do I Stand Alone? Cd: Going To The Mat Against Political Pawns And Media Jackals","review":"Do I Stand Alone? is a gem. Truly, it is a much-needed slap in the face of irresponsible, sensationalist members of the media and corrupt, out-of-touch career politicians, phrased in Gov. Ventura's signature candid manner, and it is clearly a &quot;wake-up call&quot; to the voting public. What truly makes this book shine, however, is Gov. Ventura's underlying message that we need to think critically about current events, public figures, the media, and our own beliefs. More than once, Gov.Ventura urges his audience to examine and evaluate evidence and claims, consider sources of information and their assumptions and biases, scrutinize one's own viewpoints carefully, and form reasonable, logical, independent judgments. This is precisely what educational researchers, philosophers, and teachers have been urging for years! And as someone who researches and teaches critical thinking, and a supporter of the Governor's, I hope strongly that this easy-to-read, absorbing, and lively book will make the importance of critical thinking evident to a very broad audience. Bravo, Gov. Ventura!"},{"Title":"Do I Stand Alone? Cd: Going To The Mat Against Political Pawns And Media Jackals","review":"Governor Jesse Ventura's first book &quot;Ain't Got Time to Bleed&quot; told of his adventurous past and the circumstances that led him into politics. His new book &quot;Do I Stand Alone&quot; takes a hard look at the connection between politics and media along with many other societal issues. In a sense it could be described as a road-map for continuing democracy in the 21st Century.Ventura's common sense style is well-suited to not only pinpoint the essential problems in our society, but also to offer manageable solutions. He provides an intricate appraisal of the Amendments to the US Constitution. It is a section that should be required reading for new age students who no longer study the roots of government in the United States.It is not without a few flashpoints, probably the only ones that will be quoted on TV news shows. The Governor of MN takes some jabs at the two party system and returns a few salvos to the media -especially the local flatfoots who have done their finest to search for some disparity in his message. But this book is mostly a comparison between today's perceptions and the original intents of our country's founders.All in all, it is less about individuals and more about the philosophy of governing. Combine that with Ventura's vision for a better America and this book should strike fear into the heart of the two party system, the corporate power-brokers, and the degenerative media. Jesse &quot;The Mind&quot; Ventura is here to stay."},{"Title":"Do I Stand Alone?

Jesse Ventura mirrors all of my own thoughts and feelings."},{"Title":"Do I Stand Alone?

Mr. Ventura explains everything simply and what is amazing is that he helped me understand the political terms that I haven't been understanding for years. He is truly a man for the people and I really envy the people of Minnesota that they are presided over by a patriot in the truest sense of the word. I think our Founding Fathers would be proud of him. He is worthy of our respect and much more."},{"Title":"Do I Stand Alone? Cd: Going To The Mat Against Political Pawns And Media Jackals","review":"I must admit, being the avid reader that I am I did NOT read this book but instead listened to the three-hour audio book as I drove home from a vacation with my wife. I have a lot of collegiate training in the fields of philosophy. Ventura, who is quite impressive with his practical knowledge, is really just applying the laws of logic to political beliefs in his book. In the last quarter of his book (Side 2 of tape 2), he simply goes through the irrelevance of giving &quot;ad hominem&quot; ('to the man') attacks, &quot;ad populum&quot; (to the population) attacks, red herring (irrelevant) arguments and common fallacies of logic used by many in debates. He makes many points, giving examples of each kind of logical fallacy, and when he is finished all I could do was agree with him. I must say, with 7 years of university training in theology/philosophy Ventura is right up there with any famous philosopher. I especially enjoyed his insights on how the news media notoriously twists things around by making invalid points to &quot;prove&quot; something that is really just wrong. I would recommend this to anybody, especially those who are pursing philosophical training."},{"Title":"Do I Stand Alone? Cd: Going To The Mat Against Political Pawns And Media Jackals","review":"Governor Ventura's new book ranks up there with the works of Mr. Larry Elder and O'Reilly as a wake up call to a new generation of voters. In &quot;Do I Stand Alone ?&quot; Jesse &quot;the Mind&quot; Ventura states his position on a number of issues. His positions are all well thought out and based on fact. He also lectures on voter responsibilities and flaws of of current bi-partisan system with the gridlock and extremist positions that it produces. Governor Ventura also discusses one of my favorite issues, campaign finance. Overall I found this book to be a well written entertaining read that informs on both the Governors stand on issues and areas that he feels should be reformed in the government (both from the inside and the outside &lt;voters&gt;)."},{"Title":"Do I Stand Alone? Cd: Going To The Mat Against Political Pawns And Media Jackals","review":"I read Jessie Ventura's autobiography, I AINT GOT TIME TO BLEED, as I was preparing to teach a class on state government. I found absolutely nothing worth sharing with my students. Despite Ventura's potentially interesting personal story, I found the book to be a fluff and puff. So I was reluctant when I picked up the audio book version of Ventura's next book, DO I STAND ALONE.This book has considerable upsides. To begin with, it is more focused than the autobiography. That one briefly touched on different periods in Ventura's life, this one focuses on politics. Better still, Ventura doesn't gloss over state politics, or the fact that he is the governor of a particular state (Minnesota). The particulars are interesting, and his increased fluency in the ways of state government gives Ventura more credibility as a commentator.Ventura writes in two modes - he writes to YOU about YOU, and he writes to \\"the people\\" about \\"them.\\" He is stronger and this book is more useful when Ventura sticks to the former mode.Ventura's philosophy of government is libertarian. He believes that many public problems can't be solved by government, but can only be truly addressed by the public. His conception of what \\"the public\\" is seems clear when he's in his \\"YOU\\" mode. \\"YOU\\" have to do this or that in order for US to overcome this problem. For instance, Ventura writes forthrightly about parenthood - laying the responsibility on the listener for choices he or she may make in this regard. \\"If you want something cuddly to keep you company, buy a hamster, don't have a child.\\" This was Ventura's funniest line, and it embodies his \\"take responsibility\\" message.This is rare for a politician - most seek to promise solutions to problems. Ventura outlines whole areas of public debate as being within the public's ability to solve, and not within government's. He's using his bully pulpit to challenge his listeners. He even raises a few tough issues, such as the important but often boring topic of unicameral legislatures. This is responsible.But Jesse has two faces. He frequently stops challenging and starts blaming. In this mode, he writes about a faceless, seemingly monolithic \\"people\\" as in \\"We the people.\\" As fare as I can tell, anyone who disagrees with Ventura is not part of \\"the people,\\" but rather some sort of special interest. On the one hand, Ventura rails against the apathetic, but then he also rails against every manner of active citizens - the politically active, the partisan, the members of groups organized around shared interests. In this mode, Ventura spouts off unoriginal \\"new\\" ideas, often mistaking common sense with blind simplicity, and passes off old saws about politicians versus people. The nearly monolithic media is against the people, too. (Ventura's exceptions to the monolith include such paragons of journalistic virtue as Chris Matthews and Geraldo Rivera - I'm not joking).Also weakening the book is Ventura's writing style. He often writes in generalities, which seem all the less interesting compared to his occasional specific examples. He names names early on when discussing certain state legislators and how they embody what he sees as the faults of the system - this is interesting. Yet he doesn't criticize one reporter by name in his entire chapter on the media (which he almost writes of as if the word were singular). Finally, Ventura's woe-is-me routine (hinted at by the book's title) gets very boring, very quickly.DO I STAND ALONE works well as a book on tape. I suspect that the audio version is edited, but it flowed smoothly, and frankly I wouldn't have been interested in reading much more. Venutra's interesting voice also ads to the experience."},{"Title":"Do I Stand Alone? Cd: Going To The Mat Against Political Pawns And Media Jackals","review":"Minnesota Governor Janos' (Jesse Ventura's) first book &quot;I Ain'tGot Time To Bleed&quot; was both a fascinating autobiography and athoughtful political statement. In his second book, Governor Janosdescribes his experiences as Governor. He also discusses problemsfacing Minnesota and the United States, and his decision to leave theNational Reform Party.Governor Janos' won his Governorship as theReform Party candidate, the highest electoral victory won by thatpolitical party. Governor Janos' victory resembled that of formerPresident Jimmy Carter, an outsider who won upon a platform ofreforming the Federal bureaucracy. President Carter had limitedsuccess reforming the Federal bureaucracy, and he had difficulty withan unfamiliar national news media.Governor Janos describes how heattracted the best people from the Democratic, Republican, and Reformparties to work in his Administration. His strong tripartisanAdministration has permitted Governor Ventura to reduce state debt by&quot;cutting the pork&quot; from Minnesota spending. This spendingreduction makes him unpopular with some Minnesota legislators andtheir allies in the news media.In nearly half of this book theGovernor assumes a new role: educator. Governor Janos feels that theissues affecting Minnesota and the United States are not discussedopenly and fairly. He discusses these issues plainly and he stateshis opinions clearly. This is a *very* strong position.I do notagree with all of Governor Janos' positions. On page 163, GovernorJanos proposes having armed personnel working undercover in schools toprevent events such as the shootings in Columbine Colorado. Idisagree with Governor Janos because I believe that an armed person'sfirst responsibility is to control his firearm. Armed personnelwearing ankle holsters will get jostled daily, and gossipy studentswill observe that these individuals are armed. *If* armed individualsare required in schools, I believe that high visibility, uniformedpolice officers should bear this responsibility. I also believe thatthese officers should be rotated periodically back to regular duty,both to keep them fresh and also to continue their professionaladvancement.On page 157 Governor Janos states &quot;Drug addictionis a consenual crime, it's a 'crime against oneself.&quot;, and onpage 158 Governor Janos proposes decriminalizing drug abuse. I do*not* believe that drug abuse is merely a &quot;crime againstoneself&quot;. Some recreational drugs (e.g., &quot;speed&quot;)cause violent or paranoid behaviour. Also, drug abuse financiallyvictimizes society by wasting money that could be used to feed,clothe, house, and educate. I believe that the penalties for drug use*should* be re-examined, but I also believe that the Government shouldcontinue vigorously prosecuting large volume drugsuppliers.Governor Janos is an interesting man. He writes clearlyand candidly, he discusses a wide range of important topics, and hemakes you think. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Do I Stand Alone? Cd: Going To The Mat Against Political Pawns And Media Jackals","review":"Two things upon which Mr. Ventura elaborates are common knowledge: 1) Government is completely out of touch with \\"we, the people.\\" and 2) The media distort, rather than simply report, the news; like the government itself, the media has become totally self-serving. However, Ventura's numerous examples from his own experiences reveal THE GIGANTIC EXTENT of the corruptedness, which is so shocking it's unbelieveable. A good example is how the media can completely slander someone's reputation using a complete fabrication, no sources even needed. However, this is permissible under the guise of \\"protecting the sources.\\"This book has fired me up so much for the hope that a socio-political revolution might take place within the generation.Very few issues he discusses I disagree with. I especially support his anti-prohibition views (regarding prostitution, marijuana, etc.) and I get the impression most Americans, certainly of the young, open-minded generation, would agree. I admire him one thousand percent for being one of the few politicians who is vocal in his decree that the War on Drugs has failed, and particularly, in his call for marijuana legalization. He declares, I believe quite rightly, that less prohibition actually LOWERS crime, and he offers sound testimony for this opinion with his own personal account of his visit to Amsterdam's Red Light District, which he says has no more crime than the average white, middle-class suburban neighborhood. I've heard the same thing from other people who've been to Amsterdam (and purchased pot from the \\"Cannabis Coffee Shops\\").Most important is his cry for the American public to break out of its current indifference. He reminds us that political corruption only flourishes when we lose touch with our system, thereby submitting our will to our officials' own ends.I don't know how many others feel as passionately about this as I do, but I sincerely believe every American should read this book."},{"Title":"Do I Stand Alone? Cd: Going To The Mat Against Political Pawns And Media Jackals","review":"Listening to Jesse on the audiobook has to be a totally different experience from reading it. He whines a little, explains a little, illustrates his points a little and generally makes a decent case for a third way of politics. His call for involvement, in any party, for any candidate, in any election is a challenging statement. His points here seem to resonate the clearest of all. If you're not involved to the best of your ability and time and effort for what you truly believe then we are doomed to a government of the PAC, for the PAC and by the PAC."},{"Title":"Do I Stand Alone?

Honestly, Mr. Ventura's positions are very close to my own and I'm sure I would have voted for him if I'd been in Minnesota.So if it's not his points that cost him the stars, what did? His attitude. Since his last year and a half in office became a minor disaster, it's only confirmed the hints in this book. Ventura is very much into himself and (like so many other's in our government halls), suprisingly unconcerned with the people. I say this because through anecdote after anecdote, a book on policy (and I believe Ventura COULD have written one if he'd lost the ego) became about what he's done and why he's done it.Still if you are a libertarian (l or L), there are some great things in here. Of course, they are better said elsewhere (all except for Ventura's deft criticism of republicrat government.) ..."},{"Title":"Do I Stand Alone?

Many of his criticisms were shallow and not fully informed - I much preferred the book, The Gibraltar Conspiracy, (available on Amazon.com) written by an aide of his, Jack Uldrich.The Governor, if he wants to pursue higher office, would be better off if he concentrated his time on articulating a positive vision for the country rather than telling us the problems with the media and the two-party system."},{"Title":"Do I Stand Alone?

The book is the opinions of a person who is very blunt and to the point and his views are hardly mainstream.Before you wan't him for President you need to take a closer exam at Minnesota during his 4 years (thank heavens it will only be 1 term)and read the articles that will show that some of the &quot;Politicians&quot; that he had beefs with were angry at the fact that Jesse didn't exactly listen to them or he was off on a book promotion tour at the time they needed him the most.

No one was happier than me when Jesse was elected Governor and no one applauded him more when he sneered at his detractors in such an amusing manner. Lately, though, Jesse's WWF act is wearing thin. He plays the beleaguered good guy to everyone else's bad guy so often that I find myself yawning and flipping the channel when he comes on TV.Let's not forget that this is the same Jesse Ventura who is pals with Donald Trump. The same Jesse who refereed a WWF match for pay while in office. Who has spewed his ignorant racial comments about the Irish and Native Americans.

Cd: Going To The Mat Against Political Pawns And Media Jackals","review":"Having grown up in Minnesota, I recently returned for the first time in many years, to visit my sister in Minneapolis. I've been curious about Minnesota's choice for governor in the last election there, and so during my stay i tried to ask a number of good Minnesotans about the matter; how would they explain the choice of this stage wrestler? How would they rate him as a public servant? Not one of the people I talked to, not a single one, would admit to having voted for Jesse Ventura during the last election. For me, at least, trying to find an admitted Ventura voter in Minneapolis was, possibly, a bit like trying to find a living soul during the Great Depression who admitted to having voted for Herbert Hoover for president. Almost every person I met tried to explain the last election result by claiming Ventura was the unfortunate casualty of allowing 18-yr-olds to vote. It seems that their governor has caused some slight bit of embarrassment. I guess the collective idea about the last election was that the 18-yr-olds and the gov. are at basically the same maturity level. I didn't believe this explanation for a minute, however. I just can't buy it. After all, most 18-yr.-olds are more mature than the old Body.I've now changed my opinion of Minnesotans, somewhat.

I feel that the various criticisms layed down about this book are completely preposterous. As for Roger Dawson's idiotic claim that Mr. Ventura is a bigot, the governor clearly states that he was taken out of context during the playboy interview, and that he is a Christian. This book is a dead on criticism of the two party system and how they stay entrenched in power, and he gives clear cut solutions on how to put the power back in the hands of the people.

Cd: Going To The Mat Against Political Pawns And Media Jackals","review":"Jesse Ventura's second book is a great follow up to his first. He discusses many &quot;scandals&quot; and muckraking that journalists try to pen him with while dispelling them with his &quot;take.&quot; Unfortunately, too many folks believe everything the media spews and rarely give the time or attention to those they blast.Ventura's book is defensive in nature, as it should be. It is also inspirational. He challenges all of us to stand up to the status quo and do something about the helplessness many of us feel.Ventura is truly the &quot;thinker&quot; and everything about his ideology should scare the far left and right. He argues based upon merit of the subject, not what he believes he is supposed to think. He is brutally honest and that is refreshing. What I like most is that when I read it, I felt like he was talking directly to me with his own voice.My main objection to give a full-five star status is that a few points get dredged up a few too many times in my honest opinion. However, that is just a difference in how I believe a book is most effective. It is not a book that is as fun as his first, &quot;I Ain't Got Time To Bleed&quot; as it doesn't explore his past. But it shouldn't either, since it has already been done.It's a shame that he'll not run again, but if you read the book, you'll understand his beliefs. I don't necessrily go along with all of them, but it amazes me how close we are politically and ideologically!"},{"Title":"Do I Stand Alone? Cd: Going To The Mat Against Political Pawns And Media Jackals","review":"..however, if you are apathetic towards government, if you think there is something wrong with today's political environment, or if you are curious as to what it is like being in a position like governor, READ THIS BOOK.Like I said, Governor Ventura is not known for his literary style. However, I could imagine the entire text of this book coming from his mouth.He has a lot of good points, and this is where this book really has its merit. I applaud his audaciousness and hope that he's NOT going to be the one standing alone in the political morass of today. Democracy depends on people participating in it. Read this book and take a stand! It's a challenge to every American."},{"Title":"Do I Stand Alone? Cd: Going To The Mat Against Political Pawns And Media Jackals","review":"Can an explosive bombastic professional wrestler navigate the undercurrents of the political arena of action? Yes indeed! says author Jesse Ventura not to be confused with that other Ventura- you know-- &quot;Ace Ventura- Pet Detective&quot; aka Jim Carrey. The book is an intensive look into the brave new world of Governor elect Jesse Ventura. He shares his experiences, opinions and positions on complex issues in a straight forward manner; no nonsense, no games. Readers will agree or not, with his candid perspectives on the intrusive media and &quot;spineless&quot; politicians. He makes no bones about the need for all of us to be more alert, knowledgeable and involved in the political process. He has the astuteness of an Adlai Stevenson with a lot more charisma. He doesn't mince words. He is the chief administrator, at least until the next election. For now, he seems to have made the transition from entertainer to politician just fine; and after reading the book, it's fairly clear that he does not stand alone."},{"Title":"Do I Stand Alone? Cd: Going To The Mat Against Political Pawns And Media Jackals","review":"This second book by the Governor of Minnesota gives his viewpoints on current events.He wants a unicameral legislature for his state. Will a single chamber automatically reduce voter apathy and the influence of special interests? Instead of limiting terms, limit the meeting time of the legislature so they'll only concentrate on important items. They should spend most of their time with the citizens, not the lobbyists. Alexis DeTocqueville's &quot;Democracy in America&quot; explained why there are two chambers. A yearly elected Assembly to respond to the people's wants; a triannually elected Senate to provide a more farsighted view as to the people's needs. The Senate would also impeach judges, state officials, and the governor as needed. The one state with a unicameral legislature may also have an egalitarian and homogenous population with similar interests.The cure for too-powerful representatives is simple: select committees and chairman by lot. Once these elections can't be fixed the power of the special interests will be greatly reduced.The correct campaign reform law is to ban all broadcast political advertising; they are either lies or half-truths. Printed literature will last long enough to check the promises against the achievements. Candidates will not have to sell their souls to the devils of special interests. The next step should be to ban any contributions from corporate entities; they are not real people. This will return campaigns to a very level playing field.In &quot;Tort Reform: Civilizing Our Civil Courts&quot; he asks why so many lawyers are politicians. That was answered by DeTocqueville in Volume I. That's like asking why so many people in rural areas go hunting.In &quot;Tax Reform&quot; he complains about the income tax, and high property taxes. (Isn't an income tax just a type of property tax?) To lower property taxes you must either give localities and counties part of the state sales tax, or part of the income tax. You can't do anything else!There are many other topics covered in this book. Most are common-sense proposals that are unusual to hear from a politician; but J.V. is not an ordinary politician. You should read the chapter on &quot;Education&quot;."},{"Title":"Do I Stand Alone? Cd: Going To The Mat Against Political Pawns And Media Jackals","review":"Gov. Ventura is a man who speaks for the people and to the people, not to the &quot;political machines&quot;. Reading his latest book, &quot;Do I Stand Alone&quot; has been enlightening and also inspirational. He states the facts about his inside knowledge of politics as it is today and gives suggestions and opinions of what can and should be done. I agree with another reader who said that this book should be standard material for classrooms. The younger generation has the opportunity and power to help make the changes needed if only they understood the process better. Gov. Ventura states his message in clear, every day language that most people can relate to. Thank you Gov. Ventura for another well written book."},{"Title":"Do I Stand Alone? Cd: Going To The Mat Against Political Pawns And Media Jackals","review":"Political movements usually come from unusual places. I think it would be fair to say that we have not seen everything that Gov. Jesse Ventura has to offer to the shakeup of the established political machines of the Democrats and the Republicans.I have NOT yet read &quot;I Ain't Got Time to Bleed&quot; but I plan to go back to read it after I finished this book I received as a gift. I am not sure what he covers in the previous edition to the &quot;Complete Guide to 'Body' Politics&quot; as I will call it, that he did not cover in the 2nd volume. But I can guess. In this edition Ventura points out more of what his experiences as the chief executive of the state of Minnesota. There are several examples of political tugs-of-war he has with the Twin Cities media, the legislature, and other political organizations in that state. Many of these are boring simply becuase I am not from Minnesota--can I relate?. Any of these examples can give you an idea of the local issues in your own state I am sure. He makes a great case for the goal of a unicameral legislature, instead of the clunky, inefficient bicameral that most states have. As well as for the the streamlining of gov't so that it better serves that people by staying out of the way--and leaving many social programs to private organizations better equipped to handle those problems.Most of this book reads like a series of pro-wrestling promos. IN case you are unfamiliar with wrestling, a &quot;promo&quot; are those angry, blood-pumping, violent taunts and speeches that most pro-wrestlers give with some schmuck of a &quot;reporter&quot; holding a mic to their face and the wrestler pointing to the camera looking menacing (&quot;Hulk Hogan!? You Prima-Donna! ON Saturday Night's Event, I am going to tear you UP! I am going to chew you up and spit your pulp on the mat!&quot;). Most effective promos are only a minute or two long. Most of the book is sectioned off into subjects--but the segments are so short that I was left for wanted Mr. Vetura to elaborate more on his opinion or his plans for improvement.Jesse Ventura was the original &quot;Straight Talk Express&quot; before last year's John McCain named his bus. A book like this does get to the point and doesn't try to confuse the reader with stats and figures. It's safe to say that part of this is what makes his persona so popular in the political field. He's Ross Perot, except not quite so flakey. His critics that try and dismiss him as a &quot;muscle-head&quot; or someone that is an &quot;embarassment&quot; to public office are missing the point to everyday voter. In Ventura's opinion, lawyers are an embarassment to public office. People are drawn to Ventura simply becuase people know he will work for everyone--not just those that voted for him, and not becuase some focus group or poll told him he should. He does what he feels and thinks is the right thing. If it turns out wrong, he is smart enough to try again. Simple as that.Fifty years ago the same critics would dismiss a president by the name of Truman for many of the same criticisms as they give Ventura. I don't know if Ventura will ever run for president, but his influence may inspire the everyday man or woman to get involved in politics and overcome the established corporate, popularity-contest we have today. Where the winner is the one who can raise the most funds--legally or illegally. Is that the way to run a country? Some day a real Party revolution will occur (not like in 1994) and Ventura's influence will be all over it."},{"Title":"Do I Stand Alone? Cd: Going To The Mat Against Political Pawns And Media Jackals","review":"Having vivid memories of Jesse \\"the Body\\" Ventura ,professional wrestler, I expected a brash, highly opinionated book. I was surprised by the sensible,well-thought-out political positions and ideas in this book.I believe that he was 100% accurate in his 2000 assessment of George W. Bush as well as his statement that elected officials all too often serve the party instead of the people.The advantage for incumbents and the never ending campaign cycle for reelection are also valid observations.Jesse Ventura did provide some interesting ideas-unicameral state legislature,national sales tax(looks a lot like the Fair Tax of this current Presidential election season), 4 year term for Senators and Congressmen, tort reform, trade with Cuba, repealing the 16th Amendment.I don't agree with all of Ventura's positions, but he has a thoughtful, no-nonsense attitude about tackling the political problems that have only gotten worse since the printing of this book! A lot of his ideas are bold and worth a long look."},{"Title":"Do I Stand Alone? Cd: Going To The Mat Against Political Pawns And Media Jackals","review":"Although I currently live in Pennsylvania, I am a proud Minnesotan. Governor Ventura is my governor. However, as a student of political philosophy, it did not even begin to occur to me that Jesse the Body might be Jesse the Brain as well. After ready his book, Do I Stand Alone?, I am not positive what to think.I enjoyed Do I Stand Alone?. Political science it is not. But, this book does provide an insiders perspective on the workings of Minnesota's and the nation's political machinery. Governor Ventura does an admirable job detailing the media-money monster's hold on America's government, and he makes predictions about where we as a country are headed if things don't change.Governor Ventura is not an elitist, and his writing is aimed at about a high school level. The text is divided into short sections each headed by a catchy platitude. I found this style and other details of the writing to be ironic, given the author's negativity toward sound bytes and over-simplification.Jesse Ventura is certainly one of the most interesting politicians in office today, and his ideas are worth the quick read that they are. While buying his book does contribute to his personal wealth, it does not constitute a vote!"},{"Title":"Do I Stand Alone?

Cd: Going To The Mat Against Political Pawns And Media Jackals","review":"Jessie Ventura's follow up book to Aint Got Time To Bleed makes some good points about standing up for yourself especially with today's manipulative media. Many journalists do just want to sell a good story. Jessie's points about the Religious Right and Left, relations with China, BiPartism, and Racism are well taken.However, where Jessie has good intentions, there are some obvious political ploys that he is playing. How many other govenors travel to Japan on business? Isn't this more of a federal matter? Some of his commentary on Wrestling TV seems to contradict his views on the Washington Redskins Football team. I remember when he used to refer to Tito Santana as chico or boy and described him as having a Hot Latin Temper. I can overlook such comments as the WWF is not meant to be taken seriously. However, others might think otherwise. Also, Jessie seems to have too many side jobs most recently his involvement with the XFL. Although I admit to enjoying his commentating and style, Mr. Ventura does seem to have hidden ulterior motives. A final point, this sequel repeats to much information that was said in I Don't Have Time To Bleed.This sequel of Jessie's is a worthy read but understand the motive behind it and do not think of Jessie as a total saint. A 3 1/2 star rating seems fair."},{"Title":"Do I Stand Alone? Cd: Going To The Mat Against Political Pawns And Media Jackals","review":"A New Marcus Aurelius Has Arisen In America,Now Can He Last! This book written by the author reveals the leadership traits needed to take on political opponents, sagacious pundits and the media elite paid to make and break anyone choosing to rule in public service. I found the book engaging and worth reading.While I read it, I was reminded of the last days of the Roman Empire. When Gladiators such as Marcus Aurelius rose from the common class to become the philosopher-emperor. Emperor Aurelius had his writings too, called &quot;Meditations.&quot; In those writings, he followed his belief that the rising Christian movement was a threat to the state, welfare became a by-product of slavery and the Empire was ignoring threats from abroad.Aurelius assumed the mantle of roman leadership as permitted by the Praetorian Guard who chose and approved who would become Emperor. They recognized far too late, that the time had come for a leader with great personal courage and selfless devotion to Rome. Still and all, Aurelius could not cope with the many serious faults that eventually undermined the Empire.In today's America, Jesse Ventura, lesser known as James Janos, has ascended with minority approval, to one of our fifty seats of states known as Governor. All political theorist are trying to figure out how this has happened and Jesse tells them in this book, but few are listening.As I understand from the book, Governor Ventura is a direct product of the momentary cracks now besetting America's two party system and untrusting media.The two political parties are too entrenched by pollsters, advisors and political consultants instead of just governing by leading. The author points out that they are more concerned with sound bite, spreading confusion and avoiding the truth.Thus, the two parties have put forth transitory leaders who lack real vision and leadership on every level. These faithless pretenders prefer to stay in office instead of accomplishing authentic public service for the people that need it. What is worse is they pass intrusive policies and laws that burden each citizen's preferences for freedom. Temporary Media generated agendas without common sense are more dangerous than an occasional helpful hand, they end up enslaving us all for the failures of the few!As beheld in his book, popularity by polling is a poor replacement for any Republic to follow. Jesse is just the start of these new &quot;Gladiator Candidates.&quot; These new leaders must avoid the trappings of roaming for power. When they govern they must produce, manipulate and change knowing the diversity is far greater than just getting elected. Enriching the people is a formidable task of any government who thinks it can do it, this is why people must try and enrich themselves!Nonetheless, any person who qualified to be a Navy Seal is an individual trained to accomplish any mission, task or goal. Governor Ventura has performed in all his endeavors in public service and private fulfillment to date.What I came away with in this book is that Jesse Ventura will have an impact on some future election, you can count on it!"},{"Title":"Do I Stand Alone?

What I found was that Jesse Ventura presented logical arguments in a clear and concise fashion. His viewpoints were well thought out and explained well. I even found myself agreeing with some of these points. Some I thought were out in left field, but even when I disagreed with him, he still put together sound thoughts. The book was also entertaining.

Savage takes this a bit far as he has Eleanor exploring sexuality with everyone possible. He takes to heart all the rumors that were ever circulated about her: he has her in bed with Louis, her uncle Raymond, Saladin (even though he was only 11 when they met), a Greek pirate, the troubadour Bernard of Ventadour (of course, although for awhile I thought he was going to leave him out), and of course both Henry II and his father, Count Geoffrey. When he got to the point where he also had her experimenting with her maids, the bath maidens in Constantanople, and even with the Empress Matilda, it was too much for me.Let's see, what is good about the book? Well, Eleanor doesn't go to bed with Bernard of Clairvaux, Abbe Sugar, or the monk Galeran.I'm asking myself why I'm trying to find the 2nd volume of this one. It certainly is questionable whether or not it is worth the time to see who else she goes to bed with. I suppose it will be interesting to see if Savage has her taking the nuns at Frontevrault to bed after she turns 80."},{"Title":"Eleanor of Aquitaine -Op/026","review":"Despite a cover that has all the appearances of a serious historical novel, well all I can say is don't judge a book by it's cover. This is the first of two books Savage has written on the life of Eleanor of Aquitaine, and is written in the first person as an older Eleanor reflects back on her life. Just a brief run down for those not familiar with her life - heiress to the Duchy of Aquitaine, she is married to the very pious King Louis of France (he was the second son and was intended for the church until the elder brother died), they go on a disastrous crusade and after bearing only two daughters Louis has the marriage annulled and she goes on to marry the future Henry II of England, where this book ends.Although according to the book jacket this is part of a \\"colourful romantic series\\", I've got to tell you - enter at your own risk. Eleanor does it with just about everybody except for Abbe Suger, the eunuch and a monk or two, starting from the age of twelve (!!) when her governess leads her into the arts of pleasure as well as an escapade with a young page that leaves a telling stain on her skirt that raises eyebrows in the laundry (think Monica Lewinski). Oh but we're not done yet, there's the female bath attendants at Constantinople, her uncle Raymond (ya'll remember Deep Throat?), a twelve year old Saladin (woof woof), Geoffrey of Anjou (oh my) and more. Although the hands down laugh out loud moments were at the end where she takes up with Henry's mother Matilda. Priceless.Outside of the OTT sex scenes the rest of the novel is rather dry and suffers badly from the use of the first person narrative. Eleanor comes across as quite vain and full of herself and an entirely unsympathetic character. Read this one for the laughs and not for the history.

Page 31 we find the \\"dungeon\\" in which involuntary memory casts and hides all real events that occurred to a person and that remain secret, unconscious till one day voluntary memory and habit, the two tyrants that impose onto anyone's life a day-to-day normalized behaviour and an official socially acceptable fake history of oneself, are suspended for a short moment by some exceptional event that could be anything finding an echo in one of these deep involuntary memory records, or a bout of fever or unconsciousness that could bring the unconscious back up. This dungeon is translated by \\"donjon\\" which is a castle tower in the Middle Ages. A typical and primitive mistake that yet does not prevent the translator to make the \\"diver\\" (p. 32) be \\"un plongeur\\" diving down into the involuntary memory that resides in this castle tower. The proper translation should have been \\"oubliette\\" or \\"chamber de torture.\\" Just before the translator had meddled with a common phrase in English and completely messed up the meaning. Beckett writes: \\"Curiosity is the safeguard, not the death, of the cat, whether in skirts or on all fours.\\" And that becomes: \\"La curiosit&eacute; entraine la sauvegarde et non la mort de la chatte, qu'elle soit en jupons ou &agrave; quatre pattes.\\" Thus the cat becomes a pussy cat and she mixes up with another phrase: \\"curiosity kills the pussy (cat)\\" which is deeply erotic if not obscene which by the way makes the narrator be a woman. She had completely misinterpreted the skirts of the cat curiosity kills. I would have suggested a translation that uses the corresponding French expression that has nothing to do with cats or pussy cats, something like that: \\"La curiosit&eacute; est un bien vilain d&eacute;faut, mais tellement utile parfois, qu'elle chasse le jupon ou qu'elle coure &agrave; quatre pattes.\\" And sure enough then curiosity is not turned into a female, though she is feminine by grammatical gender, the narrator is not turned into a female neither but the object of this curiosity is either a woman or the other choice is that curiosity is on all fours like a hunting dog or a police dog looking for some corpse or body. That kind of innuendo is in perfect agreement with the English text in which the sexual element is absolutely marginal though of course Beckett thought of it but he managed to keep it marginal.Thus henceforth and thence I do not recommend the only French translation of this text on the French market and what's more it was done and published for the first time after Samuel Beckett's death, otherwise it would have been checked by the boss and we know he was a very good bilingual writer.But this book has a lot more interest.The first thing is that, though it was ordered as an academic study of Proust, though Samuel Beckett was in direct touch with the top French university institution at the time of this order, the Ecole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure de la rue d'Ulm, this is not, and by far, an academic study of Proust. It is a brilliant piece of pure literature whose object and subject at the same time is Proust's works.The second remark is that Beckett is trying to be Joycean I guess and his sentences are never ending, his paragraphs cover pages upon pages. This style is of course very difficult to follow on an academic document, but it is very good style for literature. Some pages contain what will make Beckett famous, the style of his dramatic trilogy that was to come at the time more than twenty years later. Page 56 the sentence starting \\"Thus these rare moments . . .\\" and ending \\". . . the corrosion of his heart.\\" Is an intricate succession of parallel double elements. I count six, hence twelve elements, with one triplet included in the last but one element (the eleventh element): \\". . . of his love or hate or jealousy (interchangeable terms) . . .\\" This is good style and this style is always present and makes the reading difficult because such stylish elements are metaphorical or ,parabolic, and in this present case we have a full Catholic parable in the twelve (the apostles) elements, the six (Solomon's wisdom number) pairs and of course the nearly closing trinity (God himself). We could probably easily identify sub groups with a quartet for the crucifixion and an octet for the second coming and resurrection.The main idea Beckett states is that we live and experience all kinds of events, and all of them will be stored in our involuntary memory's dungeon. On the other hand, in order to be able to live in society we have to stick to what our (but is it ours since it corresponds to \\"the Old Testament of the individual,\\" p. 32) voluntary memory and a set of habits that keep us in time with social life. And the basic point is that this time is not time, is not the time of the deeper memory, of the dungeon, the real time of the real self of a person. This public time that follows the hands of the clock is artificial and prevents us from living in the real primeval duration of the world because that's the only natural dimension of the passing of an existence. And the official time means death since it also means birth, and that is so biblical, the alpha and the omega, the stepping out of time when getting into eternal life that has to be timeless, according to Saint Augustine. And when you understand that duration you can understand that one small event, like a Madeleine or a spoon clicking on a plate or glass, will suspend this time and throw the individual into the deeper layers of involuntary memory, in the dungeon of his life and he will recover some past event in an instantaneous, timeless and spaceless epiphany. It is spaceless because social space is nothing but distance, be this distance social, spatial, intellectual, or whatever which hierarchy. The epiphany we are speaking of here destroys distance and destroys space. At this epiphanic moment we are both here and now in immediate contact with the event that the diver has recuperated in our dungeon.Then you understand Beckett declaring that \\"If this mystical experience communicates an extratemporel essence, it follows that the communicant is for the moment and extratemporal being. Consequently the Proustian solution consists . . . in the negation of Time and Death, the negation of Death because the negation of Time. Death is dead because Time is dead . . . Time is not recovered, it is obliterated.\\" (p. 75)In fact the essay is centred on this time dimension. But Beckett might be misled too. When he quotes Proust saying: \\"I understood the meaning of death, of love and vocation, of the joys of the spirit and the utility of pain,\\" He makes an important mistake to take the narrator of the books as being Proust. He does not identify who spoke and he does not wonder what the autonomy of the character (even if it is the first person narrator of the book, even if he were to be called Marcel Proust in that novel) from the author. Even, when an author writes his memoirs, his confessions, his direct intellectual speculations we are dealing with what the author through the character he creates for the occasion who can be a doppelganger of the author, is saying, and not the author. It could be as if God and his creature were the same thing and Adam would represent if not be God in his full nature.That leads him into sliding into an easy exercise, to my mind a useless exercise: to compare Proust's style with various 19th century schools of writing in France with an additional mention of and reference to Dante and the name attributed to his character Des Esseintes, \\"Alfred Lord Baudelaire\\" (p. 80). This mixture of Alfred de Musset, Lord Byron and Baudelaire is a personification of the \\"'ineluctable gangrene of Romanticism.\\" (p. 80, reference not provided by Beckett) that he attributes to Proust himself.It is far more important to study the real style of Proust than to try to put a label on him by comparing him to others. I guess it is Beckett's naivety of his youth. Proust is unique, like Beckett. But labelling can be very useful to create a smoke screen hiding what the author does not want the audience to see. That's exactly what happened with Beckett's dramatic trilogy. The smoke screen of \\"Theatre of the Absurd\\" has so far prevented professional critics and academics from digging into the text and finding out the real meaning IN THE TEXT AND THE TEXT ONLY. I should publish a study on that subject in the journal Th&eacute;tres du Monde in Avignon, France within twelve months. Keep tuned.The very end of this text dealing with music is interesting but Proust's ideas expressed by his characters - so is it Proust's vision? - are surprising. Music is seen as \\"the Idea itself, unaware of the world of phenomena.\\" (p. 92) This is true provided you disembody music from all instruments. But this also produces the rejection of opera because the voice cannot be disembodied and \\"by definition, opera is a hideous corruption of this most immaterial of all the arts: the words of a libretto are to the musical phrase that they particularize what the Vendme Column, for example, is to the ideal perpendicular.\\" (p. 92) The least we can say is that this is slightly schematic and a comparison, or a metaphor, does not prove anything. Since the example is from Paris it would have been a lot more symbolic to use the Eiffel Tower. Since we are in a Biblical context it would have been a lot more interesting to compare the vertical line to the main vertical beam of the cross on which Jesus was crucified. That would have sounded, both suggestions, more real than the artificial militaristic column quoted here erected more to the glory of a man than to celebrate the vertical line. And anyway in the dungeon of involuntary memory where no time and no space exist, is there still the notion of verticality? Isn't also Beckett projecting his a-temporal and a-spatial vision he will construct in his dramatic trilogy into Proust?Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Extreme Supremacy","review":"I am not certain that this is one and the same author as who writes the wine lover's series because it is a different type book from the mystery, but I can only go on the assumption that it is. That said, I have read Ms. Scott's Murder Uncorked, which I loved and that's why I purchased Extreme Supremacy. This book is very different from her mystery series, but I still liked it. You can tell that she did write this book a long time ago. The copyright is 2001. It's obvious to me that her style has changed quite a bit. However, I found it enjoyable. It needs some editing, but the story is intriguing and the characters are realistic. She does dialogue very well in the two books that I've read by her.Her main character Dr. Kelly Manning is likeable and sympathetic. The story begins when Dr. Manning treats a young woman in the emergency room in labor. The girl gives birth to a very sick baby and the mother dies. Kelly is determined to save this child. This isn't the first situation like this that the doctor has seen in the last month and her suspicions are aroused when she goes to speak with the patholigist and the man she's recently started seeing, Jake Hamilton. Jake behaves oddly and is evasive when she questions him about the cases. That night he is murdered and Kelly becomes a suspect on the lead detective on the case, Detective Tony Pazzini's list. But the detective is drawn to Kelly and she is drawn to him. I won't tell you where this book ends up or how it gets there. I can say that it's a fun roller coaster and the author has done a good job evolving the plot and the characters, albeit it's not as polished as her wine mystery.Ms. Scott creates some great characters from Detective Tony Pazzini to Dr. Kelly Manning, and my favorite, who I would love to see her write about again is Gem Michaels who is a reporter for the L.A. Times and who really is the one who figures out this whole mess and helps to bring the bad guys to justice. And, the bad guys are really bad in this book.This is a good book. It could use some editing, but given this was Ms. Scott's first attempt out, I enjoyed it. I do love her wine series and can't wait to read more from this budding talent. I will pick up her books whether or not they are mysteries, thrillers or romantic type suspense."},{"Title":"Touchdown for Tommy","review":"I read this book as a 12-year-old, and I just loved it. Of course, my copy has a picture of Tommy running for a touchdown on the cover from the days when helmets didn't have facemasks! Anyway, it's about making friends (not playing dirty football), needing to be wanted (by a new puppy and his foster parents), and is just good, clean fun. It has the sports element, which I also liked as a kid, but it's about so much more than football. It ain't intellectual literature, but it is a great read for the 11 to 14 year old set, and can be read to kids younger. It does have sad parts and parts that tug at your heart, but it's good for young boys to feel these things; and the ending will not leave you disappoointed.

I understood this book, but lots of my schoolmaids had difficulties understanding it, probably because they didn't read &quot;21 Days&quot; first. The book is intended to teach C++ from scratch, but you have to be academically intelligent to really grasp the C++ language as it is presented in the book.

It was stupid and I totally regret it and would never drink and drive again, but anyways, on to my point.I had to serve 3 days in county jail with no TV, hardly any rec time, and really no other way to pass the time other than reading. Unfortunately, for some strange reason, the majority of books offered by the jail were old romance novels. I looked thru the small cart for some sort of book I may actually enjoy and managed to find The Jargoon Pard and an extremely beat up copy of the Dean Koontz novel, The Taking. I grabbed both of them and took them back to my cell and after getting situated I took a look at The Taking. It turns out that not only was it in bad shape, it was only about half of a book. That sucks but oh well, I have another book.So I started reading the Jargoon Pard. I struggled thru about 50 pages of this snoozer before I couldn't take it any more and decided that I just might prefer to start from page 200-something in The Taking rather than continue reading this POS. So that's what I did. I finished The Taking in about half a day or so. Once that was done, I tried to find another book to read but like I said before, there was nothing but freaking romance novels. I had to give the Jargoon Pard another try.I kept reading this book off and on over the next couple of days trying my very best to get into it. After all, I had absolutely nothing else to do. He loves some stupid belt but he can't afford it. His future wife gives it to him. He turns into a were-panther. Some wannabe witch steals it from him with the cunning use of a hawk. Oh yeah, his mother's in on it too and she actually stole him when he was a baby and left hers in his place. He has to go back and get the belt or be forever stuck as a panther. Blah, blah, blah. Who cares! I don't know what happens at the end because after reading nearly 200 pages of this god-awful book, I didn't care enough about a single character in it, or anything in the fictional land of Car Do Big Shrimp or whatever the hell it is, to finish it.I still had about half of a day to go in County Jail and rather than finish a book I had already been reading for a day and a half to pass the time, I laid on my 2 inch mat on my steal bunk and did nothing. Nothing but stare at the ceiling and read the more interesting graffiti left by the cell's previous residents."},{"Title":"The Jargoon Pard","review":"I am biased about Qndre Norton, so thus will be this review.I believe she is te most creative, and yes, spiritual author of fantasy today; modeling oour goals and principals through action, never a lecture.

No more Atlas with ruined covers from being stuck between the seat and the console!Speaking of the cover, this version has a cover made from heavier stock thus can take a bit of a beating.The spiral-bound books are a necessity in my opinion. I don't know why there are still Road Atlas's being released that aren't spiral-bound! It's so nice to have the book opened flat without having to crease pages.The only Con I found with this book is really the most important function of a book - the content. I expected that many of the smaller roads would be unable to fit in the smaller size however several recent trips have left me extremely frustrated when even state highways and large secondary routes were missing. There are also many towns missing, some of them larger towns with reasonably sized junctions.I love the features (size, spiral-bound, cover) but without the content these features are pointless.

Benitez includes most of the issues that the Hispanic world encounters, including little money, rape, spiritistic superstitions, natural disasters, and some universal ones like love and death. Each issues pops up one after another in each subsequent chapter until it's impossible to incorporate more.Her writing style is simple so it's not hard to read, but the word choice is not superb. Benitez structured the chapters so that that a minor character in one person's life story becomes the main character in the next. This style makes it near to impossible to connect fully with the characters, since every time you get close to them they're taken away for the next person.There's also the cultural healer, Remedios, who has chapters interspersed throughout the book. While her story is supposed to represent the spiritistic side of the Hispanics, her chapters make little sense to the average reader. Full of symbolism and random imagery in a flowing tone, it does little but to overwhelm the reader and make them want to skip onto the next chapter.Benitez's book may not be an engrossing, life-changing experience, but she does portray Hispanic culture in a truthful light.

I will highly recomend this book for readers who don't have a lot of experience reading like me."},{"Title":"A Place Where the Sea Remembers","review":"Great book. All are short stories, which can be read in short sittings. Yet all the stories are interconnected, so you get a real sense of the characters. I love to read books related to where I travel and I read this book on a recent trip to Mexico. It was perfect. In fact, I bought copies for friends as gifts."},{"Title":"A Place Where the Sea Remembers","review":"I bought this book based on the review that is was like John Steinbeck's \\"The Pearl\\" but this was nothing like that. I missed the sensitivity and caring feeling in this book."},{"Title":"A Place Where the Sea Remembers","review":"I did not find this book to be interesting and it did not grasp my attention. I did not think that the characters were developed very well. I did not feel for the bird man or any of the other characters and their tragic lives. However, Sandra Benitez is a wonderful person and instructor. I am still looking forward to reading The Weight of all Things. I would love to read a book about her life growing up in Latin America as well. I am sorry to have to give Ms. Benitez a rating of a 2. If you want to read the work of Ms. Benitez do not start with this book."},{"Title":"A Place Where the Sea Remembers","review":"wow I would read this book to bed like everyday for a week. Its rare how all the chapters are characters yet they all click and are linked one way or the other. The ending was sad yet it was different. It's a good book to read. It's not a book that will hit your soul but it is a good book b/c is a story you wouldnt be surprise to hear from your grandmother."},{"Title":"A Place Where the Sea Remembers","review":"I don't really get this book, but I have to read it for school. I need MAJOR help."},{"Title":"A Place Where the Sea Remembers","review":"Anyone having read Steinbeck's The Pearl recalls the power of poverty and the simple life of its characters who are pulled into ironic tragedy. So, one considers the native citizenry of Benitez's Mexican tourist village of Santiago, impoverished in the main, and subject to a cruel fate. What is especially potent in this very readable short book is the manner in which Benitez interweaves her characters with their diverse problems and needs into one another's lives. Remedios' presence as the curandero sets the tone; these lives are fated to face life head on, just as the forces of nature ebb and flow. Their fates are an integral part of nature itself.Since its publication in 1993, I have used Benitez' book as a springboard for multicultural reading for my senior English students. I still recommend it for use with other students. I emphatically recommend it to any reader."},{"Title":"A Place Where the Sea Remembers","review":"I read this book for a college lit course and loved it. It was an amazing tale that I had first thought was a collection of short stories. Benitez wove the stories together in the end for a thrilling ending. I was fortunate enough to meet and hear Benitez speak at my college. She had my attention for the entire hour that she spoke. I really loved this novel."},{"Title":"A Place Where the Sea Remembers","review":"I found that in reading Ms. Benitez' first novel that I was being lulled into a gentle portrait of the interconnectedness of the people of the village of Santiago and I enjoyed that, most of the time. At other times, I felt that the author, in the name of verisimilitude, strove to re-create the village life so much that it got in the way of the truth of the story. Remedios, the central character, was under-developed as a shamanness--that is, I wanted to see her power over the lives of the other characters WHEN THEIR STORIES WERE BEING TOLD. Instead, she was just an intercalary effect.But really, these are small criticisms. It was refreshing to read a novel where each character was treated with their own dignity."},{"Title":"A Place Where the Sea Remembers","review":"I enjoyed the contents of the Benetiz compilation of stories. Each had a full meaning and connects to each reader through feelings of pain, loss, guilt, longing and so much more. Benitez entitles the story very well, because even though all the stories are separate, they intertwine in this town, Santiago, which is close by the sea. It relates to a sailors own tales, and even though the sea is rough and forceful at times, it holds many stories full of love and heartache. Remedios is part of the sea and in tune with nature so much that she knows the troubles of every one. The main focus shifted every so often, but in general I think Benitez wanted to say that we can bury or throw away our painful pasts, but anyday, it may be dragged back to us by the foaming sea currents. Our pasts will either drag us down, or kill us, it is what we do for the future that ensures whether it is true or not. And making the right choices isn't always the easiest thing to do when life doesn't have many options for a tourist town like Santiago. Even the town itself is meaningful. It contains many lives that nonetheless are dreamful and hopeful, but not changing as much as they would like."},{"Title":"A Place Where the Sea Remembers","review":"i really enjoyed this novel. Benitez uses great detail in her writings and i felt like I was there watching the town go through all it's tragedy and happiness."},{"Title":"A Place Where the Sea Remembers","review":"This is a great book for any one to read. It is relivent to many levels and speaks in many ways. There is an interesting form of writing at work here that I have never had the joy of seeing before. It is a very gripping book and made me want to keep reading, and comeing from a 15 year old girl who has mny other things to be doing besides reading a novel, that is a big complement. I would recomend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about life in the world around them."},{"Title":"A Place Where the Sea Remembers","review":"This is one of those books that you must read to the very end.

It is not as good as her Bitter Grounds, which is tremendous. She draws the people well and the reader cares about them.

A beautiful title for a flowery collection of vigniettes that wind throughout the lives of the dirt-poor residents of some little Mexican tourist village, going everywhere and eventually tying together in the final chapters of the book. Up untill that point I was reading and reading about seemingly unconnected people and their quasi-ordinary adventures and wondering what the point was. The writing style is continuous and soothing,like the sea (if you're looking for a book where it feels as though the writer is having a conversation with you, this is NoT it; this book is written like a storyteller's tale), but the storyline is anything but tranquil at times. The reader is taken into the lives of people who any average American could hardly imagine living like: these people have 1 room houses (and the book is set in 1980's Mexico), hardly any possessions, are impoverished by our definition of it, and although they lead &quot;simple&quot; lives, they all have complex problems, feelings and relationships of their own. This book does take the reader to another way of life that is geographically near- but so far from their own. This is a strong point. I was irritated while reading this book, though, because virtually all of the 1st half of it was sidestories and excursions which, though pleasant to read, played no part in the books, rising and falling action. In retrospect, I'd say that this is a &quot;good&quot; book, by the general definition. While reading it, however, I had thought it pointless and frivolous at times. If you have spare time and are looking for a lulling, almost-poetic read that will encourage you to ponder fate and its role in the lives of others, then this book is a fine choice for you. If this book is on your summer reading list though, I'd urge you to seriously consider your other choices before settling on A Place Where the Sea Remembers. The book being relatively short is a plus, if it had hundreds of pages of serendipitous sidestories it would be like reading air- no substance. But considering how the story is set in a small Mexican tourist-town on the sea, A PLace Where the Sea Remembers would make a really good beach read!"},{"Title":"The Secret Rose: Love Poems by W.B. Yeats","review":"This is a very fine introduction to the life and love poetry of W.B. Yeats. The book begins with an extensive, 25 page biography of Yeats that includes even his distressful discovery of masturbation at age 15, his hidden love for his distant cousin Laura Armstrong, and his frustrated love for Maud Gonne, the major character of his love poems. He proposed marriage to the cold-but-beautiful and very politically minded Maud, who refused him and married a soldier. The introduction gives examples of how this most important relationship was reflected in Yeats' poems. Yeats first sexual love was with Olivia Shakespear (while estranged from her husband) and was a brief affair. The end of this episode intensified his loss of Maud Gonne and intensified the passion in his poems also. After Maude's separation from her soldier husband, Yeats proposed again to Maude, was refused again, and then he did the creepy thing of asking Maude to allow him to marry her daughter Isuelt! At age 52 he married the 26 year old Georgie Hyde Lees, whom he called &quot;George,&quot; and had a daughter and a son. Yeats exploration of Irish folklore under the guidance of Lady Gregory, and his exploration of mysticism with Georgie are also included in this focussed introduction. The 48 short poems published here are lovely, touching, and often sad, but have beautifully sculpted lines. For example,(on pg.31)&quot;She laid them upon her bosom, Under a cloud of her hair, And her red lips sang them a love-song, Till stars grew out of the air.&quot; Illuminating notes (34 pages) are in the back of the book. The best way to read this book is first to read the introduction, secondly read each poem followed by the notes on each poem, and finally to reread the poem if you want to catch the subtleties."},{"Title":"The Secret Rose: Love Poems by W.B. Yeats","review":"I have long been a Yeats fan but I found this small (120 pages) hard-back book very interesting and beautiful. The first 25 pages or so is an introduction to the life of Yeats, explaining when, why and for whom he wrote his love poetry. Yeats is a very complex and often misunderstood poet but this book is a great way to begin understanding his life and works. After the introduction, each section of the book that follows begins with an explantion of the years the poems were written, the inspiration for the poems, and any symbolism within said poems.I highly recommend this book and feel sure you will enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Secret Rose: Love Poems by W.B. Yeats","review":"Professor Norman Jeffares is an authority on Irish literature. He has lectured in Trinity College, Dublin and written and edited the works of many Irish writers, including Joyce, Yeats, Swift, Farquhar, Goldsmith to name a few. He has written two biographies of W. B. Yeats. In this collection, Norman Jeffares displays the depth and complexity of Yeats' romantic poetry and how they have progressed over the years.It is well known that Yeats led a movement that stimulated new understanding of Irish literature and nationalism in the late 1800s and early 20th centaury. Here, Jeffares focuses his attention on the contribution Yeats made towards romantic poetry.The book contains a useful introduction containing Yeats' biographical notes with important events and people who influenced his work.The poems in this anthology are presented in chronological order and categorised under three headings: romantic idealism (early poems); romantic realism (poems written over the next 15 years); and complex harmonies (poems inspired by his wife).This anthology is a good handbook for students and general readers interested in Yeats' romantic poetry."},{"Title":"The Snow Walker","review":"Canada's poet-biologist-sociologist, Farley Mowat, is the almost invisible traveler in this journey across the snow swept northern barrens.

An engrossing collection of storytelling that could only be the product of the writers intimacy with place.Says Mowat, &quot;The northern people are happy when snow lies heavy on the land. They welcome the first snow in autumn, and often regret its passing in the spring. Snow is their friend. Without it they would have perished or -- almost worse from their point of view -- they would long since have been driven south to join us in our frenetic rush to wherever it is that we are bound.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Snow Walker","review":"I loved this book as much as any that I've ever read.I'm not sure where Mr.Mowat found his ideas for these stories,but it sure seems like they are 'true myths' of the North that he has discov- ered through talking to Arctic/Nordic inhabitants.

McVayauthor of 'Souls of the North Wind'"},{"Title":"The Snow Walker","review":"This collection of short stories by the Canadian writer Farley Mowat, is outstanding proof of his versatility. Although many of his best books are almost unplanned, coming to fruition after some sort of initial spontaneous combustion (I'm thinking of \\"People of the Deer\\" especially), the fictional elements in \\"The Snow Walker\\" indicate a methodical mind capable of forming well crafted prose. All these stories take place in the Arctic, or have to do with it. Many are based on people Mowat met on his travels or heard about from others. They contain the grains of ideas and don't attempt to do more than expand that one notion, as I think short stories should. Hence the stories are focussed and the issue at hand is brought into sharp relief, sometimes in only a few pages. Like a number of Mowat's works, this one has been used in schools for many years, and deservedly so, as it is some of the best Canadian short fiction of its kind (i.e., about the Arctic)."},{"Title":"The Snow Walker","review":"I am a big fan of Farley Mowat and my favorite works of his are definitely his non-fiction: People of the Deer and The Serpent's Coil come to mind. I was hoping for more non-fiction, but most of The Snow Walker is fiction...nicely done fiction but...I buy Mowat for his true accounts so I have to say a slogged through the book but it was not my favorite.

As an individual who has ventured into the northern lands, Farley Mowat conveys ten compelling tales from natives and their cultural heritage.

Very deep stpry telling by an insider, Farley Mowat."},{"Title":"The Snow Walker","review":"I really have enjoyed this book. It gives a very different view of the North then most people know about."},{"Title":"The Snow Walker","review":"I had been given this book over 20 years ago,and it remained unopened in my library until recently. Farley Mowat was my father's lieutenant for a portion of WW II; and I always thought of Mowat as an immature, optimistic man. I recently read a couple of his other books \\"And No Birds Sang\\" and \\"Sibir\\". This same feeling still came thru, but it also revealed that he had a conscience.I opened this book and was not able to put it down. It contains a number of his stories; plus some Inuit stories/legends from the Canadian North which had been fleshed out admirely by Farley. It was evident that he had lived in the north and had a good understanding of the native peoples and what it took to survive there. I would reccommend this book to anyone interested about the north.I found the story \\"Dark Odyssey of Soosie\\" very interesting and at same time very disturbing. As a Canadian it made me feel deep shame when I read how the Canadian government bureaucrats mislead and abused these people during their attempt to establish Canadian communities in un-inhabited areas of the Canadian far north. Unfortunately this treatment of native peoples was not only a problem in Canada; but is still a problem in most of the \\"civilized\\" world. It must have taken a lot of courage for a popular Canadian writer to include this story in this book."},{"Title":"Intermediate Algebra Programmed","review":"This is an excellent book both for those who need to learn the basics of pre-algebra concepts and for those well into algebra functions.This book offers a 1-2-3, a-b-c step-by-step approach to learning complex algebraic problems.

Feminism or femininity? What is the \\"inner woman\\"?In this book, The Female Thing, Kipnis explores what it is like to be a women (in western culture, and particularly in the US) in today's society. Have \\"we've come a long way, baby?\\" Or, as Linda Hirshman claims in Get to Work: A Manifesto for Women of the World, are women continuing to miss the boat?Kipnis more or less issues a report card here: where are women now in regards to social status and equality? My interpretation of her analysis is that the report card would be a \\"C-\\".She looks at 4 primary issues that she calls Envy, Sex, Dirt, and Vulnerability.Envy: \\"If you're a modern female, unfortunately something's always broken\\" (p. 9). Women are obsessed, for complex reasons, about their \\"imperfections.\\" [Note: read I Feel Bad About My Neck: And Other Thoughts on Being a Woman by Nora Ephron for an example of this.] Kipnis summarizes this concept in her phrase \\"...voluntary servitude to self-improvement\\" (p. 10). There is a huge focus on looks instead of health, by the way. This commands women's attention to the detriment of other issues in their lives.Sex: Suffice it to say that women are told they don't need it, or they deserve more, or there are tricks of the trade that are either hidden from them or that fool them, or something! To borrow a title from Star Trek IV, sex for many women is \\"The Undiscovered Country.\\"Dirt: Your various \\"apertures\\" make you vulnerable to nasty things in life. Women in many societies take the major role in managing dirt (internal and external). \\"Needless to say, being in charge of all the dirt has not made women particularly jovial\\" (p. 91).Vulnerability; Kipnis' bottom line is that the \\"custodianship of a vagina really is the female Achilles' heel...\\" (p. 124). She discusses whether female anatomy is fundamentally vulnerable and perhaps \\"overvalued\\". Rape is the quintessential vulnerability, and she discusses the effects of sexual trauma (for example, experiences of Andrea Dworkin) in detail.And then the book ends! I really was expecting a concluding synthesis at the end of these four sections.All in all, this was a well-written, interesting discussion of the plight of many women in search of their various identities... as individuals, as members of family groups, and in societies. It is not a discussion of all the plights, nor all the opportunities. However, Kipnis focuses on the cages surrounding \\"free women.\\" I expect this book will be an interesting one to discuss in your local book club."},{"Title":"The Female Thing: Dirt, Sex, Envy, Vulnerability","review":"THE FEMALE THING is an irreverent look at the conflicted and contradictory female \\"thing\\" - that is, the female psyche. Achieving equality with and independence from the male of the species has been the goal for feminists for the last forty years, and while somewhat achieved, there is a sense of dissatisfaction, of things missing.At least for heterosexual women, men do have something that women want - the possibilities of love, etc. Apparently those needs have driven a tremendous consumption of advice and self-enhancing products and procedures, even among the most ardent feminists. Self-acceptance seems to be in short supply.Attaining financial independence by entering the workforce also has its problems: the loss of time and being subject to the rules of workplace regimes. Now in the name of empowerment, some younger women are opting for child-rearing - eschewing careers. The drive for equality and independence is indeed taking strange directions.Women are also conflicted over the nature of sex. According to the author the location of orgasmatic centers and the assignment of technical responsibility for achieving such is engendering debate among frustrated women. And then there's dirt. Women have been in charge of dirt ever since the rise of domesticity and men are generally oblivious. But the female anatomy itself has, through the centuries, been considered \\"dirty\\" by some elements creating no small amount of consternation even today.The author also considers the hysteria that can surround even the potential for rape, while acknowledging female vulnerabilities. She strongly questions a couple of well known feminists who have either forgotten their complicity in unwelcome advances or fabricated the same.Kipnis' appraisal of the female psyche, actually female sexuality, is intended to be provocative. Her writing is difficult, at times, to follow - just as in her other recent book, Against Love. But it's worth the effort. She forces a re-examination of issues that many may have thought to be settled."},{"Title":"The Female Thing: Dirt, Sex, Envy, Vulnerability","review":"This book is a valuable attempt to summarize the state of \\"the female psyche...in the aftermath of second-wave feminism and partway to gender equality.\\" After a brief preface, Kipnis explores the paradox of female compliance/complicity existing simultaneously with feminism's demands for equality. This exploration unfolds within four chapters, which compose what Kipnis calls \\"a catalog of fetters, a chronicle of impasses.\\"Holding a professorship in media studies at Northwestern University, Laura Kipnis is known for her aggressive humor and honesty regarding gender issues. Some reviewers, perhaps most notably Alexandra Jacobs in the New York Times, have criticized this book for its brevity and lack of theoretical density, but these critics are imposing inapplicable standards of judgment. An earlier book--Against Love: A Polemic--offers a way to understand Kipnis' intention in this new book. She is less interested in constructing an air-tight logical case than in using selective logic to reveal the ambivalence and indecision that many women feel about \\"the female situation.\\"The chapter entitled \\"Envy\\" offers a hilarious parody of the cult of femininity while still challenging the tendency to focus all female disappointments on men (as the scapegoats) and raising the possibility that feminism inadvertently aided \\"scorched-earth labor practices.\\" In \\"Sex,\\" Kipnis explores some willingly forgotten realities about the history of medicine (e.g., genital massage as a treatment for unhappy/depressed women). In \\"Dirt,\\" she shows how the cult of domesticity coupled with the association of home-and-body cleanliness with virtue traps women (and men) in a no-win situation.\\"Vulnerability,\\" the last and most controversial chapter, walks an argumentative tightrope. Kipnis argues persuasively that living with the constant awareness of rape inevitably shapes female behavior and psychology. On the other hand, she examines whether female victimization rhetoric is blinding many people to the possibility that \\"as many men as women are probably raped every year in the United States, and possibly more.\\" As Kipnis writes, \\"Okay, most of these men are incarcerated at the time--but it's still rape.\\"Armchair Interviews says: This book offers a provocative introduction to the debates percolating in many households and classrooms."},{"Title":"The Female Thing: Dirt, Sex, Envy, Vulnerability","review":"As a man, there were many parts of this book that caused me an eye-roll or two. But I had to concede by the end that I found \\"The Female Thing\\" to be an enjoyable and enlightening read on balance. Guys will be able to read this because it has ample doses of humor and doesn't take itself so deadly seriously as most women's books do. Kipnis examines four topics in women's culture (a term introduced to me by Kipnis herself, just what the heck is women's culture?) :Envy, Sex, Dirt and Vulnerability.Women want more. More of what, they are not sure but they want more of it; and men seem to have it, whatever it is. Power seems like a good thing to have and money seems to be the key to power so maybe women should get more money. But that just feeds capitalism and that can't be good (eww!) And if women earn more and men relatively less and women continue to rate men based on how much they make, won't women thus be denied one of the very things they've always wanted i.e. rich men? What women really want is not to feel inadequate. Or maybe just for men to feel inadequate too. Maybe if men started worrying about tummy fat and laugh-lines and their hair and using the right lotions and...wait a minute...metrosexuals... Never mind. Let's look at Sex.Women are faced with an uphill climb to sexual fulfillment, there are physical and social barriers to satisfying recreational sex. Or so Kipnis tells me. My own field research suggests that women who write books about women's sexual problems are over-thinking the thing but I will take her at her word (so to speak.) Then there is pregnancy and childbirth. The profound asymmetry between men's and women's participation and investment in procreation poses socially insurmountable barriers to an equitable distribution of rights and responsibilities. Only technological and legal changes can change outdated paradigms and...wait a minute...designer babies, family law crisis... Never mind. Let's look at Dirt.In what is by far the most readable section for men, Kipnis concedes what men have known all along: women are crazy. Okay, to be fair she offers a lucid examination of the economic, technological and social trends that have shaped modern women's feelings and attitudes toward hygiene and cleanliness and how those feelings and attitudes have presented an obstacle to women's equality (cukoo.) Kipnis fails to mention a well-known truth about the housework wars: A woman will be mad if her man does not enough housework, she will be ballistic if he does too much or does it too well or, worst of all, does it too publicly. Couldn't women ditch these images of feminine perfection and adopt a utilitarian mode of dress and hairstyle more like men's in order to...wait a minute...Rosie O'Donnell... Never mind. Let's look at Vulnerability.Kipnis wades bravely into the issue of rape (you didn't think she meant emotional vulnerability, did you?) Referring grudgingly to statistics, she goes on to talk about the fear of rape being a bigger issue than the actual incidence of rape. She lays out a wide range of what has been written by feminists about rape and the fear of rape that plays such a large role in women's lives and makes a deft observation: \\"The opposite of desire isn't aversion, it's indifference...\\" At what the author concedes is a Freudian (ergo discredited, outmoded) level, women are fascinated by the idea of surrendering to the powerful rogue archetype. (Hey, she said it, not me!) The upshot of decades of loud talk about the socio-political gender ramifications of the fear of rape is a raft of laws and rules that make every sidelong glance a potential train-wreck. Kipnis ends the chapter and the book with the following endearing sentence: \\"A full accounting of the female situation at the moment would need to start roughly here.\\" Some clever typesetting leaves most of that last page invitingly blank. It is simultaneously humble and defiant; I like it.Someday, anthropologists will discover a tribe that has no word or concept for gender. When visitors point out that some people have one kind of plumbing and some another, some bigger shoulders, some bigger hips, they will shrug as though the distinction were no more important than the shape of one's earlobes. They will have suitably elaborate mating rituals which allow the necessary mechanics to be glossed over while still allowing procreation. And we will set up discrete viewing blinds in order to make full use of this gender-neutral laboratory. Until then, we are muddling through and, for me anyway, Kipnis' subtext seems to be that we are making progress.As a man who likes women and wants them to be happy (along with everyone else) I hope so.Comments invited."},{"Title":"The Female Thing: Dirt, Sex, Envy, Vulnerability","review":"Perhaps the best way to educate an audience about a particular subject is to outline the uniqueness of its properties, which is most easily done by juxtaposing its essence alongside what it is not. Professor of Media Studies at Northwestern, Laura Kipnis, in her new book, The Female Thing: Dirt, Sex, Envy, Vulnerability, uses this strategy to illuminate intrinsic female qualities via the four emblematic areas listed in the title. While it may sound rather popish, her brisk essays succeed in their goal. The author has produced a competent, intelligent, and valuable narrative.It may surprise conservatives that a book written by a leftist-feminist could possibly appeal to them, and undoubtedly some will disagree with this reviewer's assessment. Although, The Female Thing's central theme is key to my reasoning. Kipnis believes that it is their own \\"inner woman,\\" as opposed to men or a global conspiracy, that acts as the biggest barrier to women realizing the progressive utopia they deserve--a utopia for which, the author concedes, many women are not even interested. Females have certain refractory predispositions and fascinations which cannot be propagandized away. This is revealed in the female longing for men, the way in which feminine personality types persist despite their sometimes being cloaked in feminist garb, and the world's assigning to women a higher worth based on their bodies. By identifying Woman as a free-thinking agent, Kipnis infuses the opposite sex with responsibility, and this immediately places her on a plane far above her peers. Hopefully, more non-equity feminists will agree that, socially and psychologically, our \\"respective anatomies produce different situations.\\" That's not to imply that she is a biological determinist, however. What she does state is that, \\"what kind of anatomy you've been assigned invariably structures the female experience here on earth.\\" These views are a major advancement for feminism as they eschew the lie that only social construction makes us who we are.The book's greatest strength are the arguments produced by the author's iconoclastic and insightful mind. Many novel ideas are on display. She clarified that women's empowerment came with a cost because much was lost in the process. Furthermore, has not femininity been on its own, from its earliest beginnings, an incredibly effective strategy for the acquisition of resources? From there, we turn to a major dilemma for the modern woman: one can't really be feminine and a feminist at the same time for they are mutually exclusive conditions. The former denies weakness and frailty while the latter promotes it. We find that the root of women's ever-increasing resentment of men--a resentment which is largely not reciprocated--is their own disavowal and self-deception. Their over expectations can be attributed more to a lack of personal fulfillment than to the inadequacies of men.While The Female Thing may not be a precise fit for conservatives, it undeniably marks an advancement in our relations with feminists. Its pages are steeped in argumentation and debate as opposed to calls for castration and lesbianism. Laura Kipnis is her own woman and not a slave to dogma which is all we can ask for. When leftist-feminists desire truth over propaganda they become allies or worthy opponents instead of buffoons walking around blaming \\"the other\\" for their own poor decision making.

In chronological array, the pictures depict the unfolding of a country, from the meekest ambitions of a peasant to the nobility who built castles for defense against invaders, and later, grand sprawling estates that flaunt wealth and privilege, a country grown from simple early hovels to the architectural genius of the 20th century.The result of hundreds of hours flying in a high-wing Cessna aircraft whenever opportunity beckoned, the series is a stunning collection that captures the imagination, from the Stone, Bronze and Iron Age to the remains of Roman life (Hadrian's Wall), the Dark Ages yielding finally to the Norman Invasion of William the Conqueror in 1066, and the strategic placement of castles. Over all, trails the dusty finger of time, man's ambitions rendered on the soil of a place infused with the energies of its population.The importance of religion is seen in the proliferation of churches and cathedrals, many more spectacular when viewed from above, like York Minster and St. Paul's. Medieval villages give way to changing times and population needs, but evidence of the earliest building is visible in these aerial photographs. It isn't difficult to imagine the public's fascination with Stonehenge and the forts of the early centuries, Stone through Iron, the remaining geometric markings as though made by the gods.

After a long run of deadends in his brief career, Brad seizes on this tidbit like a dog on a bone and begins tracing his lead, with the help of septuagenarian Myrna Rashevsky, a delightful CIA veteran who knows all the agency nooks and crannies and computer passwords.The pair set off alarm bells and Brad is fed an unsatisfactory story and forcefully reassigned. But he's a man on a mission who won't be stopped, despite his affection and loyalty toward his boss, whose involvement in this long-ago affair is raising uncomfortable questions about just how far the CIA will go to avoid a political scandal.Brad leaves behind his job and his girlfriend (Cabot's niece) to chase his scraps and hints through the halls of the CIA, the ranks of the Israeli Mossad and into the prison cell of Aldrich Ames, aided and cautioned by the indomitable Myrna.Meanwhile, Brad's girlfriend, Cabot's niece, furious with Brad's bullheaded pursuit of an ancient rumor, allies herself with a cutthroat New York Times investigative reporter who sees a chance to pursue romance and an explosive story, while Cabot's alcoholic wife's behavior and bitterness further derails his chances and a couple of crazed Vietnam militiamen plot a terrorist attack.The result is a full-blown Washington circus bristling with manipulation, maneuvering, lies, cover-ups and cynical ambition. It all rings surprisingly true. The pace is more concerned with the intricate maneuverings of the participants and the layers of obfuscation than with suspense. But the machinations of the clever, ruthless, backstabbing people running the country generates its own suspense.Brad is a likable, believable protagonist whose dedication to his idealistic mission is a breath of fresh air. The climax seems highly farfetched but Powers writes with enough conviction to make it all, just barely, credible. A fine read from a man who sounds like he knows what he's talking about."},{"Title":"The Confirmation","review":"Thomas Powers has written a very solid novel that explores the convoluted process by which the United States Senate confirms presidential appointees. As a long-time insider and journalist in Washington, D.C., Powers has the credentials to make the story plausible and realistic.The plot, which takes several twists and turns, is divided into four main stories: the confirmation of Frank Cabot as the new Director of Central Intelligence; the pursuit of Cabot's past by an investigative journalist, George Tater (perhaps Powers inserting himself into the story?); a Vietnam POW/MIA story centering around Cabot's young aide, Brad Cameron; and a disgruntled Gulf War vet, Dean Cutter, with a deep-seated hatred of the CIA over the POW/MIA issue. Powers does a nice job in tying the three storylines together, although at times he switches between them too suddenly. His character development is fairly good as well, despite the fact that he only seems to touch the surface on some of them. The book captures the intrigue, deception, ulterior motives, and pitfalls of life at the highest levels of politics in Washington very well.My biggest complaint about the book is the ending, which is anticlimactic to the extreme. Once the confirmation is decided, the final pages are not much more than a scrambling attempt to tie up loose ends, which it does rather unsatisfactorily. Other than that, the other minor flaws in the book are well-balanced by the rest of the story.As an enjoyable diversion for the summer, I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good political thriller."},{"Title":"The Confirmation","review":"Thomas Powers writes about Washington political life in a strong,believable way that immediately captures a serious mystery reader's attention. He is gifted with an ear for dialogue and the art of complete character development. Powers is not content with brief and superficial plot and character interaction and does not condescend to his readers. &quot;The Confirmation&quot; is by no means targeted for scholars or for only followers of DC politics. It is a mature, important and highly readable mystery."},{"Title":"The Confirmation","review":"Some of the best characterizations in recent fiction, from hero to villain, and a very satisfying plot. You won't put this down til you finish it, but not because of ridiculous plot twists or scenes of pointless violence. It is a really good story with wonderfully developed senses of time and place. Mr. Powers is in total command of his subject and has given us one of the more enjoyable reads in recent memory! Can't wait for his next one."},{"Title":"The Confirmation","review":"Powers is a skilled reporter whose biography of Helms set a standard for portraying the human behind the don't ask, don't tell mores. It is most interesting to see how he combines two or more real people into one composite. If one is reading this strictly for a John LeCarre or Ian Fleming invention, then this book suffers. If one is familar with a sinister Clark Clifford, or his reincarnation Vernon Jordan -- &quot;American Rhapsody&quot; -- then one is more than rewarded. I particularly liked Powers composite of Oliver North and John Dean as an idealistic CIA grunt. One would not fault &quot;Search for Red October&quot; because the ending is anticlimatic, and recognize that publication of our antisub capability by the Naval Institute insurance agent was a master stroke in the Cold War. Similarly, the denoument in this book is not a surprise, but like a jig saw puzzle, seeing how the pieces fit is satisfying. It is worth noting that many American aviator POWS were sent to USSR during the Korean War, and once drained of useful intelligence, were gulaged. The circumstances of one Laos POW being forgotten by the KGB/GRU/FSI are entirely credible. After all, the United States gulaged Nosenko on Bobby Kennedy's personal responsibility.Some complain about the anticlimatic ending. Quite simply, Powers like Gresham and other trial lawyers writing damn good novels, just does not know how to end a book. If one wishes a good ending, read Poe or Holmes. If one wants a good page turner, with superb character delineation, then Powers' roman a clef is my and your cup of amontilado."},{"Title":"The Confirmation","review":"a great summer read, this is a smart thriller with a hero to root for--a young, attractive CIA trainee who won't give up searching for his MIA.

The Kennedy men actually started pushing the outer edge of the envelope during World War II, and absorbed their first fatality in that conflict (Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.) As Renehan makes clear, Jack damn near lost his life as well. Even sister Kick danced on the razor's edge. She found herself cut when her husband Billy Hartington, heir to the Duke of Devonshire, was killed by a sniper in Europe in the autumn of 1944, just weeks after the death of her brother Joe."},{"Title":"The Kennedys at War: 1937-1945","review":"There are many Kennedy books but this one takes a unique approach. It narrows its focus to four Kennedys -- Papa Joe and his three most promising children, Joe, Jr., Jack and Kick -- and the impact World War II had on them. At the beginning of the book, the millionaire Irish Catholic is off to serve FDR as Ambassador to the Court of St. James. Joe is the chosen one, the one to whom daddy has pinned his hopes. Tall, dark and handsome, Joe is also blessed with good health but little imagination -- he seldom seems to question the world view presented by his powerful father. Jack is more creative, more verbal, wittier -- perhaps he's allowed this freedom because as the sickly second son, so much less is expected of him. Kathleen is charming and vivacious and more than a little spoiled, and ready to take London by storm. The war breaks out and teaches all four of them about loss and heartache, diversity, courage and integrity. Joe comes off as the one who changes the least as a man because he has the least capacity to change -- in some ways he seems unable to accept a new, less privileged life. As Renehan points out, Joe made many friends among roommates but was not well liked by subordinates or those he doesn't consider his equal. Kick changes a great deal -- going from viewing her adventures in London and DC as a lark and the war as an imposition to a woman who begins to think for herself. The future president changes the most because he was the brightest and the most original and introspective. And Old Joe continually gets his butt kicked -- by the English establishment, by the crafty FDR, by the press, by his ever-more rebellious children and by the war itself. It seems a karmic payback for the way he treated people as he garnered all that power.In short, despite the drama, glamor and money, the Kennedys are like any other family. They just lived on a bigger stage and a grander scale."},{"Title":"The Kennedys at War: 1937-1945","review":"There have been a spate of negative books about John F. Kennedy and his family as of late, the most notable of which is the aptly titled \\"The Dark Side of Camelot\\" by Seymore Hersh. \\"The Kennedys at War\\" by Edward J. Renehan is a less hostile and somewhat more balanced look at the young JFK. Overall, Renehan paints a flattering picture of the young John Kennedy, an ambivalent one towards John's older brother, Joe Jr., and a downright negative picture of Joe Kennedy Senior. Their sister Kathleen is mentioned, but this book does not really do much to help the reader to know her.Renehan's theme as regards the young JFK is that he was in constant pain as the result of a plethora of ailments, including his chronically bad back, his Addison's disease, and a urinary condition brought about by (probably multiple cases of) Venerial Disease. Despite these ailments, JFK rose above them to finish college with reasonable success, write a best-selling book just prior to World War II, and serve with distinction in the Navy in the Pacific War. Renehan essentially points out that many people suffering from JFK's multitude of painful ailments might have opted for the easy life. John Kennedy did no such thing.Overall, Renehan presents JFK as a determined and socially-adept young man with genuine intellectual gifts, who declines a life of ease as the son of one of the country's richest men and instead opts for a life of achievement and public service. Renehan disputes the widespread belief that JFK's book \\"Why England Slept\\" which became a bestseller, was ghostwritten for him, and the widespread notion that the book became a bestseller only because Joe Senior bought truckloads of copies. According to Renehan, earlier drafts plainly show that the revisions were largely those of John Kennedy himself, and no bogus purchases were needed because the book received critical acclaim and sold out quickly from bookstores. Renehan does not whitewash the \\"PT-109\\" incident and certain lapses on Kennedy's part, but does point out that it is undisputed that the men were rescued in large part due to Kennedy's excellent leadership. I felt that he gave us a balanced look at this famous story.Overall, the young JFK comes across as a not-perfect but nonetheless genuinely outstanding man. Renehan does not ignore JFK's womanizing, which certainly took place during the period covered by this book. But neither does he dwell on it overlong. The reader can decide for him or her self whether Renehan strikes the right balance here. I thought he did.Joe Kennedy Senior fares much worse in the book. Renehan rightly portrays Joe Senior's tenure as America's ambassador to Britain as having been a disaster for both the country and for Joe himself. Preaching appeasement to Hitler, and frequently expressing the belief that both Britain and America were destined to become Fascist states themselves \\"Democracy is dead in Britain...\\" according to Renehan the main reason Roosevelt appointed Joe Senior as ambassador to Britain was to get him out of the country at a critical time for the Roosevelt Administration. Renehan makes a persuasive case, and certainly Joe Senior's many errors in this context were adequately chronicled at the time. Overall an incredibly negative picture of the man.Joe Kennedy Junior, JFK's older brother, never really comes out in this book. Renehan paints him as essentially a good-looking fellow who was nonetheless a bully and not particularly gifted with interpersonal skills. I frankly did not feel that Renehan did much to help me understand Joe Junior. The same with Kathleen Kennedy.I am not terribly interested in the Kennedy family, whose day has plainly passed. On the other hand, after reading \\"The Dark Side of Camelot\\" I wanted to read a different perspective on JFK in order to strike a balance. This book succeeds as such."},{"Title":"The Kennedys at War: 1937-1945","review":"Both in peace and in war, the Kennedy family has always been in the \\"war\\" with destiny.

Excellent book."},{"Title":"The Kennedys at War: 1937-1945","review":"This is a well researched, well written and very interesting and insightful book.In \\"The Kennedy's at War\\" author Edward Renehan Jr. examines the impact of World War II on the family of Joseph Patrick and Rose Kennedy. The book focuses on the elder Kennedy, his sons, Josephy Jr. and John F. Kennedy, and daughter Kathleen Kennedy, although the entire Kennedy clan is covered.The family sacrificed a great deal during World War II, although the elder Kennedy had done everything in his power to keep America from entering the fighting. Both sons served in the U.S. Navy. Joseph died piloting an aircraft full of explosives late in the war, while John went missing in the Pacific temporarily after his torpedo boat, PT-109, was sliced in half by a Japanese destroyer. And daughter Kathleen's British husband was killed by a German sniper in Normandy shortly after the two married.It was his experiences in World War II that shaped John F. Kennedy and transformed him into the man that later became President of the United States.\\"The Kennedys at War\\" debunks a number of myths concerning the Kennedy family and offers new insights into one of America's most powerful and interesting families."},{"Title":"The Kennedys at War: 1937-1945","review":"This is a well-written and entertaining book, giving a detailed account of the Kennedy family before and during the war. However, contrary to what the title may suggest, the bulk of the book focuses on the Kennedy family prior to the war and their own participation in it. Much of the book is devoted to the time Joe Sr. spent as ambassador to Great Britain and Jack and Joe Jr spent travelling the world, as opposed to the book being exculsively about their time in the service. Very little of the book is actually devoted to that time, which does not take anything away from the quality of the book, but does make the title slightly misleading. None the less, an excellent examination of the Kennedys during that tumultuous time in American history."},{"Title":"The Kennedys at War: 1937-1945","review":"I will stand by my earlier reviews of this book. There is very little new in the way of work done here. Despite one reviewer saying that the author interviewed Gerard Zinser, the last survivor of the 109, it simply is not the case. And there are no new interviews with comrades of JFK's who were in the squadron. Again this is nothing but a rehash of the old Kennedy myth!"},{"Title":"The Kennedys at War: 1937-1945","review":"I stand by my earlier review of the book. There is very little in the way of new scholarship here. Take a look at the endnotes, most are citations from other volumes. I also found it sad that others have to resort to sarcasim in their reviews. The story of PT 109 in this volume is not fair or true. It was not Kennedy that enable the crew to be rescued, but rather Lenny Thom, the XO. Before you attack someone on these pages, you should do your homework."},{"Title":"The Kennedys at War: 1937-1945","review":"As I read this book, I was struck by how little new research was done. All the information seems to have been pulled from other secondary sources. No PT vets were interviewed. And the account of the post sinking of PT 109 is all KENNEDY KENNEDY KENNEDY! No mention whatsoever of the heroics of Lenny Thom, the XO of that boat, who wrote the note that got them rescued. It was NOT the coconut shell! When will the truth be told~?"},{"Title":"The Kennedys at War: 1937-1945","review":"I came away impressed with Mr. Renehan's prose-style, which engages one immediately and makes one sail through the book. This is, as they say, a &quot;real page-turner.&quot; I also came away impressed with the many new sources Renehan has unearthed: aged contemporaries of Joe Kennedy Jr. and Jack who have yielded a great trove of previously-unpublished tales. But the story doesn't stop with Jack and PT-109 or Joe Jr. blowing up with his Liberator bomber over the British coast. No, Mr. Renehan also digs deep into previously unpublished correspondence between the old man, Ambassador Kennedy, and Secretary of State Cordell Hull to document the Ambassador's power-play with Hull and FDR over Chamberlain's policies of appeasement. Mr. Renehan further renders the touching, tragic story of Kick Kennedy and her brief marriage to Billy Hartington in quite a tender and wonderful manner. This book is neither hagiography nor character-assasination. Renehan is not the Kennedys' prosecutor, nor is he their lawyer. He is just a first-class historian, digging up great new information and telling the story straight, as it ought to be told. I recommend THE KENNEDYS AT WAR very highly."},{"Title":"The Kennedys at War: 1937-1945","review":"There are nine customer reviews to date for THE KENNEDYS AT WAR. This one, once it gets posted, will make ten. Six of the nine customer reviews to date are favorable, and three unfavorable. The three unfavorable have all been written by the same customer, a fellow from Cheyenne, Wyoming, who evidently has an axe to grind with THE KENNEDYS AT WAR. Since multiple votes appear to be allowed, I'll register mine once again. (I'm already one of the six favorable.) I stand by what I've said before. I found the book to be very insightful, enlightening and well-written: just as the reviews in Publisher Weekly, Kirkus and other major publications suggested it would be. As far as original sources are concerned, I see that in addition to interviewing several WWII vets who knew JFK and his brother Joe Jr., the author has also, along with other primary sources, mined previously unpublished correspondence between JPK Sr. and Lady Nancy Astor of Cliveden, copies of this correspondence having been provided to the author by Lady Astor's son, Major Sir John Astor. How is that for an original source?"},{"Title":"The Kennedys at War: 1937-1945","review":"I picked this book up Sunday morning after reading a rave review (written by former RI governor Bruce Sundlun, who is a vet of WWII) in THE PROVIDENCE JOURNAL. Nearly three-quarters of the way through, I find it delivers a refreshing and engagingly-written view of the Kennedy family during those troubled and tragic days of war. PT 109 forms only a tiny slice of the really epic story Renehan tells here. There is also Joe Jr.'s troubled life and martyrdom. There is Kathleen Kennedy's troubled coming of age and her young (nearly instantaneous) widowhood. And there is the disaster of JPK Sr.'s years at the Court of St. James's. I respectfully disagree with those who say Renehan has not done much in the way of original resarch. The sections on JPK Sr.'s ambassadorship, for example, seem (from a glance at the footnotes) to be thoroughly grounded in diplomatic correspondence at the FDR Library and in the Cordell Hull Papers, etc. Likewise Renehan has done fresh interviews with vets of the Solomons campaign, etc., etc. Renehan even interviewed the last surviving member of the PT-109 crew, who died last summer."},{"Title":"The Kennedys at War: 1937-1945","review":"Renehan is one of our finest writers of popular history. This is a decision I made long ago when I first read his THE SECRET SIX, and later THE LION'S PRIDE, both also available from Amazon. With THE KENNEDYS AT WAR, he seems to be continuing the line of inquiry he first developed in THE LION'S PRIDE: the study of gifted and prosperous young people during time of war. It is very interesting to watch what happens when Jack Kennedy and his older brother Joe Jr., both from a life of wealth, encounter the democratic (small \\"d\\") institution that is military service. A great story this, featuring characters that can't help but intrigue and engage the reader."},{"Title":"The Kennedys at War: 1937-1945","review":"Note to the previous reviewer: I agree, it was very disengenuous of the author to focus on &quot;Kennedy Kennedy Kennedy&quot; in a book entitled &quot;The Kennedy's at War&quot;.Good portrait of the malevolent Joseph P. Kennedy who continued with his defeatist meanderings even after U.S. entry into the War. Joe Jr. emerges as a chip off the old block, while the future President seems to have benefitted from a lower level of expectations and parental guidance.The author references young Jack's frequent illnesses, and more frequent affairs, but he doesn't dwell on them unnecessarily. Instead, he provides ample evidence of a complex young man with an incisive analytical mind and a casually fatalistic approach to life."},{"Title":"The Kennedys at War: 1937-1945","review":"No other Kennedy book that I've read (and I've read 'em all, I think) gives the in-depth yet balanced coverage found here with regard to the war years. This book covers ALL aspects of the Kennedy family during WWII. Renehan has included not just PT-109, but also Kick Kennedy Hartington's unique story of love and loss and redeption, and one of the most brilliant studies of Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. ever penned. What is more, the portrait of Ambassador Kennedy and his appeasement (what amounted very nearly to pro-Nazi lobbying at Whitehall and in DC) is both stunning and frightening. Renehan has done a great deal in the way of original research, using heretofore unavailable letters and diaries, and interviewing a number of Jack and Joe and Kick's surviving contemporaries (those few that still survive). I found this book to be a VERY good read, and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Kennedys at War: 1937-1945","review":"By zeroing in on a narrow slice of years (1937-45), Renehan is able to go into detail that other writers on the Kennedys have simply not had space for with regard to the war years. His evocation of Jack Kennedy in the South Pacific seems especially good. The best, I think, that I've read. Also, Renehan dives quite deeply into the story of Kick Kennedy and her courtship/marriage with Billy Hartington, heir to the Duke of Devonshire, and it is all very well told."},{"Title":"The Kennedys at War: 1937-1945","review":"I learned a lot I had not known before, especially about Joe Jr., Kick and the young Jack.

Renehan does a terrific job of portraying the complex and interesting Kennedy clan during a key formative moment: the years of World War II."},{"Title":"The Kennedys at War: 1937-1945","review":"As a professor in a small midwestern college, I have noticed that students tend to generalize about historical periods. One of the generalizations usually is that America was united in opposing Nazism and that most Americans were looking for an excuse to enter the war. The \\"America First\\" isolationists are treated as a historical anomaly rather than a powerful political force.Renehan's story of the Kennedy family (focusing primarily on Joseph, Joe, Jr., Jack, and Kathleen) provides evidence that support for avoiding war was found even among prominent Democratic families. Joseph used his position as ambassador to England to promote isolationism, arguing first that Hitler should be appeased as Chamberlain was doing, then, that the US should recognize the futility of supporting a doomed England against the Germans. At the beginning of the volume, Joseph's position seems reflective of the family as a whole. Joe, Jr. does little to change from that position. Jack, on the other hand, moderates his position and shows himself to be quite pragmatic as an aspiring politician.While Renehan talks about Joseph and his adult children, the portraits of Joe Jr. and Kathleen remain somewhat flat. He does better at presenting a multi-dimensional picture of Joseph. He is best at presenting a deep image of Jack. It appears that his sources for Jack were best, including interviews and materials from the Kennedy presidential library. The sources on other family members are not as rich.Most of the critiques offered by other reviewers suggesting that Renehan is merely presenting the \\"Kennedy Myth\\" are addressed in the volume. Rumors of a ghost writer for Jack's Why England Slept and the purchase and storing of huge numbers of the volume by Joseph to ensure its status as a best-seller are dismissed. The story of PT 109 is presented from available sources. (It seems common among Kennedy critics to suggest that Jack was inept as a naval officer or that he was to blame for the sinking of PT 109, given Jack's herculean efforts to get into the war, such a criticism seems pointless.) Renehan attempts to present an accurate portrait so there is plenty of ammunition for those who wish to criticize the Kennedys. The numerous affairs of all three Kennedy men are here without defense. Jack's concern about losing his faith is here. It seems that Renehan is fair and as honest as his sources allow him to be.There are some minor errors of note--Renehan refers to Jack's friend (and later Supreme Court justice) Byron \\"Whizzer\\" White as having been a football star at Colorado State. White was a Colorado Buffalo (not a Colorado State Ram). He also makes reference to a Naval acquaintance of Jack's as a \\"hard-rock Baptist\\" -- I think the proper term would be \\"hard-shell Baptist\\" (I'm not sure what a \\"hard-rock Baptist would be.)Nevertheless, this is an interesting read and provides new light on a prominent American family at a significant time in American history."},{"Title":"The Cabin","review":"RIVETING, SPELLBINDING STORYMs. Neggers has done it again.

Then, even though she proclaims her deep love for her husband she just can't bring herself to return home to him and instead puts down strong roots in Boston at her grandmother's house and even purchases an isolated cabin several hours north of Boston.Her husband learns of the danger she is in and goes to Boston to be with her and once again she sneaks off from him...this time running to the cabin. THEN, the woods around the cabin are crawling with bad guys, one of whom is a murderer and is also after her so instead of staying in the cabin where another Texas Ranger is there to keep her safe she decides to go cross-country skiing and surprise, surprise runs into the bad guy who, duh, tries to kill her. Now there's a surprise!Okay, call me stupid, but if my husband were a CPA and I had an accounting problem, I probably would ask for his help. If my husband were a doctor and I had some sort of mystery ailment, I think I would ask for his opinion. And if my husband were a cop and I had some really bad guys after me, I believe I would see if my husband could help keep me safe!Like I said, I just didn't GET Susanna. I think Ms. Neggers intended to portray Susanna as being so strong that she didn't need her husband. Unfortunately, she doesn't seem to understand that being strong sometimes means realizing when you need to turn to someone else for help.

Jack quickly follows as does the suspect and the tension mounts.It is all resolved at the Adirondack cabin Susanna has bought in her grandmother's hometown. The family problems and the suspense plot are expertly woven together and fold back on one another in a fashion worthy of Ross MacDonald. The characters are real and fully drawn. The supporting cast is superb.(Note especially the tavern scenes) The emotional issues are real and realistically settled. The suspense is palpable and satisfyingly resolved. Laced with humor and excitement this book marks a further advance in the author's work. A great great read!"},{"Title":"The Cabin","review":"I read quite a bit. I usually have 2 or 3 books going at one time. This was the most boring, uninteresting book I can ever remember reading. The characters are one dimensional, the storyline is ridiculous. There is nothing remotely romantic or mysterious about any of it. I hate to even donate it to Good Will for fear of spoiling someone else's reading pleasure."},{"Title":"The Cabin","review":"Texas Ranger Jack Galway and his wife, Susanna have been married for twenty years and have twin girls. They have a happy marriage and trust each other or so one would think.Following the murder of his wife, Beau McGarrity, the dead woman's husband pays a visit to Susanna and implores her to convince her husband that he did not kill his wife. Unbeknownest to Beau Susanna has recorded the conversation and when Beau leaves, Alice Parker, an inept officer knocks on Jack and Susanna's door and Susie thrusts the recording in Alice's hands. Never mentioning any of this to Jack, Susanna packs their girls and goes to visit her grandmother in Boston for a &quot;few weeks&quot; which turn out to be 14 months.Alice Parker is convicted of tampering with the murder scene of the above crime and is sentenced to one year in jail. When she is released she goes to Beau, tells him about the recording, and tells him Susanna has the recording. She tells him she will retrieve it for $50,000. Then Alice goes to Boston, meets Susanna's grandmother,and becomes friends with her. All this contrived plot is to lead Beau to think Susanna has the tape and she, Alice, will steal it from her. How trite. How unbelieveable. Susanna finds out about the friendship between Alice and her grandmother and confronts Alice, then she leaves a message on Jacks's voice mail about what is going on. Jack, of course, flies to Boston.Then everyone goes to the Adriondaks where Susanna has purchased a cabin in the area where her grandmother was born and reared. The plot thickens, but not much.By the time you reach the end you don't really care what happens. Jack, it seems, already knew all of Susanna's so called secrets, but the one I like best was that she was afraid to tell him the investments she made for them are now worth ten million dollars. I'm certain most husbans would be upset to find out they are millionaires or so you are supposed to think. This is certainly not one of Carla Neggar's best and I have read them all."},{"Title":"The Cabin","review":"If you see yourself as a strong, intelligent woman, DO NOT read this book. The 'heroine' is anything but! Her rationalizations of why not to report key information regarding a murderer to her 'wonderful Texas Ranger' husband, and her reluctance to 'clue' this hunk in on her lucrative business, is beyond any normal persons reasoning. And her teen aged daughters behaviors? Is anyone that foolish?Oh, and can she possible squeeze \\"Texas Ranger\\" into anymore sentences...on the SAME page?Normally I consider all books worth reading, but I'll not soon pick up another one of Carla's."},{"Title":"The Cabin","review":"Texas Ranger Jack Galway wants his beloved wife Susanna back, but their separation continues as she lives in Boston making &quot;gazillions&quot; though he has no idea why she left him over a year ago. Their fraternal twin daughters Maggie and Ellen seem adjusted flying back and forth between their parents, but he wants the Galways to become one happy family again.Seeking solace Maggie buys a cabin in the New York Adirondack Mountains near where her ancestors once lived. She, her daughters, and her grandmother travel to the cabin for a family getaway. However, former law enforcement official Alice Parker sees the four females as the weapons of vengeance against Jack who she blames for her troubles. Alice destroyed a murder crime scene with clumsy police work. To exonerate herself she set up a bogus witness. Jack unraveled her sloppy work, which led to her spending time in prison, her goal to become a Ranger lost forever, and the killer getting free. Alice is coming to Upstate New York.The suspense of THE CABIN never slows down for a moment as Alice begins her quest. The support cast to include the twins (any fan of Jane Austen as the siblings are has to be a warm character), granny, and several friends add depth to the plot. The split between the lead couple seems contrived and unnecessary adding little except to keep Jack and Susanna apart so that Alice can facilitate her revenge much easier. Fans of action-packed romantic suspense will delight in Carla Neggers' terse thriller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Cabin","review":"This book from 2002 is one I have read before and is one of my early favorites written by Carla Neggers. The gripping suspense throughout the book, and the dramatic conclusion are enough to keep one enthralled until the end. In spite of being annnoyed by Susanna keeping some secrets that lead to extra difficulties, I sympathized with her and with her husband's situation as well. It's a great read."},{"Title":"The Cabin","review":"Well written exciting story. It was a quick read because you wanted to know what would happen next. Carla Neggers is one of my favorite writters of mystery stories."},{"Title":"The Cabin","review":"I've been reading Carla's books for a few years now and I can easily say she gets better and better. This book was one that kept me reading well past one am. If she continues at this pace, Ms. Neggers will soon be the number one romance writer in the country. This is definitely one to check out!"},{"Title":"The Cabin","review":"As usual, Ms. Neggers has created refreshing, original characters along with a story that is believable and fast-paced. I really couldn't put it down this weekend!!It was just what I needed after a stressful week--can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"The Cabin","review":"You can read the plot summary from the other reviews, I'll just say that I really like the characters that Neggers creates in this book. The heroine is almost forty; a nice change. And the eighty year grandmother is a real person, who not only has an intriguing past, but who is also still an interesting person. And then there's Jack and Sam. I'm assuming that Sam will get his own book soon; will he be paired with one of the twins? I enjoyed THE CABIN more than THE CARRIAGE HOUSE. Would I tell my husband if I'd made $10 million dollars? It wouldn't be easy if it made him feel threatened. Just think of all the romance novels I could buy secretly on line."},{"Title":"The Cabin","review":"So, in this continuation of the series of friends from Somerville, MA (Read the Carriage House first) Susanna has secrets she finds she can't share with her husband Jack, and afraid of what her emotions mean to their marriage - she \\"runs\\" away from him. When in danger he comes to her rescue only to find that she has to rescue him, too. Oh my gosh - Neggers is a hidden gem and this just continues my love of her books that I just can't put down! Just keep writing Carla!"},{"Title":"The Cabin","review":"So far this book I'm reading is pretty good, becuase it's very suspensful and nothing predictable happens when you think it will. I would recommend this book to other people who like suspensful fiction books."},{"Title":"The Cabin","review":"Annotation: Carla Neggers claims that she writes because she always has ideas and stories percolating in her head.Author Bio: Carla Neggers has written quite a few books, she says once she starts writing she can continue writing for 18 hours at a stretch, but she has to take breaks to unkink. Carla's last four books have interrelated characters, although each book stands alone-the stories themselves aren't connected. Carla's first three original romances were written under the pseudonym Amalia James. Amalia is Carla's middle name( after her dutch grandmother). Right now she is working on a book called &quot;Nights Landing.&quot; She finished her first book at 24, she was so broke she had to rent a typewriter. The book sold and since then her popular, award-winning romance fiction has appeared on the New York Times, USA today, Waldenbooks, and Amazon best seller lists. She lives in vermont with her husband and two children. She is known for her unique blend of humor, romance and suspense. She also lives to ski, kayak, hike, and garden.Evaluation: The book I'm reading, &quot;The Cabin,&quot; is a very suspensful book. I enjoy the way the author introduces the characters in the story. Its one of those books you want to keep reading and never put down. The story jumps from one character in the story and then all of a sudden there is another character talking.So you have to read carefully to know what is going on,but if you get the gist of it, it's a pretty good book and I would recommend it to other people out there, who like reading books that are kind of mystery and suspensful. This book is good because, even though it is fiction it is something that could really happen in real life."},{"Title":"The Cabin","review":"I have read several of Carla Negger's books to date and plan on reading more as I like the suspense romance books. However, it was impossible for me to finish this book. It was difficult to get through the number of chapters I did.I found myself wanting to strangle the main character Suzanna. I could not believe that any smart strong woman would act like she was acting, especially to her husband who she claimed to love deeply. I could not enjoy the book as I disliked the main character so much.When I read a book, I want to enjoy the read and feel like the main characters could be great friends of mine. I want to be taken away from the real world and I want a read that seems plausable.I think Carla Neggers books are a great read, but I find occasionally I find myself saying \\"Why would anyone do this? This is just not believable.\\", which makes the book not as enjoyable. This book just is not up to the level of writing I find from Carla Neggers. I do plan on reading more of her books however. Do not pass up her other series of books because of one book. All authors have books I don't particulary care for."},{"Title":"The Cabin","review":"I really, really liked this book. And, so far, I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Carla Neggers books-of the seven I've read. I like her female characters, who are idependent, self-sufficient women with a mind of their own. Most of them are stubborn. Some make choices that I would never make, but I can understand where they are coming from. And they fall in love with men who are just as independent, self-sufficient, and stubborn as they are, which makes for spicy and intriguing love affairs.I liked The Cabin because it ultimately pulled the married couple back together by each learning that they need to TALK to one another and not keep so many secrets from each other."},{"Title":"The Cabin","review":"Description from the back of the book:Texas Ranger Jack Galway knows his wife Susanna loves him, so when their marriage hits a rough patch, he supports her decision to take their teenaged daughters to Boston for a break.

Although I enjoyed the adventure & story of this book I didn't really understand the reasoning behind the murdering & stalking. I also didn't get some of the humor in this book & there were a few times when I just didn't follow what was going on.

If you like romantic mystery, you'll love &quot;The Cabin&quot;."},{"Title":"The Cabin","review":"I always look forward to reading Ms. Neggers and she hasn't disappointed me with this wonderful story. She starts with a new premise - Jack and Susanna, a couple married 20 years are having some problems and Susanna moves away to regroup, rethink their lives together, not Jack. While Susanna is living up in MA, an unsavory character reappears in Jack's life looking to cause a myraid of problems. This book is well written and totally enjoyable. A true winner."},{"Title":"The Cabin","review":"This was a nice read - it wasn't a romantic book really, and didn't have too much suspense either. But, it developed the main characters well enough and had a decent plot. My interest in the book was lowered by the &quot;Texas Ranger&quot; phrase being used on pratically every other line. Carla Neggers hammered that phrase into the mind again and again and again and again - it was really irksome and kept the dialogue from flowing. I wish I had counted how many times &quot;Texas Ranger&quot; was used in the book, because it must number in the thousands - it was just overkill."},{"Title":"The Cabin","review":"I kept thinking this book would get better but it did NOT. Maybe it was because I am married to a lawman. It was just so unreal. I kept reading thinking it would have a good suprise ending. But it did not.

The stories include The Ugly Duckling, Thumbelina, and the Emperor's New Clothes. Translated by Naomi Lewis, this collection of wonderful stories is told in a clear and concise format, as Puffin books tend to be. Hans Andersen's stories often include mythical creatures like such as the Snow Queen, the Mermaid Family, and even a Goblin. Many of the other characters are talking animals or figures. Of course, there are people, and there is even a one inch high girl. At about 200 pages long, the book is perfect for any child who can read and an even an adult might enjoy the stories.One of the stories tells the story of a one inch high girl and her voyage through the world and her rescue of a swallow, another tells the stories of porcelain figures and such that come to life at night. Even yet another story tells the story of a goblin who discovers the wonders of poetry but cannot give up his Christmas bowl of porridge that the grocer he lives with gives him, and so never fully enjoys the magic and wonder of the poetry book.Hans Andersen wrote some of the best stories of all time and readers are guaranteed to love them."},{"Title":"Hans Andersen's Fairy tales (Chandos classics)","review":"And I say \\"beware of the version published by General Books LLC \\" because this particular publisher specializes in taking copyright-free books (such as this) and recreating them using OCR technology, then selling them at a highly inflated price.Within Amazon, books are generally grouped by the same title regardless of whether there are multiple publishers - which there are for this book, as it's now copyright free. Consequently, when one of these books with multiple publishers is reviewed, you will see the reviews of other publishers versions associated with it. And as a result you need to be very careful to make sure you've bought a decent version. The version available from General Books LLC is NOT what I would call a decent version. To be quite frank, it's awful. Full of mistakes (OCR does that, when there's no actual editing to catch the software-generated mistakes), tiny font (verging on the unreadable), no table of contents, no index. By now you should get the idea.General Books LLC puts together books using an OCR automated scanning device which can miss complete pages. There are many many Typos and no table of contents. There books receive NO EDITING of any kind, also, the OCR scanning is done by a robot (which the publishers website outright says can miss pages and which does not scan in images). This is all stated on the publishers web site (google them and read for yourself to get all the details). And with this particular book, you can't do the \\"Look Inside\\" thing for the General Books LLC version to see what you're getting. (And when General Books LLC does let you do this, you'll see something like the following - \\"Just so you know...This view is of the Paperback edition (2009) from WLC. The Paperback edition (2010) from General Books LLC that you originally viewed is the one you'll receive if you click the Add to Cart button at left..\\"They do this because if you saw the actual reproduction of their version, you'd NEVER buy the thing..... Enough said! General Books LLC are flooding Amazon with these low quality publications (450,000+ listed so far) and, unfortunately, many of them have the reviews associated with the original or with better quality imprints associated with them. For the buyer that's not aware of this publisher this can result in a rather unfortunate purchasing decision.A good rule of thumb for these Print on Demand publishers is to take a look at the cover - if it's a good quality illustration that reflects the content, there's a table of contents, and when you do the Look Inside thing there's no disclaimer saying you're looking at another book, and they've stated that they used facsimile reproduction technology (rather than OCR), it's usually a pretty safe bet. Conversely, if any of these are missing, you're taking a chance on the quality. I've bought a few based on my selection criteria above and they've been good quality. General Books LLC however, is a publisher to steer clear of at all costs.If you have been unfortunate enough to buy the General Books LLC version by mistake, you can return to Amazon for a full refund (but check Amazon's return policy and process first).All that said, I loved this book as a kid, still have my old illustrated copy that's almost in pieces, and it's a tragedy to see it being descecrated by a \\"Publisher\\" like General Books LLC. Basically, they're scamming people.And in response to the two Comments below criticising this review: Gentlemen, I suggest you check how Amazon publishes reviews and then READ MY REVIEW. Amazon does NOT allow you to publish a review for a book from a specific Publisher - Amazon groups a book with numerous different publishers together. This is why buyers get caught out by books published by General Books LLC - they rely on people inadvertantly buying from them for the bulk of their sales. Do a bit of checking for yourself before criticising.Please Note that I said:\\"Within Amazon, books are generally grouped by the same title regardless of whether there are multiple publishers - which there are for this book, as it's now copyright free.

This means different versions from different publishers are grouped together. Review one, review 'em all.

The stories are still really boring, occasionally tedious, generally depressing and often religious, but yet I can read them without wanting to scream and pull my hair out as I did withWhat the Moon Saw: and Other Tales.

Hans Christian Andersen's little gems *aren't* traditional folk tales - he did the work - but quite often serve to fuel such fires anyway.The translator, Naomi Lewis, has included a brief introduction discussing Andersen's life and career, and a few pages of notes at the end of the book discussing the original publication and origins of each story herein.\\"The Princess and the Pea\\", \\"Thumbelina\\", \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\"\\"The Little Mermaid\\" - If you're only familiar with the Disney version, I warn you that they discarded much of what makes this story truly great. When evaluating a translation of this story, a quick test is to check the last scene between the mermaid and her prince to see how well the translator captures the actions and feelings of the characters.The youngest of the seven mer-princesses has always been more fascinated by her grandmother's tales of the world above than any of her sisters, but she has the longest to wait for her first trip to the surface on her fifteenth birthday. Since mer-folk turn into seafoam at the end of their 300 years of life and have no immortal souls, she is especially curious about her grandmother's tales of how humans, when they die, can rise into a higher world just as the merfolk rise to the ocean surface, but one the merfolk can never reach, save through a human's love. (Oscar Wilde once turned this upside-down in \\"The Fisherman and the Soul\\", a very good story in which a fisherman fell in love with a mermaid and magically cut himself free of his soul to join her in the sea.)As each of the sisters in turn makes her first journey, we see the world through their eyes, and since each has a different temperament and their birthdays fall at different times of the year, each sees and seeks out different sights. But when the youngest princess' turn finally comes (her name is never given), she has experiences that even the 3rd sister (the most adventurous of the lot) never had: a prince's birthday celebration at sea is struck by a great storm, foundering his ship before her eyes.\\"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\\" - A toy story.\\"The Nightingale\\" - Try Lackey's _The Eagle and the Nightingales_.\\"The Ugly Duckling\\"\\"The Snow Queen\\" - Check out Joan D. Vinge's novel of the same name.\\"The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep\\" - They're porcelain figures who have fallen in love, but when her grandfather arranges a marriage for her with a mahogany carving instead, they decide to run away together.\\"The Happy Family\\" - One of Andersen's lesser-known stories, of a little family of snails who know that they're the most important people in the world. :)\\"The Goblin at the Grocer's\\" - The poet rescued an old book of poetry from the grocer who was using it as scrap paper, and the household goblin took offense at what was said.

Most of them have a darker side. I also believe that the eminent literary critic, Harold Bloom, includes Andersen in his select list of short story writers qualified to be part of the Western canon. I did prefer some of the collection's early and middle tales, such as \\"Little Claus and Big Claus,\\" \\"The Travelling-Companion,\\" and \\"The Little Mermaid\\" to a handful of the later ones like \\"She was Good for Nothing,\\" or \\"The Family and the Gardener.\\" It seems that Andersen's true imaginary gifts shine best where his writing is least in step with the real world."},{"Title":"Hans Andersen's Fairy tales (Chandos classics)","review":"I have always loved Hans Christian Andersen Fairy Tales, but found this book a disappointment.

I haven't read all of the tales yet, but I've read a good portion of them to know that they're all absolutely nuts and insane and I'm absolutely in love with the madness of it all.A particular story entitled The Elf of the Rose stands out to me. It sounds like it's going to be a lovely story about a cute elf frolicking about rose bushes singing songs with fairies and toads or something. It is everything but such a thing. The story recounts the tragic tale of a maiden who's lover is murdered by her brother. And then like, this elf tells the girl in her sleep what happened cause her brother told her that her lover will not return for a long time or ever because he was sent away to a different land. So she finds his buried head and takes it and plants it in this potter of jasmine that she puts by her brother's bed.In the morning this LITERAL HOARD OF BEES and the elf rush in to stab the life out of her brother (which they totally do, btw) but he's already dead cause the smell of the jasmine killed him.I mean.What?I love this story because it's so amazingly...amazing. As are other stories, like The Fir Tree which actually kind of annoys me because I want to smack the Fir tree for being so stupid and impatient and depressed, and The Girl Who Trod on the Loaf, which recounts the tale of a nasty spoiled girl who thought herself so high that she literally TROD ON A LOAF OF BREAD and the earth swallowed her for her insolence.And of course, let's not forget the Princess and the Pea, which has always been one of my all-time favorite fairy tales for as long as I can remember.

Estas sensaciones son casi siempre vagamente opresivas, sutilezas que nos absorven a su universo que nos puede parecer real, pero que siempre hay algo que no encaja en esa realidad. Cuando nos dimos cuenta, ya nos ha transportado a su mundo de fantasmas y estamos compartiendo un sutil sufrimiento con el autor y las protagonistas. Por esta razon, Cortazar es un maestro. En su mayoria, sus relatos tienen complejos vaivenes de argumentos, que siempre termina sorprendi&eacute;ndonos.

She also knows that somehow, Tom blames himself for the accidental death of Callie's first husband.Callie works for Tom as an investigator for the J.O.S.H.U.A. foundation which donates grants to charitable organizations. Callie's position is to recommend which of numerous charity possibilities are to benefit from Tom's generosity. For this particular assignment, Callie is sent to New Orleans to uncover some of Tom's past and to meet his family while working with a charity for children with rare diseases called Family HEARTS. This organization was formed to assist Tom's niece who is also a victim of a rare disease.While reading THE BUCK STOPS HERE, you really need to first meet the characters from reading the previous book, A QUARTER FOR A KISS. Even though this is the fifth book in the series, the previous book is needed to understand the characters and their relationships to each other. Yes, you probably could read this as a stand alone, but you really wouldn't understand the situation of Callie's job, her life, Eli, or Tom. The past history is important to THE BUCK STOPS HERE.Some people frown on reading Christian mysteries; however, I find each of Mindy Clark's books enthralling and delightful while knowing each character better. These are fast paced, action adventure novels with the characters' integrity being the center point. Her books are not really Christian, but probably more inspirational. The characters, especially Callie, view their religion as a part of their daily life. Some real people also have that viewpoint. Callie considers her religion to be private and while you read about her, you discover that this private relationship regarding her religion is what gives her character strength.THE BUCK STOPS HERE is fast-paced and a well-organized novel. The characterization is superb. Each character develops depth with each page. The sequence of Callie's investigation perfectly matches the reading pace. I thoroughly enjoy these novels and I am wondering about the next one. What will the title be? Will the two-dollar bill be next or what title could you use with a five-dollar bill?Mindy Starns Clark has written now five books in THE MILLION DOLLAR MYSTERIES SERIES involving Callie Webber. She lives in Louisiana and is also a wife and mother."},{"Title":"The Buck Stops Here (The Million Dollar Mysteries, Book 5)","review":"Several years ago, Callie and her husband Bryan were on the Appomattox River in Virginia, when a drunken speedboat driver killed the latter. The driver James Sparks pleaded guilty and was sentenced to sixteen years in prison. At first Callie did not want to live, but over time with the help of a friend private investigator Eli Gold she regained her equilibrium. Eli got Callie a job as a researcher at the J.O.S.H.U.A. Foundation investigating nonprofit organizations that apply for grants. Though she still mourns her loss, she has a new beau, Tom Bennett, a code breaker for the National Security Agency.Callie overhears Tom tell Eli he loves her and wants to marry her, but must tell her the truth about Bryan. Eli reminds him that would be an NSA security breach. Stunned, Callie later confronts Tom, who claims national security so she begins to investigate her late husband's life and death. Her inquiries take her from her Maryland Eastern Shore home to Louisiana where she seeks the truth although someone is stalking her with murder in mind.The fifth \\"Million Dollar\\" mystery, THE BUCK STOPS HERE, is a terrific tale that completes the circle started with the first novel. The story line is electrifying, but character driven as Callie needs to know if her second true love had something to do with the death of her first true love. Callie is the center of this fast-paced plot with her quest to learn the truth even risking a chance at a loving relationship. This stand alone novel and the entire series provides delightful entertainment value and worth the bucks, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Buck Stops Here (The Million Dollar Mysteries, Book 5)","review":"Four years ago, Callie Webber's world was shattered when her husband was killed in a boating accident. A man named James Sparks was out boating drunk and didn't even see Brian in the water. Since that horrible day, Callie has managed to recover from her grief, partially thanks to her job investigating charities for the J.O.S.H.U.A Foundation on behalf of her boss, Tom Bennett. Tom and Callie have also fallen in love, and Callie hopes to marry him soon.Ten days ago, Callie overheard a conversation where Tom took responsibility for Brian's death. Shocked, Callie asks for an explanation, only to be told that Tom can't tell her anything because of his work for the NSA. Brian's accident is a matter of national security? How can this be?While Tom can't tell Callie anything, he does encourage her to poke around on her own, which she immediately starts to do. Almost immediately, she begins to discover that the things she thought she knew about that fateful day aren't true. Following the faint trail she can find, she begins to piece together an entirely different picture of events. But what exactly is Tom's roll in all of this? Will God help her forgive him or will Callie turn her back on Tom and God?I must confess, this is the book in the series I've been most anxious to read since I started the series. It didn't disappoint. After the first couple chapters, which are a good introduction for those who haven't read the previous four books in the series, the action takes off. I had trouble putting the book down several nights in a row because the suspense was killing me.About half way through, the plot moves to New Orleans and things slow down a little. After the break neck pace of the first half, it feels slow, but in actuality, things are still moving forward.I also found this part interesting in light of the recent hurricanes. The problems that were an issue in the disaster there were discussed briefly in this book, which came out a year before hand. Just a few throw away lines, really, but they caught my attention.Each book in the series has been personal for Callie in some way, with each one hitting closer to home. As a result, we've been able to see her grow to the point where she is strong enough to deal with the truth she learns from the investigation. Not that she doesn't go through some incredible moments of weakness and pain. Callie is a very human character, which is one of the things I have always loved about her.Forgiveness is a very obvious theme in the book, both God's forgiveness of us as well as forgiveness of each other. It's not preachy, however, but a good reminder for every day life.The writing style still isn't as polished as some series I read, but this time around was actually the smoothest of the series. I had no trouble reconnecting to these characters from the very first page.While not a requirement by any means, this book will be most enjoyed after reading others in the series. All of them are highly entertaining and I recommend them to Christian mystery lovers."},{"Title":"The Buck Stops Here (The Million Dollar Mysteries, Book 5)","review":"This was a fast, fun read with deep meaning.

After finding out (by over hearing a conversation) that her boss, Tom, had something to do with her late husbands death, Callie confronts Tom, but because Tom works for the NSA he is restricted by law not to tell her anything, so he just tells her he's sorry and to please forgive him and then leaves. Ten days later, Tom shows up and in around about way without actually saying it, lets Callie know that she can do her own investigation into the situation.As Callie searches for answers from Virgina, Georgia and then to Louisiana, Callie some how pushes God to the side and takes matters into her own hands, breaking some of the very rules she'd never done before. She struggles with the pieces of information that she's getting and wondering if she and Tom will ever be able to continue their relationship that has been developing into love for many months.During the course of her investigation, she is also conducting an investigation on the Company Family HEARTS for the company that she works for, J.O.S.H.U.A. Foundation. The Family HEARTS compay works for familys with children who have rare disorders. Callie meets several familys whos' lives touch her own. During this investigation Callie meets some of Tom's family and gets a better look at his personal life that has been kept private.For those of you readers who have read all of the previous books in this series we finally get to know just what J.O.S.H.U.A. stands for!"},{"Title":"The Buck Stops Here (The Million Dollar Mysteries, Book 5)","review":"After QUARTER FOR A KISS, things seemed to be looking up for Callie Burke. After recovering somewhat from the loss of her husband in a freak boating accident she has fallen in love with Tom Bennett, the head of the charity organization Callie works for as an investigator. However, in a moment of inadvertent eavesdropping Callie overhears a conversation that reveals that Tom may have had some involvement in her husband's death.

In doing so Callie must learn to fully trust the man she has grown to love and finally discover the tragedy behind her husband's death.Mindy Starns Clark's books have grown stronger with each new entry, and THE BUCK STOPS HERE concludes on a high note.

This includes not only Abraham Lincoln's \\"A House Divided\\" (1858), \\"First Inaugural Address\\" (1861), \\"The Gettysburg Address\\" (1863), and \\"Second Inaugural Address\\" (1865), but also Frederick Douglass's \\"What, to the Slave, is the Fourth of July?\\" (1852) and Robert Toombs, \\"On Secession\\" (1861). Even though the speech collection that I was using had annotated copies of these speeches, I wanted my students to really understand the political situation that Lincoln and the others were responding to in their orations. I ended up doing a lecture on the history of slavery, beginning with the arrival of the first slaves in the American colonies and detailing each crisis and the major court cases and Congressional compromises. The idea was to set up the seeds for the conflict, showing how the political need to keep the number of free and slaves states balanced was running into geographical limitations with regards to the growing of cotton as the United States pushed beyond the Mississippi River. Consequently, I know what a book entitled \\"Causes of the Civil War\\" should cover.James F. Epperson begins with a list of the Notable Figures who will play key roles in the history that he relates in these pages. These includes not only Lincoln, his predecessor James Buchanan, and his opposite number Jefferson Davis, but also Senators John C. Calhoun, Henry, Clay and Stephen A. Douglas, abolitionists John Brown and Harriet Beecher Stowe, the slaves Nat Turner and Dred Scott, and Chief Justice Roger Taney. By highlighting these individuals before the historical narrative Epperson indicates that his thin volume is covering all three branches of government and their respective roles in the coming storm. The book is illustrated maps and photographs, most of the latter coming from the Library of Congress and National Archives, which lend the proper air of authenticity.The specific causes of the Civil War are covered in six chapters: (1) Seeds of Conflict begins with Fort Sumter being shelled and then goes back to the establishment of slavery in America. The debate at the Constitutional Convention over slavery, the Northwest Ordinance, the Missouri Compromise, the Nullification crisis, and the Nat Turner rebellion all set the stage for the last great act of compromise. (2) The Compromise of 1850 covers how the territory acquired from Mexico as a result of the Mexican War, and the attempt to pass the Wilmot Proviso, made the question of how California would enter the Union of critical importance. Epperson then details exactly how the Great Compromise came about. (3) Bleeding Kansas is the next eruption after four years of sectional peace, by which point Stowe had published \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" and the violence entered the chamber of the U.S. Senate. Kansas did not receive statehood until 1861, but the issue spurred the creation of the Republican Party.The fact that there is not another compromise forthcoming makes it clear the war is inevitable at this point, it is just a question of when. Epperson underscores that with (4) Deepening Divisions, where the Dred Scott decision and the Lincoln-Douglas debates make slavery THE only political issue on the agenda. (5) The Election of 1860 explains the great irony, that the split in the Democratic Party gave Lincoln and the Republicans the White House as a result of the 4-way race. Lincoln's election led to (6) Secession and War, with the Southern states making good on their threat, which they did not do in 1850 over the admission of California to the Union. By this last chapter the focus in no longer on the general causes, but rather the specific situation that make Fort Sumter the final crisis that sparked the war.Granted, pretty much everything here can be found in a solid American history textbook, but Epperson has the advantage of clearing the field of everything else. There is nothing in this book that is not related to the topic of the title. The back of \\"Causes of the Civil War\\" includes a Chronology of key events from 1787 to 1861, including Eli Whitney patenting the cotton gin. This is followed by a Glossary of terms from \\"abolition\\" to \\"unconstitutional,\\" and a list of Further Reading that is divided into books for students (e.g., Dale Anderson, \\"The Causes of the Civil War\\") and books for older readers (e.g., James McPherson's \\"Battle Cry of Freedom\\"). There are also Internet Resources and an Index. Other books in The Road to War: Causes of Conflict series look at the causes of the American Revolution, World War I, World War II, and the 1991 and 2003 Gulf Wars. Hopefully these other books are as solid as this one."},{"Title":"Causes of the Civil War (The Road to War: Causes of Conflict)","review":"The \\"Road to War: Causes of Conflict\\" series from OTTN Publishing features outstanding titles that introduce young readers in grades 4 through 6 to the causes of five American wars over the last two hundred years that saw significant American involvement.

On a somewhat theoretical level, Levit describes a &quot;response-managed organization&quot; where the organization strives to be as responsive to their customers as they expect their vendors to be towards them. This makes a lot of sense but, while Levit does provide a framework to achieve this level of response, from a practical standpoint most organizations will struggle to achieve this. Part of the reason for this challenge is reflected in what Levit calls the 5 percent rule: &quot;Of the time invested in each step in a process, only 5 percent contributes directly to the desired outcome. The remaining 95 percent of the time does not add value to the outcome.&quot; For the most part, this is true - and if you don't believe it you've either never been involved in a process improvement initiative or you're not in touch with the reality of you own organization's frailties. The bottom line is, if you're in a corporate environment and are actively involved in process improvement you should read this book. However, don't expect this or any other book to improve your team's ability to successfully implement process improvement initiatives - dedication, persistence, talent, and probably some outside expertise are all necessary ingredients.

However, with the emergence of the service/science-oriented business world and the knowledge worker, these same qualities appear to have little correlation with an executive's effectiveness. Today's business world needs executives who can get the right things done."},{"Title":"The Effective Executive","review":"The better way to understand what is going on inside every business with a little waste of energy and time!!!!!.This book is a need for every one who has the right to be on the way of high performance successfully."},{"Title":"The Effective Executive","review":"What a wonderful book! I read it soon after reading Walter Pidgeon's book entitled The Not-For-Profit CEO, and I thought it really added to it. Pidgeon touched upon what it takes to be successful as a CEO, and the author here tells us in a narrative format comprising of 192 pages how to be effective/successful. I recommend this book to anyone who is responsible for leading a sole proprietorship, a small business, a nonprofit, a department in a for-profit, or a large for-profit. In short, I recommend it for an executive/leader.Most, if not all, of the points in this book are obvious. No rocket science here. The five main points I got from the book are that a leader must:1. Understand what she was hired to do and do it2. Stick to doing things that add value3. Play on her strengths, and don't worry too much about her weaknesses4. Strategize, plan, prioritize and focus5. Lead by making rational decisions based on fact rather than opinionA leader or executive is someone whose work requires tasks of his or her head. He or she does knowledge work. The author states that other workers do tasks of the legs that amount to physical or manual work. He points out time and time again that performing knowledge work is hard to do and still be effective at doing it. A leader who keeps the above five points in mind when doing her work will do it effectively. She will be achieving results - not merely appearing to be busy.I had a few problems with the book even though I liked it. One is that it is dated. At page 139 the author states \\"Decisions are made by men.\\" If this were an isolated incident of focusing on men to the exclusion of women, then I would have let it slide. However, there are numerous references indicating that the book was written as though only men are leaders/executives.Another problem I had with the book was that the author was telling the reader what he thinks it takes to be \\"effective,\\" and the organization of his book was not all that effective in making his points. The narrative format dragged out the message. I would like to have seen a better introduction as to what to expect from the book. I would have liked the main body of the book to be structured more in an outline style. And I would have liked a conclusion that reiterated the introduction and tied the main body of the book together. He failed to do this in my opinion.Early in the book the author tells us that being an effective executive must to be learned. Well, ok - now tell me something I don't know. There was no need to talk about the need for learning - everything a person does has to be learned at some time or another. See the titles of Chapter 1 and the Conclusion to see what I am talking about. Those sections of the book should be renamed and rewritten to make the book more coherent.I would have enjoyed the book more if it had only four points rather than five. The first two points in the book seem to me to really be just one. Leaders are hired to add value to the company that hires them, and they need to understand what they are hired to do. Clearly these two concepts are so intertwined that they should have been discussed as one point."},{"Title":"The Effective Executive","review":"Note: The title of this review is a portion of one of Peter Drucker's most important insights: \\"The most serious mistakes are not being made as a result of wrong answers. The true dangerous thing is asking the wrong question.\\"* * *I first read this book when it was originally published in 1967 and have since re-read it several times because, in my opinion, it provides some of Peter Drucker's most important insights on how to \\"get the right work done and done the right way.\\" By nature an \\"executive\\" is one who \\"executes,\\" producing a desired result (an \\"effect\\") that has both impact and value. As Drucker once observed in an article that appeared in Harvard Business Review at least 40 years ago, \\"There is surely nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all.\\" Therefore, the effective executive must develop sound judgment. Difficult - sometimes immensely difficult - decisions must be made. Here are eight practices that Drucker recommended 45 years ago:o Ask, \\"what needs to be done?\\"o Ask, \\"What is right for the enterprise?\\"o Develop an action plano Take responsibility for decisions.o Take responsibility for communications.o Focus on opportunities rather than on problems.o Conduct productive meetings.o Think in terms of first-person PLURAL pronouns (\\"We\\" rather than \\"I\\").The first two practices give executives the knowledge they need; the next four help them convert this knowledge into effective action; the last two ensure that the entire organization feels responsible and accountable, and will thus be more willing to become engaged. \\"I'm going to throw in one final, bonus practice. This one's so important that I'll elevate it to the level of a rule: [begin italics] Listen first, speak last.\\" [end italics]This volume consists of eight separate but interdependent essays that begin with \\"Effectiveness Can Be Learned\\" and conclude with \\"Effective Decisions.\\" Actually, there is a \\"Conclusion\\" in which Drucker asserts that \\"Effectiveness Must Be Learned.\\" I agree. The essays are arranged in a sequence that parallels a learning process that prepares an executive to \\"assume responsibility, rather than to act the subordinate, satisfied only if he \`pleases the boss.' In focusing himself and his vision on contribution the executive, in other words, has to think through purposes and ends rather than means alone.\\"I highly recommend this to all executives who need an easy-to-read collection of reminders of several basic but essential insights from one of the most important business thinkers, Peter Drucker. I also presume to suggest that they, in turn, urge each of their direct reports to obtain a copy and read it. The last time I checked, Amazon sells a paperbound edition for only $11.55.

Glad I did. Very informative and practical. Great for anyone who wants to improve their effectiveness level in any aspect of their lives."},{"Title":"The Effective Executive","review":"Peter Drucker provides in \\"The Effective Executive\\" what is missing is almost every other leadership book I have read: incredible ideas without indulgent self-promotion. Drucker gets to the point, writing efficiently. He explains we can learn to be effective, how to determine our role and priorities, and how decisions are made.Although any of this can be applied to top brass positions, he respects that most of us reading this are in management at a much lower level. Keeping anecdotes to a minimum, and then, relying on history and major leaders (like Robert E. Lee), the book transcends Drucker himself and the 45 years or so it has been available. Never name dropping, the book reads like a smart textbook, not a management flavor of the month. Because of his approach writing, I left having learned how to manage better with lessons I expect to apply in real life.Much of his thesis comes down to our responsibility to the organization, not what can we get others to do. He uses the term \\"contribute\\" in that we need to ask what we can contribute, how, what is needed for the contribution. While he points out the obvious, that things will get done by ourselves and those below us, he also explains our superiors are likely to respond likewise through our example.A few useful ideas: Work on strengths, not weaknesses (dividends will be higher). Ask ourselves what will produce results (effectiveness starts here). Focus on the real future, not defending the past (if last year's product isn't this year's, move on). It is more than how-to, but also, it is about why: Why these are good ideas, and what can we expect from implementing them.I fully recommend \\"The Effective Executive\\" by Peter Drucker.Anthony Trendlhttp://anthonytrendl.com"},{"Title":"The Effective Executive","review":"Peter Drucker's The Effective Executive is a timeless classic!

It was an excellent course. But perhaps the best thing about the course was that IBM gave each student a new copy of two books that were essential to appreciating the material taught in the course. The two books were \\"The Effective Executive\\" by Peter Drucker and \\"Managing a Programming Project\\" by Phillip Metzger. These two books still probably stand today as the two really essential guides to effectiveness in a modern career in information technology.Drucker teaches a five-fold program for executive effectiveness. The elements are:Time ManagementFocus on ResultsBuild on StrengthsPrioritizationDecision MakingAll of these elements are important. Taken together, they comprise a wonderful guide to executive effectiveness. One of the most outstanding aspects of this book is Drucker's usage of historical analogies to illustrate his teachings. For instance, in discussing the importance of building on strengths, Drucker relates the story of Lincoln's promotion of General Grant at an early stage of the Civil War. While considering this decision, Lincoln was advised by one of his closest aides to keep in mind that Grant was a drinking man. Lincoln's homespun response was to find out what brand of whiskey Grant drank and to make certain that a case of it was delivered to every Union General. The point of the story is that Lincoln understood that Grant had a weakness, for the booze. But his weakness was irrelevant in light of Grant's great strengths as a strategist. Drucker employs this example to teach his student that the purpose of the organization is to make personal strengths effective and to make weaknesses irrelevant. And this is truly a timeless message in executive effectiveness.I would strongly recommend this excellent little book to anyone who desires a great career in information technology today. In fact, the teachings are so generic relative to executive effectiveness, that they would apply to almost any large scale organizational career."},{"Title":"The Effective Executive","review":"If you have an interest in nonprofit organizations and governance, I highly recommend this book.

Stephen Covey has copied a lot of the ideas here in his recent books"},{"Title":"The Effective Executive","review":"Peter Drucker begins this book by pointing out that there is no science of how to improve executive effectiveness, nor any naturally-occurring effective executives. The redeeming point of this problem is that he argues that executive effectiveness can be learned.The principles begin with a focus on time management. We can get greater quantities of every other resource we need, except time. Drucker reports that executives spend their time much differently than they think they do and much differently than they would like to. His solution is to begin by measuring how you spend your time, and compare it with an ideal allocation. Than begin to systematically get rid of the unimportant in favor of the important. His suggestions include stopping some things, delegation, creating policy decisions to replace ad hoc decisions, staying out of things that others should do, and so forth. Any student of time management will recognize the list he suggests. One of the best points is to give yourself large blocks of uninterrupted time to do more significant tasks. He also cautions us not to cut down on time spent with other people. If an hour is required, don't try to do it in 15 minutes.Next, Drucker argues that we should focus on what will make a difference rather than unimportant questions. Otherwise, we will fill our time with motion rather than proceeding towards results.Beyond that, he points out that we have to build on our own strengths and those of the people in our organization. That is how we can outperform the competition and accomplish much more.We also need to be systems thinkers, getting to the core of the issue first. If we are weak on new products, we need to work on the new product development process before fine-tuning our marketing. If we reverse the order of these activities, our results will be far less.Perhaps the best section in the book has to do with executive decision-making, when to make a decision, about what, and what principles to apply. If you only read this section, you would be well rewarded for studying this fine book.I especially liked the familiar Drucker use of important historical examples to make his points. You'll remember the principles better because the examples are so vivid.Although this book was written some time ago, it retains the strength of its insight today. Truly , this is a timeless way to achieve greater effectiveness.You may be concerned about how you are going to learn to apply these concepts. That is actually quite easy. Drucker provides questions in each section that will guide you, step-by-step, to focus your attention on the most promising areas.If you only read one book about how to improve your personal effectiveness as an executive, you will find this to be a rewarding choice."},{"Title":"The Effective Executive","review":"Although Drucker wrote EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVE more than 30 years ago, the principles of decision making are still relevant today, if not more so. The effective executive. . .1) Knows where their time goes. Time is the most valuable resource and is inelastic. It must be managed. What has priority? What is better left undone? What can be outsourced?2) Focuses on results (not effort) by asking:\\"What do I do that justifies my being on the payroll?\\" (pg 53).3) Staff to people's strength (not the absence of weakness).There is no such thing as a \\"good man\\". Good at what? Likewise, a person is hired to produce results, not to please a superior, or blend in.4) Fills the job with the right person (not fits the job to the available person).

Today there are several in this genre. But this book was the first, as is the case with many of Drucker's masterpieces.Drucker starts the book by stating that this book is about managing oneself and that executives who do not manage themselves cannot possibly expect to manage other people.Efficiency vs. Effectiveness:\\"Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right things.\\"For manual work, efficiency was enough. In today world, the center of gravity has shifted from the manual worker to the \\"knowledge worker\\" (a term Drucker coined in the 60s). For knowledge work, effectiveness is more important than efficiency.Who is an executive?Executive = a knowledge worker who is ... responsible for contributions (decisions, actions) ... that have significant impact on ... performance and results of the whole organization (derived from pages 5 through 9).Effective executives:1. Manage time2. Focus on contributions and results3. Build on strengths4. Set the right priorities5. Make effective decisions1. Manage time:\\"Time is the scarcest resource, and unless it is managed, nothing else can be managed\\" (page 51).Chapter 2, Know Thy Time, starts with a three-step process - recording, managing and consolidating time. Drucker then states the factors that make time a unique resource - the supply of time is inelastic, time is perishable and cannot be stored, time is irreplaceable (i.e. has no substitute), all work takes place in and uses up time.Drucker then explains time-diagnosis with questions for the executive:a. What would happen if this were not done at all?b. Which activities could be done by somebody else just as well, if not better?c. (ask others) What do I do that wastes your time without contributing to your effectiveness?Drucker then explains the identification of time wasters caused by - lack of system, overstaffing, bad organization structure, malfunction in information. If you have spent time in meetings, you will surely be able to relate these concepts to your work. This chapter changed my perception of time as a resource.2. Focus on contributions and results:In chapter 3, What Can I Contribute?, Drucker stresses the importance of focusing outward, on contributions and results; as opposed to downward, on efforts. He proceeds to discussing the four basic requirements of effective human relations:a. Communicationb. Teamworkc. Self-developmentd. Development of others3. Build on strengths:\\"In every area of effectiveness within an organization, one feeds the opportunities and starves the problems\\" (page 98).In chapter 4, Making Strengths Productive, Drucker explains that effective executives build on strengths and make weaknesses irrelevant. Decades after this book was written, researchers from Gallup arrived at the same result, published in the bestseller \\"First Break All the Rules\\"; confirming that Drucker was right all along.Drucker proceeds to outline four rules for staffing from strength:a. Make sure the job is well designedb. Make the job challenging to bring out strengthsc. Have an appraisal policy to measure performanced. Put up with weaknesses - the exception is a weakness in character and integrity, which causes disqualification.4. Set the right priorities:Chapter 4, First Things First, deals with concentration. Drucker explains that effective executives set the right priorities and stick to them. They concentrate on the areas where superior performance will produce outstanding results. They also set posteriorities - tasks not to tackle. In the section \\"sloughing off yesterday\\", Drucker states that effective executives ask \\"If we did not already do this, would we go into it now?\\" If the answer is no, the activity is dropped or curtailed. This concept is explained in more detail in Drucker's book titled \\"Managing For Results\\" (1964) as purposeful abandonment in chapter 9. America's best known CEO, GE's Jack Welsh, followed this practice when he got rid of GE businesses that could not be number one or two in their industries.5. Make effective decisions:\\"No decision has been made unless carrying it out in specific steps has become someone's work assignment and responsibility. Until then, there are only good intensions\\" (page 136).In chapter 6, The Elements of Decision Making, Drucker explains his five step decision process:a. Determine whether the problem is generic or uniqueb. Specify the objectives of the decision and the conditions it needs to satisfyc. Determine the right solution that will satisfy the specifications and conditionsd. Convert the decision into actione. Build a feedback process to compare results with expectationsIn chapter 7, Effective Decisions, Drucker states that a decision is a judgment, a choice between alternatives. He explains the importance of creating disagreement, rather than consensus. Drucker explains that disagreement provides alternatives and stimulates imagination.\\"The first rule in decision making is that one does not make a decision unless there is disagreement\\" (page 148).In the conclusion, Drucker states that effectiveness can and must be learned and that executive effectiveness is the best hope to make modern society productive economically and viable socially.If you are an executive, you must read this book."},{"Title":"The Effective Executive","review":"Have you ever run into executives who create more harm than good? Do you realize that some people may see you that way, at least in some situations.One of the most famous quotes by Peter Drucker is that he sometimes refers to himself as an &quot;insultant&quot; rather than a consultant. His straight talk in this book will direct you onto the right path for helping your organization accomplish more.Peter Drucker begins this book by pointing out that there is no science of how to improve executive effectiveness, nor any naturally-occurring effective executives. The redeeming point of this problem is that he argues that executive effectiveness can be learned.The principles begin with a focus on time management. We can get greater quantities of every other resource we need, except time. Drucker reports that executives spend their time much differently than they think they do and much differently than they would like to. His solution is to begin by measuring how you spend your time, and compare it with an ideal allocation. Than begin to systematically get rid of the unimportant in favor of the important. His suggestions include stopping some things, delegation, creating policy decisions to replace ad hoc decisions, staying out of things that others should do, and so forth. Any student of time management will recognize the list he suggests. One of the best points is to give yourself large blocks of uninterrupted time to do more significant tasks. He also cautions us not to cut down on time spent with other people. If an hour is required, don't try to do it in 15 minutes.Next, Drucker argues that we should focus on what will make a difference rather than unimportant questions. Otherwise, we will fill our time with motion rather than proceeding towards results.Beyond that, he points out that we have to build on our own strengths and those of the people in our organization. That is how we can outperform the competition and accomplish much more.We also need to be systems thinkers, getting to the core of the issue first. If you would like to know more about that subject, look at The Fifth Discipline. For example, if you are weak on new products, you need to work on the new product development process before fine-tuning your marketing. If you reverse the order of these activities, your results will be far less.Perhaps the best section in the book has to do with executive decision-making, when to make a decision, about what, and what principles to apply. If you only read this section, you would be well rewarded for studying this fine book.I especially liked the familiar Drucker use of important historical examples to make his points. You'll remember the principles better because the examples are so vivid.Although this book was written some time ago, it retains the strength of its insight today. Truly , this is a timeless way to achieve greater effectiveness.You may be concerned about how you are going to learn to apply these concepts. That is actually quite easy. Drucker provides questions in each section that will guide you, step-by-step, to focus your attention on the most promising areas.If you only read one book about how to improve your personal effectiveness as an executive, you will find this to be a rewarding choice.If you liked what Peter Drucker had to say in this book, you may want to read his latest book, Management Challenges for the 21st Century, to get your agenda for using the skills you developed from The Effective Executive."},{"Title":"The Effective Executive","review":"This book has some powerful messages for the modern executive. The difference between being busy and being effective is an important distinction that Drucker highlights. He also highlights some important rules of thumb that are very true but often taken for granted. For example, the fact that any significant innovation requires large chunks of consecutive time spent focused on the issue. Any manager that wants to create a breakthrough change in their organization needs to think through the issues in large chunks. All we can do in small chunks of time is what we did yesterday. He also points out that the critical scarce resource for any executive is time and that some of the most important decisions an executive makes is any honest assessment of what is not going to get done. Too many projects keep moving forward burning up critical time and never reaching critical mass. Drucker provides insight into how to either make something happen or how to be decisive about what you are not going to do which is often even harder"},{"Title":"The Effective Executive","review":"An outstanding book with the key word in the title being &quot;effective&quot;. Having spent several years working in large corporations and having dealt with many types of managers and executives I am able to count on one hand the ones I have been associated with who were actually &quot;effective&quot; in their respective positions. A must read for anyone currently in an executive management position or aspiring to become any type of manager."},{"Title":"The Effective Executive","review":"This book is not just a good read but should be treated as a manual by anyone who wants to get things done in the knowledge based economy. Some of Drucker's advice seems obvious, e.g. that effective executive should play on the strengths of his coworkers. But how often do managers follow this principle in real life? There is plenty of such simple yet profound advice in this book by the world's No. 1 management thinker."},{"Title":"The Effective Executive","review":"Peter Drucker died on November 11, 2005 at the age of 95. His life and work spanned sixty years and he left behind a body of knowledge and ideas that continue to influence all knowledge workers today. In this book he demonstrates an uncanny ability to see organizations in all their complexity and reduce management problems to their essentials. Like a virtuoso musician, he rarely hits a wrong note, and each idea blends flawlessly with the next. He provides a complete model for management effectiveness that is theoretically sound and solidly based on his experience. This is perhaps the most useful of his 38 books and distills a lifetime of management consulting into a few concise lessons that get to the root of what managers need to do. It provides a complete course in management in a thin book of just 192 pages.Drucker starts by arguing that all knowledge workers are executives and that effectiveness should be defined as \\"getting the right things done.\\" He develops his ideas from real experience, supporting them using real-life stories of successes and failures taken from business and politics. He structures the book around five essential practices, which he found all effective managers have in common: 1) track where your time goes; 2) focus on your outward contribution; 3) build on strengths (yours and others'); 4) do first things first; and 5) -- perhaps most interesting and least intuitive -- follow a decision-making process that builds on opinions and encourages dissent.In elaborating these five essential practices, Drucker presents many insightful findings. However, what is most impressive about the book is not any particular idea or piece of advice, but how his many ideas are tied together into a coherent whole, leading to practical advice on how to do things better.My own experience of the last 30 years indicates that, in spite of much thought and many advances, management has not improved greatly in the past 100 years. Drucker's lessons haven't got passed on to individual managers in the organizations in which I've worked. These were mostly managed by untrained and inexperienced executives and demonstrated typical levels of dysfunction. In large companies, small companies, failed startup companies, failed acquisitions of entrepreneurial companies by larger companies and failed business reengineering efforts, I've experienced many examples of Drucker's advice not being followed -- including all of the following:- Managers who consistently spent too much time managing crises and left important work undone- Culture that evolved into a culture of fear and blame, where heroes were worshipped and winners took all the rewards- Poor, hasty decisions that were made by high level executives based on insufficient information- Banishment of dissent and an unwritten policy of \\"don't ask, don't tell\\"Could these failures have been avoided or is managing just too hard? Drucker's criteria for effective management are simple, but not easily followed. Drucker points out that executives tend towards ineffectiveness unless they put energy into the five practices. Although people don't set out to be bad managers, I've frequently seen good people rendered ineffective by the burden of impossible jobs, by mindless assumptions that could not be disputed, and by decisions that could not be questioned. The drive and energy needed to fix this has to come from an extraordinary and dedicated leader -- and this rarely happens. In the same way that entropy dictates that natural systems tend towards disorder, the natural order of organizations dictates that energy drains out of companies and their managers until they become dysfunctional. Hence the frequent rise and fall of our organizations, which are a microcosm for the rise and fall of our nations and civilizations.It would be hard to read this book and not gain from the experience, but although Drucker was a journalist and his writing is lucid and well-structured, his old-fashioned style makes his book less easy to read than it might be. Also, Drucker's ego sometimes gets in the way. For example, he rarely acknowledges his influences, and when he does, it's usually people he consulted with, like Alfred Sloan, Jr of General Motors, from whom he can claim credit by association. He appears to come up with his huge fund of ideas as if from thin air. This is unfortunate, because there would be great value in understanding where his ideas came from and their links to the ideas of like-minded experts in related areas of thought. For example, one aspect of executive effectiveness that is strikingly missing from his model is motivation. Drucker doesn't address what drives people to excellence and how managers can motivate others.Drucker may have passed on, but his ideas have not. Minor criticisms aside, this could be the only book you need on your path to becoming a better manager. As Drucker says, \\"Self-development of the executive toward effectiveness is the only available answer. It is the only way in which organization goals and individual needs can come together.\\" Effectiveness can be learned and the five habits are a good place to start. Certainly Drucker's ideas could be worked into any training program and his book provides the material for a life-time's work of self-improvement. You will learn a great deal by simply reading the book and relating it to your experience and it may inspire you to make some significant changes in the way you do your work.Graham Lawes"},{"Title":"The Effective Executive","review":"Peter F. Drucker is probably the greatest management thinker of the 20st Century. He has been Professor at New York University and at 83 years old still teaches at the Graduate Management School of Claremont University, California. This book, originally published in 1966, is split up in seven chapters, plus a conclusion.Effectiveness is not just about intelligence, imagination and knowledge, it is about getting results. And the author believes that \\"effectiveness can be learned - and it also has to be learned.\\" In Chapter 1 - Effectiveness Can Be Learned, Drucker discusses the five habits of the mind that have to be acquired to be an effective executive: 1. Know thy time; 2. Outward contribution, or what can I contribute?; 3. Making strength productive; 4. First things first; and 5. Effective decision-making. Each of these elements of executive effectiveness are covered in Chapters 2-to-5.Chapter 6 - The Elements of Decision-Making, which is quite a long chapter is the start of the second part of the book. \\"Effective executives do not make a great many decisions. They concentrate on the important ones. They try to think through what is strategic and generic, rather than 'solve problems'. So what are the elements of the decision process? 1. \\"Is this a generic situation or an exception?\\" Most problems are really generic.; 2. What the decision to accomplish?; 3. What is right, rather than what is acceptable?; 4. Converting the decision into action.; and 5. Feedback has to be built into the decision. This sounds simple, but is rather difficult in practice. But what about the decision itself? \\"A decision is a judgment. It is a choice between alternatives.\\" And this is the subject of Chapter 7 - Effective Decisions. Contrary to common knowledge one does not start with facts, but one starts with opinions. And the right decision ultimately grows out of the clash and conflict of divergent opinions and out of consideration of competing alternatives. Finally, Drucker concludes with the conclusion that effectiveness MUST be learned. He bases his assumption on the fact that the executive's job is to be effective and that effectiveness can be learned and that effectiveness will/has become more important for the knowledge worker.As usual, another great book by Peter Drucker. Although the book was originally published in 1966, it still strikes home the simple basic of effectiveness. This book is not only for business executives, but for all people wanting to become effective and in any field required. The author makes use of great examples from the greatest thinkers in time. I recommend this book to readers who did like Larry Bossidy's 'Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done' and Stephen Covey's 'Seven Habits of Highly Effective People'. Just one comment: Although Drucker makes it sound easy, it requires a lot of hard work and discipline. The author uses simple business US-English."},{"Title":"The Effective Executive","review":"If you are ever consigned to that mythical desert island, and can only have one management book, make this the book.I got my first copy of Peter Drucker's Effective Executive right after I started my first management job after getting out of the Marines in 1968. I read and re-read my hardbound copy, dipping into it again and again for more than three decades until that copy finally fell apart two years ago, and I had to buy another copy. Even though I've read it - cover to cover - several times and dipped into it, literally, hundreds of times, I always find something valuable.Drucker is one of the most lucid and insightful writers there is. In the Effective Executive, he applies those skills to analyzing the job of anyone who has to do knowledge work. In other words, this isn't for the \\"executive\\" in the classic sense. If thinking is a large part of what you do, this is a good book for you. The main points are staggeringly simple. Know thy time. What can I contribute? Making strength productive. First things first. Making effective decisions.For each key point, Drucker gives you, in his usual straightforward way, both examples and ideas. Thisis the book that first taught me to schedule my work in ninety-minute blocks. It's the one that taught me not only about the importance of setting priorities, but how to do it. It's a book that taught me the basicsof decision making, but also that the most important thing about decision making is to have a method for it.I recommend this to all my students in supervision, management, and leadership classes.

The audience could be a CEO or any other enabled knowledge worker.I found Drucker's view encouraging because he feels these aptitudes are not inherent in anyone without the effort of learning these skills. On the other hand, the book is not necessarily a roadmap to the CEO's office as one might hope. In-fact, it merely addresses what an individual's goals should be and the behavior necessary to be effective.The book is also curiously out of date. This is no shortcoming. The issues which were current at the time lend an excellent perspective. The principles presented are not only still true; we understand how history has treated the examples given in the last 40 years. The book has aged very well. In some ways it is has more value than it had originally.There is no magic formula in this book. This is not a cheap 12 step program to the big chair.

So, let's get going...I liked this book a lot, how's that for intellectual. It reads well, I was entertained and I learned a lot more then I expected, which is good for I planned on learning a lot about becoming an effective executive. But history lessons, hey, this is a bonus.Mr. Drucker uses, as have other leadership teachers, many important history lessons of this century to illustrate his effective executive points. He includes life adventures of Gen. Marshall, Presidents Roosevelt and Kennedy, even Bach, Mozart, Verdi and Haydn to illustrate points. One of my favorite comments is from Chapter 5 (First Things First), &quot;Executives can hardly assume that they are 'executive Mozarts'&quot;. No more hints, you'll understand when you read the book. The chapter addressing &quot;The Elements of Decision Making&quot; is the best of the book, although the others are not far behind.If you are in the market for a book on executive leadership, you better put this close to the top of your short reading list.

Drucker's explanation of the difference between manufacturing workers and \\"knowledge\\" workers is illuminating.

It remains a classic for understanding effectiveness in organizations and specifically \\"how to manage oneself\\".Even after 40 years, the book remains relevant. Most of my students, predominantly in their 20s, feel that the book is relevant for today. The examples are a bit dated and the use of the male pronoun throughout is awkward. Nonetheless those minor flaws are far outweighed with systematic writing and practical insight.For Drucker, effectiveness is habit, a set of practices that can (and must) be learned. It is neither a skill, nor is it knowledge. Instead it is a set of simple practices which simply must be engaged in regularly. Drucker frees us from the idea that effective people are born, have a talent or temperament for effectiveness.Effectiveness is \\"getting the right things done\\". This is very different from efficiency, which is merely \\"doing things right\\". Effectiveness is the key to the growth of the entrepreneurial economy.The five habits of effectiveness are: 1) knowing where your time goes, 2) focus on outward contribution, 3) build on strengths, 4) concentrate on a few areas that produce outstanding results, and 5) make effective decisions.Drucker walks through these habits in a highly engaging writing style. He explains and illustrates the habits and provides practical information based on his experience with dozens of executives over decades.While many of Drucker's books are excellent, this is possibly the one that is most widely applicable for anyone who seeks to become more effective and to manage themselves for effectiveness."},{"Title":"The Effective Executive","review":"You know you read the writing of great thinker when the line of text in front of you is simple and yet powerful. Peter Drucker writes like that. The Effective Executive is one of those books that wake up your intellect: simple, unpretentious, direct, based on experience and well practiced art of detecting underlying principles hiding behind our mundane tasks.Effective managers, according to Peter, follow eight principles:- Ask \\"what needs to be done?\\"- Ask \\"what is right?\\"- Develop action plans- Take responsibility for decisions- Take responsibility for communicating- Focus on opportunity rather than problem- Run productive meetings- Think and say \\"we\\" rather than \\"I\\"I like for instance how he describes the taking of responsibility for decisions: a decision has not been made until people know: the name of the person accountable for carrying it out, the deadline, the names of the people who will be affected by it, and the names of the people who will be informed. Simple, isn't it?A penetrating observation is that in large organisations people tend to be absorbed by what happens inside its boundaries and by perfecting a process regardless of the outside world. The removal of the executive from the customer base is fatal in the long run.Other thought that I liked is that the effective executive does not make decisions by consensus, but by what is right, even if the decision is not popular. The executive makes a few decisions, but powerful, rather than many razzle-dazzle decisions.I have this book handy, so that when I have time, I choose to read randomly a page or two. It's like doing meditation. It is simple, elegant and very sharp. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject."},{"Title":"The Effective Executive","review":"Peter Drucker was such a prolific and important writer, thinker, researcher, teacher, and philosopher! Although he is best known a the father of modern management theory, I find that his ideas are applicable to a wide variety of positions and enterprises.The Effective Executive, like most of his works, is written with the assumption that the reader is part of an institution and needs to learn to function within the challenges of the corporate environment. I have never had a traditional job or position in a large institution, but can totally relate to the challenges of what Drucker refers to as executives and knowledge workers.As a professional musician and holistic music teacher ([...]), I have worked to integrate the creative, intuitive sides of human nature with the organizational, rational aspects, both for myself and my clients.Like many artists, I was never taught the principals of management and have had to adapt and educate myself along the way. I owe a lot to Peter Drucker for helping me make sense of the nature of effectiveness and management.Drucker's wisdom transcends culture and industry. Just the acknowledgement that effectiveness is a skill in-and-of-itself, apart from intelligence, talent, charisma, or creativity, is a powerful distinction. His encouragement that it can be (and must be) learned is a relief!His 5 basic practices for effective executives are invaluable insights. Here they are, paraphrased:1) Be aware of and manage your time2) Focus on results, not efforts3) Play to and develop strengths, not weaknesses (yours and others')4) Concentrate and align your actions and your purpose5) Learn to make good decisionsThe examples in the book are a bit old-school, but the principles still hold true.

He writes that, to be effective, an executive (whom hedefines as any knowledge worker responsible for making decisions) must master five specific skills...-- Managing time-- Choosing what to contribute-- Mobilizing strength-- Setting the right priorities-- Making the right decisionsAbout managing time, Drucker offers that the effective executiveeliminates time-wasting activities and consolidates time spent onimportant projects.On choosing what to contribute to the organization, he tells thatthe effective executive asks \\"What can I contribute tosignificantly affect the performance and results of thisorganization\\"? And he stays focused on results rather than onefforts.Regarding the subject of mobilizing strength, Drucker councilsexecutives to hire and manage people with an emphasis on theirstrengths rather than concern about their weaknesses. Andhe advises executives to discover and mobilize their ownindividual working style.About setting the right priorities, he offers two importantthoughts. First, \\"It is more important to convert an opportunityinto results than to solve a problem -- which only restores theequilibrium of yesterday.\\" And second, \\"Concentration -- that is,the courage to impose on time and events his own decision as towhat really matters and comes first -- is the executive's onlyhope of becoming the master of time and events instead of theirwhipping boy.\\"On making decisions, he advises stimulating disagreement among themanagement team. For disagreement brings consideration of alternatives, in turn, brings understanding. He also reminds us that a decision isn't complete until it becomes a detailed work assignment. Until then, it is merely a good intention.As with each of Drucker's books, \\"The Effective Executive\\" isloaded with quotable \\"Druckerisms.\\" For example...-- \\"The truly important events on the outside are not the trends.They are changes in the trends.\\"-- \\"He [the effective executive] always assumes that the eventthat clamors for his attention is in reality a symptom. He looksfor the true problem. He is not content with doctoring thesymptom alone.\\"-- \\"One of the most obvious facts of social and political life isthe longevity of the temporary.\\"Upon finishing writing my own book, \\"Strategic Thinking: A FourPiece Puzzle,\\" I wrote to Peter Drucker asking if he'd write anendorsement for the book. Sure, I knew it was a long shot, butwhat could I lose except a postage stamp?Sure enough, he turned me down. He mailed back my letter onwhich he had scrawled four words, \\"I don't do that.\\"I've kept that letter. For two reasons... Not only is it the shortest rejection letter I've ever received, but, more importantly, it's a personal note from the master himself -- Peter Drucker."},{"Title":"The Effective Executive","review":"The content of this book is very timely and applicable to anyone who is considered to be a 'knowledge worker'.

I fully recommend you read this book! I also found &quot;Life and Death on the Internet&quot; by Keith A. Schroeder valuable as well."},{"Title":"The Effective Executive","review":"As the title indicates this book is about effectiveness, which is defined by the author as getting the right things done. The dogma presented in this book is that it is the executive's job to be effective and that effectiveness can be developed. As Drucker best says: \\"There is, in other words, no reason why anyone with normal endowment should not acquire competence in any practice. Mastery might well elude him; for this one might need special talents. But what is needed in effectiveness is competence.\\" The author then goes on to present the five habits/practices that have to be acquired to be an effective executive:1) Time management: \\"Effective executives know where their time goes. They work systematically at managing the little of their time that can be brought into their control.\\"2) Results-Focused: \\"Effective executive focus on outward contribution. They gear their efforts to results rather than to work. They start out with the question, \\"What results are expected of me\\" rather than with the work to be done, let alone with its techniques and tools.3) Focus on Strengths: \\"Effective executives build on strengths - their own strengths, the strengths of their superiors, colleagues, and subordinates; and on the strengths in the situation, that is, on what they can do. they do not build on weakness. They do not start out with the things they cannot do.\\"4) Priorities: \\"Effective executives concentrate on the few major areas where superior performance will produce outstanding results They force themselves to set priorities and stay with their priority decisions. They know that they have no choice but to do first things first - and second things not at all The alternative is to get nothing done.\\"5) Decision Making: \\"Effective executives, finally, make effective decisions. They know that this is, above all, a matter of system - of the right steps in the right sequence. They know that an effective decision is always a judgment based on \\"dissenting opinions\\" rather than on \\"consensus on the facts.\\" And they know that to make many decisions fast means to make the wrong decisions. What is needed are few, but fundamental, decisions. What is needed is the right strategy rather than razzle-dazzle tactics.\\"Some of my favorite excerpts from the book include:a) \\"Every knowledge worker in modern organization is an \\"executive\\" if, by virtue of his position or knowledge, he is responsible for a contribution that materially affects the capacity of the organization to perform and obtain results.\\"b) \\"The man who focuses on efforts and who stresses his downward authority is a subordinate no matter how exalted his title and rank. But the man who focuses on contribution and who takes responsibility for results, no matter how junior, is in the most literal sense of the phrase, \\"top management.\\" He holds himself accountable for the performance of the whole.\\"c) \\"The focus on contribution by itself supplies the four basic requirements of effective human relations: communication, teamwork, self-development; and, development of others.\\"d) \\"A superior has responsibility for the work of others. He also has power over the careers of others. making strengths productive is therefore much more than an essential of effectiveness. It is a moral imperative, a responsibility of authority and position.\\"e) \\"The effective executive, therefore, asks: \\"What can my boss do really well?\\" \\"What has he done really well?\\" \\"What does he need to know to use his strength?\\" \\"What does he need to get from me to perform?\\" He does not worry too much over what the boss cannot do.\\"f) \\"In human affairs, the distance between the leaders and the average is a constant. If leadership performance is high, the average will go up. The effective executive know that it easier to raise the performance of one leader htan it is to raise the performance of the whole mass.\\"g) \\"Act if on balance the benefits greatly outweigh cost and risk; and Act or do not act; but do not \\"hedge\\" or compromise.\\"h) \\"Self-development of the executive toward effectiveness is the only available answer. It is the only way in which organization goals and individual needs can come together.\\"This book is undoubtedly in a class of its own as far as management books are concerned. As you read it, you will inadvertently recognize the many other books you have read in the management area that have been heavily influenced by the concepts presented within it. A definite must read classic in this field, a book that not only inspires but prompts effective execution and success in one's career and personal life."},{"Title":"The Effective Executive","review":"Drucker wrote a timeless masterpiece. The adage that common sense is far from common echoes through the pages. The book itself rests on two premises: the executive's job is to be effective; and that effectiveness can be learned.

They are:* Recording where the time goes, and an analysis of the executive's time. He notes over and over again that we truly are unaware of how much time we waste, how we use it, and with whom. The first step in effectiveness is to understand where our time goes.* Focus on contribution. The executive then needs to determine why he or she works there, what they are trying to accomplish, what they are expected to accomplish.

It concentrates on a small number of practices to help executives manage themselves - a precursor to managing others. Drucker makes the point that, \\"No one is born an effective executive. No one is a natural... It must be learned...In addition, it is not exceedingly difficult.\\" That's welcome news for all of us. We simply need to follow the practices outlined in this book.The book is meant for a wide audience as Drucker's definition of the executive is broad - \\"Anyone that is responsible for a contribution that materially affects the capacity of the organization to perform and to obtain results.\\"The first step on the journey is to \\"know thy time.\\" Too many managers have no idea where they spend there time. Drucker recommends managers start by recording their time to discover where it is being spent. Once identified, they need to stop wasting time on things that are not important and then work to consolidate freed time into chunks. Significant blocks of time of 2 hours or so are needed to complete important things.Next executives must ask of themselves, \\"What can I contribute that will significantly affect the performance and results of the organization.\\" This helps the manager look outward and to identify and prioritize those tasks that are most important to complete.Then the managers should do the first things first and do them one at a time. \\"The secret of those people who do so many things and apparently so many difficult things is that they do only one thing at a time. As a result, they need much less time in the end than the rest of us.\\"Finally, Drucker outlines how to make effective decisions. He craftily breaks down the elements of the decision process and explains how managers can improve in this discipline.The book is filled with examples and supporting information. Drucker writes in a refreshingly honest and straightforward style. Many refer to this book as a classic. It is worthy of the designation. So much of what is written today is borrowed from Drucker.

The book addresses how an individual can become more effective in key activities such as time management, activity prioritization, and decision-making to the furtherance of their organization's goals.I believe that an organization's actions are defined by its people and not the buildings, machines, and tools they use - organizations themselves fundamentally behave like people. Subsequently, as individuals become more effective, such that their decisions and activities are increasingly focused on mission achievement, the organization itself is more likely to achieve greater levels of success. Because the principles contained within The Effective Executive focus on strong leadership, when they are built into processes and procedures, additional measurable improvements in organizational effectiveness can be achieved.The Effective Executive clearly and concisely conveys many powerful leadership concepts.

One section that fascinated me was about being efficient with time-management. Drucker sites FDR's aide Harry Hopkins as being so sick during WW II, that he literally could only work a few hours every OTHER day. But that he got MORE work done than anyone in wartime Washington. Because he was efficient. Winston Churchill called him, &quot;Lord Heart of the Matter.&quot; I know workaholics who emotionally deprive their families, but take a martyr-like pleasure in their workaholism. And, yes, sometimes they are very accomplished. But I also have a friend in the South of France who is filthy rich, and lives on a huge estate, and made all his immense wealth on his own. And he still works full time. And he rarely works more than a six hour day! And sometimes much less than that! After reading this book, I realized he is just very efficient. Another good book is Robert Ringer's MILLION DOLLAR HABITS. He relates how he used to be frustrated to see so many people work fewer hours than he, but make a lot more money. Then he read a study that showed the most successful people are not workaholics: they are efficient.

I recently re-read his book, \\"The Effective Executive \\" The Definitive Guide to Getting the Right Things Done\\" (this plays perfectly into my theme of time leadership. Leadership is the working on the right things versus Management which is doing things right.) Effectiveness is more important than efficiency.According to Peter Drucker, effective executives follow the same eight practices:They asked, \\"What needs to be done?\\"They asked, \\"What is right for the enterpise?\\"They developed action plans.They took responsibility for decisions.They took responsibility for communicating.They were focused on opportunities rather than problemsThey ran productive meetings.They thought and said \\"we\\" rather than aeI.I particularly liked his view on taking responsibility for decisions.\\"A decision has not been made until people know:The name of the person accountble for carrying it out;The deadline; the names of the people who will be affected by the decision and therefore have to know about, understand, and approve it \\" or at least not be strongly opposed to it; The names of the people who have to be informed of the decision, even if they are not directly affected by it.\\"\\"Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results. By themselves, they only set limits to what can be attained.\\"I could continue regurgitating and typing most of the book; however, I think it is such an excellent book that you should read it yourself.Because I have been swamped lately, I resonated with one of his comments which was executives' time tend to belong to everybody else.

I highly recommend the book."},{"Title":"The Effective Executive","review":"many bright ideas in the book had been further developed, elaborated and marketed.To me, the author is the topmost management guru ever. His ideas in this 1966 book, say, \\"First Thing First\\" (now seemingly to be originated from Stephen Covey, what a shame), time management through task prioritization, systematization of the decision making process, being effective by getting the right things done etc etc simply form the skeleton of contemporary self/business management thoughts. However, I had rated it with four star for two reasons. First, the great concepts put forth by the author were just too good to be put in one single 174 page book. He could elaborate further on any one of them. Second, the examples adopted in the revised version were still those historical cases near the WWI, the WWII and the Vietnamese War era. Some may like that but I find them too remote and aged to relate to.Afterall, it's still a very good book for any executive (somebody expected to get the right things done, per the author) or executive to be. Recommended, but not on the top ten priority list if you have already read more than five self management/improvement books!Below please find some of my favorite passages for your reference.Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffectual; they fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself achievement. They never have learnt that insights become effectiveness only through hard systematic work. pg 1Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results. By themselves, they only set limits to what can be attainted. pg 2Every knowledge worker in modern organisation is an executive if, by virtue of his position or knowledge, he is responsible for a contribution that materially affects the capacity of the organization to perform and to obtain results.....In a guerrilla war, every man is an \\"executive\\". pg 5-6.... five practices/habits of the mind that have to be acquired to be an effective executive:-1. know where their time goes2. focus on outward contribution3. build on strengths - their own, of their superiors, colleagues...4. concentrate on the few major areas where superior performance will produce outstanding results...set priorities...5. make effective decisions, know that this is above all, a matter of system - of the right steps in the right sequence. pg 23-25People kept in a room in which they cannot see light and darkness outside rapidly lose all sense of time.

But even with the lights on, a few hours in a sealed room make most people incapable of estimating how much time has elapsed. pg 26"},{"Title":"The Effective Executive","review":"One of his classics, and among the few that focuses on the practicioner (the manager) instead of the practice itself (management). Drucker delivers in his classic lucid style, insightful but never pedantic. There are lots of truisms in this book, but the one that stands out is the power of focus -- do one thing at a time. In practice, this is among the hardest things to do for a manager. As owner of a growing consulting firm, I am strecthced in all directions at all times. Applying this simple principle -- focusing on a &quot;rock&quot;, as opposed to the &quot;pebbles&quot;, not only increased my productivity -- and thus revenues -- but level of personal satisfaction as well. We all know what needs to be done. It's how to get it done (being effective) that's often the problem. Read this book and learn."},{"Title":"The Effective Executive","review":"I always learn a lot from Drucker. Every single book he has written has become a classic in its own right, with basic prescriptions for many problems one often comes across in business and in life. Although his book Innovation and Entrepreneurship is my all-time favorite, The Effective Executive, at least for me, is a very close second.Drucker starts by defining who and what the executive is, and places him (and increasingly her) in the most appropriate context. He is very careful to distinguish the executive from the more typical laborer. Essentially, Drucker tells us that the executive is someone who is paid for what he or she knows, and not what he or she does. The executive is supposed to know, for any situation, the following: what is the right thing to do, how to do it, and how to do it effectively. Once this is identified, the executive has to make certain that those who do the right thing can do it well. That is essentially the difference between management and labor.Some executives do manage and supervise, as these terms are traditionally used, but an executive has to do more than this. He or she has to identify problems and opportunities, and in the case of problems, solve them, while in the case of opportunities, marshal all available resources to pursue them. While decision-making is part of the executive's domain, it is what goes into the decision-making that is critical. The real task of the executive is to think, make judgements, take focused action and ultimately bear the consequences of his or her actions. In too many institutions, whether they are universities, coporations or government agencies, this action chain often breaks down, typically at the first step. More often than not, however, actions are de-coupled from (bearing) the consequences. As a result, Drucker spends a lot of time going over what it means to be an Effective Executive, as opposed to one of the many hangers-on who merely treads water and tries to curry favor through flattery, subterfuge or other devious and unsavory methods.Drucker, I believe, is very likely the first to make the important distinction between effort and results. Lots of people work hard, put in long hours on the job, yet have nothing to show for their effort. Many will advance in rank and pay, but not based on merit, for they will get their promotions and pay raises based on time served. Results are the end-product of effort- be it large or small, but effort,no matter how great or how dedicated, does not necessarily lead to results, issues of what constitutes 'results' (or even 'effort') aside. This is why Drucker admonishes one to occupy himself or herself with results, and not efforts. That said, Drucker emphasizes that every executive looking to be a better executive should spend a little time thinking about where his or her most important resource- time, goes.Speaking of resources, Drucker also states that the two most important resources in any organization are knowledge and time. Painful experience forces me to agree with his assertion. The two once combined can equal favorable and positive results, if combined properly. However, both of these resources have to be put to work through an organization, and with the assistance of other (hopefully like-minded) people. The danger here is not that knowledge and time will be mis-applied, but that first, knowledge within an organization will go unutilized and second that some knowledge, such as that internal to the organization, will take precedence over the information and knowledge coming from the outside. Too many institutions have grown stale simply because they have consciously chosen to emphasize what is going on inside the organization than what is occuring on the outside, and acting upon it. Once again, painful experience forces me to agree with this brilliant insight.However, Drucker also points out that information and knowledge exist pretty much outside of the organization, and for this he gets my undying respect. People are the source of all knowledge, and in the global economy, people are mobile, so all knowledge, to some extent, will also be mobile. An institution's success or failure then hinges on what comes through and walks out of the door every day. This valuable insight ties into Drucker's last admonishment- focus on contribution. Every executive should ask: 'What can I contribute of value?'; however, this question should be considered well within the context of the organization. Yet again, painful experience forces me to admit that many institutions have specifically organized themselves so as not to have its personnel contribute something of value, no matter what their mission statements profess. In such situations, it is best for the effective executive or those wishing to become effective executives to part ways with such an institution.But fear not, while the book is a thinly veiled extended lecture on the importance of competence and good judgment in business relations, these things can be learned. The path to becomig an effective executive demands some tribute upon the Altar of Bad Experience, but as for the rest, you can acquire it through careful study of history, anecdotal experience and the exercise of a few simple habits to be found in the book. As Will Rogers once said, \\"Good judgment comes from experience. And a lot of experience comes from bad judgment.\\""},{"Title":"The Effective Executive","review":"I were totally shocked when I first read this book(I borrowed it from the public library but now I want to have my own copy).It just tell the feeling inside the bottom of my heart of how to be an effective executive in the knowledge-based society.'To get the right thing done'is a simple jargon but it is also the real essence of being effective in every aspect.I highly recommend this book to all my friends who really want to achieve something in their career."},{"Title":"The Effective Executive","review":"The content of this book is very timely and applicable to anyone who is considered to be a 'knowledge worker'.

This book is not didactic in practices, so it will pair well with Steven Covey's 7 habits approach, or David Allen's approach in Get Things Done."},{"Title":"The Complete Basenji","review":"My parents got our first Basenji when I was 10 years old, and have owned several since then. So, I was familiar with the breed when my husband and I adopted our first basenji 6 weeks ago. But my husband knew very little about the breed, and wanted to know more. After looking at several books I chose &quot;The Complete Basenji&quot;. It is full of historical, confirmation, and medical information about the breed. I would recommend it to anyone who is owned or would like to be owned by a basenji."},{"Title":"The Complete Basenji","review":"I'm owned by 2 Basenjis. This book will gave you insight into the breed. I liked the section &quot;Health Care and Heredity Conditions&quot; which I plan to give to the Vet. Read it carefully if you're considering the breed - it tells you good and bad points. Much of the book is about lineage and criteria for breeds in different countries."},{"Title":"The Complete Basenji","review":"This book is sure to delight everyone, from people who breed and show basenjis to the owner of the cherished pet.A long established breed originating from Africa, the basenji is indeed a distinctive dog. Basenjis have deeply wrinkled foreheads, double curls in their tails, clean themselves like cats, run like antelopes and yodel instead of bark. They can also shed tears. Basenjis are known for their determination, loyalty to their owners and their keen hunting ability. Their cleanliness, natural beauty and gracefulness make them cherished pets indeed.This book is a good teaching tool for folks who own basenjis, a good resource tool for folks interested in basenjis and certainly a well written wealth of information."},{"Title":"The Complete Basenji","review":"A must for a Basenji owner. The pictures are great, good tool to explain the African history to friends.

There was everything in the book that you wanted to know about Basenjiis. There are also many colored photos of the dogs."},{"Title":"The Complete Basenji","review":"A true wealth of information on the amazing Basenji breed. The book provided a concise history of the dog and its migration to other parts of the world. My only complaint is that the pictures were not in color only b&w. Still worth the purchase price. If you are lucky enough to own a Basenji, buy the book. Thinking about owning a Basenji, buy the book and read another. Basneji's are truly unlike any other dog and deserve a person who knows, accepts and appreciates their distinct differences."},{"Title":"The Complete Basenji","review":"I recently bought this book expecting to find out all that wasn't accessible online, only to find that it doesn't really say much. The author owned many basenjis, and knew about as much as I did after a few minutes of google searching the basenji.

It is a quick, easy and very enjoyable, informative read."},{"Title":"The Organ by John Stainer","review":"This book does quite well for teaching someone the basics of playing the organ, for which purpose I'm reviewing it today. It also could practically serve as a reference for how to service an organ, which I didn't really need to know, but wasn't too annoying. I came from a long piano background before I started organ, and I found it a very difficult to transition. This book recognizes that for many, the new fingering that is required by organ is harder than the challenge of pedaling. I certainly found it that way, having to keep my hands legato while reading three lines, playing pedal, and pulling stops. Good comprehensive beginning tool."},{"Title":"Butterfly & Fairy Designs","review":"This is a wonderful book. She offers a lot of good tips and how too's. The designs are clear and easy to follow.

This book is designed to plant the right seeds of belief within its readers.Faith enables an individual to get in harmony with God. It is through trusting Him that the supernatural is manifested. He emphasizes this point by encouraging us to continually fill our minds with possibility thoughts. Replace doubt with expectancy.A familiar theme that he drives home in this book and other works is that what you visualize in your mind is produced in the physical dimension. Consider the statement he makes on faith and results when he says, &quot;Think big, and powerful forces are released.&quot; Planning for inspiration is essential to the achiever's lifestyle. &quot;Travel, music, art, stimulating friends, and good books contribute to inspirational living,&quot; he reminds us.Some profound thoughts on God's perfect timing are also included. We're reminded of the need to synchronize our timing with His, and that as Christians He lives in us.Dr. Peale is a master at communicating truth from the Bible.

Dr. Peale's words of wisdom are skillfully set out by experience and example, personal and otherwise. Many of the characters identified in the book are still living.

This is a small book and most of the stories have to do with the soldiers themselves; thus, if you have an interest in a soldier's imagination, thoughts, dreams, and what he thinks about during the war, their conversations with each other, rather than the raids/battles they might become engaged in, you'll find something of interest within the pages of this book. Otherwise, I'd say give this one a pass. This won't be a book I keep around nor is it something one can readily cite as a source."},{"Title":"Afghan Tales: Stories from Russia's Vietnam","review":"... Most of it was barely tolerable. To get through it was quite a chore. Read this and you'll be amazed when you think the people written about in this book were representing a major super power. I can't even imagine the fact we were once fearful of these people. It seems the only people Russia used in their little war, were found in some bowery or skid row. After reading the book I am still left seeking the answer to a few questions. Like..Did any Russian units actually go on patrols? set an ambush? Does anyone have any of those experiences to share? I have read about a dozen books written by former Russian soldiers and it strikes me that none of them have any combat experiences worth sharing. You will hear plenty about guys hanging out at the camp beating each other up, or drinking. They will even excite you with babble about the dangers of traveling from one place to the other. (which may explain why they never left the capms) Those that did leave the camps, never seem to have gotten out of their BMPS's. Maybe I'll stumble across that one real good book detailing some real combat experienced by The soldiers who fought in Afghanistan. But this one just plain stunk."},{"Title":"Scar Vegas & Other Stories","review":"After picking up this book at the state library ... I wished I hadn't. Paine is a confused writer to say the least and his short stories refelect that. His stories could have been condensed down to a half a dozen pages, but add up to 20+ of verbiage simply reflecting a writer who likes to hear himself write. O'Henry Mr. Paine is not. If you have never felt you wasted your time reading a book .... then read 'Scar Vegas'."},{"Title":"Scar Vegas & Other Stories","review":"I bought this book based upon the (at that time) glowing reviews on Amazon. I found the stories boring (when comprehensible), moralistic and wholly uninteresting. Perhaps I failed to comprehend some oblique deeper mmeaning here--but I doubt it. It was literally a struggle to finish the book. I would definitely skip this one. The worst book I have read in a long time."},{"Title":"Scar Vegas & Other Stories","review":"I'm going to have to make it a rule not to look at the author's photo before i start a book. Tom Paine's airbrushed face is on the jacket, and oh boy, he looks like he fell asleep in a tanning booth. That, combined with the Abercrombie & Fitch styling predisposed me not to like this book.But the writing did not help either! The first story is about a wealthy man caught in a hurricane while sailing. His boat sinks and he is rescued by a group of Haitians floating their way to the US in very dire conditions. These poor people believe that by rescuing an American they will have no trouble being accepted in the country. But the way things turn out is very different.The second story is what really did me in. A burly Marine general, on the day of his retirement, decides to \\"come out\\" by undressing to his female underwear during his farewell banquet.There was something so contrived and forced in that story that i couldn't take it any more. Like the critic who got up in the middle of a play said, \\"I don't need to eat the whole omelette in order to tell you that the eggs were rotten\\"."},{"Title":"Scar Vegas & Other Stories","review":"don't believe me? read the first story and then get back to me"},{"Title":"Scar Vegas & Other Stories","review":"Who is the future of fiction?

Highly entertaining and recommended."},{"Title":"Scar Vegas & Other Stories","review":"I can't believe it. Just as I thought I could never find a short story with something important to say, Tom Paine erupts with stories that grab your attention and make you think. Great writing. Important ideas.Unforgettable. If you suspect that there's more to real life than internet IPO's and instant millionaires, read Scar Vegas. A breath of real air--fresh and shocking."},{"Title":"Scar Vegas & Other Stories","review":"In truth, if half stars were available, I might have given this collection of short stories 4 1/2 stars, but I still though it was great. The stories were varied not only in their subject matter but in their style of being told, almost to the point where it feels that each story was written by a completely different author. In addition, they range from broad comedy to real tragedy to astute social commentary to everything in between. Quite an accomplishment. My only slight reservation was that, while I considered the second 5 stories to be very good, they were not in my view as uniformly excellent as the first five, which were truly great. In particular, I felt that the &quot;Unapproved Minutes of the Carthage, Vermont, Zoning Board&quot; (absolutely hilarious) and &quot;The Spoon Children&quot; were the best of the group. Buy the book and enjoy it."},{"Title":"Scar Vegas & Other Stories","review":"Author Tom Paine delivers 10 short stories in his collection, \\"Scar Vegas\\". While the premise of many of the stories appear clever and promising, they too often end with the familiar and clich&eacute;. Mr. Paine clearly is a talented writer, and this first experience with his work would not stop me from reading what may follow.The author deals with many serious issues with social and moral implications. The issues themselves are not in general that unique, so he has raised the bar for his task of writing new and insightful commentary. He has chosen, in the case of the opening story, a troubling facet that continues to hamper our species reaching closer to a humanity that is appropriate. Again a familiar theme, which he then compounds with additional familiarity by telling his tale through an episode in recent history, that is just too easy. The ending will be clear very shortly after you begin. Indeed with the first tale, the story may lie revealed after reading the description on the book's jacket.The author also makes editorials of many of the stories. The edge these stories would need to make the reader feel uncomfortable, or perhaps become introspective, is made harder by the tone that approaches preaching. If a statement about war is the goal of a story, unless you happen to adhere to this author's opinions, it becomes difficult to concentrate on how he demonstrates his skills as a writer, when as a person he intrudes in his fiction. War can be commented upon without ever mentioning a specific nation or a specific conflict. War is unconditionally horrid. It can stand on its own and be criticized and judged, it need not be identified in meticulous detail to make its point. The conduct of war can certainly be more extreme in certain notorious historical examples. I truly think the author is capable of making his point without relying on events from the news, and his personal views that consistently shadow his words."},{"Title":"Scar Vegas & Other Stories","review":"Tom Paine's debut collection of short stories has the rushed feel of a trip around the world in two weeks. In one 200 page volume the author takes us from a shipwreck in the Caribbean, to an anarchist convention in Seattle, through the despotic world of pre-1989 Romania, and onto the battlefields of the Persian Gulf War. On the way he introduces us to lapsed yuppies, latter day beatnicks, cross-dressing generals and construction executives at war with each other over the meaning of spirituality.Like any ambitious voyage some of the destinations fascinate while others pale. &quot;Will You Say Something, M. Eliot?&quot; &quot;Ceausecu's Cat&quot;, and &quot;A Predictable Nightmare on the Eve of the Stock Market Breaking 6000&quot;, are three of the best ports of call. They each involve the tragedy of strivers derailed by the cruel nature of their environments.The weaker stories get bogged down in overdrawn narrative and trivial dialog. &quot;The Mayor of St. John&quot; and &quot;The Battle of Khafji&quot; are both examples of stories where the author forces us to linger too long over themes he finds interesting. When Paine becomes overtly political, preaching about the evils of the money system and power politics, he undermines what he does best: providing skilled guidance through experiences we couldn't hope, or fear, to have otherwise."},{"Title":"Scar Vegas & Other Stories","review":"Paine mixes Laughtere and Joye in perfect measure. The wonder is how convincing his many divergent characterizations are. The social commentary, beneath it all, is stirring."},{"Title":"Scar Vegas & Other Stories","review":"One of my favorite short story collections. Lean and powerful and insightful work, turning current affairs (modern war, the environment, corporate America) into compelling stories. It's pitch perfect."},{"Title":"Scar Vegas & Other Stories","review":"\\"Scar Vegas\\" is a solid library pick-up, at the least: an entertaining collection that reads quickly."},{"Title":"Scar Vegas & Other Stories","review":"I respected these stories and Paine's geopolitical stance more than I embraced the stories themselves. He's a talented, hard-working writer. But I found myself not connecting nor loving these stories as much as I knew I ought to. They weren't hair-raising as Denis Johnson nor beautiful and inspiring as Alice Munro or wicked little slices of life like a William Trevor or Updike. I found them to be rather dry as a matter of fact. Perhaps I'll pick it up again, later, but for now, it's on to other things."},{"Title":"Scar Vegas & Other Stories","review":"Gosh, this is really lively work. Which in this instance should be read as a synonym for \\"labored.\\" If you'd like a roadmap, or blueprint, or whatever figure of speech pleases you, of everything wrong with a ritzy diploma mill like Columbia's MFA program in creative writing, pick this up.

We read our copy again and again as well when he was five. Then into 6 and 7 it still comes out many times as we cycle back through his great interest in flying. We like the introduction to the 'greats' that contributed to flying. We loved seeing the planes we'd read about in the Smithsonian and knowing their stroies. We loved that this was a jumping point for further study. We love this book."},{"Title":"The 7 Irrefutable Rules of Small Business Growth","review":"Perhaps Covey is to be blamed for the fact that so many authors of business books treat the number seven as sacrosanct. The \\"rules\\" which Little offers in this volume could well have been 11 or 21...if not more. All are essential to business success. For example, \\"Establish and maintain a strong sense of purpose\\" (#1) and \\"Attract and keep the best and brightest\\" (#6). No news there. The great value of this book is derived from what Little has to say about each rule and, more importantly, HOW and WHY all seven are interdependent. At this point, it may be of interest to share information cited by Michael Gerber in his recently published E-Myth Mastery: \\"Of the 1 million U.S. small businesses started this year [2005], more than 80% of them will be out of business within 5 years and 96% will have closed their doors before their 10th birthday.\\" Opinions vary as to the percentages as well as to the reasons for such extensive failure. However, the fact remains that a substantial majority of small businesses will fail eventually.Now consider the following remarks with which Jack Welch explains why he admires entrepreneurial companies: \\"For one, they communicate better. Without the din and prattle of bureaucracy, people listen as well as talk; and since there are fewer of them they generally know and understand each other. Second, small companies move faster. They know the penalties for hesitation in the marketplace. Third, in small companies, with fewer layers and less camouflage, the leaders show up very clearly on the screen. Their performance and its impact are clear to everyone. And, finally, smaller companies waste less. They spend less time in endless reviews and approvals and politics and paper drills. They have fewer people; therefore they can only do the important things. Their people are free to direct their energy and attention toward the marketplace rather than fighting bureaucracy.\\"In this volume, Little suggests strategies and tactics to achieve and sustain many of the competitive advantages to which Welch refers. His tone is personal, indeed conversational, and he thereby establishes a direct rapport with his reader; moreover, he anchors his observations and recommendations within a real-world context, mercifully free of theories and hypotheses; also, he addresses how and why as well as what to do; and finally, following his rigorous analysis of each of the seven rules (to each of which he devotes a separate chapter), Little then provides a suggested Next Steps section which reiterates key points concerning implementation. I also appreciate Little's inclusion of hundreds of personal anecdotes which add some seasoning to an already lively narrative. This book offers a practical, cohesive, comprehensive, and cost-effective program by which all organizations (regardless of size or nature) can achieve and then sustain profitable growth. It will be of greatest interest to decision-makers in smaller organizations...and perhaps to decision-makers in larger organizations which have lost their entrepreneurial spirit."},{"Title":"The 7 Irrefutable Rules of Small Business Growth","review":"I'm a SCORE counselor and the mission of SCORE is to help wanta-be entrepreneurs and actual small business owners either successfully start a business or maintain/grow an existing business. Typically \\"clients\\" come in to the face-to-face counseling sessions with questions, lots of questions. If the client is a wanta-be entrepreneur, then one of my first questions is: Have you written a business plan? If the client is a small business owner and having problems or is interested in growth, then one of my first questions is: How does this relate to your business plan? Interestingly, both types of clients usually answer that they don't have a business plan, or at least they don't have a written business plan.Mr. Little's book covers what I have to tell my SCORE clients when they tell me they don't have a business plan or don't use a business plan. It sure would be nice if I could just hand the clients Little's book and call it an evening. However, the clients probably prefer to hear it from me verbally instead of having to read it first.Wanta-be entrepreneurs and actual small business owners must:1. Establish and maintain a strong sense of purpose behind their idea or business2. Research, analyze and fully understand the industry in which their business operates and the market in which it serves and competes3. Write a sound business plan, and use it to operate the business4. Be customer-centric, i.e. stay in touch with the customers, their wants and their needs5. Systematize operations, planning, and use technology whenever possible6. Build a team of good people to run the business7. Be something of a visionary so the business can prosper (everything gets old that stays the same for long)By getting this book and reading it you will see the importance of writing a sound business plan and using it to manage and grow a successful small business. The \\"rules\\" mentioned are supported by real-world stories and provide insight into what makes business work. This book is an invaluable resource for anyone involved in small business strategy. A must read! Get it, and prosper.I'm not so sure the appendix material was relevant or necessary. I can't say I would have liked the book better without it, but I saw no point in including it. There is a fair amount written about personality types, and which personalities are more included to be entrepreneurs versus being W-2 employees. I think it is a shame that stereotypes are created since those classifications seem to keep many people from ever trying to be an entrepreneur."},{"Title":"The 7 Irrefutable Rules of Small Business Growth","review":"I saw Steve speak at an industry trade show recently and came away with plenty of information I could use right away.

Even though the book attempts to narrow it's readership to those already planning on growing an existing business I feel there is enough wisdom in here for people who don't have a business, but are planning on one. This book relies on the authors experiences as well as interviews with other successful business owners and because of this Little is able to distill a lot of information into 7 key points. Many of these points are not unique to this book, in fact if you do a lot of reading many of them might sound familar. However, what this book does is compile them into one volume.

Truth to be told, I plan to buy this book even though I have already read it, due to the fact that it is the kind of book you just want to have. This book includes several essays and articles written by J. H. H. Weiler on European integration, from different points of view. That variety can be seen simply by reading the titles of some of the essays in this book, for example \\"The transformation of Europe\\", \\"Introduction: the reformation of European constitutionalism\\", \\"European democracy and its critics: polity and system\\" and \\"To be an European citizen: Eros and civilization\\".Those essays were written by the author during a period of 10 years, and were finally revised, updated (when it was necessary) and compiled in this book, released in 1999. According to Weiler, he considered rewriting all these essays into a monograph, but settled on keeping their format in order to allow the reader to choose exactly what he wanted to read, according to his interests and available time. In Weiler's own words, \\"I expect that no one will read all the essays and articles in this book- not even my own doctoral students. But I do hope that many more will read some of its essays and articles that would be the case if this were a scholarly monograph of equal size\\".I specially liked the fact that every chapter (that is, each individual essay) can be read as a standalone, because I think that allows everybody to choose exactly where to begin reading this book, and gives the opportunity of not reading something if the theme isn't particularly appealing. Despite that, if you start this book because you are interested in one particular chapter, it is highly likely you will end up reading at least some of the others, as the writer's engaging writing style will tempt you to go on reading. Also, and from the point of view of a non-native English speaker (my case), it is a pleasure to read something that is so well-written...All in all I can say that all these essays and articles are highly interesting, and allow the reader to learn something more about European integration, as a process, an ideal and a reality everybody has to deal with. In my opinion, this book somehow manages to tackle quite well both the structure and ends of European Integration, and that is no easy task. Whether you are a student or someone who is just interested in the subject, I recommend this book as great reading material that allows you to read exactly what you find interesting and at your own pace.Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Power Persuasion: Using Hypnotic Influence in Life, Love and Business","review":"I am utterly amazed. Much of this book is just a rewrite of Unlimited Power by Tony Robbins therefore other than as a quick recap on NLP, I see little use for it.

He's culled an amazing amount of persusaive data from the best of NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) and condensed it into this jam packed book! And what's more you don't have to have any knowledge of NLP to be able to use it! If you've wanted to delve into the \\"secrets\\" of NLP's Rapport and Persuasive speaking but were put off by the sheer complexity of the NLP jargon - or the ridiculous amounts of money the NLP Gurus charge to learn this, then this book will seem like a God send to you!From page one, you're taught how to use rapport & once you master that, David takes you on thru Meta patterns of language on thru the covert Military patterns onto the infamous \\"Sleight-of-Mouth\\" patterns.Whether you're in sales, persusasive speaking or just want to get a leg up on your competition, this book will definitely help IF you take the time to read it and then APPLY it to your own situation. I found if I took the material David presents and overlay it onto the script I normally use, I found places where I could beef up what I was saying using these patterns.Many of the NLP gurus out there want to bankrupt you to learn their methods and then say that your results will justify the expense. David's material in this book is heavyweight & packs just as much punch as the other \\"gurus\\" running around charging thousands of dollars for.And if you're in sales, like I am, I highly recommend using the Military Linguistic Patterns with the standard objects you get.

R. Barron and Danek S. Kaus. Barron is a communication and persuasive expert trained in Hypnosis, Neuro Linguistic Programming, and Social Influence. Kaus is a former clinical hypnotist. He has trained doctors and nurses on how to use hypnotic medical techniques. Both authors apply their expertise into this book. They give you the techniques that you need to use to influence, friends, loved ones and business associates. They say that this book will \\"Give you the tools to help make your dreams come true.\\"Persuasion is defined as, \\"that seemingly magical ability to influence other people and yourself.\\" The techniques offered here will give you a better understanding of how the mind works. Whether or not using these techniques is right or wrong is based upon your intentions of why you are using them. The authors do not recommend that you use these techniques for improper purposes. The goal is to do good for oneself and the other party involved.Every chapter offers exercises to assist you with perfecting each technique. These are not skills which will be acquired overnight. The exercises are very interesting and seem fun. The goal of this practicing these techniques is to have fun and maintain your sense of humor. You will also need to set specific goals so that you will know exactly what you want. You will improve on your body language and conversation skills. Some of the techniques for these skills are derived from Neuro Linguistic Programming. These techniques will also help prevent miscommunication.I found this book to be very interesting and easy to understand. I look forward to seeing how well I progress as I practice the exercises. To progress, I will be reading \\"Power Persuasion\\" many times. I see it as an invaluable tool for improving on my communication skills with others. The techniques presented including mirroring and matching will help in my communicating with people that have limited English skills. I encounter these people daily. In addition to becoming an expert at persuading others, I also feel that I will be able to recognize when others are using these techniques on me. All things considered, I highly recommend this book.Received book free of charge."},{"Title":"Power Persuasion: Using Hypnotic Influence in Life, Love and Business","review":"that David Barron has some excellent audio and video products.

Two of the main charcters from the first book return and the story begins soon after the concluding events of the first book. While still entertaining, this one tended to drag through the middle third of the book.The story opens with another excellent fight scene involving the main character of the series - Sunbright Steelshanks. His newfound ally from the first book, the sorceror Candlemas, also returns and aids Sunbright. After the initial discovery of a shooting star, the heroes are transferred to a different time. The book begins to drag when the heroes are separated.New allies are found, there are plenty of sword fights, and the story starts to pick up again at the beginning of the final third of the book. There's a big buildup to the finale which is well-written (involves a character trying to achieve god status), but it is a bit short. The book is still recommended as long as you read the first book beforehand."},{"Title":"Dangerous Games (Forgotten Realms: Arcane Age series, Book 2)","review":"Dangerous Games is the second book in the Netheril Trilogy set in the region of the Anauroch Desert in Faerun's North thousands of years in the past when the inhospitable desert was covered by lush forests and green fields, all part of the mighty Netheril Empire. The book deals with the ongoing adventures of Sunbright, a northern barbarian, who finds himself sent three and half centuries into the future at the exact time of the fall of the great Netheril Empire.Clayton Emery continues to do a wonderful job of presenting essential knowledge relevant to Faerun, including customs, religion (especially the mention of Tempus' predecessor: \\"...like the arrow of Targus, God of War,\\" (p.288) and Mystra's predecessor: \\"Mystryl, Lady of Mysteries, Mother of all Magic. Mystryl was the goddess of lovers, and the poor, and those in dire strife\\" (p.218)), and the history of the peoples of Toril.Clayton Emery's description of the battle between the two cities of Ioulaum and Karsus was breathtaking: \\"Screams. A charred smell of scorched flesh filled the air, an autumnal whiff of burning leaves. There was nothing to see, but soldiers died where they clustered. Barely visible heat ripples ticked the air as men and women felt their clothes, their skin and hair, ignite. Painted K's on their breastplates curled and smoked, then each person became a ball of writhing flame, then a melting pool of blackened fat.\\" (p.237) Moreover, the author depicts the chaotic neutral alignment, through the archwizard Karsus, superbly just as he had done in Sword Play with Sysquemalyn's chaotic evil alignment; again, probably the best depiction I have seen to-date. In addition, Clayton Emery does a magnificent job in Chapters 21 and 22 of describing Karsus' attempt to challenge the goddess Mystryl, and then describing Mystryl's ultimate sacrifice in the latter (and final) chapter. On pages 85 and 130 respectively, the author provides more exceptional descriptions that help plane shift the reader to Faerun, beside Sunbright and his companions: \\"... poor Baron Onan. He was disemboweled and strangled with his own guts. Hung from the bedpost,\\" and \\"Seeing his mistake, the guard let go of his weapon. Too late. Harvester slammed into his belly, bowling the man back and spilling his guts.\\" As for the graphic descriptions found throughout the book, and especially the torture scenes on pages 216-217 they are extraordinary indeed, while Chapter 13 provides for great battle scenes versus assassins: \\"Harvester of Blood split the assassin's guts and rocketed out his back,\\" (p.182) \\"Howling, he slammed Harvester overhand and smashed it down on her shoulder, splitting her back to expose white ribs, and knocking her sprawling,\\" (p.183) and \\"Sunbright's sword slammed her across the midriff, cutting her to the spine. The warrior heaved the heavy trunk off his blade and the assassin in two halves.\\" (p.184) Moreover, the author continues to convey Netheril's pure decadence and corruption, through Chapter 5 especially: \\"There was no end to the corruption of the empire, he saw. It was built on the bones of the unjustly-treated dead, and the hunched backs of the dying living,\\" (p.73) while page 86 in particular provides for a great summary of the Neth Emprire's woes/ills. Furthermore, the author speaks truthfully when stating that: \\"... plump women hated skinny ones worse than poison.\\" (p.210)On the down side, the battle against the beetles with which Dangerous Games started was not that interesting and should not have been at all challenging, especially following Sunbright's previous venture into the Nine Hells (!) in Sword Play. Moreover, when Sunbright saw Knucklebones' \\"milky white eye\\" and thought it looked \\"familiar,\\" the author did not provide any follow up, just like we never learned Greenwillow's background story in Sword Play; subsequently, the reader is just left hanging (again). An additional question that arises is in regards to Candlemas' dramatic change of personality from one who is majorly into his chambermaids (even twelve year old girls) and takes part in wagers with chaotic evil wizards to falling for the comely middle aged woman without him or us really knowing how or why?Overall the plot is not as enticing as in Sword Play, however, the author's wonderful style of writing and the novel's great historical value make it a must-read for Forgotten Realms fans; looking forward to the final installment: Mortal Consequences. 4.5 Stars"},{"Title":"Dangerous Games (Forgotten Realms: Arcane Age series, Book 2)","review":"Good writer that has played the game, excellant combination.

The 14-point type made her feel like she was getting baby talk, and the clothing/wine tips were gimmicky.Well, yeah, but although the clothing/wine tips seem silly at times, theadvice is mostly good. On 11-12 the authors point out that grape variety is a more consistent guide than European blend-names like Bordeaux and Chianti but fail to note that grape-variety labeled wines (like Sangiovese) in the USA and most other places need contain only 75% of the variety on the label (while Italian Chianti must be at least 90% Sangiovese).The book is aimed at novices, and the comments about using untinted or etched wine glasses are right on the money. Still, why Riedel?

There is, however, a disadvantage to this portable Poe; namely, it's not all there. The collection excludes the story for which Poe is credited for having begun the detective genre itself: \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\" introduces the characters of Dupin and our narrator, and prepares the scene for the detective figure to fill the gap of reasoning that the overly-methodical Parisian police have left. It sets the tone for the increased emphasis on analysis in \\"Marie Rogt\\" and the humorous rivalry between police and detective in \\"The Purloined Letter.\\" That being said, the other stories fit well together; \\"The Oblong Box\\" has one foot in the detective genre and the other in that species of psychological drama that we see in \\"William Wilson.\\" Wilson and his doppelganger compliment the double corpse question in \\"Marie Rogt,\\" and the parallel worlds and coincidences, which make the mystery of Marie Rogt more fascinating, lend an uncanny quality to \\"MS Found in a Bottle,\\" with the discovery of Mercator's map.

A Very Dangerous Citizen documents in detail Polonsky's participation in socialist causes -- as well as his other public activities -- that ultimately led to his head-on collision with the U.S. government during the Red Scare of the late 1940s and 1950s. The list of Americans who have been labeled &quot;a very dangerous citizen&quot; on the floor of the United States Congress is a short one, and Polonsky earned that label due to his membership in the Office of Strategic Services during World War II.Authors Paul Buhle and Dave Wagner have studied the blacklist extensively -- Buhle as the co-author of Tender Comrades: A Backstory of the Hollywood Blacklist and Wagner as the political reporter for the Arizona Republic. Together they have produced a thorough if somewhat clinical study of the American Communist movement through the life of one of its staunchest advocates.The book begins slowly, as the authors devote several chapters to setting the stage for Polonsky's great triumphs in Hollywood by examining his past and the shaping influences in his life. While good biographic work, these scene-setting passages slow down the overall narrative to the point of distraction until the narrative arrives at Polonsky's best-known works, Body and Soul and Force of Evil.These films, produced in 1947 and 1948, respectively, are the primary reason Polonsky is remembered today. Here, the parallels between his work and his politics are clearly defined. Body and Soul, considered the standard bearer for later boxing films such as Raging Bull, establishes the postwar persona of John Garfield (also a later blacklistee) and presents a full-blown condemnation of the system that compromises an individual's morality. Force of Evil, also with John Garfield, is a noir classic that takes the next step in exposing how American society breeds those who would operate beneath the law. In each case, Garfield's character embodies values that Americans of the period would find both reprehensible and admirable. Buhle and Wagner dissect the scripts and the production value of these films in their attempt to get into Polonsky's head, and are extremely competent in their analysis.Once Polonsky is blacklisted, there isn't too much left to tell. His acerbic condemnation of those who perpetrated the blacklist as well as the popularity of his films overseas served to keep him active, but his later films were mere curiosities, known more for their creator than their content. This is not to say that Buhle and Wagner don't have fodder to continue their thesis. Indeed, they follow Polonsky through the '50s and his later return to Hollywood to work with newer stars like Robert Redford. Unfortunately, beyond his two great masterworks, Polonsky was no longer regarded as a pioneering voice in cinema, but rather as a historical curiosity.To those who don't possess at least a moderate interest in the history of American cinema and Hollywood, A Very Dangerous Citizen can read like a doctoral thesis. In the end it is interesting purely for the fact that its chosen subject matter was a man who led a mythic, almost clich&eacute;d, struggle for his art and beliefs. Polonsky himself tried to tell his story with the original screenplay for the film Guilty By Suspicion. Surprisingly, or perhaps not so, Buhle and Wagner demonstrate how Guilty By Suspicion in its final form is nothing like Polonsky's vision. Given his radical activities, they make a convincing argument that even a mainstream Hollywood exposition on the blacklist could not measure up with Polonsky's real story, though Buhle and Wagner have done so successfully."},{"Title":"Murder Well-Done (Hemlock Falls Mysteries Ser.)","review":"I love this series. 2 sisters (Meg and Quill) run an Inn in upstate NY.

Walt's starting point is a wide-ranging description of the sources and manifestations of American primacy. Then, in the most insightful part of the book (\\"The Roots of Resentment\\"), he does a superlative job of describing the ways that others see America and why their perceptions differ from how we picture ourselves. The following two chapters discuss the strategies foreign governments employ in their relations with an America that is much more powerful than they are. These strategies fall into two broad categories - opposition and accomodation, each of which is broken down into several sub-categories. In the final chapter, Walt sets forth a foreign policy that he believes would be in our national interest.Neo-Realism In an Era of TerrorismIn my view, Walt has considerable difficulty fitting al Qaeda and other Islamic terror organizations into his conceptual framework. This is probably true for most or all neo-realists. A school of thought that has the balance of power as its foundational principle is ill-equipped to understand a world in which the primary security threat is from transnational, religiously-inspired terrorist groups. For the U.S. or any other country to base a foreign policy on the assumption that al Qaeda will respond to carrots and sticks in the same manner as states would be the height of folly.Many more states are threatened by al Qaeda and/or al Qaeda-inspired terrorism than by aggression from another state. Given the nature of the threat and the unmatched strength of the U.S. military, balance of power theory, if it is to have any validity in the current era, would have to say that other states would have moved into ever-closer relationships with America in the years since 9/11. Except for heightened behind-the-scenes cooperation within the intelligence community, quite the reverse has happened. The counter-argument is that, as has been shown in several public opinion polls, many populations fear U.S. power more than terrorism - even if their governments do not. It would be absurd for America to assign a greater priority to appeasing foreign publics than to eliminating terrorists.If al Qaeda and the like were not part of the equation, Walt's thesis - that the Bush Doctrine, because it has intensified anti-Americanism among peoples and governments, and allies and enemies - would have merit. But, not only is al Qaeda part of the equation, it is the most important part of the equation. Given that there is scant evidence that the policies of the Bush Administration has undermined relationships among intelligence organizations, it is far from clear that altering these policies in a manner that would lessen anti-Americanism would aid in the fight against al Qaeda. There may be - and, in my opinion, there is - a trade-off between improving our relations with foreign governments and our overseas approval ratings, and the efficacy of our efforts to defang the Islamic terrorists.Islamic TerrorismThe most disturbing aspect of Walt's book is that it displays only a superficial understanding of the nature of the threat from Islamic terrorism. He does not mention the jihadis' long-term strategy of re-establishing the Caliphate and shows no evidence of having read Sayyid Qutb and other Islamist authors. Accordingly, he mistakes their tactics for their strategy. Not surprisingly, then, his policy recommendations are ill-conceived and, in my judgment, would facilitate rather than undermine their ability to achieve their objective.As a result of his misperceptions, he believes that U.S. foreign policy, in general, and American support of Israel, in particular, are the root causes of the terrorists' antipathy toward us:\\". . . international terrorists have not attacked the United States or its allies because they are opposed to U.S. values, or even primarily because they are worried about U.S. power. Instead, they have targeted the United States because they oppose its global military presence and the policies that presence is supporting.\\" (p. 87)\\"Although bin Laden is sometimes critical of American culture, his actions throughout his career have been inspired primarily by opposition to the specific policies of particular states . . . Indeed, bin Laden emphasized in October 2004 that he and his followers were not at war against \\"freedom,\\" which is why they did not strike countries like Sweden.\\" (p. 85)\\"U.S. Middle East policy is one of the main reasons why terrorists like Osama bin Laden want to attack the United States . . . Even worse, America's tacit (and, at times, active) support for Israeli expansionism makes bin Laden and his ilk look like prophets and heroes rather than murderous criminals.\\" (p. 234)\\". . . if the United States can portray those who use terrorism as criminals driven largely by a selfish desire for power, then a terrorist campaign is likely to fail.\\" (p. 138)In addition to not appreciating the nature of the threat, he appears to underestimate its severity and potential impact on the U.S. How else can these words be explained?(...)The United NationsWalt is a multilateralist with a high regard for the UN. Commenting on the run-up to the Iraq war, he says that\\"America's opponents [in the Security Council] sought to prevent the use of force in this particular instance, while simultaneously strengthening the authority of the UN system.\\" (p. 146)There is an alternative perspective that I share: by not authorizing the use of force to punish a serial violator of Security Council resolutions, America's opponents weakened the UN, setting it on the same path as the ignominious road followed by the League of Nations.(...)As to winning the War on Terror, he believes that the necessary and seemingly sufficient condition is for the U.S. to lay it on the line with Israel:\\"If the United States wants to win the war on terrorism, it must find a way to reverse the steady deterioration of its standing in this critical part [the Middle East] of the world . . . the United States should use its considerable leverage to bring the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to an end, [which includes pressuring Israel] to withdraw from virtually all territories it occupied in June 1967, in return for full peace. If Israel remains unwilling to grant the Palestinians a viable state . . . the United States should end its economic and military support . . . The United States will still support the continued existence of a Jewish state (the same way that we support a Norwegian state, a Thai state, a Polish state, etc.), and it would be prepared to help if Israel's survival were threatened.\\" (...)"},{"Title":"Taming American Power: The Global Response to U.S. Primacy","review":"I'm going to explain why you should do the environmentally correct thing and not buy this book. To begin, it's pedantic and boring. The author spends several hundred pages explaining why other countries dislike American pre-eminence and how they resist it. Once you've read this, you'll be left with the empty feeling that there's nothing that you couldn't have thought of yourself.So the first four chapters of the book, the why and how, are not worth reading. If you jump to the fifth chapter, you'll see the author's prescription for how to tame American power. He runs through a number of possibilities, but ends up with what he calls offshore balancing. He notes that this has been America's traditional grand strategy. The problem is that the traditional grand strategy left us with September 11th, 2001. I'm not the first to note that the author does not deal well with the threat that became obvious to the U.S. on September 11th.But even his reapplication of the grand strategy is based on false premises. Here's a quote. \\"--- new WMD states will go to great lengths to make sure that their arsenals do not find their way into terrorists' hands. No foreign government is going to give up the weapons they need for deterrence and allow them to be used in ways that would place their own survival at risk.\\" Although not a perfect counterexample, one need only point out the A Q Khan network in Pakistan. Further: \\"Yet the danger that rogue regimes will give away WMD is extremely remote. After incurring all the costs and risks of obtaining these weapons, would any leader either give or sell them to terrorists when he could not control how the terrorist might use them and could not be sure that the transfer would not be detected?\\" What repercussions has Pakistan incurred since the revelations that Khan game away its weapons technology to Libya and North Korea? None! Here's another nugget: \\"Had the Bush administration rejected preventive war in Iraq in March 2003, and chose instead to continue the U.N. mandated inspections process that was then under way, it would have scored a resounding diplomatic victory. The Bush team could claim could have claimed that the threat of U.S. military action had forced Saddam Hussein to resume inspections under new and more intrusive procedures. The U.N. inspectors would have determined that Iraq didn't have any WMD after all.\\" This is utter fantasy; Hussein had rope-a-doped the inspections process for more than a decade. The paragraph within which this is contained contains much more fantasy.Here's another interesting quote from chapter five: \\"The United States should not let its post-9/11 concern for homeland security interfere with the continued flow of foreign students to our colleges and universities.\\" Only someone at a university would be foolish enough to make such a blanket statement.Whether you agree or disagree with current American policy, this book is not worth your time or your dollars."},{"Title":"Taming American Power: The Global Response to U.S. Primacy","review":"The argument here is laid down as follows:1) America is the dominant power and it is spreading its wings around the world. The world is angry about this and hates America.2) In order to appease the world America must change its policies to become more like the world.The recipe here is like those in the 1930s who argued for appeasement based on the false assumption that democracy was dying and that Bolshevism and Nazism were the only alternatives, and Nazism would triumph and therefore should be first 'understood' and then appeased.In this book a standard academic argues that we must appease the world, that we must seek to 'understand' genocide and the Sudan and that America must therefore never oppose genocide because those who commit genocide might hate America, instead America must appease all reactionary genocidal regimes that suppress human rights, from North Korea, to Iran to Sudan.Terrorists hate America therefore America must learn from the terrorists and invite them to craft American policy so that it is in line with their goals. America must never defend freedom and minorities because that is unpopular, instead America should side with the majority, even if the majority is set upon world conquest and the killing of all Americans. In short this is a recipe for national suicide. American policy was not popular with Adolf Hitler or Josef Stalin, and apparently not with Osama Bin Laden. The ideas presented here is that America should have been more understanding of these monsters and that America should have crafter her policy to be in line with whatever the world majority believes. Thus if the world is for bringing back slavery then America should support slavery. If the world is for genocide, then genocide must be the policy. An extraordinary argument, showing that we have apparently learned nothing from history. History should have taught us the opposite, namely that the minority has generally been correct, that the world worshipped Nazism and Communism, and that the world was wrong. America was right to oppose these mass manifestations of national hatred.A sad critique.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"Taming American Power: The Global Response to U.S. Primacy","review":"One reviewer of this book said that this book was a \\"recipe for appeasement\\" and that were the world to recommend genocide, or a return to slavery, that this book would imply that this ought to be America's policy! Well, is that reviewer right about this book?After reading the book, I think the reviewer is right.The author makes the point that opponents of the United States try to delegitimize us. He's right; they do. But the response to this ought to be to do what is best, not to appease our enemies. Appeasement generally makes matters worse for everyone. I think if we have the ability to support truth, justice, human rights, peace, and prosperity, we ought to do so, even if it may sometimes mean battling thugs and tyrants.The portion of this book that I'm best able to judge is about Israel. I'm a Pagan and a Zionist. And the author does a bad job of describing America's informal alliance with Israel. He somewhat exaggerates the strength of the Israeli lobby here, and in addition, he makes it appear somewhat sinister, as if it were causing America to support policies that are against our own interests. In fact, it is very difficult for small nations to convince us to act against our interests. It is far easier for small nations to agree to do what we say (in an attempt to become or remain our allies) or for small nations to benefit from getting our support when America's enemies attack them.Yes, the Israeli lobby has done well, but the main reason for this is that it has an excellent product to sell! Israel is a nation which is being attacked by some reactionary and racist thugs and tyrants. The nation most slandered by the United Nations and the international community is Israel. No wonder plenty of decent people find it easy to support it. The Israeli lobby isn't needed to convince most American opponents of all this slander and aggression. Walt does not mention any of this, of course.There is a big difference between being in favor of human rights for all and supporting all policies of the State of Israel. Walt certainly agrees. But he implies that American Zionists tend to support the latter, not the former. And that's not true at all. There's plenty of opposition by Zionists to specific Israeli policies, and it is an anti-Zionist untruth to say that one can't object to Israeli government policies without running afoul of the Zionist lobby. Such excuses are often used by those who deny Israel's right to exist (presumably in order to deny human rights to Levantine Jews) and then try to say that they merely disagree with some policies of the Israeli government. In addition, Walt fails to discuss the extent to which some American Jews disagree not only with Israeli policies, but even with the idea that Israeli Jews ought not be denied human rights.Walt implies that Israel wants \\"to impose an unjust solution unilaterally\\" to its dispute with the Arabs. That's ridiculous. If there is peace, Israel wins: it gets to stay on the map and prosper on land it is making excellent use of. That's why Israel is willing to put up with a solution which cheats the Jews out of land they would otherwise be entitled to keep or purchase. It is anything but unjust to the Arabs to let Israel have less than its fair share of land! Or to allow human rights for all the people of the region!The author also comes up with the taunt that denying Arabs \\"their legitimate political rights has not made Israel safer.\\" That's outrageous. There is no legitimate right to dissolve a neighboring nation and get rid of the human rights of its people. And it does not make one \\"safer\\" to agree to get rid of one's human rights, quite the contrary. He's simply blaming Israel for the aggression and slander against it.At one point, Walt even asks \\"why should other Arabs believe that the United States is committed to freedom when its money and power are used to deny these rights to millions\\" of Levantine Arabs. Well, I think that there are plenty of flaws with American foreign policy. However, in my opinion, we deserve quite a bit of praise for supporting human rights in the Levant. We could do better. But if we take the author's advice, we'll be doing much, much worse.I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Taming American Power: The Global Response to U.S. Primacy","review":"Walt is a long-time proponent of Realism in international relations, publishing especially in the journal International Relations. This is his latest brief for U.S. foreign policy, and not only is it a rebuke of the Bush Administration's disastrous war on Iraq, \\"GWOT,\\" and \\"preemptive war doctrine,\\" which of course is really *preventive*, offensive war, but it outlines a more sensible course of action -- a strategy based on Realist principles.The bulk of the book examines how the rest of the world is actually responding to U.S. primacy, and why, from the eminently logical point of view that countries pursue their own interests, not ours. Walt looks at examples of the whole range of possibilities, from balancing (including asymmetric strategies), to \\"balking\\" (footdragging), \\"binding\\" (to alliances, institutions and norms), and delegitimation (what we call in sociology a \\"framing\\" strategy), in the cases of Europe, China, Russia, Arab states, and the whole cast of characters on the world stage.Only at the end, based on this primer on Realist analysis, does Walt turn to his eminently sensible prognosis for U.S. foreign policy. He indicts the failed Global Hegemony strategy of the Bush Administration, which has led to active attempts by virtually everyone else to counter the U.S. After a brief survey of the Selective Engagement strategy of the Bush Sr. and Clinton Administrations, he recommends a return to Offshore Balancing, which was U.S. strategy through most of its history, and which Walt says is perfectly suited to this (no doubt temporary) period of U.S. primacy. Offshore Balancing is not isolationism, but it would minimize permanent commitments and bases in places like Europe and Asia where our allies should take up their share of the common burden, and will in their own interest if forced to, according to Realist theory.In lamenting the feckless Bush Administration policies that have put the U.S. in a deep hole in terms of its international standing and alliances, Walt observes that the U.S. is \\"a remarkably immature Great Power,\\" and that \\"Americans remain remarkably ignorant of the world\\" (p. 245). In contrast to the spate of immature, ignorant books currently flooding the market, calling for a global War on Islam, among other amazing hare-brained ideas, TAMING AMERICAN POWER is a refreshing voice of sanity."},{"Title":"Taming American Power: The Global Response to U.S. Primacy","review":"Ask folks outside the US if there is something wrong with it and what that is, and chances are that you'll get a good many little piece of the big puzzle characterizing the relationship between the US and the World. Since the \\"mission accomplished\\" moment, similar pieces have made it in the US media taxonomy, as high up as editorials. It is the merit of Stephen Walt's, to have been gathered a lot of little pieces in a framework that would capture the situation like this: 1) Why other states fear the US primacy? 2) What strategies can states pursue in response to US primacy? 3) What can the US do about #2? If not much can be debated about points #1 and #2 in Walt's framework, point #3 comes along the lines of a growing conversation meant to supplant the neocon doctrine, as the latter one loses steam by the day.It should be briefly noted that the answer to point #3 had preoccupied the US foreign policy makers even before the neocon doctrine - recall Clinton's 'indispensable nation.'The relative novelty Professor Walt brings into consideration, when looking for answers to point #3, is the need for openness and public debate about the activity of political lobbies - especially those steering the US foreign policy. Michael Scheuer might have been the first one, in this round, to raise awareness about political lobbies as factor influencing the US foreign policy. However, it is only now that we have a proposal on how to deal with the shortcomings of what, Walt reminds us, is a fundamental feature of the American democracy - interest groups. It should also be added that, in a recent report on overall nations' business competitiveness, released by The World Economic Forum, the US occupies only the second place due also to the perceived negative influence of business lobbies on government policy. So, here we have a complementary instance where interest groups, the same ones Tocqueville was first to write about, are exacting their price on the American system.I would sum up the value of this book in terms of: (a) Taking a snapshot of the world's perception of the US through the lens of the American foreign policy; (b) Building a framework of the relationships between the US and the other nations; (c) Bringing to public attention several prescriptions for maintaining US primacy while addressing (some of) the world's concerns. As for Walt's prescriptions for US foreign policy, the part of the book that's open widest to debate, only time will tell what and how. Somehow, I have a feeling, the next executive is taking notice.For those still undecided customers, have a look at \\"Taming American Power,\\" an article the author published in Sept/Oct issue of Foreign Affairs."},{"Title":"Taming American Power: The Global Response to U.S. Primacy","review":"A new genre of foreign policy writers is emerging in the United States. They are called \\"realists\\", but defining the term defies precision. Following the \\"neo-con\\" works extolling the idea of the US flexing its military and economic might came the \\"soft power\\" advocates. The latter declared that overbearing foreign policies were counterproductive. Power must be curbed or withdrawn in favour of more conciliatory policies, preferably multilaterally decided and applied. Stephen Walt's approach is a middle ground, without being conciliatory to either of the previous stances.Walt opens with a summary of all the aspects of might available to the USA. This is the foundation of the \\"realist\\" genre - the power is there and Walt catalogues it nicely. The USA is at once the strongest power militarily and economically, influencing many by sheer presence. It has far outstripped whatever competition it might have had. A military defeat is out of the question and even economic challengers can only hope to share, not dominate, markets. The collapse of the Soviet Union left the USA in the role of world primacy. That unique position has led other nations to view such solitary might with distrust and resentment. Walt explains brilliantly why these countries are suspicious. Any nation confronted with such prowess will naturally be wary. He generally avoids value judgements in the depiction, but he notes how poorly informed the leaders and general populace of the USA are about the resentment. How other nations do and should react becomes the theme of most of Walt's remaining chapters.Once he's described what he calls \\"the roots of resentment\\", Walt describes the reactions by nations uncomfortable with the USA's \\"primacy\\". He lists various \\"strategies of opposition\\" and \\"accommodation\\". Opposition to such prowess must range across many options. Can it be direct? Walt shows how resistance to US demands might depend on the severity of the issue, whether other distractions command greater attention or whether the resistance might reach across more than one nation. Excessive power is a fine tool for forging opposition alliances. Where open and direct alliances may be lacking or impractical, various forms of \\"balancing\\" may be established to offset US hegemony. The most extreme form of \\"balancing\\" is the terror attack, but many other methods are available, from \\"balking\\" to blackmail. It's important to note that with a single power to contend with, continuous or sustained tactics to counter US strength are unlikely. There will be shifts and rearrangements until new balances are struck. Pejorative references to \\"Old\\" and \\"New\\" Europe, for example, are counterproductive. They only serve to demonstrate inflexibility and increase disaffection toward the US leadership.Where direct opposition to US hegemony fails or is impractical, there are various forms of accommodation that may be adopted. Understanding that each nation has its own interests to follow, \\"accommodation\\" is a term of wide and flexible definition. One strategy is to call in the \\"debts\\" of past cooperation. That may lead to modification of the original demands by the US. \\"Bandwagoning\\" is Walt's term for a nation agreeing to a US policy, but with an eye to later possible challenges. It's a rare tactic, but one used effectively in the proper circumstances. \\"Regional balancing\\" is another form of manoeuvering. It was used successfully during the Cold War, and lingers in some of today's national alignments. A more blatant form of accommodation is the use of \\"penetration\\" of domestic politics. Here, Walt treads on shaky ground as he depicts the extensive lobby groups run by Israel and India. These forces have gone beyond seeking accommodation to actually guide US policy-making. His recommendation to banish these groups as inimical to US long-term interests will certainly lead to protest by vested interests. Walt further recommends the blatant and unhindered support of Israel in the Middle East is causing more problems than benefits. The US should cut Israel loose and strive to broker a new arrangement based on the establishment of a Palestinian nation.Walt stresses a point often lost in discussions of US power and policy. It is a mistake, he notes, to think other nations resent or \\"hate\\" the people of the US. Except through the leaders they elect, the people of the US aren't held accountable for mistaken policies. The failures of successive administrations are regrettable, but the peoples of other nations generally accept the foundation of \\"good intentions\\" in US actions. What is needed, Walt suggests, is to prove that good intentions work. This can be accomplished by the US using its might with circumspection. \\"Offshore balancing\\", the solving of problems by negotiation with the might of the US present in the background, has been successful and should be applied more often. The present administration has abandoned \\"offshore balancing\\" in favour of a declaration of \\"preventive\\" war against nations it deems unaccommodating. This, in effect, is a declaration of war against the rest of the world. Instead of asserting its power, Walt argues, the US should assume a stance of playing \\"hard to get\\". Other nations should be welcomed in bringing problems to the US instead of the US intruding unilaterally. He calls this approach a \\"mature foreign policy\\".Who will tame this powerful eagle? Chairs and whips are for lions, so something else must be applied. It is the ballot that will curb excess or foolishly applied power. Walt intends this book as a non-partisan prescription for improving the awareness of the US electorate. He notes that many of the problems in international affairs his nation is facing are of recent origin. It isn't too late to employ corrective action, but voters and their representatives must be better informed of the issues and how policies are irritating other nations with which the US must coexist. Read this book and learn where to start.

I can certainly understand their objections: the author provides a very fine overview of how Israel has bonded and penetrated the U.S. Government at all levels including junior staff levels in both Congress and the Executive, and how this, in combination with what I consider to be an unholy alliance with the Christian Zionists (the author names Gary Bauer, Jerry Fallwell, Ralph Reed, Pat Robertson, Tom Delay, and Richard Armey), has shifted U.S. policy between Palestine and Israel from being a balanced peacemaker to unleashing Israel and not holding it accountable. The author is at his best when discussing how to cease our support for Israel if they cannot be sincere in seeking a two-state or shared state solution. The author does not, as far as I could see, discuss the complete failure of the Arab nations to provide support to Palestine where it counts: aid, passports, land rights, etcetera.On balance I was somewhat disappointed. The book is a tour de force at a very high level, but it is rather simplified, primarily state centric, an executive summary of a great deal of the literature, but missing important slices of the broader literature. Nothing here about the ten threats, twelve policies, or eight challengers.The author does well at making the point that it is US actions, not US values, that are the catalyst for attacks, and he is quite explicit in discussing how specific terrorists attacks follow consistently from some specific US action in the Middle East. He lists the problems with US Foreign Policy, including double standards, short attention span, historical amnesia, and ambivalence about respect for international law, but there is not as much substance in this book as in, for example, David Boren's edited book on \\"Preparing American Foreign Policy for the 21st Century\\"--see my review for an 18 point summary--nor is there the fullest possible discussion of grand strategy. The author breaks new ground in defining strategies of opposition and strategies of accommodation (mostly state-centric) but all things being equal, I think Colin Gray's \\"Modern Strategy\\" is better.The author is at pains to state that pro-Israel organizations, but not most American Jews themselves, egged the Administration on toward the elective invasion and occupation of Iraq. He tries very hard to be politically correct, to the point that the scholarship is weakened--note 97 on page 283, for example, avoids stating the obvious and documenting Greg Palast's \\"Best Democracy Monday Can Buy\\" case, i.e. that George Bush stole the Florida election in 2000.The author touches lightly on the reality that you cannot do public diplomacy using dogma and propaganda--it must be based on substance, and he correctly identifies education as the key--something the Broadcasting Board of Governors not only does not understand, but they are actively keeping their head in the sand while the battle rages over where the Open Source Agency will be (in the spy world or in the diplomatic world).Just when I thought the author was going to reach a cresendo, after a review of Joe Nye's soft power ideas, stating that no other state is capable of withstanding the full weight of US power, I ended up with a cream pull. No real discussion of how that full weight can be defined and manifested.See also my reviews of Derek Leebaert's \\"The Fifty Year Wound,\\" Jonathan Schell's \\"Unconquerable World,\\" Chalmers Johnson's \\"Sorrows of Empire,\\" Robert McNamara and James Blight \\"Wilson's Ghost,\\" Tom Hammes \\"The Sling and the Stone,\\" and Mark Hertsgaard's \\"The Eagle's Shadow,\\" among many many other books."},{"Title":"Taming American Power: The Global Response to U.S. Primacy","review":"\\"'Taming American Power' - Why would one like to do that?\\" This seems to be the standard tongue-in-cheek reaction one gets from a fellow American student who has spotted the reviewer reading Stephen Walt's latest book. Granted, it is a bit hard to swallow Walt's line of argument at first. As the author, academic dean of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, himself admits, \\"by virtually any measure, the United States enjoys an asymmetry of power unseen since the emergence of the modern state system.\\" And more than that: It is highly likely that it will remain the most powerful player in the international system for some time to come. So who would go about trying to tie down this omnipotent Gulliver? Walt does a good job in pointing out that reactions from across the world to America's \\"primacy\\" position (the author defines this as \\"being first in order, importance, or authority\\") are often lukewarm at best - large parts of the population in the Middle East, Latin America, Africa, and Asia do as a matter of fact detest everything the United States stands for. And even seemingly close allies in Europe and Asia look like they have lost their (Cold War-) love for Mr. Big.But is it just the \\"rise in the power of [modern-day] Athens and the fear it causes in the world\\" that makes America so unloved at the present moment? According to Walt, who is a neo-realist at heart but doesn't shy away from making use of other theoretical models on the way, the answer to the question of \\"why they hate us\\" is not so much what America stands for, but what it has done in the past, especially ever since the George W. Bush Administration took office in 2001. But his seminal book is more than just one of the many polemics on the current executive. It is a lucid, and often provocative, account of the current problems U.S. public diplomacy faces in the world. It is a profound analysis of the way states deal with American power, something that \\"has become an essential element of statecraft for every country in the world.\\" More importantly, Walt gives clear recommendations for policy action as well, something that is so often missing from comparable works.The author starts by shedding light on how the U.S. got into the position it is recently in. How did the \\"preponderance of power\\" (Melvin Leffler) come about? Walt attributes geography, shrewd diplomacy, but also pure luck for the unique situation America is in now. Starting with the end of the Cold War (here an analysis of earlier developments such as the Spanish-American War might have brought further insights) Walt goes through the development in the growth of U.S. influence and primacy. He then sets out to analyze the difference in perception the United States has of itself and that other states have of it. Americans and their political leaders are quite often ignorant of the fact that their country is not well liked in other parts of the world. Worse than that: On a regular basis, they simply do not care about other states' opinions. Walt considers the various strategies that states use if they indeed intend to oppose U.S. primacy. Balancing (\\"soft balancing\\" with other states or \\"internal balancing\\" on their own), balking (foot-dragging), binding (using norms and institutions), blackmail (threatening to take some undesirable action unless the U.S. offers compensation), and delegitimation (portraying the U.S. as morally bankrupt) are the various means that states put to use, very often in combination with each other and during different time periods. Although theses categories have large explanative value per se, it is however not quite clear whether they really cover the entire spectrum of political action. For example, a state could just refuse to hear what the U.S. has to say, thereby falling under none of the above categories.But what if a state decides to go along with U.S. primacy? According to Walt, it can then either bandwagon (appease), follow a regional balancing strategy (use the U.S. to balance against neighboring states), bond with (establish close personal ties) or try and penetrate American politics (manipulate the U.S. domestic political system). But here, too, other categories seem to exist. A state can for example go along with U.S. policies while at the same time thinking very little of the nation's administration or even its president. The relationship between former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter serves as a prime example.It is at this point that Walt gets to the heart of his controversial reasoning. He lays out an argument against political pressure groups and ethnic lobbyist movements - in itself not necessarily a new argument. Yet although he also talks about the Indian and Armenian lobby groups, his main thrust is directed against the various kinds of Israeli groups such as the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP), and the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA). He blames them for having an undue influence and for pursuing a national interest that is \\"national\\" only in Israeli, not in American terms. Yet his argument about the \\"power of the weak\\" rings a bit hollow and is only thinly veiled by devoting very few pages to the Indian and the Armenian case. Although Walt rightly states that a solution to the problems of the Middle East is essential to \\"win the hearts and minds\\" of the Muslim world and to achieve one of the main objectives of U.S. foreign policy, he walks on thin ice when he makes sweeping statements about the influence of the Israel lobby in the United States such as \\"Israel is the \`gold standard' by which transnational penetration should be judged.\\" Granted, the road for the solution of the Israel-Palestinian problem did not \\"lead through Baghdad\\" - U.S. involvement in Iraq turned into a quagmire situation, as Walt rightly points out. But does it really lead through K Street in Washington, D.C.? This seems hardly likely. Lobbies are influential, especially in the United States, but they surely cannot be the sole explanatory variable for why America has so many problems with public opinion in the world.Bearing these caveats in mind, Walt is at his best when he comes to the actual policy recommendations in the last part of his book. Most importantly, he states, U.S. foreign policy \\"must be molded with [other states'] reactions in mind.\\" Although this might sound like a truism to European ears, it is something that has not always been at the center of the U.S. foreign policy decision making process. There is hope, however: Consulting with allies and taking their opinions into consideration seems to have been taken up by the current U.S. administration recently - just look at the State Department's new efforts in \\"transformational diplomacy\\", increased student exchange and language learning. Walt also makes the important point that the strategy of \\"pre-emption\\" - which really is just another word for \\"preventive war\\" when the Bush administration uses it - must be abolished at earliest convenience if the U.S. doesn't want to ruin relations with the rest of the world in the long run. For large parts of the global public (especially the European part of it), this seems to be a matter of highest urgency.The drawback of Taming American Power is that its analysis is extremely state-centered. It is perfectly alright to view states as the principal actors in international relations, but even the most hard-boiled realists will have to acknowledge that the U.S. will increasingly have to deal with non-state actors such as al-Qaeda in the future. Also, Walt seems to be a bit too sympathetic to John Mearsheimer's theory of \\"offensive Realism\\" to make it fit with his call for a \\"mature U.S. foreign policy\\" that takes the opinions of others into account when pursuing policy goals. It is because of theses inconsistencies that Walt's analysis can only serve as a starting point. But it is a good starting point and leads into the right direction. Therefore, it can be recommended highly."},{"Title":"Taming American Power: The Global Response to U.S. Primacy","review":"As the failures of the \\"Bush Doctrine\\" of preventative war become more obvious by the day, the foreign-policy elite - except for a few neocon holdouts - are already looking to steer foreign policy back towards America's traditional grand strategy - namely, the realist approach. Neocons will argue that the realist approach is no longer viable since 9/11, but as we can see the neocon strategy has had many shortcomings. Proponent of the realist school, Professor Stephen M. Walt has written a very sober analysis of our current situation and points to where we should go from here.After 9/11, the Bush administration conducted foreign policy as if American power was the only thing that counted in the international arena. In responding to this \\"imperial hubris,\\" other countries adopted a variety of strategies to counter this power, strategies ranging from opposition to accomodation. As more and more countries became uncomfortable with American power, they will either try to coalition against it or try to cozy up to it in order to influence it. In either case, the American strategy of \\"global hegemony,\\" as Walt calls it, is not working.The strategy that Walt outlines for America in this book is called \\"offshore balancing.\\" According to Walt, America should only be concerned with the security of regions of vital interest: namely, Europe, the Persian Gulf, and East Asia. This approach recognizes that the US cannot control these areas directly, rather it would partner with friendly local powers. This is not isolationist since the US would also be engaged through international organizations such as the UN, NATO, and the WTO. Also, significantly, this strategy would not seek to impose democracy on other countries. It is basically a strategy of minding our own business and acting less threatening to others.The problems with this strategy are numerous. How do we disarm nuclear proliferation, counter the terrorism of non-state actors, or how do we stop genocide or mass murder? The answer, according to Walt, is through multilateral institutions and regional allies. Not only would this reduce the need for the American military, it would, more importantly, preserve the legitimacy of American actions. This may be troublesome for those who still cherish the unencumbered excercise of American power, but it should not be forgotten - nor mentioned too often - that unilateralism is always an option when our vital interests are threatened. Walt has presented us with a foreign policy that will make us not only more popular, but also more powerful."},{"Title":"Taming American Power: The Global Response to U.S. Primacy","review":"This is simultaneously a very scholarly work and very easy to read. Walt knows his stuff and makes a convincing case. Yet the book's not too complex for the foreign policy layman. US foreign policy over the last 19 years, and especially over the last 7, has been detrimental for the world, and for the US itself. The US acts with the politics of empire, but the rhetoric of aggrieved victim and the holy state. Walt goes through empiracal example and rhetorical points to prove his thesis, and then offers constructive criticism as to how we can change and improve the world we live in. He vividly shows how and why the rest of the world is offended by America. This book is a must read for anyone planning to run for office or steal an election."},{"Title":"Taming American Power: The Global Response to U.S. Primacy","review":"The United States has made some fundamental changes in its foreign policy as a result of the 9/11 attacks. These largely center around the almost unilateral decisions to change the governments of Afghanistan and Iraq. The United States had the power to do this, and exercised that power.It appeared unlikely that the US would get UN approval or a UN based coalition to work together. France and Russia were getting favorable oil pricing from Iraq in exchange for weapons and would likely veto any decision in the Security Council. The addition of numerous Islamic states into the General Assembly. So the decision was made to proceed anyway. It was certainly popular with the American people still operating in great anger after 9/11.Americans tend to believe with an almost religious fervor that our way is best, that the America system (under God) is clearly the way that the world should work. Americans believe that their global actions are benevolent, that the rest of the world is almost child like, and should look up to us as a father.The rest of the world doesn't exactly agree. The Islamic countries look at the US support of Israel and see a contempt for Islam. Europe looks at the US with some alarm. President Bush is often viewed as some kind of pistol packing Texas cowboy.Any book like this is a snapshot of the situation at a given time as seen by one person, the author. He certainly presents an interesting fview of other states worred about US dominance and who are starting to turn their concerns into action.It's an interesting book to read now, and it will be interesting to read in ten years or so to see just how a good a predictor Dr. Walt turns out to be."},{"Title":"Taming American Power: The Global Response to U.S. Primacy","review":"Finally coming to read this book after an outrageously long time, it is very striking that it describes a world in which one can no longer really believe. A financial crisis and two interminable wars later and China is within a few years of overtaking the USA in terms of GDP. The USA had its moment in the Sun and squandered it. But two elections after the end of the reign of the Chimp in Chief and the USA is also no longer the clod-hopping bull in the china shop that we knew in the days of the Rape of Iraq. Obama is just returned to office at the time of writing, states have just voted to terminate the war on drugs, the USA is beaten in Afghanistan and the American public want something done about global warming. The USA looks like a responsible nation again.So this book got almost everything wrong, from one perspective. The USA has not acquired a Thousand Year Reich as the neoconservative \\"intellectuals\\" dreamed, or even a Several Decades Reich, but then, neither is it such a cause for resentment among the rest of us.On the other hand, the book has a scholarly tone and an even thoroughness in its approach such that it still has something to say so long as America remains on or near the top, and even for the next hegemon. No polemic, it simply looks at why power leads to resistance, how that resistance can take form and how it can be worked around. It yields a blueprint for a worthy leader among nations and that blueprint is really not bad. It says, in effect, that to be the hegemon one must behave like a mature nation and earn hegemony, for a bully can always be thwarted. This is not a bad lesson for whomever it comes to be of interest in the future.Time passed the author by and brought a world a little different to his expectations. But then, we all had some surprises. For being mainly wrong with good intentions and careful methods, therefore, a neutral rating."},{"Title":"Taming American Power: The Global Response to U.S. Primacy","review":"There are so many arguments set forth in this book that are poorly researched/argued that it's hard to recommend it on any level.

Volume II did a good job of covering further developments in methodology and distribution theory. However after the two volume were published in 1992 it became apparent that there had been some key omissions and that further developments shed light on the importance of articles that had not been considered breakthrough papers earlier but in hindsight they clearly were. So in 1997 these fine editors published Volume III to fill in the gaps.The earliest paper that was overlooked was Galton's famous 1889 paper that introduced regression, correlation and the phenomena of regression toward the mean. It is clear from reading the book that all the added papers were worthy of the title of breakthrough. Of particular interest to me are the articles that deal with faster computing techniques and computer intensive algorithms that were made practically important as the speed of computers grew astronomically in the 1990s. So the paper by Metropolis et al. 1953 became a breakthrough when another breakthrough paper by Geman and Geman 1984 showed the these Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms were useful in a Bayesian approach to image processing or \\"image restoration.\\" After this breakthrough modifications of the basic algorithms have been developed to solve many of the previously viewed as infeasible problems in Bayesian inference. The practical development of frequency domain times series owes a debt to the fundamental breakthrough paper by Cooley and Tukey in 1965 that introduced the first versions of the fast Fourier transform. I shall skip the others except for two of my favorites, Peter Hall's 1988 paper that established theoretically through the use of Edgeworth and Cornish-Fisher expansions the asymptotic accuracy of various types of bootstrap confidence intervals and the 1986 paper by Liang and Zeger that developed an approach to longitudinal data analysis via generalized linear models. In this remarkable paper they also introduced Generalized Estimating Equations that are commonly used today. this work led to a famous and popular book on longitudinal data analysis that they coauthored with Peter Diggle. The pharmaceutical industry that I work in owes a great debt to Liang and Zeger as their approach to longitudinal (or repeated measures) data has been applied to the efficacy endpoints of phase III clinical trials."},{"Title":"Breakthroughs in Statistics: Volume III (Springer Series in Statistics / Perspectives in Statistics)","review":"Knuth said, garbage in garbage out.

In all honesty, if you don't laugh at the story that sparks the fist fight between Geordie and Danny, you would never have liked this book anyway. I look forward to Laird's next novel.I would take with a grain of salt reviews (such as the booklist review above) that do not understand that the IRA is a Republican organization, and all of the Irish characters in this book are Protestants, and Unionists. That error means they missed one of the interesting things about this book. It is one of the rare instances of a book set, in part, in Northern Ireland told from the Protestant perspective. That is a serious gap in a reviewer's understanding. Ditto all of the \\"lad lit\\" descriptions. Lad mags, at least, are for 20 something kids trying to feel sophisticated.

McLiam Wilson's lyrical brilliance, and the bitter real politik of the dramatist Gary Mitchell, Laird provides a readable addition to the literature of \\"The Armed Peace.\\"Depicting disaffected, drifting Prods in the cultural landscape in which the Catholic nationalists are perceived to have won, his plot largely depends upon generic, predictable tropes--the jaded young London lawyer who has a change of heart that motivates him to sabotage a predatory corporate takeover, and the same jaded young lawyer locked into a bitter (though seemingly arbitrary) oedipal struggle with the firm's senior partner. But the major contrivance is this same lawyer falling in love with the firm's exotic and beautiful young lawyer--first feeling in awe of her, bedding her only to find that she has recently ended an affair with his bete noire senior partner, irrationally and brutally rejecting her, and eventually recognizing his error and reconciling with her. (One wonders and never knows what she sees in this lackluster drudge.) Very ho-hum and predictable.Perhaps the larger disappointment is with how generic the Belfast landscape is. Although Laird is an Ulsterman and chooses the most emotionally charged an dangerous setting for a large section of his novel (the 12th of July!), this lawyer and his love cruise through the Belfast environs without ever seeing a bonfire, a police barricade, an armed standoff complete with watercanons and shockwalls, or any of the threatening mess that tends to mark this week each year. No, this couple motor around the area as if it were a forgetable spring day, and bar-hop through Belfast without seeing a paramilitary roadblock, any of the many shops annually boarded up by its owner in anticipation of the 12th, or even smelling the faint odor from a city full of bonfires."},{"Title":"Utterly Monkey: A Novel (P.S.)","review":"With Nick Laird's novel 'Utterly Monkey', the post-Agreement depiction of Northern Ireland has arrived in print--and it has received the 'Rooney Prize for Irish Literature', the back cover informs me prominently. Its appearance as a paperback, has the addition of a feature I've never seen before in which there's not only background and interviews and two of his similarly prize-winning poems...but the contents of his desk, his most played I-tunes, and \\"Poems Attached by Blue-Tac to the Door of My Study\\" the latter three as of July 4, 2005. Laird's novel follows the dyspeptic detective send-ups of Colin Bateman, the considered meditations of Glenn Patterson--both Northern writers also continuing their explorations of their province as the Troubles subside, and like Robert MacLiam Wilson, he loves shenanigans enmeshing his likable protagonists who seem to take quite a bit from their creators.What distinguishes Laird? First of all, he's over a decade younger than this trio. Born in 1975, by the time he came of age in Cookstown, the worst of the violence had begun to for the most part ease. Like MacLiam Wilson, he went to Cambridge. Unlike his predecessor, he did not drop out--shades of Ripley Bogle--but went on to a year at Harvard and six years practicing law in London. He chucked it all and took up writing. Now, I have to admit, since he's married to Zadie Smith, I'm not sure when this relationship started and how it influenced his decision. Certainly, however the situation, Laird has, like his wife, taken on today's London and, in his case, mixed it with a glance back at his native corner, still struggling to shake off the paras--now using drug moneys to fund their continued grievances and, in this novel, to carry off--on the Twelfth of July 2004--another 'spectacular'.Laird's sketches of his native turf enrich what otherwise succeeds far more on characterisation than plot. While the caper entertained me, and its initial twists kept me up at nights eager to continue while not wanting the book to end too soon, as I kept reading, I began to grow disappointed. Still, I recommend it regardless of its too-pat ending and fluffy denouement. The climactic chase across the Millennium Bridge into the Tate Modern has 'screenplay' written all over it.The people he conjures up, with a couple of notably static ones, mix satire's bite with reality's tang. They do seem only slightly larger than life. While Danny, the main character, seems perhaps too glaringly a stand-in for his harried solicitor-maker, and likewise his stunning black partner, Ellen, may be all too closely drawn from his wife, these comparisons are perhaps inevitable for a first novel. (As a professor once lectured to us, 'all first novels, or first books for that matter, are deep down autobiographical.')But, with Ian, dispatched from 'the Organisation' to force the Crown to pay attention to its spurned suitor now languishing across the Irish Sea, Laird's command falters. There's one scene when Ian wanders about the zoo in Regent's Park that adds nothing but time-killing to the story as it nears its climax. Geordie, the unwitting mate of Danny who has to leave 'Ballyglass' suddenly when he stumbles upon the ill-got stash of 'the Organisation', and his girlfriend Janice do add texture to Laird's depiction of the recent past and the post-1998 Northern younger generation that still finds all too little to gainfully do amidst a changing environment, as the North faces a fast-charging economic invasion by British corporations.Laird's insights, filtered through mainly Danny--who mirrors Laird's own trajectory for the most part--Geordie, and to a lesser extent Janice and Ian, establish the post-Agreement terrain in asides scattered through the novel. Never enough to pontificate, but sufficiently scattered to make 'Utterly Monkey' more than another generic trade paperback mass-market purchase to while away the hours in an airport or on a bus.

The protagonist of Utterly Monkey, Danny Williams, hails from Northern Ireland and works as a dissilusioned lawyer. Like many first novels, this one has more than a smidgin of the autobiographical about it.Danny is 27 affable, handsome and a rising professional. He pursues the gorgeous Ellen, a black trainee in his law firm and seeks respite from the monotony of his job but this is hard when you are plagued by visits from old friends from flintier times in Northern Ireland who tell your would be girlfriend about the time you had intercourse with a girl immediately after she has excreted in an alleyway.Linked in with all this is a complex crime plot revolving around a stolen 50,000 from loyalist terrorists culminating in a car chase through London with an unexploded bomb in a van. A car chase, I ask you - In a modern novel - What's the point of that when film does this thing much better? Utterly Monkey reads like a Guy Ritchie crime caper, but the problem with novels written with one eye on a screenplay is that the writing, in its novelistic vessel, invariably suffers.The novel is high style lad lit. Mixed in with the Nick Hornby style narrative about young man trying to make his way in metropolitan London jungle are some fine phrases.

This is the play that was not filmed, and though it is perhaps the least engaging work in the trilogy, the story does contain one unforgettable twist. \\"Blackout\\" remains my favorite of the plays, and is a story I will cherish forever. Danny and Diane, have come to New York in 1936 to meet a doctor, a specialist. Diane has a mysterious problem that has shaken her sanity and dragged the couple through a crucible of grief, burning away everything but an intense, clear-eyed, and sincere love for each other. In the end, \\"Blackout\\" is story rooted in a very basic relationship, and Gifford packs every line with texture and meaning-a style deeply reminiscent of Faulkner."},{"Title":"Vocal Direction for the Theatre: From Script Analysis to Opening Night","review":"I had the tremendous privilege of having Nan Withers-Wilson as my instructor for courses in both stage dialects and voice and diction. There is absolutely no doubt that Dr. Withers-Wilson is the voice of authority on the role of dialect and vocal coaches in the world of professional theatre. Her experience and knowledge in the field have proven to be invaluable to me, both as an actor and as a dialect coach. Any director utilizing a dialect or extreme vocal work in his or her show, or planning to, would be well served to read this book. Dr. Withers-Wilson does not candy-coat matters, but says it quite plainly: if you anticipate having actors work beyond their natural vocal range, either in dialect work or by moving to extremes of their natural range, you need a vocal coach, and you need to make them an integral part of your production team as early in the process as you can. I can not sing the praises of Dr. Withers-Wilson's experience in this arena highly enough; she has quite literally written the book on the subject, and directors will ignore her expertise at their (and their actors') peril."},{"Title":"Dr. Mortimer and the Aldgate Mystery","review":"In 1890 Dr. James Mortimer is unable to continue practicing medicine following the death of his wife due to diphtheria so he sells his practice. At the urgings of his friend, Dr. John Watson, James moves to London and joins the medical practice of Dr. Ferraby as an associate so as too not dwell on his loss.James' first patient is Lavinia Nancarrow who seems to be a virtual prisoner of her guardian, Archibald Boynton-Leigh. Unable to resist the urge to find out about this unusual arrangement, James begins to investigate what hold Archibald has on the charming Lavinia. However, unlike his good friends Holmes and Watson, sleuthing is a relatively new game for the doctor, who is not prepared for the impossible murder that he feels obligated to solve.DR. MORTIMER AND THE ALDGATE MYSTERY is a wonderful Victorian mystery that brings to life a more ominous and creepy side of London. The story line is very entertaining and the brief appearance of Watson should thrill the Holmes crowd. The mystery is clever, but Mortimer, whose first starring role is a smashing success (see HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES for a secondary role), will bring accolades to Gerald Williams.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Dr. Mortimer and the Aldgate Mystery","review":"As readers of the Canon will recall, Dr. Mortimer brought Sherlock Holmes one of his greatest challenges, the case of The Hound of the Baskervilles.

Both the Fireworks 3 Bible and the Dreamweaver 3 Bible are the standard referance and documentation for these two products. I am not a graphically gifted person, but by using Fireworks and the Fireworks Bible I can easily create impressive graphics, animated buttons, toolbars, java enhanced pages, split images, etc. But I can only do this because the Fireworks Bible easily tells me how to do it.This is one of those books you can browse through and see something and say &quot;oh cool...I need to try that&quot; and it will step you through how to do it. I would recommend this book to both beginners and experts. It's full of examples, and makes a great reference for the Fireworks 3 program. I've been waiting for this to be available from Amazon for months, I was able to put it to good use immediately. Thanks Joseph Lowery...Awesome Job!"},{"Title":"Fireworks 3 Bible (with CD-ROM)","review":"This book is, without a doubt, pretty comprehensive, and I'd also have to say it is pretty much the only good Fireworks 3 book out there as of now.The reason why I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5 was because the organization of some chapters were rather annoying. Around the third or fourth chapter, the author starts exhaustively listing all the menu items and options in the software. For somebody who has never used Fireworks before, it was a little frustrating going through all the available options in Fireworks without having really done anything yet. I was expecting a task-oriented instructional style early on where a task would be defined, and it would be followed by steps on how to achieve the defined task, which, along the way, would have familiarized the user with the menu options. This is not to say that the book does not do this, but I had to skip that chapter that comprehensively listed all the menu options to get there. (Perhaps I should learn to jump from chapter to chapter instead of dogmatically treading the book from cover to cover.)Also, in some areas where a graphic sample was presented, steps were provided on how to accomplish such a graphic output via lassos and marquees. I thought the description on lassos and marquees were pretty good, but I had difficulty understanding how to replicate one of the graphic outputs shown in the book, the one where a man's face was surrounded by concentric circle patterns, even after reading and rereading the paragraphs. Perhaps more illustrations might have helped.Other than these few isolated instances, the book is pretty good, and I would recommend it to people, but just don't expect it to be ever-so-perfect. I think 4 stars describes it well."},{"Title":"Fireworks 3 Bible (with CD-ROM)","review":"With my background being primarily in database and application development, reading the Fireworks 3 Bible was somewhat of a sidestep for me. For quite a while I have been writing ASP pages to serve as front ends to my databases-- all the rollovers and DHTML I used was hand-coded. Though fun, writing such things out manually is anything but speedy. Enter Fireworks! Not only is Fireworks speeding up my development, the work I produce is of a decidedly higher order.The Fireworks 3 Bible is the only serious work out there on Fireworks. Luckily it's a good tech manual. I have hardly any background in graphic design, so I sat down and read this book cover to cover (if you know Photoshop/Illustrator you should be able to skim and pick up just the details you need). It was great to get an overview of vector graphic and image editing-- I feel as if I could pick up other Macromedia/Adobe products and fudge my way through basic designs.I would recommend this book to any web developer. My approach to web development has been completely altered."},{"Title":"Fireworks 3 Bible (with CD-ROM)","review":"Hi,Ok, I wanted to create my own personal web site featuring my college work in the field of engineering.

After a few hours of using FireWorks I could not believe how easy it was to use. I figured the program had to be more powerful, that is when I said hello to Fireworks Bible 3. The book takes you step by step and it is extremely easy to create killer web-ready images! The book also teaches you how to use Fireworks with your scanner. The book, and the software are extremely powerful and extremely affordable. I highly recommend this book if you are thinking, thought, or will think about creating a web page. Five Stars without question."},{"Title":"Fireworks 3 Bible (with CD-ROM)","review":"Macromedia offers yet another incredible product and Lowery offers yet another incredible reference. If you have never used Fireworks first buy the getting started manual: Fireworks 3 for Windows and Macintosh: Visual QuickStart (at a great price here at Amazon). If you are familiar with Fireworks it is well worth its cost (if you value your time at all) to have this excellent reference to find and use all the new and wonderful features in the new version of Fireworks (and believe me, there are plenty of them).I was a long time user of Photoshop and just got Fireworks 2 in the packaged deal with Dreamweaver 2 to simplify some wed design tasks (Javascripting behaviors with images- little coding experience needed). Fireworks 3 has all the web design capabilities, but also does many of the same functions as Photoshop (layers, filters, etc.).Speaking of the Dreamweaver/ Fireworks combo- a great value. ................... If you do any web development- buy it. The Visual Quickstart Guide and Bible are aslo great books for Dreamweaver 3. Lowery also authors the popular Dreamweaver Bible series. This is nice, since the two tools (FW &amp; DW) are also meant to be used so integrally.Good Luck and Enjoy! ;~)"},{"Title":"Fireworks 3 Bible (with CD-ROM)","review":"There is no doubt at all that Lowery not only has the indepth knowledge about the subject but the fact that the fluent,lucid and fantastic manner in which he explains the complete Fireworks subject in nothing short of amazing. Very few computer gurus can teach what they know, I mean teach well, and without doubt Lowery is one of them. If you are knew to fireworks,or at the intermidiate level,this is the book which after reading, you can afford to add the word &quot;GURU&quot; in your title. If you are looking to pick up Fireworks fast,have no time to waste through fat books, EVEN THEN,do NOT miss out this brilliant book.Skimming through section 1 of this book should be enough to help you working efficiently with Fireworks menu and toolbars.I mentioned this point cause I myself was under tremendous pressure from my manager to pick up the Fireworks stuff for the projects,and initialy had opted for the &quot;Firworks fast and easy web development book&quot; so I could immediately pick up the tool.Wrong Choice.I gave up reading that book within 30 minutes of opening the first page.This book guides you thro the steps involved in familiarizing with the Fireworks basics and then moves on to the deeper and extensive stuff which you can do with Fireworks. The first 136 pages are slow and you may feel like throwing away the book.DONT.The real fun starts after the 136 pages provided you have read well upto that part. after 136 pages its nothing short of a high speed Bond movie chase. Each chapters/articles are carefully detailed with enough of juices to drink which would last a lifetime. Basic chapters like &quot;managing color&quot;(in my opinion a very fundamental principle to learn and pick to avoid making amess of your website),'choosing strokes',&quot;composing text&quot; and many more - form the Second section of &quot;Mastering tools&quot;.This section is a beginner's delight. The author then moves on to more advanced sections like &quot;acheiving effects&quot; , programming with fireworks(if you need it), and many more.This is the kind of book you pick up to learn a new subject and then make place for it near your desktop for a lifetime refrence and guidance."},{"Title":"Fireworks 3 Bible (with CD-ROM)","review":"After waiting what seemed like ages for this book, I can say it is definetly worth the wait!

There is lots of good information. It is sometimes overwhelming. There are examples in the book that you just can't follow along with. They give you the completed exercise but why not give you the starting graphics, give you directions and let you create the finished product yourself. I was also disappointed in several chapters on the CD ROM that didn't seem to have the correct files as the chapters in the book. So I decided to go to their web site to see if they had corrections. When I went to the site identified in the book, it was the site for the Fireworks 2 book. The book is an invaluable resource and should be in anyone's collection if they are working with Fireworks 3, but, in my opinion, this is not a 5 star book."},{"Title":"Fireworks 3 Bible (with CD-ROM)","review":"This was a fairly good book. But, I found myself getting lost and confused several times while reading. I have never used Fireworks 3, and I have not used any other sort of graphics design program before. So I am new to graphics design. I found the book to be very helpful but confusing in a couple of chapters. I did have a few problems with the book. The first couple of chapters throw all the menus and tool options at you right off the bat. It kinda blew my mind, and I almost had a melt down! One last thing I didn't like about the book is the constant pointers to using Fireworks with Macintosh. I am ofcourse a Windows user, so I found the constant references to Mac pointless. I will remain a Windows user until the day I die, so I could of done without the references to Mac in the book. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed the book.

There was a good reason those other books were not published in her lifetime. They were the awful attempts of an immature writer. I wish they had stayed hidden so as not to unfairly represent her true talent. Grace probably would have felt the same way. Her repeatedly published books,however, were timeless and were still selling well in the 1960s and even the 1970s.These authors of the past wrote real stories.

Unfortunately his presentation of ideas is not as clear and concise as it might be. He has valid ideas but his dry writing style prevents them from being conveyed effectively. This book is not an easy read.For similar concepts in a more readable format I would recommend &quot;Warfighting&quot; by Hayden, &quot;Maneuver Warfare Anthology&quot; by Hooker, or &quot;Maneuver Warfare Handbook&quot; by Lind. Only after you have read these books will you benefit from reading Leonhard's book.See also Leonhards excellent &quot;Principles of War for the Information Age&quot; which is significant and important (but suffers many of the flaws of this book). I feel that book is a more visionary and unique work by this important authour."},{"Title":"The Art of Maneuver: Maneuver Warfare Theory and Airland Battle","review":"As a non-military person I approached this work with some trepidation, but within pages my fears were erased. This is a superbly written, well thought out book. Leonhard offers, step by step, the history of &quot;maneuver&quot; warfare, and explains how it has been ill applied in American arms. He goes on to provide a doctrine for it's application, and finally critiques the Army's performance in Panama and the Persian Gulf.Leonhard's tactical sense is above reproach, and his explanations are offered in cogent, brief passages. This work is unique in my experience with military theory in that it is both easy to read, and important. Any serious student of military theory/history would do well to read this book to better understand both the past, and the future.Oh, and if you pay careful attention, it just might improve your chess game as well...it did mine!"},{"Title":"The Art of Maneuver: Maneuver Warfare Theory and Airland Battle","review":"Instructors at various training institutions have been trying to educate me in the aspects of &quot;Manouevre Warfare&quot; for nearly ten years now, but it wasn't until I read this book that I began to understand it. The concepts and techniques that Mr Leonhard is trying to get across aren't new or original, as he implicitly states, but the genius he shows is in explaining it all so clearly and then applying it to modern situations. The style of writing was very easy to follow, and the book was, in the main, a joy to read. The more I read, the more the lights came on in my head.While I couldn't say that I am now an expert on this approach to war (or even competent at it), understanding the principles behind it means I can begin to apply and practise them. This book is ideal reading for anyone in the senior lieutenant level, as a primer for the junior staff course(s) in your Army (Although instructors tend to preach manouvre and then practice attrition, it will still help you). It should be required reading for all officers who take their calling seriously, regardless of Corps. If nothing else, it will encourage debate, and that is always a healthy and desirable thing.Highly recommended. I'm only sorry I can't get my own copy."},{"Title":"The Art of Maneuver: Maneuver Warfare Theory and Airland Battle","review":"Leonhard discusses the art of neutralizing your opponent's strengths in detail, with numerous examples and analyses. He discusses three main techniques. Preemption is acting before your opponent expects an attack, catching him by surprise. Dislocation is acting in a way to avoid the enemy's strength, such as David attacking Goliath from out of Goliath's reach. Disruption is finding some critical enemy weakness, such as communications, or some position or assumption that supports morale, and attacking it fiercely. Leonhard explains these clearly and with plenty of examples.Leonhard also provides numerous examples of what not to do, with detailed discussion of why such things are bad ideas. He strongly discourages attrition warfare, since it means we have to be superior in raw strength to prevail in a battle that will be bloody for both sides. He shows why not to engage the enemy when possible, and demonstrates how to seize opportunities to neutralize enemy forces without having to fight them. Most of his bad examples come from current U.S. Army thinking, although some of his good examples come from U.S. Army practice. This is not only a clear discussion of the practice of maneuver in warfare, but a spirited analysis of modern Army doctrine from a firm and understandable viewpoint.The main failing of the book is Leonhard's insistence that maneuver is always the answer, and attrition never is, and his disregard of the dangers of maneuver. It is therefore not suitable as the first, or only, book to read about strategy. It makes an excellent second book, as it is a clear and compelling exposition of military maneuver."},{"Title":"The Art of Maneuver: Maneuver Warfare Theory and Airland Battle","review":"The Art of Maneuver is an excellent work from the commander that we &quot;well trained platoon leaders&quot; affectionately referred to as &quot;The Professor.&quot; This book is as timely now as when it was first published. If we try to gauge our success in Afghanistan (or any war) by counting body bags, we will be doomed to repeat our own history. Instead we must, as Leonhard teaches us, keep the enemy dislocated and operate inside his decision cycle. Excellent advise for officers of today and of the future from a seasoned officer who has studied his craft well."},{"Title":"The Art of Maneuver: Maneuver Warfare Theory and Airland Battle","review":"Robert Leonhard's work, The Art of Manuever:manuever-warfare Theory and Airland Battle, was a good introduction for myself to the theory of manuever-warfare. For some time since the tenth grade through an Army stint and four years of college history classes I was lacking names and theories to what I had been witness to while reading military histories from Caesar's Gallic Wars to Hackworth's About Face. I am thankful to Leonhard for those terms: manuever, attrition and dislocation. An important consideration of manuever-warfare that Leonhard included was the effectiveness of artillery. A weakness that jumped out at me from the start was Leonhard's assertion that Western civilization never practiced Manuever warfare. The author believes that only in the East was manuever-warfare practiced. Immediately Hannibal's sixteen year campaign in Italy during the Second Punic War came to mind. Time and again Hannibal demonstrated classic manuever-warfare as he literally destroyed Roman armies larger than his own. Scipio Africanus answer to Hannibal was to defeat Hannibal with his own understanding of manuever-warfare. Caesar's campaigns in Gaul was another demonstation of manuever warfare in the West. Ironically while praising the Orient for Tsun-Zu's, The Art of War, the only example of war practiced in China taht Leonhard gives is a Chinese General NOT practicing manuever warfare. Leonhard did not convince me that China was the home of manuever-warfare. The U.S. Army was quite smitten with Tsun-Zu during the latter 1980's and one has to wonder if Leonhard was the instigator or a follower of that infatuation. This objection aside this book would be one to include on my bookshelf....Von Mellenthin, (author;Panzer Battles) claims that at towards the end of 1944 onward the Soviets had developed quite a few effective armored-manuever generals. Wehrmacht generals trace Nazi Germany's defeat on the Eastern Front to Hitler's decision to swing the army towards the Caucaus oil fields away from Moscow(not on Soviet attrition warfare.)..."},{"Title":"The Art of Maneuver: Maneuver Warfare Theory and Airland Battle","review":"This book is unique among the maneuver theory books I've read, as it examines seriously Soviet Maneuver doctrine. This examination of how maneuver can be conducted through \\"command push\\" rather than \\"recon pull\\", is enlightening, and provides an excellent complement to the German Maneuver Doctrine which is advanced in most MW literature.He first defines the key terms in maneuver theory (preemption, dislocation, disruption) and then discusses their application throughout history, using the story of David and Goliath to particularly good effect.My only complaint with this book is that it is written not as an academic study of maneuver, but to persuade the US Army to adopt a Maneuver-centric doctrine."},{"Title":"The Art of Maneuver: Maneuver Warfare Theory and Airland Battle","review":"This book is certainly fascinating and well written. But it contains no magic blueprint.On the contrary, like most other diehard maneuver enthusiasts, Mr Leonhard draws VERY selectively upon history to &quot;prove&quot; that the maneuverist approach is essentially the only viable means of prosecuting modern warfare. As a professional, well-published academic historian who specialises in Wehrmacht operations, I can tell you that the Wehrmacht was generally NOT maneuverist and SELDOM permitted the much-vaunted Auftragstaktik. And don't forget that the Wehrmacht got whipped by the attritionalist Soviets.And as for both the German defeat of France in 1940 and the Israelis' marvellous warfighting in 1967 (both hailed by Leonhard as paradigms of maneuverist perfection): oh come on. The battlefields were not two-dimensional, as Leonhard would have us believe from his failure to mention airpower, but three-dimensional. AIRPOWER provided virtually all the preconditions for victory in both 1940 and 1967.I know this stuff is &quot;sexy&quot;, to use modern vernacular, but it's not yet tested. The Gulf War? Gimme a break. If that was maneuver warfare, then why again did it only occur after a 38-day pounding by AIRPOWER, involve virtually no preemption, and provide only average disruption and dislocation? And why was there so little directive control? Etc. etc."},{"Title":"The Art of Maneuver: Maneuver Warfare Theory and Airland Battle","review":"The Art of Maneuver is a good book worth reading. Leonnhard talked about many problems in in the U.S. Army right now, from the way we think to the way we fight. In the second part of the book he talks about the weakness of the U.S. military tactic - air land battle. He pointed out that air land battle could not deal great destruction to the enemy force than we normally expected. It was shockong when I first learned it.But however, Leonhard did not gave the solution to the problems he pointed out, it is a great disapointment to me. Because of that, it made the book more of a list of complains."},{"Title":"The Art of Maneuver: Maneuver Warfare Theory and Airland Battle","review":"This authoritative work shines a harsh light on what is the greatest failing of the modern US Army, namely the poorly conceived and structurally flawed operational doctrine AirLandBattle. AirLandBattle was conceived as a politically expedient approach with which to fight a ground war in West Germany, and by holding to the idea that NATO needed to defend a finite territory against superior numbers, they allowed some very shoddy operational thinking to make its way into official doctrine. The Cold War over, the problems remain. In chapter after chapter, Leonhard provides evidence that the US Army has fallen away from the concepts which make mobile warfare so devastatingly effective, as the emphasis has shifted away from dislocation and winning through maneuver towards the mindless and ultimately pointless strategy of high-tech attrition."},{"Title":"The Art of Maneuver: Maneuver Warfare Theory and Airland Battle","review":"Excellent fresh view of maneuver warfare theory!Leonhard found well the main principles of maneuver warfare.

Even if this is the first book you've ever read on military strategy, you won't be in over your head.

His JIHAD by the way is the True Jihad and if we combine Maneuver Warfare with the ideological dogma of Islam which is &quot;La ilah illallah&quot;, it is actually the career of the Chosen Prophets like Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad and many others.Although Muhammad (peace be upon him) military exploits are largely unknown or distorted in the non-Muslim world, His applied will as a commander can still be felt today and in the future to come. If proper research is done, we will find him to be the Greatest Military Leader of all time.I would be honored to be able to interact with the author and if needed, prove my statement above with Islamic historical literature."},{"Title":"The Art of Maneuver: Maneuver Warfare Theory and Airland Battle","review":"If you are new to maneouvre warfare this is a good starting point. Leonhard synthesises thought and doctrine without making it a result of his personal experience solely - but his personal experience lends caution and credence to the points he raises. I found the book generated an interest to follow up on some of the other authors he mentioned, the historical basis of maneouvre (Napoleon etc). There is not too much jargon and no painful acronyms that stop you in full reading flow. I wish he had addressed more the differences between light infantry and dismounted infantry - a distinction not made often enough."},{"Title":"The Art of Maneuver: Maneuver Warfare Theory and Airland Battle","review":"This is an excellent overview of a still misunderstood theory of warfare.

Highly resistant to a number-crunching approach to war-planning and war-fighting, Leonhard tears apart the thinking that drives most U.S. military policy. Using a central theme of maneuver as a superior tool to attrition, Leonhard actually sets up a framework of effect driven choices for planning, response and analysis of war. He powerfully opposes the reduction of any conflict to a battle model by offering a paradigm of approach driven by the resultants of victory - pursuit and exploitation - rather than an approach limited to the attainment of decision. Pretty readable, given the highly specialized subject matter with a well organized and richly informative style that has held the attention of all I have inveigled to read Art of Maneuver.

Leonhard under the bus, I should make it clear that I've never served in the military in any capacity. It may well be that there is a great deal more to what Col. Leonhard writes that would be self-evident to a serving officer (in terms of background and world view) that I'm missing due to my lack of background. In my own discipline (physics), anyone can pick up a volume of the Landau and Lifschitz series and read through it, but I can guarantee that you aren't going to appreciate all the subtleties without dedicating a lifetime of study and experience to the field. I approached this book as an interested, reasonably well-read non-specialist who has read a great deal of Bill Lind's writings online, read about the Gulf War (e.g. Col. Summers account), the 2003 invasion of Iraq, etc. and I wanted to learn in detail what the experts view of maneuver war is and how it is different from the doctrine that Lind calls 2nd generation warfare.In short (and with the above caveats in mind), this work can only be characterized as a huge disappointment. There are, in my view, two fatal flaws in this work. First, at least half the text is taken up with Col. Leonhard's personal rantings about shortcomings in Army training, doctrine, AirLand battle, etc. In particular, he repeatedly rants about AirLand battle doctrine is flawed. By the 27th time he states this, I think the reader gets the picture. One of the other reviewers states that this book is a tough read, but contains a great deal of info. I agree with this assessment, but it is a tough read because it it poorly written. The prose could have been tightened up, and more than half the discussion in the book removed as irrelevant.Second, his conclusions often contradict his general thesis, or in several cases his conclusions really leave more questions than answers. He spends several hundred pages pointing out the flaws in the (then current - published in 1991) US Army Airland Battle, then as a case study talks about the invasion of Panama in 1989 and describes it as a great success for maneuver warfare. As an example of the latter phenomenon (answers versus questions), he goes to great length to explain the historical development of AirLand battle and how it was a response to the Soviet threat to Western Europe. He then rails about the flaws of the AirLand battle (and attrition warfare in general) and the superiorities of maneuver warfare, but then he never addresses the fundamental issue of how NATO should stop a Warsaw Pact invasion of Western Europe within the maneuver warfare paradigm. He never proposes an alternative to the AirLand battle, only criticizes it because it veers from the maneuver warfare paradigm. He vaguely alludes to some type of offensive, pre-emptive action, but I'm not sure how successful this would have been against the huge Warsaw Pact army. In the end, Leonhard left me with the impression that the AirLand battle paradigm was probably the right one and that his rantings about maneuver warfare are greatly overblown.The bottom line is that there is some good info in this book (hence the three stars), but it really isn't that well written or detailed in spite of some of the glowing reviews. I can't really recommend that anyone take the time to read it. Everything that I learned from this book can be discerned in about 10 minutes by reading the Wikipedia entry on maneuver warfare. I'm going to get Bill Lind's book and perhaps look around for some additional references to broaden my knowledge. This book is a real disappointment."},{"Title":"The Art of Maneuver: Maneuver Warfare Theory and Airland Battle","review":"If you are interested in military tactics and how tanks are employed on the battlefield of the 1980s to early 90s this is the book for you. I glad its in part of collection although I might sell it or trade it in for the hardcover version."},{"Title":"The Art of Maneuver: Maneuver Warfare Theory and Airland Battle","review":"This book has a double focus: the principles of military strategy and the defects of current US military strategy. For a reader interested in the latter, this book is an essential thought-provoking essay on what is wrong with current US military thinking. Particularly interesting and useful is the author's demonstration on how current policy depends on factors that can be analyzed by computer, and why that is wrong and dangerous.There is also much for the newcomer to military strategy in the first part of the book, where concepts of great military strategists like Sun Tzu, Liddell-Hart and others are cast into a modern and original concept, and where strategy is distilled into its elements. Some readers might find the second half of the book dealing with various airland battle doctrines heavy reading. So I don't recommend reading this book in one or two sittings; it is better read and digested a bit at a time. A heavy meal, but a very satisfying one."},{"Title":"The Art of Maneuver: Maneuver Warfare Theory and Airland Battle","review":"An interesting and insightful read!

Great book for what it is, pretty much of what might have gone into a diary but written years later. My guess is that he sat down and told the story to his coauthor who transcribed it into this book. Yeah it lacks the intellectual depth of One Bullet Away but covers a lot more combat. For those who love stories from the field this is a winner.Rad Miller's certainly not your typical Seal, he enrolled what was then known as UDT training without knowing how to swim, a fairly radical handicap. However, his instructors must have seen something as they did again in Seal training, the mindset of a warrior, far more difficult to teach than how to swim.Miller captures the mindset, the hours of high stress boredom and the fog of small unit warfare. His best writing is the stories of the various missions. There's no discussion of the strategic issues, just the intimate detail of war, one small battle at a time.The primary mission of his unit was to collect intelligence with an occasional ambush or body snatch mission thrown in. There's a lot of lessons learned from clothing to weapons. All of this mixed with black humor.If anything Miller makes himself look like a bumbling warrior who somehow managed too do three tours in Vietnam.Highly recommended and the perfect airline companion."},{"Title":"Whattaya Mean I Can't Kill 'Em?","review":"This is a good book with a true outlook on that messed up war"},{"Title":"Whattaya Mean I Can't Kill 'Em?","review":"I think his stories about battle are believable and everything else is nonsense.

His unedited, unpolished style of writing might appeal to some, but I found Miller's style to be annoying, self-glorifying and, frankly, probably a little fanciful. Miller tries to convince us that SEALs are the ultimate warriors, yet he details his screw-ups and his colleagues screw-ups. Unprofessional behavior that would normally get you killed fills the book. I don't know about SEALs in general, but this guy wasn't a patch on the Green Berets that I know who served in Vietnam. Just goes to prove that the best of the best are the ones that you never hear about or read about."},{"Title":"Whattaya Mean I Can't Kill 'Em?","review":"I was very disappointed in this book.I have read all the others books by &quot;Seals&quot; and this did not come close to any of them.

What it lacks in writing style it makes up for with brutal honesty and relentless truth-telling.Rad Miller's book is an excellent primary source, and a useful tool for someone who wants to learn the history of the Vietnam conflict. Bearing in mind that this is only one soldier's perspective, the book perfectly captures the spirit of the late sixties and early seventies, and goes beyond simply describing combat and training, but actually grapples with the issues of the war and chaos that reigned on the homefront. A must-read."},{"Title":"Whattaya Mean I Can't Kill 'Em?","review":"One thing can be said about this SEAL is that he sure has a sense of humor.Of course,war isnt pretty.Its sexy.But really,unlike these other books I've read,like LRRP's Ranger,boy ,does that book ramble on and on about technical issues and stuff I've never been familiar with.But Rad was able to express himself not in a robot fashion,just brain washed to kill,but the human side of being a commando.It was very exciting and intruiging.I was totally involved in it.I have read some true combat novels that just don't get to details about what was going on.Some didnt explain how it felt in combat in true real time detail.Rad Miller takes you there.I hope to get his autograph some day."},{"Title":"Whattaya Mean I Can't Kill 'Em?","review":"Miller's re-cap of his life before / during his tour in Vietnam, as a Frog/SEAL is well written, and is very intense reading.

Go elsewhere. Miller tells it like it really was for most combat vets. Months of training and monotony punctuated by moments of sheer panic. The best plans go wrong, the toughest troops get tired, hungry, hurt, and do almost comical things while facing death. Miller has the maturity to admit his human frailities but still manages to show that he was indeed one of the best trained, fiercest fighters in the world. I felt his pain lugging overloaded combat packs, trying to stay awake on all-night ambushes, of almost drowning while crossing rivers and streams, and the morality of staring face to face with an armed enemy and wondering if pulling the trigger is the right thing to do. There's very little military techno-talk in this book, and it can be understood by anyone who was never a soldier but wants to see what it takes to turn a young high school jock into a warrior."},{"Title":"Whattaya Mean I Can't Kill 'Em?","review":"I wanted to know what it was like to be a SEAL in Vietnam. This book more than explained what it was like. Miller tells his life story from graduating high school to buying a tape-deck that lasted nearly 20 years.

But what those critics seem to miss is that's EXACTLY what makes this book so worth reading. Unlike many authors of the same genre, Miller isn't out to entertain or educate an audience with polished form or textbook writing formulas, instead he simply talks about his experiences in the Vietnam War in a brutally frank, unpolished, straightforward, and often hilarious manner. In the process, Miller takes the reader on a tour of Vietnam in the late 60's, (actually three tours), giving a fantastic view of what it was like to serve in that confusing war.Supplying technical details when necessary, colored with social overviews that give perspective on the era, and tied together with a sense of humor rarely found in war/military books, Miller's book is a home run that reads as if he's sitting next to you in the bar, remembering old times.

Students seek a college educational experience that matches them. Their needs cannot be met by simple rankings of size by campus or selectivity by major.Where are descriptions by the author for each college in this book?"},{"Title":"Rugg's Recommendations on the Colleges (22nd Edition)","review":"Rugg's Recommendations On The Colleges is now in its 17th edition. New and updated editions have been published every year since 1988 (every 2 years before that). The book's enduring popularity is testimony to its usefulness in the college search process, especially in the list-building phase. I buy multiple copies every year for my college counseling office and always keep it within reach when working with students. The book is a staple in high school guidance and college advising offices nation-wide.The author is a former counselor and is well-respected by members of his former profession. He is also well-known for the seminars that he presents for counselors around the country. As a former counselor, Rugg knows what information students and parents need and he provides it. The foundation of the book is the 83 lists of colleges grouped by majors and divided into three levels of selectivity. The colleges on each list are \\"recommended\\" for each major based on discussions with students at the colleges and counselors across the country, and on Rugg's own research and visits.To the author's credit, he does not rank colleges the way that the national magazine (the one with two names and the ampersand) does. This is also a factor in the respect that counselors have for his work. Also to his credit, he states that the \\"book is not perfect.\\" No publication in this field is, although a couple of them would like us to believe that they are.The book also includes other helpful hints and information such as a list of the 100 colleges that he hears the most nice things about, colleges that \\"offer students the best opportunity to maximize their education.\\" It also includes a list of colleges that offer \\"wellness\\" dormitories. Rugg's approach encourages students to find colleges that will be good fits while smartly avoiding the \\"more selective the college the better it must be\\" approach that fuels the magazine rankings mentioned above.Rugg's Recommendations On The Colleges is a helpful tool that contains good and current information. It has always been available through guidance catalogs and from the author. I am glad to see it becoming widely available."},{"Title":"Rugg's Recommendations on the Colleges (22nd Edition)","review":"I do agree that guidance counselors probably do need a copy of this book, and the author was wise to avoid the increasingly discredited practice of re-ranking schools each and every year. It's perfectly reasonable to list colleges in general selectivity categories, which he does, but more and more people are realizing that schools don't change markedly in the period of one year and the annual ranking lists are simply bad journalism.However, I feel that this book is not as useful as Fiske's Guide To Colleges. Rugg's basically groups under each major a very long list of schools that are purported to be strong in that field. It's not a very stylish book, but it's effective and no-nonsense.Here's the problem: If you pick any major (say art) and then find a school that is strong in that field (say Vassar) you're probably going to want to know a lot more information about Vassar and the only thing Rugg's will tell you is whether its student population is small, medium or large, and if you search through the back of the book you may find what other majors are strong at Vassar and their average SAT score. That's pretty much it.Fiske also includes a similar list of majors and schools that excel in each field near the front of the book. Then each college is profiled in depth similar to books such as The Princeton Review Guide to Colleges. (Fiske is also better than Princeton Review for recommending strong departments.)One thing to note is that Fiske covers about 300 of the most prestigious and best-known colleges which is great but not exhaustive. If the schools you're interested in aren't included in Fiske then Rugg's can probably still help because it lists about a thousand schools. Barron's Profiles of American Colleges also includes over a thousand schools and offers much more information on each school than Rugg's. However, with Barron's I do think you will need to at least browse through Rugg's because Barron's frequently only lists \\"most popular majors\\" as opposed to most recommended."},{"Title":"Rugg's Recommendations on the Colleges (22nd Edition)","review":"Most of us know (or think we know)the top schools around the U.S. But if your high school student already has a solid interest in a particular major, this guide will open your eyes to possibilities you never knew existed.

Our son will be pursuing some area of computer science, and we found many highly-rated schools in this guide which were completely new to us. What is also interesting is to look at the listings for some majors and see what &quot;name brand&quot; schools are missing from the list.

Undecided? you can use Ruggs to find the schools that have strong programs in the 4 areas you are interested in so if your first major choice doesn't work out, you can change majors without having to change school.

I have continued to buy multiple copies of each edition since then for myself and for the college resource center at my school. Now, five years and five editions later, I want to sing the book's praises again.In the college counseling profession, we now take \\"Rugg's\\" for granted. Reaching for it and expecting it to be there is like turning on the water faucet or flipping on the light switch. We depend on it and if it isn't right at our fingertips, something immediately seems wrong.Fred Rugg, a former school counselor, is respected by members of his previous profession and is known for his book and for the seminars that he presents for high school counselors across the country. The author does not rank colleges the way that USNews & World Report does, and this is one of the many reasons why counselors have respect for his work. Rugg's approach encourages students to find colleges that will be good fits while avoiding the \\"more selective the college the better it must be\\" mind set that drives the magazine rankings.The book's enduring popularity (22 editions in 25 years) is testimony to its usefulness in the college search process, especially in the list-building phase. The foundation of the book is the lists of colleges grouped by majors and divided into three levels of selectivity. The colleges on each list are \\"recommended\\" for each major based on Rugg's conversations with students at the colleges and high school counselors, his own visits to college campuses, and other research.Rugg, in his characteristically honest and straightforward way, states that his \\"book is not perfect.\\" No publication in this field is perfect, and no one book or other resource has everything you need to do the college search and application process right. \\"Rugg's\\" is one tool in the toolbox; it performs a needed function and performs it well.\\"Rugg's Recommendations on the Colleges\\" is a helpful resource that contains good and current information. I am glad that it is widely available for students, parents, and counselors who need good information in the college search and application process."},{"Title":"Rugg's Recommendations on the Colleges (22nd Edition)","review":"The review on Rugg's book from \\"B. Borgerson, cybertrooth\\" states that this book is \\"essentially a list database.\\" Actually, nothing could be further than the truth!

With the plethora of fine college guides available it is hard to decide what to include in one's library.This one has proved invaluable as a first step for me.As an independent counselor to students around the country I have noticed that most high school guidance offices have this handy guide. It is particularly helpful once the student has an academic concentration in mind.Even esoteric majors like Music Therapy, Health Services Administration, Arabic, Entomology and Forensic Sciences are ranked by college. At first I was not sure if the colleges were just listed because they were simply courses offered in the college catalog.No, they are chosen to be included because Ruggs has implemented a comprehensive system of researching that combines statisitcal analysis with direct communication with hundreds of counselors and teachers around the country. He is able to sift and sort the objective with the subjective. Colleges are always evolving from year to year, department to department. It is a Herculean task to measure the strength of an academic department every year since faculty moves on. But Ruggs seems to fairly well identify the dedicated and involved faculty that works hard to provide a substantive level of education and training to students pursuing degrees in those disciplines.Too many students go off to college without ever really looking at the college catalog and faculty. This guide puts the priority right up front. A lot more is needed before the final decision is made, but if one of those things is to critically think about \\"what they want to be when they grow up\\", then the chances are good that the college selection process will be successful."},{"Title":"Rugg's Recommendations on the Colleges (22nd Edition)","review":"No, Rugg's Book is not \\"a cross-referenced listing of colleges by category.\\" It is a listing of \\"quality, student-oriented departments.\\"Input is primarily received from objective sources (secondary school counselors, and college students), not college personnel (like USNWR)who obviously can be biased.

To state, as a reviewer from Northfield, Minnesota did recently (July 17, 2006) \\"that the book is basically about location, etc.\\" misses 98% of the book.

What I appreciate most about this book is that it doesn't pretend to provide precise rankings, but rather \\"recommends\\" specific departments at particular colleges and universities that do a good job of teaching in a specific undergraduate major. For example, if a student wants to study Physics and asks me whether Cornell University has a good Physics Department, the first place I turn to confirm my recollection that it does, is to Rugg's Recommendations.

And, this edition is no different. It gives you all the information about all the colleges. But, how do you make the right choice? Want the answer? As an education counsellor, I'll tell you what I have been telling many others. The answer is UNDERSTANDING, understanding the REAL purpose of college education --- what our founding fathers, especially education pioneer Thomas Jefferson, said was absolutely critical that college education accomplish for both you and our Nation. I recommend, before you do anything, that you first read the only book about understanding higher education --- &quot;West Point&quot;, by Norman Thomas Remick. In it, Thomas Jefferson explains in simple language, through his founding of West Point (hence, the title), the reasons for having colleges in America. It's a heads up that will help you make the right decision and save you from making a big, life-altering mistake down the road by bringing everything into clear focus for you.

A year later, I'm finishing my first semester at my ideal college. There's obviously no guarantee this would happen for other people, but I do believe that anyone who requires a certain strong program/s at their school of choice will appreciate this book. I also like that schools are grouped according to selectivity, another way of helping readers narrow down their options.

It's more of an illustration of the feminist politics of the characters. In other words, the killer is exactly who you expect it to be. I kept waiting for an entertaining twist and there was none. And even as a feminist, I found myself unable to swallow all the pronouncements of certain characters.Don't read this for the mystery. Read it, if at all, for the politics. They are the real reason for this novel's existence. And don't say you weren't warned."},{"Title":"Bad Chemistry","review":"Nora Kelly is a native Easterner who is now living in Vancouver, British Columbia, where she teaches part time. She has been involved in writing her Gillian Adams mysteries for several years, and has won the 1999 Arthus Ellis Best Novel Award awarded by the Canadian Crime Writers Association.Using a University as a backdrop, where old buildings reek of sinister motives; strange chemicals are used in obscure experiments; and cutthroat individualists fight over diminishing federal and private grant funds is a recipe for intrigue and mayhem. Gillian Adams is a department head of the History Department at the University of the Pacific Northwest. Her boyfriend, Edward Gisborne, is a Deputy Chief Inspector for Scotland Yard. Both have demanding jobs and have let their relationship wind around their crushing schedules. Gillian is in Cambridge, England on Sabbatical, thinking about her next career move, when the murder of Wendy Fowler, a research fellow strikes uncomfortably close. Gillian's friends are involved in a nonprofit organization called the Pregnancy Information Service where Wendy volunteered. It is up to Gillian and Edward to sort out the murderer's motives, and to tie the murderer in with the PIS office:&quot; So you think he might have burgled the PIS office?' Irene said. To steal the cards? That's silly. What good would it do?' Maybe he wanted to see what we said about other doctors. Maybe he thought he could sue if he had the evidence.' No. But he might have taken the book. Who else would? He probably thought the information he wanted was in it. Or something else he could use against us. And then he took the money so we'd think it was an ordinary burglary.&quot;Not only does Kelly create a labyrinth of clues; her characterizations have the reader seriously considering almost every character she introduces as a suspect. Her particular form of feminism is well articulated through the characters, and their relationships strike a chord in the reader. Wendy Fowler is pregnant, and when a second body turns up that is connected to the PIS, Gillian and Edward take the reader through a well constructed plot that keeps the pages turning.Bad Chemistry is great fun and is a cozy that will be embraced by the mystery reading world.Shelley Glodowski, Reviewer"},{"Title":"Women Who Achieved for God (Fisherman Bible Studyguides)","review":"This review refers to the 1984 publication.This small study guide turns the spotlight on 19 women from the Bible.

One day a charismatic stranger,named Joseph Dylks, turns up there. At first he claims to be sent by God, then to actually be God himself. As unlikely as it seems, about a third of the town believe him and become his followers. But there are skeptics in the village of Leatherwood. One of them Matthew Braile, justice of the peace, is content to poke fun at the ease with which this con man has won over so many in the village. But when Dylks promises a miracle and fails to deliver, some of the skeptics become violent and Dylks and his followers are driven out. In this novel Howells shows how ready some 19th century Americans were to believe almost any religious claim, however outrageous. The thoughtful reader might wonder whether we are any different today.

Unfortunately, the \\"math\\" part is really only about three sentences long and includes only: two times fifty, five times twenty and ten times ten. Even so, with arithmetic seeming to sometimes take a back seat to reading and writing, this is an easy, fun way to expose your younger reader to the number 100 and some of its factors.

Handy and beautifully crafted pull-out design appraisals by body type enhance the utility of the book. But the most compelling reason to include this book on your homework list before you buy an SL is for Olson's evaluation of the collectibility of each body type (and models within type) and the 8 factors that affect the value of a collectible car.

And no one tapped the arteries of power gone awry more than the curious & formiable coupling of Hunter S Thompson & Ralph Steadman. Steadman's career seemed allied to Thompson's throughout the 70s, their frenzies wedded to Nixon's political campaigns, & cavorts with Hell's Angels. Occasionally, tucked away in Letters To The Editor, we sampled Steadman's bizarre philosophy in erratically numbered,'Gardening hints.' For a suitably distorted biography of the guy, his 'Between the Eyes' is an excellent primer. You'll see he names the German dadaists as his forebears. George Grosz springs to mind. But Ronald Searle & the Goons lurk midst his mordant wit. 'I Leonardo', 'Sigmund Freud','Alice In Wonderland' list amongst his achievements. His is an ego that needs larger than life subjects to vent his rage. It comes as something of a relief to find him in less than overdrive with the hilarious & intimately observed collection,'Dog's Bodies.' It's a manual on coping with dogs: the full Heinz catastrophe, & should be available with your mutt's licence. If, like me, you've been intimidated by dogs, felt their rabid fangs in your flesh, or had your sleep reduced by their lunitic howling, you'll revel in Steadman's advice for doggy discipline.

The use of recursive formulations in dynamics is fairly new, so the priciples of their operation and reason for their efficiency are explained.These algorithms are initially described in terms of an un-branhed, open-loop Kinematic chain - atypical serial robot mechanism. This is done to keep the descriptions of the algorithms simple, and is in line with descriptions appearing in the literature. Once the basic algorithms have been introduced, the restrictions on the mechanism are lifted and the algorithms are extended to cope with kinematic trees and loops, and general constraints at the joints. The problem of simulating the effect of contact between a robot and its environment is also considered. Some consideration is given to the details and practical problems of implementing these algorithms on a computer.The reader is asumed to have a knowledge of vectorial mechanics. No prior knowledge of robot dynamics, or the dynamics of any other kind of rigid-body system, is required...."},{"Title":"Robot Dynamics Algorithms (The Springer International Series in Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"I'm a third year undergraduate mechanical engineering student and I bought this book as my supervisor sugested that I try to implement the concept of 6D spatial vectors into my research project.

While working as a maid she manages to catch the eye of her former playmate and the son of the lady of the house. From there her life is nothing but complicated. Not only must she learn to function as the wife of a wealthy man in high society, raise her family and please her husband, but she also must face traveling from New Jersey to Indiana under the harshest of conditions. Even when her husband doesn't act like he should, Aaltje stands by him and learns what life can really be like.This a great story for women, outlining the life of one of the author's actual ancestors, who had to survive the life of a pioneer, all the while juggling her religion, her children, dysfunctional relatives and a roving husband. A wonderful book that sheds light on the strength and desire to survive of the early American woman."},{"Title":"Aaltje of Aurora, Indiana: 1773-1819","review":"Aaltje is a simple but clever girl whose unflagging faith in herself helps her overcome all of life's difficulties. And her life certainly has plenty of difficulties! The early death of her parents, the callous treatment of her siblings, innumerable dangerous childbirths, and a grueling trip across the country - not to mention a faithless husband. Through it all, Aaltje never forgets who she is, and never lets anyone or anything dull her spirit.This book is so rich in plot and character that it is easy to get lost in it. Once I'd gotten to know Aaltje and her travails, I didn't want to put it down! I especially liked the way Aaltje's husband, Richard, was portrayed: he is a quite subtle and ultimately likable character, who is more weak and thoughtless than truly bad, and whose soul is ultimately redeemed by his unwavering love for Aaltje.Though occasionally naive, Aaltje's strong will, pure heart, and fascinating life story will undoubtedly endear her to readers."},{"Title":"The Blackwell Guide to the Philosophy of Computing and Information","review":"This book is really worth reading. It contains a collection of articles by top-class philosophers somehow related to this new branch of Philosophy, coined as Philosophy of Computing and Information.All articles, with no exception but for various reasons, are extremely interesting. Some articles present interesting surveys of some specific topics, while others reflect very much the particular ideas and studies of their authors. Common to all articles - probably due to orientation and the example of the book organiser - is that the authors did not try to pretend they would be presenting \\"neutral\\" views about their topics. This sincerity is evident throughout the whole book and much appreciated.It is likely, therefore, that any reader will learn a lot from certain chapters of the book, cheer the contents of others for agreeing with those contents, and feel like being provoked and invited to a discussion by the authors through other chapters for disagreeing with their contents.

The Swann family saga will hold you enthralled until the end."},{"Title":"God Is An Englishman","review":"God is an Englishman is Victorian historical fiction at its best - I recommend it to anyone who has an interest in the world changing developments in commerce and industry in England in the mid/late 19th Century. I have always been fascinated by tales of the Industrial Revolution when English entrepreneurs, inventors and innovators changed life from an a rural/agricultural system to a modern industrial society in a matter of generations.After a military career, Adam Swann returns to England in 1858 with an intense ambition to build his fortune in the fast changing and extremely competitive world of Victorian commerce. Swann soon meets his soul-mate, Henrietta, the high-spirited daughter of a local mill owner and they set out to build a family business under the Swann name. Along the way they share challenges, setbacks and eventually an immense fortune.As now, the secret of Swann's success is building an efficient and competitive business that is ahead of its time and is essential to the success of others. Swann sees that while railways are a fundamental part of the game-changing industrial revolution, they cannot always provide door to door delivery. He sets up an extensive and complex country-wide network of horse drawn transportation to take materials and goods between the railhead and factories up and down the country, sometimes on appalling roads and gradients.Henrietta, as well as being a wife and mother to an ever increasing brood of small Swanns, is the financial wizard who helps Adam to succeed. While the business is essentially a family one, much of its success is due to finding the right staff in the right place and giving them every incentive to perform and develop the business.This is a fascinating and outstanding novel about exciting times in economic and social development throughout Victorian England. The next novels in the series - -Theirs Was the Kingdom (Swann Family Saga)andGive Us This Day (God Is an Englishman)- - bring the younger Swanns into the business and they face the next challenges as the face of road freight transport changes from horse drawn to motorised delivery.The Swann family saga is only one of several important English family sagas written by Delderfield, including The Horseman Riding By and To Serve Them All Our Days, both of which became popular BBC mini-series.This is a beloved novel by one of my favourite authors. I first read this book (the first in the Swann family saga trilogy) in the UK the early 1970's when it was first published. I read it again with continued enjoyment over 30 years later and was delighted to see it featured recently as a Kindle Daily Deal so I can now keep a copy with me at all times."},{"Title":"God Is An Englishman","review":"I read this series back in high school, about 40 years ago and loved them then. thank you for offering them in kindle form.

Setting is in England."},{"Title":"God Is An Englishman","review":"This is the first volume of an epic saga about a British entrepreneur who realizes that there is money to be made in horse drawn distribution in the middle of the 19th century despite the growth of the railway system. The story of how Adam Swan builds that business is fascinating and presented in elaborate detail. At the same time, the book deals with romantic topics but in a way that seems very old fashioned and censored. Lots of odd, symbolic language that somewhat detracts from the overall commercial theme of the book. Those parts make the book a little embarrassing for an old fashioned male reader to be caught with; somewhat like reading part of a Har___ novel from a bygone era. At times the book's treatment of women is patronizing although arguably it does show women in unusual, for the 1860s, management positions. For me, I wish the author had stuck to the story of the development of the enterprise and left the romantic parts to other authors. Mind all of it is very clean, nothing in this book that anyone could object to."},{"Title":"God Is An Englishman","review":"God is an Englishman is a wonderful book.

I even tried to find if this family ever existed. It is the Swann Family Saga and tells how Adam returns from the military to become a Tradesman in England despite his family's background in the military. He marries an eighteen year old and their story is exciting in itself. There were times of detailed descriptions of the Swann-wheels territories that I became a bit bored, but suddenly the book would weave a personal troubled story into the plot and I would once again become entangled in the Swann family life.

The thrill of following Adam Swann's drive to build a commercial empire during the Industrial Revolution, the complexities of family life, the emergence of England's mighty railways all blend to form a compelling tale that throbs with the power of a locomotive. R F Delderfield's characters are vivid and unforgettable."},{"Title":"God Is An Englishman","review":"The history of the UK was interesting. The advances of transportation, the differences in each locale, and how each station master handles their own unique set of difficulties. I like the character development. It was a little long winded in spots, but these parts could be skimmed."},{"Title":"God Is An Englishman","review":"Adam Swann has followed his family's tradition of military service for long enough to turn 30. He's seen a lot during those years, including a horrific massacre of civilians. When chance places a fortune in rubies in his hands, he's more than ready to make drastic changes. Back to England he goes, the England of a world just prior to the American Civil War, looking for a better way to spend his life. He finds it in two places. First, in a revolutionary business idea sparked by an encounter with a railway official; and second, in a runaway young woman. He marries the woman, factory heiress Henrietta Rawlinson (who's swiftly disinherited by her infuriated father), and he turns the idea into a hauling firm that deliberately fits itself into all the gaps the railway system cannot fill.That's the bare outline. What makes this novel remarkable, though, isn't its plot. It's the characters, and the way author Delderfield lets them grow naturally out of the time and place in which he sets them. Adam Swann is in many ways a man ahead of that time, disgusted by what he's seen in war and determined to make his way in the world without committing outrages against basic human decency. In fact, he's determined to make a difference for the better while succeeding as a businessman. Henrietta, blessed with her enterpreneur father's sharp mind and quick wits for commerce, grows from a willful, uneducated and thoroughly spoiled girl into a worthy and even challenging partner for Adam in the course of the book's 800-some pages. Nothing seems forced, and none of the details of Victorian England ring false, in all of those pages. Some of the best reading comes from secondary characters who weave in and out of the main story, because each is well drawn and interesting - no matter how brief the appearance.A tour-de-force, all in all. One of the best \\"family sagas\\" around, still, nearly 40 years after its publication."},{"Title":"God Is An Englishman","review":"I can think of few better authors to take along on a long plane ride than Delderfield. God Is an Englishman is the first of a trilogy that runs a little out of gas by the end of the third book, but not in the first. To Serve Them All My Days got me hooked on Delderfield, and this series continued it. I can also recommend his book Diana. Alot of his works are out of print, although you can find them at liabraries, or Amazon's auction site -- or bookfinder.com"},{"Title":"God Is An Englishman","review":"God Is an Englishman is the first book in this wonderful saga about the Swann family. Adam Swann, a 31-year-old cavalryman in the service of Queen Victoria's army, decides to break off with his family's military tradition and gives up his soldierly life in lieu of starting anew in England as a businessman. The road ahead of him will not be easy, as old sentiments still prevail where people making a living in a new, industrial England are looked down on and someone like Adam, giving up his army career is thought foolish. Adam Swann persists in his desire to be his own boss and not spent his life serving somebody else, even if it's the Crown of England. In his struggles to become a respectable and successful owner of a horse-carriage business, he has a few supporters, including his young wife, Henrietta and, surprisingly, his own father. The readers follow Adam and his personal and business lives for nine years. These are very tumultuous years for England as well. It is the 19th century, the country changes from an agricultural one into an industrial empire, with railroads ruling the transportation, mills, mines and factories replacing the farms and Adam Swann takes on a daring project of using horses as his road to success.I thoroughly enjoyed God Is an Englishman, so much so that even before I finished it, I went and got part two (Theirs Was the Kingdom). It's not an easy read by any means, but very captivating and really a requirement for anyone who wants to read more about one of the most important periods in England's history. Some might say that it's reminiscent of Dickens's books but I should say that probably only in the time set. Through Delderfield's book I got a hopeful outlook, not a grim one. True, it's still England where poverty is on the rise, where child exploitation flourishes but it's also England where one doesn't have to belong to royalty in order to become well-off, successful and if they're persistent enough, respected. \`Common' people now have a chance to have careers and to be truly in charge of their lives. I must say that I liked this approach and I just was riveted by Adam Swann and by the whole process of him starting from a scratch and, despite unexpected failures and \`bumps \`, holding on to what he believed and never losing sight of what Adam deemed as success.That's one great part of God Is an Englishman. Another one is the multitude of characters, bad, good and just average, but they all change, they all grow and, as a reader, you really have your pick in which ones are going to be your favorites. Mine was Henrietta, Adam's wife. I think she grew the most throughout the novel. She changed so much but still somehow retained her youthful innocence despite some occurrences that would turn many into bitter, prematurely old women. Henrietta and Adam's marriage is not an easy one, some would even say it's doomed from the beginning, but yet again, Delderfield just serves us this happy story, with both parties fulfilling their dreams, among the turmoil of their times. Don't get me wrong, it isn't a \`happily-ever-after Cinderella' story but an uplifting one nonetheless, despite the many problems that could endanger both Adam's and Henrietta's happiness.I say that if you're a \`saga junkie', if you are even remotely interested in the history of England and want to meet people, who in the end you feel are your friends or at least next door neighbors, God Is an Englishman and you will be a perfect match."},{"Title":"God Is An Englishman","review":"MY WIFE KEPT TELLING ME WHAT A GOOD &quot;READ&quot; THIS BOOK IS.I FINALLY FOUND ALL 3 SWANN SAGA BOOKS AT A USED SALE &amp; I HAVENT LOOKED BACK.THIS AUTHOR HAS THE KNACK TO RELATE TO THE READER EVERY BIT OF WHAT ADAM 'N HETTY WERE EXPERIENCING IN VICTORIAN ENGLAND.I HAVE BEEN IN WHEELED TRANSPORTATION 40 YEARS AND I FELT LIKE I WAS WALKING STEP FOR STEP WITH ADAM SWANN FROM THE TIME HE FOUND THE RUBY NECKLACE TO THE 1ST MAXIE 10 TRK ORDER.I LAUGHED N CRIED THRU OUT EACH VOLUME.I AM NOW IN A SEARCH MODE FOR ANY N ALL OF DELDERFIELD BOOKS I HAVENT READ.I'D LIKE TO SEE A FAN CLUB...."},{"Title":"God Is An Englishman","review":"This book is a must read for any Anglophile.

This is a very suspenseful novel, full of twists and turns. At first I was reluctant to read it, it seemed like just another boring, wordy book with no action. But, on advice from a friend, I finally rescued it from my shelf to read. I'm glad I did.

While I read it, I had no idea that it had been written 30 years ago. The historic details are magnificent, as is Delderfield's sense of English geography. The story is rather simple and predictable however. And the characters are too perfect. No character is this book is ever in danger of knowing failure, and to me, that detracts from their depth."},{"Title":"God Is An Englishman","review":"It's a very good story. Very informative, however, the author gets too carried away with description. The story could be told very nicely with about 20% less descriptive words.

Peace."},{"Title":"The Chinese Nail Murders: A Judge Dee Detective Story","review":"This book is part of a delightful series. Most readers of Van Gulik read these books again: they abound in details on Chinese medieval life and the plots are always clever. This is the only book where the judge is tempted by another woman. Usually, you see him content, enjoying the company of his several wives in his courtyard, practicing calligraphy or some peaceful activity. In this book, he is more confused and less wise than in the others. So, you find Judge Dee to be less regal than usual, but the end will leave you with a touch of sadness. Hence, only 4 stars, but don't miss it."},{"Title":"The Chinese Nail Murders: A Judge Dee Detective Story","review":"I have always been a great fan of Judge Dee stories.

So,when a friend gave me the first book last month, I went on Amazon.com and was so happy to see they were are re-released - I got all 17 books. I am happily into the 5th one now. If you are a lover of mysteries - there are 3 cases to be solved in each book; if you are a lover of Chinese culture - you will love the subtle descriptions and seemingly minor hints. I've learned things I never knew before.You will enjoy Judge Dee."},{"Title":"The Chinese Nail Murders: A Judge Dee Detective Story","review":"This Chinese mystery story is one of Judge Dee's best, although I like all of his books so far. The book was fun to read. I always try to figure out who is the murderer and how it was done before finishing the book; the author is very clever, and sometimes there is a surprise ending. I am delighted these books were reprinted. I read them 50 years ago; and now that they are again available, am rereading them. I like them even better now!"},{"Title":"Pounding Down...One Day at a Time","review":"I loved this book. It gives you great incentives when you are dieting. Even my youngest daughter loved this book.

These young women affectionately referred to themselves as the \\"Ninnies.\\" They bought her books, attended her lectures, carried on long-term correspondence with her (Anais vowed she would never let a fan letter go unanswered), and even attended informal workshops at her home. After reading COLLAGE OF DREAMS I am pretty certain that Spencer was a Ninnie herself.COLLAGE OF DREAMS, like Bettina Knapp's ANAIS NIN, is inevitably a bit on the worshipful side. Rather than being a critical evaluation of Nin's work, it seems to be an advocate of her work, emphasizing all its wonderful aspects and never really touching upon its weaknesses. This is a wonderful breath of fresh air when contrasted with Deirdre Bair's verging-on-hostile ANAIS NIN: A BIOGRAPHY, but it doesn't do much in the way of helping the reader relate to Nin's oeuvre. In fact, Sharon Spencer writes a lot like Anais Nin herself, utilizing two hallmarks of Nin's style: a cascade of beautiful and luxurious words; bad organization of ideas. Each paragraph seems to contain at least four sentences that should've served as topic sentences for their own paragraphs. One gets the impression that Sharon Spencer would've liked to have been Anais Nin.As a footnote to the benign personality cult that formed around Anais Nin in the late 60s and early 70s, COLLAGE OF DREAMS is indispensable. Spencer's love of Anais Nin and Nin's work really comes through, and it is quite heartwarming. But for critical evaluation, and for a more balanced assessment of Anais Nin's successes and failures as a writer, I recommend ANAIS NIN: AN INTRODUCTION as well as THE CRITICAL RESPONSE TO ANAIS NIN."},{"Title":"A Book of Kells:: Growing Up in an Ego Void","review":"This is a wonderfully personal tale of one family that sweeps through Canadian history from the 1800's onwards. The descriptions of the ordinary details of life, as well as the big events and traditions, puts the reader into every scene. But the strength of the story is a grown woman searching her family's past for an understanding of her parents' and her egos and souls. Its a both a historical and a psychological story interwoven masterfully into one riveting seamless tale."},{"Title":"A Book of Kells:: Growing Up in an Ego Void","review":"A Book of Kells is a fascinating account of the early lives of the author's parents - how they met, the nature of their courtship, and what they did with their lives before and after they had children. Margaret Kell's father, John, was a farmer turned minister. Her mother came from England and together they became missionaries of sorts, being one of the first people - if not the first - to bring the Word and the Bible to the Cree Indians. These parents were strict and devout, living through the Great Depression and the days of the milkman's wagon.The book is a wonderful historical account of hard-working, devoted Canadians, with powerful scenes such as the parents kayaking and logging for 40 miles in the brutally cold northern Manitoba wind: so cold that the father's nose froze.It is also a work of candor. Margaret tells it like it is. She is very straightforward talking about relationships, feelings, and her own adult beliefs about religion."},{"Title":"A Book of Kells:: Growing Up in an Ego Void","review":"Another book written from letters.

I have not previously seen a book written for new IT Managers. I highly recommend it. The transition from a technical role to management is often difficult - this is well documented. This book will make that change easier. I plan on making it required reading for my direct reports who are new managers."},{"Title":"IT Manager's Handbook: Getting Your New Job Done (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)","review":"Technology can change all it wants but the fundamentals of being a good IT Manager have changed very little. This book hits all the major areas of focus from staffing and budgeting to infrastructure and disaster recovery.The section entitled &quot;Certification: How Do I Know Its Worth&quot; applied 10 years ago, and still applies today. Right on the money and a good brief for an IT Manager building a team. Also, small but extremently important policy issues like email and security are included.I do think that the book included slightly heavy doses of technical information such as a full page table of different memory technologies as well as an entire section entitled &quot;How Do I Configure a Server&quot;. These would service a Network Administrator or Engineer just fine but an IT Manager ? Not so much. Don't let this detract you from the overall picture though. Too much information is certainly better than not enough.I have to be honest, I didn't read this cover to cover. But for someone who has spent time as an IT Manager in the past and one who is looking at doing it again, I was able to re-establish concepts and draw on new tools that, no doubt, provided benefits."},{"Title":"IT Manager's Handbook: Getting Your New Job Done (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)","review":"This book is a real godsend for all of us who have tried to prepare our talented people for their next career step.

Although his remarks are aimed at the Catholic Church, much of what he says is equally applicable to many Protestant denominations as well.In a world where utilitarian seems to be the name of the game, it is good to see that there are still those who appreciate beauty and tradition in their worship, and understand 'why' churches, erected to the Glory of God, should look the part.The angry tone Mr. Day displayed in his previous book is not to be found here, which is a wonderful improvement.As a clergyman, I strongly recommend this book -- even though it may, at times, be an uncomfortable read."},{"Title":"WHERE HAVE YOU GONE, MICHELANGELO THE LOSS OF SOUL IN CATHOLIC CULTURE","review":"This book lays out quite nicely the problems with worship and ego in modern American Catholicism. I don't advocate going back to the &#34;old Mass&#34; but the way we've implemented the &#34;new Mass&#34; is absolutely banal, disastrous, and pathetic."},{"Title":"WHERE HAVE YOU GONE, MICHELANGELO THE LOSS OF SOUL IN CATHOLIC CULTURE","review":"In this follow-up, Day branches out from music criticism into the fields of church \\"renewal\\" and comparisons between the ole Latin Mass and the new vernacular Mass. It's not quite up to his other work. His writing style is a bit harder to follow and his points are more scattered. Sometimes he sounds like a union organizer for an organist guild. But it still is worth reading and he makes some extremely valid points. Everybody who is discontented with the state of Catholic worship should read this book and would probably agree with about 90% of it."},{"Title":"WHERE HAVE YOU GONE, MICHELANGELO THE LOSS OF SOUL IN CATHOLIC CULTURE","review":"Acerbic. Provocative. Hilarious. These three words best describe the music professor's critique of church design, liturgy, music and American culture. This is an openly anecdotal book, not an academically researched one, however the insights are often quite prescient. As any good critic, he is an equal opportunity employer skewering ideas that are promoted by variously motivated factions within the Roman rite of the Catholic Church.His wit is hilarious, perhaps at times even derailing the seriousness of his endeavour. My favorite quote among many is the following (pg. 111) in reference to the centralization of where the priest sits during the mass, formerly on the side of the altar, now often in front of the tabernacle, the old high altar or the most prominent site in the sanctuary:\\"At the very center (the heart?) of so many newer or renovated liturgical environments--especially those stark, science-fiction architectural spaces--is the Royal Seat, sometimes the most formidable artistic \\"statement\\" in the whole church.

There are many &quot;ET&quot; visitors who are working with individuals to open humanity to understand its role in the intergalactic commmunity. While Anna's experiences and presentation come from just one of many species contacting humans, she is right on target with the general information and the specifics of the species she is dealing with. She is articulate and presents the material with great professional skills. It is informative, delightful, entertaining and I highly recommend it.Remembering to read other contact material as well...&quot;Extraterretrial Contact&quot; by Dr. Steven M. Greer is also highly recommended in your search for information on the &quot;awakening&quot; knowledge of our intergalactic connectedness and the contacts that have been made and the history of humanity. His research with military, government and civilian sightings and contacts is at last &quot;the smoking gun&quot; so many have been looking for. In light with the same &quot;proof positive&quot; is Zachary Sitchin's books which bring proof of humanity's origins. It is time humanity awakened to not only its origins, but the why and where of the purpose of creation. Anna Hayes, Steven Greer and Sitchin are among a vanguard of articulate individuals assisting in the awakening humanity. -Lori Cordini/Watana (another contactee)"},{"Title":"Voyagers: The Sleeping Abductees, Vol. 1","review":"Anna Hayes' work is about ascension and transmutation that the Earth and human race will be going through during the next 17 years. In this marvelous series, Volume I and II, she conveys to us in detail how spirituality and science are basically the same thing. The mechanics of creation, multidimensionality, our DNA, cycles of the Earth, merkaba fields and mechanics, and how we are ultimately connected to and effected by the rest of the Universe and creation, is finally revealed in a book that provides answers to most of our questions. Anna Hayes' workshops, given periodically on the East Coast, delve deeper into information in the books, and go beyond, in an endless manifestation of knowledge that we have always hungered for. The ancient mysteries and their application to our lives today are revealed. For those who are open to the truth and wish to explore and expand their consciousness, and understand their connection to our Creator, these books will provide endless insight and satisfaction."},{"Title":"Voyagers: The Sleeping Abductees, Vol. 1","review":"Ashayana Deane, previously writing under the name Anna Hayes and previously known as &quot;Katie&quot; has put together a history of Earth and compilation of extraterrestrial science and metaphysical ideas that appears impressive, though confusing at first look. The more I go through her materials the more they seem like propaganda for some secret society or ET faction - lots of potentially accurate details being used to carry a deception or manipulation into the reader's consciousness. There is an excessive focus on galactic politics and how they have played out in the conflicts over Earth. The Keylontic science stuff seems to have some validity, but in my opinion misses the deepest levels of reality and healing - consciousness and spiritual awareness/integration. Aliens with holographic technology who can interdimensionally abduct people and create artificial reality and illusions seem like control freaks [regardless of whether they believe they are acting for someone else's good] who need to learn to be in harmony with creative flow and basic spiritual principles. With all the ETs and entities who claim they wish to help humanity against the &quot;dark&quot; powers, why do they just communicate with a small sample of people instead of offering their help to the general population? I strongly encourage a read of the Matrix 5 books by Valerian for those who are prepared to explore this further. This author of the Voyagers books seems to be caught in the midst of a galactic/global power struggle among beings preoccupied with shaping this space-time reality to their liking. This is certainly interesting stuff and better than most ET contactee materials, but I would not accept the contents at face value. There are certainly some useful ideas about personal empowerment in this book, yet these are accompanied by ritualistic belief systems of a more subtle nature that may keep you from exploring your true self more fully."},{"Title":"Voyagers: The Sleeping Abductees, Vol. 1","review":"Voyagers 2 is an excellent source for our many billion years of history. It is a massive book but really only touches on the most significant events in our past in order to bring you up to speed with where we are sitting now. Since the book was published a few years back, it tells of relevant events up untill the point of publishing. As another review writer had mentioned, you can find more info on azuritepress.com of what has been released lately. The information has been coming through full speed since this book and there is a lot of updates as to where things are at right now.This book contains a large ammount of history, which all resonates with me as truth, but some of the stuff that I have found personally to be more interesting, has been released in the recent workshops over the past few years. If you are still contemplating reading this or not reading it, I'd strongly recomend that you let it speak for itself and give it a read.What I have personally found with this work, is that I have found a personal knowing. I have found my truth and my path in life thanks to this information. There are no questions if this is the real deal. I encourage everyone to seek out their own knowing in their own lives. Not everyone has the same path... But if you are still searching, give voyagers a shot, and find out for yourself if it is right for you. All I can say is that I'm glad I did and that is has given me the self empowerment that I needed to be happy and joyful in life. What else could you ask for? :)"},{"Title":"Voyagers: The Sleeping Abductees, Vol. 1","review":"This is a bit long but please read it all!The positive reviews from the other posters and the topics in the table of contents made this book and its precursor quite appealing so I bought them both. I've read probably thirty very powerful spiritual books (like Autobiography of a Yogi, Conversations with God series, Ken Wilbur's works, Life and Teachings of the Masters of the Far East, Sri Aurobindo, Ken Carey's Starseed series, etc.) over the past 3 years and all of them produce that feeling of knowingness that this is Truth. Recently I've begun exploring channelings from the ET's and found some fascinating material in Marciniak's teachings of the Pleiadians and Pereira's Arcturian Star Chronicles. They all carry the same basic positive message concerning the New Age we are entering and that is that we (humanity) are indeed divine and the path to ascension is a process of self-discovery by raising one's consciousness. Many of these books warn that this expansion into the New Age (1987-2012) will bring about major changes to the planet (earthquakes, increased storms) and our species (more wars, suffering, etc.) They also talk about how there is a great deal of spiritual help to get through these times but there will also be an increase in the darker forces (unfriendly ET's like the greys) who will work hard to promote the escalating dramas and create polarity and confusion.Voyagers I & II are just such books. They actually had me quite scared for a few days after I read them that humanity was ultimately doomed and the darker forces have the upper hand against the spiritual hierarchy and the lightworkers who work for peace and unity. The author claims she was abducted (may very well have been) by the evil ET's (the greys) but was also abducted later on by beneficent ones (whom she calls the Guardian Alliance) who trained her regarding the various tactics of the dark forces and how humanity can fight back. The first book starts out as quite believable because the author is articulate and seemingly well versed with incredible details of the various dark ET's and their agenda against humanity (probably because the info came from these sources). This begins to engender fear in the reader because the overall message is that these dark ET's have a whole array of powers over us that they can access against our free will to put us under their control. She then goes into extraoridinary detail of the solution or protection necessary to defend oneself which she refers to as \\"the science of the subconscious symbol codes, part of the reality construction system we refer to as Keylonta Mechanics\\". This quickly throws the reader into overwhelm as the description of the process and the physical terms she uses to describe it sound like complete gibberish. She goes into these incredibly detailed and confusing meditation/visualization procedures to ostensibly protect oneself. As if this isn't enough to freak you out, the book then goes into this incredible depiction of the intergalactic battle going on between the dark and light forces which has been raging for billions of years and Earth is in the middle of it beginning in 2002-2012 (hmmm, the book is published in 2001, I wonder why no one has ever talked about this before her). Here's what she says, \\"The only viable solutions to this progressively manifesting final conflict visitor drama are: Advanced Planetary Templar Complex Grid Work, through which the Halls of Amenti Star Gates and Earth's Vortex System can be protected from further Fallen Angelic Race infiltration; and personal self-generated DNA bio-regenesis of the dormant angelic human 12-strand DNA template, through which Advanced Planetary Templar Complex Grid Work can be run, and by which the human bio-energetic field can be healed and protected.\\"Ok, so that made absolutely no sense to you right? Well don't think having the books will make it any clearer. It tries to engender fear and confusion by saying mankind is doomed as this massive battle behind the scenes goes on and to save yourself you must employ our Keylonta science procedures. I decided to do some investigational work and checked out the website (azuritepress.com) and it was filled with an incredible amount of meditation/visualization tapes/cd's from many hours of seminars around the world that one can buy (at very high prices no less). Then I decided to look up the name and company of the only guy who endorsed the second book (no endorsements for book 1) -- Philip Gruber, Founder/Director of Quantum Access Group. I could find no company on the internet by this name nor anyone with this name who has any spiritual credibility.I am convinced these books (and organization) are a very clever but insidious medium created to incite panic and fear among already confused humans. I say \\"already confused\\" because I'm pretty confident these \\"end times\\" we are heading into we may very well indeed witness chaos and polarity among humans as well as increasing overt extraterrestrial presence. The greys and other dark ET's may likely make their presence known as things start to get crazy but I can assure you these books will not clear things up for you. The dark forces feed off confusion and fear and cannot harm you at all if one stays centered in their own all powerful spirit -- the message of the ascended masters.Use discernment people in these coming times, it may very well save your life. If the message creates fear and confusion then it most likely seeks to dis-empower and then you are vulnerable. Even worse, you will miss the upcoming ascension wave as addressed in Operation Terra -- a book that truly empowers.Namaste!"},{"Title":"Voyagers: The Sleeping Abductees, Vol. 1","review":"Anna Hayes gets down to business.

What Einstein saw as the ultimate limit (speed of light) is the gateway to a higher octave of dimensions, now recognised by physicists worldwide as 12 in number, the upper three are beyond all states of matter.

At the time, I wished my husband -- a clinical psychologist --had been with me. She was extremely engaging, but very paranoid. She said the dark aliens were messing with her husband's mind (Gruber) and he was in the hospital, in a mental ward.Still, I bought her book and found it barely comprehensible. I've been a student of metaphysics for over 25 years and am fairly up on physics and reasonably intelligent (Phi Beta Kappa) yet, the book -- especially at the end-- is barely intelligible.Then, later, I see she's remarried and changed her name. Whether her husband ever got out of the mental ward and changed his name, or this is a new guy, I don't know.Later, I saw she's doing seminars on Indigo Children, a take-off on work done by Nance Anne Tappe 20+ years ago. I don't know the content of Anna's seminars, but doubt they add much to original work.Let's just say my own information is that there is considerable &quot;Astral mischief&quot; going on at the present time and I wonder if Anna/Ashayana -- like her former husband, Gruber-- may not be the victim of some of those same mischievious forces.Anyone wanting the REAL lowdown on what's going on should read the works (or watch the videos) of Dr. David R. Hawkins."},{"Title":"Voyagers: The Sleeping Abductees, Vol. 1","review":"I congratulate Anna Hayes [now Ashayana Deane] for having the courage to publish this book. This book is extremely heavy reading, and having read it more than twice, I can attest to the unerring internal consistency of the material.This book does not look like channeled New Age brainwashing from some Ascended Master who speaks of love, light etc. I did not find any praise for Archangels, Great White Brotherhood, Thoth nor St Germain in this book.This alone is sufficient credibility. As a pioneer in Occult Astrology, I checked the dates of 6 Silent Avatars mentioned and predicted in this book. Their charts are very much mind boggling and cannot be fictitious.It would take a team of a PhD in Physics, Philosophy and Geo-Politics to cook up such information, and as any one can see from Deane's videos, she just does not have the intelligence quotient to come up with even 20% of this book on her own. No disrespect meant.This book speaks of the bloodshed wreaked on humanity from several kinds of ET Vampires. The legendary Stan Lee studied the Demiurge who possessed Moses's people and initiated genocides starting with the Amalekites, and created super villains like Galactus based on these ET creeps who are sadly worshipped as the one true god even today. Stan Lee could have made a hundred villains if he read this book.Skeptical and rational brethren will obviously laugh at the mention of Arachnid ETs [Star Ship Troopers type], Reptilians [David Icke stuff], Annunaki groups, Sirian Renegades and Zeta Abductors. However, for the millions who have been abducted, who have seen such entities in the Astral Planes and who sense such hybrids with full black eyes from Auric Sensing, this book clearly explains the sequence of events and the politics behind all such vampiric groups. This book is a must for all you light warriors who have been victimized.Some of the best explanations for ET Jesus, 11:11, 12:12, 9-11 Attack, Indigo Children, Merkabas and Atlantis is mentioned here.The main weaknesses in this book [which I do not blame on Deane but on this Guardian Alliance who have used some kind of biological chip implanted in Deane's brain by her initial abductors or in Montauk], which all serious researchers in paranormal/Ascension studies must ponder about are:1. No discussion of Gautama Buddha nor Vishnu Avatars. Krishna is mentioned as a guardian from the 5th Dimensional Sirius Indigo people.2. Rishis are mentioned but Rishi Mandala is skipped.3. Lyrans are said to have created \\"Elohim\\", Elohim are said to have helped Sirians in seeding Human Root Races.Sirians are menitoned as way more powerful than Reptilians and the Annunaki.Yet, the maximum recalls from \\"Star Seeds\\" on Earth is that Lyrans were destroyed by Draconian Reptilians.Who is right? Lyra's \\"Star Gate\\" is mentioned as all important for the Universe.4. Andromedans are praised as very advanced. Not much is written about Lion People. Several Clairvoyants have spotted Lion People amassing near the Kuipers Belt, allegedly as part of the Guardian Alliance. WHo is telling the truth?5. Inner Earth and Agartha are wonderfully explained, and so is the connection to the Sun's Core, and Solar System as fragments of Tara [which explains why Astrology works for Humans] but there is no mention of Antarctica, Nazi's connection to Inner Earth and Aldebaran ET Influence. I expected a mention of Martyrs Jim Keith, Schneider [exposed Dulce Incident] and truth tellers like Major Jesse Marcel by these \\"Guardian Alliance\\"6. Now the core anomaly: DNA Activation. The impression created is that 2 strands of DNA are Physical and 10 Strands Ethereal. Activating a minimum of 5 Chakras [up to Throat Chakra] guarantee 5 Strands \\"Accreting\\" and guarantee Ascension between 2017 and 2022. But if the Soul's Ascension is based on DNA Activation, then each Soul will have a wholly unique DNA. Every child knows that our DNA is 1/2 from Mother and 1/2 from Father. How can a Soul rely on two other individual's DNA to make its unique DNA for Ascension? Why must a Soul Activate inherited DNA Strands? It is clearly mentioned that the junk DNA maps to the 10 Etheric Strands.There is a solution to this puzzle but I would have expected a great Guardian Alliance who exposes dirt on each and every other ET Group from Galactic Federation to Thoth to Ashtar Command to Wing Makers and Drunvalvo Melchizedek to have pondered on this anomaly before making an inherited protein molecule as fundamental for a Soul's connection to Higher Self and later Ascension to higher dimensions. Simple Fact: Soul Essence/Consciousness is above Protein Molecules, it just uses Protein as a Vehicle for Human Experience. Beautiful explanation is given in the Upanishads, Nachiketa's chapter in a dialogue with Yama. [Vedanta is conspicuous by absence too, as is Buddha. Yet, Kundalini is mentioned as important, with less than 0.1% clarity as given by Vimalananda in the Aghora Series].7. Maharic Seal Visualizations: They involve Crimson Red color which has been detected by practicing mentalists as opening up the Sacral Chakra for programming. Golden Brown should have been used in reality. And lately, Deane's group uses some strange symbols instead of the Maharic Seal for psychic shielding.8. The GA mention a need for 40% of Humanity to awaken to a certain level. Yet, only one person has received these CDT Cloister Emerald Melchizedek teachings. Again, even a child knows that to reach 40% of Humanity, at least half a million humans in more than 200 countries should have received this information in their mother tongue.It is as if the GA spilled the truth of Galactic History to encourage a select percentage of humanity into exploring \\"Kelontics\\" a different and difficult system than the standard New Age brainwashing planned in 1986 by the Harmonic Convergence group. Interestingly, one expensive \\"guru\\" Toby Alexanader has taken up many of this book's info and has claimed the stamp of approval of Mahavatar Babaji on this DNA ACtivation. Babaji would be knowing fully well that a Soul need not bother with inherited DNA Activation for Ascension, as he formulated Kriya Yoga for Kundalini Rise, based on Upanishads.It would be nice if the Azurite Group or the Guardian Alliance can allay these doubts with the same clarity with which they exposed other evil groups.I rate this book 10 out of 5 by the way for sheer guts."},{"Title":"Voyagers: The Sleeping Abductees, Vol. 1","review":"The Hierarchy descripted by her is wrong, so becareful, but the Knowledge is very good!

What she says is true but I find her to be too focused on some of these things as well. If you want raw, information data this is the book to read. This book alone won't give you anything spiritually per-se, except for a \\"mental\\" understanding of some of what is happening.KS does not teach spirituality per se as it does raw methods (advanced) for evolving different parts of your spiritual/physical template. The spirituality must be inherent and developed through real, actual life. So like I view the internal arts (like taijiquan), these are more \\"additions\\" of advanced nature to add your your already developing understanding of reality and nature itself. The mind or spirit was never meant to follow just ONE tradition..so wake up and move past this.As with any powerful information or teachings, people tend to \\"Follow\\" and \\"worship\\" the information down to the last drop. These are always the followers and not the creators. Look what happened to the religion that we know now?In my case, I have been living up there most of my life, so this stuff resonates with me 100% naturally. Most of you who were born within the cycle of earth will resonate more with grounded teachings, and that is okay.As for the information? Pretty much 100% true in many different ways.As for the information? Much of this will not make sense to many of you, and that's okay. Her way of writing is kind of scattered and jumps all over the place, but if you can make sense of it you will find it very rewarding.In esoteric terms, this relates more to the mind chakra...the one which seeks to understand advanced, spiritual science through mental terms. While there are other forms for developing your heart chakra and other forms of understanding the vast beyond.In my opinion these books are directly designed for the Indigos whom this information resonates with perfectly..and serve as a brief \\"Training\\" or \\"manual\\" as to some of the things that has been occurring.By no means should this be the end-all-be-all to spiritual attainment or information.

The story focuses on a love affair between a middle-aged American, Benjamin Cole, a Vietnam veteran, and a young Vietnamese woman, Le Thi Tien. Returning to Ho Chi Minh City thirty years after the war, Ben meets Tien, a woman who finds herself trapped between the Vietnam of the past and the Vietnam of the present.In 1966, Ben was in Saigon driving trucks for the Unites States Army. The story takes place almost thirty years later, when Ben returns to Ho Chi Minh City and meets (and falls in love with) Tien, who finds herself trapped between traditional Vietnamese beliefs and the policies of the new Communist state.Butler, a master of first-person narration, alternates this story between the sensuous and lyrical voices of Ben and Tien as he explores the conflicts inherent in the old and the new Vietnam and as the couple struggle to find their own special place in the world. Even though Vietnam is a place of horror and violence for Ben, he comes to feel at home with Tien, more so than he ever felt with his own family in Midwest America.Living in a tiny apartment in Saigon, Tien works for the government as a guide for foreign tourists. Outwardly conservative, she appears to follow all Communist Party guidelines, however, Tien is a woman secretly longing for the intimacy and passion that only sexual and emotional fulfillment can bring. Ben and Tien are both a bit of the misfit, the outcast. Tien's mother, a prostitute, fled Vietnam when the Communists gained control and left Tien with her grandmother. And, although Tien grew up believing her father to be dead, she often feels his presence near her.Far too much of this book takes place in the bedroom, as Ben and Tien consummate their new-found love. And, as we learn the story of Ben and his years in Vietnam during the war, we also come to sense the ending of the story, many, many pages before it actually arrives.James Olen Butler, however, is a wonderful writer and this book, although thin on plot and character, is still wonderfully written. Some of the best images are contained in Tien's descriptions of traditional Vietnamese religion, folklore and mythology.Butler is a writer who is sensitive to the problems in Vietnam and the longterm effects of war, on both a country and on individuals. I would recommend his Pulitzer Prize winning A Good Scent From a Strange Mountain, however. The Deep Green Sea, although moody and atmospheric and certainly well-written, is just too trite and predictable to be worthwhile. Two stars for the quality of the writing, but that is all I can justify."},{"Title":"The Deep Green Sea: A Novel.","review":"To some this will be a wonderful erotic and tragic novel. To me it is simply a tragic tedious read with some startling moments.It is told in parallel, that is two people alternating their thoughts through the sections. There are no chapters as such. First it is her, then it is him. Tien and Ben in love and making a meal of it, on and on until the closing section where the tragedy is finally consummated.Ben, a Vietnam veteran, has returned to that country years after the war ended to round off his life as it were. He seeks to come to terms with what happened and with himself. He walks a street, which in 1966 was lined with bars, and where he fell in love with a prostitute forming a close relationship with her. Now on that same street he has a chance meeting with Tien, a twenty-six year old tour guide, abandoned by her bar-girl mother in 1975 when Saigon fell to the Communists. Kim, as the mother was known, feared retribution after giving birth to a child fathered by one of the enemy.Ben and Tien are soon in the throes of passionate love, therefore much of the book takes place in the bed chamber where their thoughts to and fro while they explore each other's bodies. This is where their past secrets emerge to such a degree that they feel there is a slight possibility they could be father and daughter indulging in a bout of incest. Obviously this throws cold water on the lovers, and there is only one thing to do, and that is to find Tien's mother so they can continue unheeded with their relationship.There is no doubt here that the author Robert Olen Butler is more than an accomplished writer, but it doesn't lessen the fact that this novel reads like someone wrote it at a creative writing class."},{"Title":"The Deep Green Sea: A Novel.","review":"To say I expected more from a Pulitzer Prize winner is an understatement. Where to start? I found it unbearably cheesy. It seemed liked every 3rd sentence by both characters began with the word 'and' - a device that can add weight to a sentence if used sparingly, but not when it's used constantly - it turned the book into an oh-so-reverent cheese-fest ('And then there was the sea, spread before us. And Ben was with me, and it was good'). Also, for a novel so infused with sex, the priggishness of both characters was maddening - neither one was able to refer to their own bodies like adults ('He touched me in my special place' or 'and then she reached for that most sensitive part of me' over and over and over). The plot was pretty absurd too - even allowing for the odds of Ben being Tien's father, just the mere fact that he recognized Tien's mother as his former lover DID NOT NECCESSARILY MAKE HIM TIEN'S FATHER! Tien's mother was a prostitute, for Pete's sake - she must have had hundreds of American lovers. Finally, I nearly gagged when, after they learn the 'truth,' Ben prevents Tien from jumping to her death by saying, \\"Only one of us\\" and then jumps. Butler is obviously a skilled writer, in that he writes aesthetically pleasing sentences. But this novel is a total failure in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Deep Green Sea: A Novel.","review":"Robert Olen Butler has explored an &quot;unspeakable&quot; topic in this novel. This is a beautiful love story between Ben, a forty-four year-old Vietnam Veteran, and Thien, a twenty-six year-old Amerasian woman. Though a generation apart, they complement each other with their searches for fulfillment: Ben, for a closure which he supposedly finds, and Thien, for the love of her life. Butler is a master storyteller who excels at giving voice to his two protagonists. The prose is lyrical, sensual, and rawfully honest. The most harrowing aspect of the novel is that it raises more questions in the end than it answers. If that is Butler's intention, then he has succeeded.

And, this one touches all the senses!"},{"Title":"The Deep Green Sea: A Novel.","review":"This story takes us to Vietnam in two time periods: the mid-1990's, when Ben, a former GI, revisits Saigon in search of closure to his past, and perhaps explore new beginnings; and 1966-7, when Ben was first there, in the midst of a confusing and senseless war. He, like so many others, was drawn into the world of the easy sex and opportunity of the 1960's in Vietnam for men in his position. He lost his innocence there with a sweet bar-girl, and afterwards returned home to a disappointing life in the American mid-west.On his return to Vietnam, he falls deeply for a beautiful young tour guide, Tien, young enough to be his daughter. What follows over the course of a few days with Tien is reconciliation with his past, but also opening of old wounds and much heartache for both of them. Tien is equally smitten by Ben. To reveal more than this would be to reveal some of the premise of the story.Butler is a very sensitive writer, who is able to convey superstition, mystery and realism side by side. He writes first from the perspective of Tien, then Ben, then alternates back and forth throughout. This proves very effective, and allows the reader to experience both aspects of the developing relationship, feeling both the triumph and traumas of each as they unfold. There is a desperation and loneliness to both characters which draws them together, both feeling unreconciled to their pasts, and seeing their relationship with eachother as a form of absolution.This is a very effective and affecting story, despite some events that can at times seem contrived or overly coincidental. But there is much symbolism and a haunting sense of tragedy here, and I found myself holding my breath on several occasions, not quite believing what I was reading, shocked but moved. Butler obviously loves Vietnam and respects her people. This is a wonderful story."},{"Title":"The Deep Green Sea: A Novel.","review":"I was immediately pulled into this novel by the short chapters and the earnest voices of the two characters. Ben is a Vietnam War veteran, returning to that country after its inevitable &quot;fall&quot; to communism in order to search his soul and perhaps find some closure. Tien is a young Vietnamese woman to whom Ben is immediately drawn, and has some healing of her own to do. The two begin a very tender (and tentative) love affair which consumes them both.I enjoyed the addition of Vietnamese culture and landmarks, especially because they lent a sense of historical realism to a novel which, with Butler's sparse, poetic prose, may have seemed dream-like without them. The chapters alternate between Ben and Tien's points of view, pulling the reader into their tragic drama and making it impossible to look away even for a second. What I especially liked was that the book truly remains a love story, with Tien and Ben both receiving the closure they've so desperately been seeking (though in not the ways they may have imagined-- or maybe they did)._The Deep Green Sea_ is a sad, touching novel about the aftermath of war, the bonds that bring people together, and unintended consequences. Not everyone will like this book, but I do guarantee that the story won't easily leave you."},{"Title":"The Deep Green Sea: A Novel.","review":"I read Robert Olen Butler's The Deep Green Sea in a couple of sittings. His prose is sensual, fast-paced and hypnotic. His frequent use of Hemingway-like compound sentences flow like a fast-moving river. I like the uncanny way Butler is able to get inside the minds of his characters. Like almost all of his other work, Butler imbues his story with people struggling to come to terms with the tragedy that was the Vietnam War. I liked the love affair between Ben and Tien, though it seemed to happen unrealistically fast. Though it is possible that their true relationship to one another could be revealed after they find Tien's mother, the odds of this happening in real life make the ending seem improbable. And it struck me as melodramatic that Ben would jump off the cliff in the end after the &quot;discovery&quot; is made. The sense that I had raced through the beautiful prose of the book only to feel somewhat let down is tempered by Butler's ability to reveal the deepest thoughts and reactions of his characters."},{"Title":"The Deep Green Sea: A Novel.","review":"This great book by Robert Olen Butler shows more than any other Vietnam book, the experience of an ordinary American soldier returning to Vietnam to figure out why he is returing there. The careful blending with Vietnamese folklore, the points of view of the two main characters, and the whole idea of an American trying to come to terms with why this land draws him so makes for a fantastic read and perspective. One does not want to put this book down, only to read each beautifully written page. Clearly this author has the capability to cross a &quot;monkey bridge&quot; when describing Vietnamese culture and the American experience with Vietnam."},{"Title":"The Deep Green Sea: A Novel.","review":"Viet Nam veteran Ben Coles returns to Ho Chi Minh City, a place he knew as Saigon over three decades ago. Ben seeks to find the peace of mind that has eluded him since his combat days. In Nam, Ben meets Le Thi Tien, whose mother, a prostitute to the American soldiers, disappeared in 1975 when the North overran the South. Ben and Tien are immediately attracted to each other and share sexual experiences.However, when they compare their experiences, Ben wonders if Tien, whose father was allegedly an American, could be his child. The duo decides to travel into the countryside in search of Tien's mother who supposedly returned to her small village in order to avoid retribution for hanging out with the Americans from the conquering Communists.THE DEEP GREEN SEA is a well written work of fiction that could easily be considered a great work of art. The scenes involving seventies and nineties Viet Namese culture and society are some of the best prose written in the nineties. The love scene, though brilliantly scribed in alternating voices, seem to take away from the strength of the story line and just slow it down. Robert Olen Butler, winner of a Pulitzer (A GOOD SCENT FROM A STRANGE MOUNTAIN) knows and describes Nam like no one else and though his latest novel may not win the Pulitzer Prizel it is still a damn good book.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Deep Green Sea: A Novel.","review":"Butler had an agenda with this book. He had the story planned out from beginning to end and he would not deviate. As i read this book i kept feeling the story moving out of line, like there was something else that needed to be told, there was more to this story. But then Butler would rench it back in by bringing up that infernal question. Other reviewers have spoiled the &quot;surprise&quot; but I wont. To me, the question didnt matter. The man's need to know seemed forced, almost unreasonable. And certainly the ending didnt necessarily have to end that way. Simply because he was recognized doesnt mean he was responsible. But, as i said, Butler had an agenda with this book. It was a story he told his way, regardless of how the story itself wanted to go. And so we end up with an endearing Vietnamese girl, an almost endearing American man who asks strange questions, and a story that limps from being beat into line too often. Skip it."},{"Title":"The Deep Green Sea: A Novel.","review":"This is the first book I've read of his -- it sounds like it's worth checking out his Pulizter prize winning stories. Butler does an excellent job of evoking the sights and smells of Vietnam from the perspective of a vet who returns to find out more about himself. The narrative flows from Ben's point of view to his lover's -- the technique seemed heavy handed at times, seamless at others. Images flow freely as they fall in love and try to consummate their passion -- but the past's secrets seem to be invading. The conclusion seems too much to be believed, but I'm not sure it matters that much. This is a mood novel, and as such, it was a good read. You'll feel like you know what it feels like to be in Vietnam under this time and circumstance. Very nicely done overall with some well-drawn portraits of two characters."},{"Title":"The Deep Green Sea: A Novel.","review":"I have never read anything so deeply poignant and beautiful as this love story between Ben and Tien.

Where was the character development? Where was the heart of this book? I felt as though I was reading a trashy romance novel vs. work by a Pulitzer pize winning author. I was disappointed in not only the cheapened content, yet the structure in writing about it. I felt absolutely NO connection between the characters, and therefore toward the book in general. The predictiblity is probably the biggest disappointment overall. If I wanted to read a perdictable romance, I would have picked it up at the supermarket, not in the literature section of a prominent bookstore."},{"Title":"The Deep Green Sea: A Novel.","review":"In this book, I knew almost from the beginning what the end of the story would be, but I couldn't put it down because I was dying to know what the character's reactions would be.

No one would argue that this is a book to be sampled, but it is much more than that. Thigpen offers a coherent resource that gives even the casual browser something to think about. Each of the 19 thematic chapters opens with a quotation from scripture and brief introduction. All \\"last words\\" quotations contain a brief statement identifying the person and circumstances.The chapter entitled \\"No One Will Take Your Joy\\" quotes John 16:22 and begins with a little history of St. Thomas More, \\"a first-class joker,\\" who carried his sense of humor to the gallows. Thigpen notes that \\"a finely tuned sense of humor is often the distinguishing mark of clear vision.\\" Taking the will of God seriously, he suggests, allows us to take everything else, even death, lightly. In addition to humor, Thigpen addresses such topics as wisdom, detachment, forgiveness, and concern for those left behind.This work could easily be adapted for use by faith-sharing groups. Members might select a topic, and, after reading the chapter, reflect on the theme and discuss quotations that were meaningful to them and the insights they gained."},{"Title":"Last Words: Final Thoughts of Catholic Saints and Sinners","review":"This book is most interesting... a book that can be read during brief free moments (or, in other words, a great bathroom book!).

Karma: A Life not only explores the real-life interpretations of karma and its principles through its heroine Guinevere MacManus, but it weaves a beautiful narrative of self-exploration, family, and adventure. The structure of the book boldly defies convention as it leads the reader to the bounds of Guinevere's spiritual journey, while Landis York brings humor and warmth to the characters, making for an enjoyable reading experience. A definite page-turner, this book was not only exciting, but intriguing. It stirs a need to explore and to question in its subtle stories.

His father has got him an apartment and sends him money as he needs it, but is lacking in the love and warmth department, to the extent that Moon wonders why his parents even had him. In the past couple of months, Moon has been having vivid dreamsof living in 13th century Korea, known as Koryo at that time. The bizarre thing is that they have been becoming more and more real, and now they have engulfed him. He REALLY is in the Korea of 1229, a son of a warrior family who is trying to drum up support to fend off the Mongol hordes. And most of the people that surround him have the faces of people he knows in the 20th century, with just their names changed. If Moon can keep from losing his sanity, he might just figure out what is going on and why his life seems to stretch across the centuries.First of all, the art in this Korean manga is superb and realistic. The travelling back and forth in time is a little disconcerting but nothing you can't handle. I also thought it was interesting that the story is framed with actual historical events. A ghost that haunts Moon is especially scary. The dialogue also never stretches the boundaries of good taste with shouts of special attacks and the like. I would like a little more differentation in the design of the characters, since they tend to look alike. But you get the sense that only a few characters matter anyway. This is a great first volume."},{"Title":"ESTHER A BOOK FOR GIRLS","review":"It was a lovely biography,with an amazing twist. There were some errors that could have been fixed with better editing, but a lovely book nevertheless!"},{"Title":"In The Desert Of Desire: Las Vegas And The Culture Of Spectacle","review":"In \\"the Desert of Desire,\\" William L. Fox explores one of the most unique cities in America. Make no mistake; this isn't another historical overview. Given the author, the reader already knows that it will be unlike any other work on the subject. The book examines the question, what has and continues to make Las Vegas such a popular world destination? In short, the city creates spectacle that carefully responds to the desires of the day. The author uses an odd assortment of themes to elaborate this point. Case studies are offered in art and architecture, menageries and zoos, dance and sex. One of the author's main observations is how there is a blur between the public and private spheres in Las Vegas. To illustrate this point, the book spends a good portion of energy on the art world. In most cities, art is a public endeavor while for Las Vegas it is usually a casino led enterprise. \\"In the Desert of Desire\\" paints a detailed and accurate recreation of what it's like to visit both Sin City's main art galleries and Los Angeles' Getty Center. More over, aquariums and zoos are usually a public endeavor for most cities. Again, Shark Reef and Siegfried and Roy's Secret Garden root these experiences in the private domain. Libertarianism offers an explanation for the city and state's curious blending of public and private sectors. The dance section is not only an interesting examination of the history of ballet, but a look at the curious exchange between Las Vegas' exotic and ballet dancers. The book is a tad dated in that spectacles like the Springs Preserve, Zumanity and City Center were still being developed when the book went to print. In the end, such developments don't significantly change the main points of the work. Outside of this, William L. Fox tends to publish as either a fine arts writer or a naturalist with a love of the desert. As would be expected, \\"The Desert of Desire\\" is written by the art reviewer. For me, most of the topics have little personal interest but I'm working through his entire bibliography after getting hooked on the desert adventures. This read didn't disappoint as Fox not only makes the material interesting, he always makes a meaningful contribution to the topic. As with all of the author's writings, this is an interdisciplinary exploration and a philosophical journey. Beyond the city's official PR and common misconceptions, \\"In the Desert of Desire: Las Vegas and the Culture of Spectacle\\" is an unusual and insightful look at Las Vegas."},{"Title":"In The Desert Of Desire: Las Vegas And The Culture Of Spectacle","review":"Las Vegas is a unique city in the history of the world in that it was founded by those seeking escape, and exists as a place for those seeking to escape. The latter has created a city built on catering to the desires of other people, which is the topic of this short book. Whether it be gambling, shows, sex, or exotic animals, no other city in human history has so excelled at providing entertainment of so many forms and types in one place at one time. The book examines the different spectacles offered by Las Vegas, with a close eye on the appropriate history, business aspects, and ironies. Each chapter focuses on one specific spectacle; such as art, wildlife, and dance shows. In each, the author traces the development of that spectacle from its origins in Western history to its growth in American culture, and final establishment in Vegas. For each, the author also shows how private and public actors interact to create the final product seen by tourists. All in all, a very interesting and good work. This reviewer has visited Las Vegas twice, and after reading this book, I more fully understand it now and appreciate when went into creating it."},{"Title":"In The Desert Of Desire: Las Vegas And The Culture Of Spectacle","review":"Real Fake & Fake Real: Thinking About Las VegasI was intrigued to discover that the post office made a mistake with the most recent Statue of Liberty stamps.

After 9/11, people left tons of flowers and offerings at the casino, as if it were not just a Hollywood style representation but a magical link to the real Big Apple.William L. Fox writes, in his book about Vegas IN THE DESERT OF DESIRE, \\"The Hanging Gardens (of Babylon) were the world's first known theme park-that is, an attraction meant to distract people from reality by representing in miniature another environment for them to enter.\\"No wonder I like things like the Taj Mahal built out of sugar cubes.

Beyond the translation of the poems, the book also contains the original Russian text, as well as an introduction and commentary by the translator.Some of Tsvetaeva's poetry here belongs still to the juvenile, overtly feminine style of her earliest work. Lyrics like \\"Whence cometh such tender rapture\\" (written to Osip Mandelstam, a verse notably orchestrated by Shostakovich) are fairly insubstantial. However, overall the collection stands out as her first truly mature work due to its elegant centering around several related themes. At this time, Tsvetaeva was a fan and correspondent of the poets Osip Mandelstam, Alexander Blok, and Anna Akhmatova, all of whom were based on Saint Petersburg. MILESTONES represents a sort of presentation of Tsvetaeva's cherished hometown Moscow to them. The city's many churches is one promiment donation, as when she writes in poem 28 \\"Seven hills--like seven church bells, / Round seven church bells stand---belfries. / There are forty times forty in all,\\" or in poem 26 we find \\"Above the city Peter spurned of old, / the thunder of her belfry chimes has rolled.\\" Elsewhere Tsvetaeva contemplates Blok walking alongside the Neva in Saint Petersburg, as she delights in the Moskva river.Another powerful feature of the collection is its juxtaposition throughout of the bloom of youth and the inevitability of death. Already in the first poem we read \\"And over me---the owl to cry, / And over me--the grass to sigh...\\", and in poem 33 \\"Eat drink, and be merry, my soul! / But there'll come the day--, / Lay me in the wold, / At the four crossroads.\\" And though Tsvetaeva was only nominally Orthodox, and lead quite the scandalous life, we find many poignant observations of the beauty of Orthodox liturgy here. Poem 18, a chronicle of a visit to the liturgy of the Feast of the Annunciation, is my favourite of all the lyrics here in its intense combination of reflection on the self and of feeling part of an ancient tradition: \\"A group of peasant / Women, gray and old, ... / Crossing themselves severalfold, ... / Before the candles' rays. / As for me, I merrily ... / Thrust my way through the crowd. / I run down to the river Moskva / To watch the ice flow there.\\"I read the collection in the original Russian, and came to the English translation and notes only in preparing to review the volume here. Kimball's introduction is very enlightening on the context and prosody of the poems. Similarly the notes, though sparing, are quite helpful. I'm less satisfied with his translation, which tries to reflect the sound of the original in English. I am not a fan of adaption translations which are meant to work on their own, instead, I prefer that translations only be a crib for the reader to use until he can read the poetry in the original language. Still, Kimball does deserve praise for being generally faithful to the exact Russian wording, and especially for retaining the dash, Tsvetaeva's favourite punctuation, which many translators eliminate to the detriment of their supposedly faithful English renderings.For me, Tsvetaeva's best work came later, after her emigration to Czechoslovakia after the establishment of the Soviet Union, in such works as \\"Hour of the Soul\\" and \\"Poem of the End\\". Still, MILESTONES is generally a very entertaining, occasionally awe-inspiring work."},{"Title":"SUN DANCING: LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL IRISH MONASTERY AND HOW CELTIC SPIRITUALITY INFLUENCED THE WORLD","review":"This book will capture your interest and will leave you hanging with more questions. If your interest is in the field of archaeology, etc, you will probably want to \\"pass by, Horseman.\\" However, if you're like me and you just want to know what was happening to the average peasant and believer on the banks of the River of history, then this book is for you. G. Moorehouse, does a smash up job of bringing to life the spirit of the Celtic monks who changed the world. The book is divided into two parts: the first being a \\"faction\\", that is a historically accurate fictional account of day to day life in the monastery of Sceilig Michail. In this section, he attempts to penetrate the Celtic mind and I have to give him credit for this. If in any way, he failed, it is only because the truly Celtic Christian mind was lost to us after the Great Schism of 1054 and after their valiant and heroic resistance, Eire finally fell to the Roman church. (We should all mourn what might have been contributed to Byzantium because it is the less for all that!)The second section deals in the facts, insofar as they are known, and as cold as the stones that pious Celtic hands pressed into service, to build the monasteries of Iona, Lindisfarne, Sceilig Michail. The bibliography alone is worth every penny, the price of the book and I highly recommend it as much for Mr. Moorehouse's attempt to plumb the depths of the celtic Christian heart, as for it's more scholarly attributes.If you're looking for new age nonsense about \\"Celtic\\" spirituality, move on. If you are looking for the Orthodoxy (big O intended) of the Celts, you've come to the right place. Moorehouse skirts the issue, and never directly says it outright, but the message of this book is loud and clear: The origin of Celtic Christianity lies in the East, with Eastern Orthodoxy and not with Roman pontiffs. Nobody, with any knowledge will fail to recognize the obvious: St. John Cassian's prayer and method of use (pre-cursor of the Jesus prayer), the monastic cell rules, the ascetism of St. Anthony and other Desert Fathers.In the end, what one is left with is this: Iona, Lindisfarne, and Sceilig Michail are not so far away as they may appear in the mist. They may, and must, be re-built each day in our own hearts with a Christianity that is Orthodox and that is lived each day, without fail."},{"Title":"SUN DANCING: LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL IRISH MONASTERY AND HOW CELTIC SPIRITUALITY INFLUENCED THE WORLD","review":"If you've ever stood on the rocks of Skellig Michael, or peered at them from safe ground across the tossing waves, you've thought to yourself, &quot;only crazy people and seagulls would live there&quot;. You would be wrong - passionate maybe, maybe not crazy. This story of the monks on Skellig Michael, part history, part fiction, speaks of the loneliness and of being alone - which are not the same things - and the astonishing strength that can come from the most unexpected places when one person or a group of people who share a focus come together. Even the early pages that detail the types of ink used in the glorious illuminated manuscripts of Clanmacnoise draw you into this passion and this focus. It's an incredible story of life on a rock in the middle of nowhere that provided a continuous line of education and religion (like it or not) in a time beyond our imagination."},{"Title":"SUN DANCING: LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL IRISH MONASTERY AND HOW CELTIC SPIRITUALITY INFLUENCED THE WORLD","review":"Sun Dancing is a fascinating look at this period of Irish history.

This gave me a fundamental problem in getting into the book. The first half is decently written and attempts to get in the heads of various Irish monks in the Middle Ages, the second half provides the facts to back up the conjecture of the first. I preferred the second half, though that may be because I tend to enjoy my history a bit harder than most. I just didn't like the structure of the book. To me, what this book really is is a novella about an Irish Monastery on a rocky island with a novella-sized end note section. The end notes were more relevant for research. I don't question the scholarship of the work, just the presentation. Overall, not bad, but if you can get past the strange way it's put together (unlike me) you'll probably enjoy it."},{"Title":"SUN DANCING: LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL IRISH MONASTERY AND HOW CELTIC SPIRITUALITY INFLUENCED THE WORLD","review":"Skellig Michael (Michael's Rock) is a tiny, steep, pinnacle of an island off the coast of Ireland. For 600 years during the early middle ages, it served as a Celtic Monastery. Travel writer Geoffrey Moorhouse tells of the rigors of the isolated lives of the monks, via an imaginative, partly fictional reconstruction of key experiences such as surviving Viking raids, existence in a bare stone beehive hut, and preserving the essence of Celtic Christianity, away from the tentacles of Rome.The second half of the book is more scholarly but drier and less engaging. Nevertheless, Skellig Michael by its remoteness has remained relatively unchanged, and the evidence that researchers have been gathering from it has been aptly elucidated by Moorhouse; a valuable snapshot of Christianity in one of its variant early forms."},{"Title":"SUN DANCING: LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL IRISH MONASTERY AND HOW CELTIC SPIRITUALITY INFLUENCED THE WORLD","review":"This book's best quality is that it lacks the pretension of Cahill's &quot;How the Irish Saved Civilization.&quot; We see the Irish monks' lives at close range, in much detail and with sympathy. The monks are not portrayed as kooks but as devotees of Christ who expected His return at any minute."},{"Title":"SUN DANCING: LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL IRISH MONASTERY AND HOW CELTIC SPIRITUALITY INFLUENCED THE WORLD","review":"Anyone who visits Ireland's haunting Skellig Islands asks themselves the same question: What have life must have been like for the incredibly dedicated monks who, for hundreds of years, inhabited one of the most isolated, forbidding, harshest, difficult places on earth?Moorhouse answers this question well with a brilliantly conceived historical novel, which explores not only how these men lived, but also why they chose such a difficult life. The picture Moorhouse paints of daily life is detailed and, one has to conclude, highly accurate. Even more moving, though, are the characters he develops and the insights into what must have been in the minds of men who sacrificed all for a faith that was tested 24 hours a day.Unlike many historical novels, Sun Dancing is not overly simplistic, its characters are not flat and transparent. What could possibly drive men to survive near starvation, Viking raids, a brutal climate, and isolation that would drive many mad?

The book is a riveting story of how monks lived on that island and the scholarly evidence to prove that the story is pretty much what happened at that time. It was a much more severe type of monasticism that developed independently of traditional Western monasticism based on the Rule of St. Benedict.A must read for those looking for heroes that live by deep faith."},{"Title":"SUN DANCING: LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL IRISH MONASTERY AND HOW CELTIC SPIRITUALITY INFLUENCED THE WORLD","review":"After visiting Skellig Michael, I wanted to know why! Why did the monks go to such a place and stay for so long. I passed this book by several times while looking for my answer, the title is very misleading. From scant historical evidence, the author writes a compelling historical fiction in the first half, and then explains his reasons backed up with facts in the second half of the book. This book answered my question and whet my appetite for more information about the Celtic monks."},{"Title":"SUN DANCING: LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL IRISH MONASTERY AND HOW CELTIC SPIRITUALITY INFLUENCED THE WORLD","review":"Fun for anyone with even slight interest in history, Christian religion, etc. Part story, part historical text, very clever and interesting.

I could tell by the cover picture I would enjoy it. I'm a fiesty female who believes all women are beautiful and powerful, and that it's time we stop letting men tell us different. This book makes you appreciate yourself and reminds you to surround yourself with others that do to, male or female. One of my favorite quotes went something like \\"nobody can make you feel insecure without your permission!\\" How true, don't give someone, anyone the power to make you feel less than you are! Just a joy to read and the animal pictures are beautiful and sweet. This book is great for inspiring confidence in any woman, and maybe even for our men to read to remind them how lucky they are to have us! *smile*"},{"Title":"Free, Fearless Female: Wild Thoughts on Womanhood","review":"Willow Creek Press' little inspirational book is for the independent modern woman who needs some fun words of empowerment paired with fun animal photos.

It is hard enough to state simply and accurately what one's own religious tradition practises and teaches. This catechism by Patrick Twohy, S.J. achieves the apparently impossible -- stating the Roman Catholic teachings about God in Christ while respecting the Native American ways of the Coastal Salish peoples. The book explicates the Catholic wisdom tradition by illustrating Christian teachings with indigenous examples and images. The book is no dry tome -- it is radiant with the light of new understanding and fragrant as the fruit of prayer. It rewards the reader not only with new insight about Native American lifeways, but incites the kind of compassion and appreciation of what Chistianity can mean when it is embraced by people alive to the spirit world. I urge you to hurry this important book into an additional printing."},{"Title":"Finding a way home: Indian and Catholic spiritual paths of the Plateau Tribes","review":"I was very disappointed in this book.

Wow, this one really &quot;hit home.&quot; The built in interactivity allows the reader to personally engage as the story unfolds.

This book is both enjoyable to read and very profound."},{"Title":"Awakening the Leader Within: A Story of Transformation","review":"I've read a lot of books on self-improvement and spirituality/awakening, so there was no new information in this book for me. However, his information is accurate and true.I didn't find the writing all that engaging.Stephen Covey's books (Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, etc) were more appealing to me.If you don't usually read spiritual/self-help books, and you are into leadership and improving your ability to lead, this might be your book.Personally, I am not keeping it."},{"Title":"Awakening the Leader Within: A Story of Transformation","review":"This story of transformation is a juwel of profound and timeless wisdom being practically applied to business, leadership and coaching.

I guess that's what the title promises. Anyway, its very interesting to those who are curious in astrology, fortune telling, and so on.

If you were fortunate to be growing up at that time the AM dial never left 890 either at home or in the car. This book captures the personalities of the disc jockeys that made those days so memorable. With the new ABC ownership, WLS was transformed from the Sears Roebuck agricultural outlet (Worlds Largest Store- WLS) to feature rock and roll music & equally as important feature the men who captured the spirit of this new sound. From the early morning show of Clark Weber to the evening show of Art Roberts this books tells the tales of what AM radio was like in Chicago with a change of music, demographics, and on air personalities. Be prepared to find yourelf interrupting your reading to search for \\"oldies\\" like the Sugar Shack by Jimmy Gilmer & the Fireballs to Mary Wells version of My Guy .

Most books on the subject concentrate on either the product designing aspects or the market orientations. This books brings forth the impact and importance of market conditions on the development of a new product very succinctly. It begins by looking at the product development cycle and then leads the reader through the various steps from product design through associated supply-chain management issues to present an overall picture. Appropriately placed illustrative examples and well depicted system diagrams along with graphical display of results increase the utility of the book for both, the in-depth researcher as also the casual reader."},{"Title":"Pennsy Q Class (PRR 4-4-6-4 Steam Locomotives) - Classic Power No. 5","review":"E.T.

She admits to difficulties in attributing Colossians to the Apostle Paul, but in the long run claims that it \\"can still best be explained as written or authorized by Paul during his own lifetime.\\" The real contribution of this volume is the sections on the theology of each letter -- which in each case is near the length of the commentary proper. Especially enjoyable is her treatment of the church as \\"new humanity\\" in the theological section on Philemon. This volume won't replace those of Bockmuehl, Dunn, O'Brien, or Wright, but it worthy to stand beside them."},{"Title":"Colossians and Philemon (Two Horizons New Testament Commentary)","review":"Very good commentary, brief and to the point; not too wordy and shorter than other commentaries, while still holding a good overview of the books!"},{"Title":"Ladies on Hold","review":"I love this book. I had to make myself put it down. It is a page turner. I love the suspense and mystery in this book. There are so many twist and turn in this book, it is like riding a new and exciting roller coaster. The scenes are so real. The characters will make you think of people you know in your everyday life. Reading this book, you will laugh, cry, and scream to the top of your lungs. Symone, Narissa, and Otavia have trials of life but they overcome. Some of the others character learn what life is truly. Deanna is another interesting woman who you will grow to love like I did along with some of the other characters. There is drama on top of drama. There is love, murder, and absolutely great sex. Take notes on the sex scenes because they are something you may find useful in your own life. Have fun while reading \\"Ladies On Hold.\\" Reading this is one of the best thing you can do this because it is just that good. There some of the characters who make the gossip and have their dity laundry aired. On a more serious note, this book made me re-evaluate my life ----my goals, my dreams, my wants, and my fantasies, I started to put things in perspective while reading and definitely after I finshed the book. I think this book came at a time in my life when I really needed it. I am becoming more focused. I am more of myself than ever before. I love this. I am no longer ON HOLD. Good Life here i come. Thanks to the author for writing such a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Ladies on Hold","review":"The title took me back a bit because lots of people (especially men) read books on women who were done wrong and cringe. Putting aside my judgment, I found this book to be quite a 'loving and healing experience.' These women realized their mistakes and took action to reveal and heal while allowing themselves to love who they were and be loved. The men were loving and vulnerable yet strong and kept it real. It is also a lesson for those who think they can get away with 'murder'....so true...karma can be a b****!!"},{"Title":"The Bush Was Blazing But Not Consumed","review":"A follow-up to the author's &quot;The Wolf Shall Dwell With the Lamb&quot; this volume picks up on the earlier work and presents helpful techniques for those who work with peoples from varying cultural backgrounds, particularly when there is conflict or misunderstanding between groups. An earlier review is apparently written by a reader who assumes that anyone who has a differing background is inferior -- this is exactly the mindset that is counter-productive when working among diverse cultures. I would highly recommend the readers begin with the earlier work as it is referenced extensively in this volume."},{"Title":"The Bush Was Blazing But Not Consumed","review":"A great follow up to Rev. Law's first book, &quot;The Wolf Shall Dwell With The Lamb.&quot; Highly recommended for people who work in a multi-racial faith community."},{"Title":"Perfect harmony (Wondergirls)","review":"Have you ever felt as if you were nervous? Or have been in a competition and didn't want to mess it up for your team? Well Traci the main character in Wonder Girls felt.Traci is a sixth grade clarinet player from Wonder Lake Middle School. Her orchestra is going to the semi-finals. Traci can play all her other pieces fine, but when she gets to the hard part in the Mozart piece she squeaks. A boy named Adam from Colindale offered to help. Her friends Ryan and Felicia have a bad feeling about this boy. They try to tell Traci that he's bad news but she thinks he is really awesome for helping her. Traci and Adam start to hang out a lot. Felicia gets mad because Traci never hangs out with her. So its time for the competition and Traci's school got second place.I thought this book was good book because I could really relate to this book. I mean at my school there is so much drama. I don't think I would change anything about this book. This was an amazing book and I would recommend this book to any one who can relate to school related drama, and hot guys."},{"Title":"The Last Victim: The Extraordinary Life of Florence Maybrick, wife of Jack the Ripper","review":"Wonderful, and very informative. Graham obviously knows a lot about the Maybrick case and Jack the Ripper, and she skillfully weaves a convincing and interesting argument that they were connected. One of the best books I've read lately!"},{"Title":"The Last Victim: The Extraordinary Life of Florence Maybrick, wife of Jack the Ripper","review":"There's no doubt that the story of Florence Maybrick and her trial and travails is a fascinating one, and the author, who is believed to be an indirect descendant of \\"Florrie's\\", has done a very good job of recounting it.The trial of Florence Maybrick for the murder of her husband James and her life afterwards was already one of the most famous sagas in the history of \\"true crime\\" and, as such, has already been the subject of other books.But another more recent treatment is appropriate in light of the recent finding of the diary that identifies James Maybrick as \\"Jack the Ripper\\", the notorious East End serial killer of prostitutes.The diary's authenticity and the identification of Maybrick as the \\"Ripper\\" have been hotly disputed since the diary was first made public. Shirley Harrison's publication of the diary, complete with commentary, and Paul Feldman's investigative work are excellent treatments of the subject, which strongly suggest that the diary is indeed genuine and that the most famous unsolved serial killings are no longer unsolved.But this particular book will disappoint those who are primarily interested in the Maybrick/Ripper angle. As Ms. Graham candidly states in her forward, she did not write the book with the intention of providing any more proof that James Maybrick was the Ripper; she has left that task to others. Therefore, this book does not add any information to that produced by Harrison and Feldman.Instead, this is principally \\"Florrie's\\" story, and the author has simply incorporated the Maybrick/Ripper information produced by the others and woven it into the fabric of Florrie's story. And that story stands on its own, but it leaves the reader even more puzzled about how Florrie and her associates, to an individual, managed to keep their amazing knowledge secret even BEYOND their deaths. The book disappoints in that it makes the Maybrick/Ripper connection a little MORE speculative, not less so."},{"Title":"The Last Victim: The Extraordinary Life of Florence Maybrick, wife of Jack the Ripper","review":"Since the Maybrick ripper diary has been proven a hoax, I found this book about his so called murder at the hands of his much younger American wife fascinating. Was she really guilty of murdering her husband, a known arsenic addict for years, or was she judged guilty before the trial even had begun for the greater sin of indulging in an extramarital affair, something the Victorians considered more unannatural and abhorrent than murder. She was caught in her infidelity so when she was charged with murder it was an easy leap for a jury to convict her though she protested her innocence to the end.If you're interested in learning about this young American Southern belle who marries a British business man over twenty years her senior and is eventually accused of poisoning him, this book is for you.If you're more interested in James Maybrick as Jack the Ripper, try reading one of the ripper diaries attributed to him.I found Florrie Maybrick and her stalwart mother interesting characters in their own rights and this book was everything I hoped it would be. I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"The eyes of the woods: A story of the ancient wilderness (The young trailers series / by Joseph A. Altsheler)","review":"When I was in seventh and eighth grades in the 1950's, Joseph A. Altsheler was one of my favorite authors and I read several of his books. When I was in the middle of The Eyes of the Woods, my grandmother in her late 70's picked it up to see what I was reading. She was not an avid reader of novels but she wound up reading this book from cover to cover and for days she raved about how wonderful it was. I thought so, too. This is clearly a book that appeals to the young and the old and probably everyone in between. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"For Which It Stands: An Anecdotal History of the American Flag","review":"Perfect for the flag day (June 12th) birthday gift or the patriotic flag bearer who wants to know flag ettiquet."},{"Title":"Class Actions and Other Multi-Party Litigation: Cases and Materials","review":"I am the professor majoring in law in South Korea.I am an attorney of N.Y State. I earned LL.M. degree at the George Washington Law School in 1995.I read the book. And I was very impressed by it's high quality.I strongly recommand this book.Recently, the modern disputes which accompany collective and diffused damages such as consumer conflicts and pollution conflicts occur frequently because of the rapid industrialization and the complexity of social environment. But the present litigation system can't relieve damages satisfactorily. On account of that, public criticism is aroused in the form of the collective enmity of the people. It is the judicial settlement that fixes the conflicts desirably.To cope with these conflicts, there is Class Action, Citizen Suits in America and Verbandsklage in Germany. In Korea, the discussion to introduce Class Action is being hotly spread out.In the position of a plaintiff, the collective litigation system is the useful means of judicial relief for many victims with small sum damage. In the position of court, the collective litigation system can promote the judicial efficiency through the unificative decision.There is quite differences between the two systems. The Verbandsklage of Germany gives the right to litigate only to the qualified organizations while the Class Action of America gives the right to litigate to a private person in principle and doesn't limit it to a specific person.Moreover, the Class Action of America is applied to the post-relief of damages yet happened but the Verbandsklage is used to hinder damages from happening by preventing offenses. In the back of these differences, there are differences of legal culture between the two nations. Germany fundamentally has a collective legal culture or legal culture centering around the legislative body while America has an indivisualistic legal culture. Therefore, in the Class Action of America, an individual takes the lead and the individualistic profit is an important object. But in the Verbandsklage of Germany, groups take the lead and the public profit is an important aim.The identity of the Korean environmental law must be secured not through closure and insulation but through open-hearted attitude and positive groping.The introduction of Class Action doesn't settle all questions. The important thing is not the introduction of the collective litigation system but its proper administration and strong will to settle the question. In this sense this book will contribute the development ofKorean class action law.Again I strongly recommand this book."},{"Title":"The Bombast Transcripts: Rants and Screeds of RageBoy","review":"This is the crash course in understanding the fundamentals of the necessity of change as seen through the eyes of the author, Christopher Locke. Everything you previously thought was lore is turned on its head in riotous fashion in The Bombast Transcripts. Each chapter takes apart some standard you thought was a given, an immutable and constant attribute of practically every aspect of life in the western world.The best part is that Chris does it in so many different ways in one book. There's flat out ranting and there's cutting ridicule including interviews with himself, Rupert Murdoch and the famous one with Mr Ed. (Yes, the horse.)Using those cliched critic's terms of rollercoaster ride or rollicking good yarn don't do this volume any justice whatsoever. In fact, this book defies any label you might care to ascribe.In fact, I defy anyone to come up with a label for this book."},{"Title":"The Bombast Transcripts: Rants and Screeds of RageBoy","review":"That was my introduction just over a year ago to Entropy Gradient Reversals and the evil genius mind(s) behind it, Christopher Locke/RageBoy. From that first mind-blowing, breathless reading of his newsletter, I was alternately charmed, alarmed and disarmed by the decidedly unpretentious Chris Locke. His new book, the Bombast Transcripts, a collection of essays previously published to the Entropy Gradient Reversals mailing list, contains that first newsletter that caught my imagination, and so many more.As I've read through this book, I have found myself again reacting to it in the visceral way that I had to become accustomed to as one of his faithful Valued Readers at EGR. While some may call him pompous and crass, I find him to be merely open and honest. Then again, I've always had a soft spot for intelligent, over-indulgent, semi-vulgar Don Quixotes. His chosen windmills are big business that don't have a clue (IBM et all, no small potatoes here) and, while a book about business practices would normally make my eyes glaze over while putting me in a semi-catatonic state, I find this book to be human and engaging at every turn. Each essay stands on it's own as either a rant or a screed, yet each could also be expanded into its own little book. Irreverent, engaging, transforming, contemplative, hilarious....and each page is more of the same.While I read Locke's words, I get the feeling that I am a part of something much bigger and more important than anyone can guess, especially those that think the internet is nothing more than a collection of chatrooms and porn sites. No, I get the feeling I'm getting a glimpse of a creation, a rapturous inferno of truth and emotion, two key elements that, when exposed to each other under the heat of RageBoy's passion, cause a brilliant flash of evolution that could change the world as we know it. What a wonderful world that would be.Idealistic? Maybe. Bombastic? Hardly. Evil Genius?? Indeed."},{"Title":"The Bombast Transcripts: Rants and Screeds of RageBoy","review":"I've liked reading Chris Locke (aka Rageboy, aka Chief Blogging Officer) since he and fellow authors Rick Levine, Doc Searls, and David Weinberger showed how the Internet was turning business upside down with their original publication ofThe Cluetrain Manifestoabout a decade ago. They had argued that commerce should be about conversations, no matter what the medium, and should not be about transactions. This was pretty heady stuff a decade ago, and this book did cause a number of CEOs to examine their own businesses... but maybe not enough of them.I was working for a now-defunct \\"Internet Super Carrier\\" (google that one) located in Northern Virginia about the time of thepaperback release of that titlein 2001. My associates and I quoted regularly from our copies as we watched our 'Net worlds sinking around us in that strange financial collapse of so many of the telecoms and ISPs during that year.Shortly after getting and reading my original hardbound copy of Cluetrain, I found that Chris Locke had a number of regular online journals to be found, especially his \\"Entropy Gradient Reversals\\" and his \\"Mystic Bourgeoisie.\\" Google them and you'll see that they are still running to this day. (The author of these is also the Chairman Emeritus of \\"The Titanic Deck Chair Rearrangement Corporation\\" NASDAQ:TDCRC, but that's another story in itself.) Chris was already quite experienced at publishing on the Web when some were asking \\"What's a blog?\\"He provided diversionary enlightenment to a number of us as we watched the collapse our so-called 'Net empires that year. Many of the thoughts that the author was noting on his various Web pages and blogs proved to be prophetic.WhenThe Bombast Transcripts: Rants and Screeds of Rageboycame out in early 2002, I bought my first hardbound copy, one that became the merciless victim of a yellow highlighter and numerous Post-It tabs as I furiously noted sections that I felt were worth referencing for future use. All of this was taking place during a frantic search for a new IT project management leadership position and a personal domestic relations meltdown.That book was \\"borrowed\\" by a colleague last year and never returned. As it's a critical one on my IT reference shelf, was pleased to find it still listed here in the Bargain Book section. I grabbed it, and reading it again has proven to be a pleasure as I've become quite accustomed over the years to RageBoy's gonzo-journalist style. As Publishers Weekly once put it, \\"Resurrect William Burroughs, Charles Bukowski and Ken Kesey, add a dash of Dilbert and that's RageBoy.\\" I'll add a dash of Hunter S. Thompson to that.But now authors Chris Locke, Rick Levine, Doc Searls, and David Weinberger have releasedThe Cluetrain Manifesto: 10th Anniversary Edition, with a new introduction and chapters by the original authors, and commentary by Jake McKee, JP Rangaswami, and Dan Gillmor. A decade after its original publication, their message remains more relevant than ever. Am personally finding this new book to be truly essential reading for anybody interested in the 'Net and e-commerce, and it's especially vital for businesses navigating the topography of the wired marketplace.But if you want an even broader understanding of Cluetrain, tryThe Bombast Transcripts: Rants and Screeds of Rageboyas a companion volume of sorts. It's not for everyone, and some may even find him irreverent and slightly offensive (I did not). He'll either charm or alarm you, but Chris has a way with words that is unforgettable.Calling this one a 5-star read. And apologies to the author for again bringing up the TDCRC."},{"Title":"The Bombast Transcripts: Rants and Screeds of RageBoy","review":"I only have one thing to say about this: &quot;The Solution is Poetry&quot;.

Wow. Rageboy's ways are faster than America realizes. Blessed by more than a wit of words, Rageboy (AKA Chris Locke) steps three ahead in the market place. Who else would approach this strategy? Who else could get away with it?!?

Good question, honestly I am still pondering it mulling it over in my head and probably will for a bit. It is a quick read, it's an interesting read, but fundamentally it's not a light read. It takes a little time for digestion and pondering... I suspect I will read it again in the next month or two and reconsider, hell maybe throw this whole review out.So here's my advice go buy the book, RageBoy needs the cash. If you like Tom Robbins, Hunter S Thompson, and the Gonzo style read away, you'll enjoy it. Perhaps you will find some stuff to digest, even without ingesting any substances on the Schedule I drug list.If you didn't like Cluetrain Manifesto, Gonzo Marketing, or any Gonzo writing buy the book anyways, for the reasons stated above. Then hide the book in your bookshelf and wait until a really dark night, one in which your soul is screaming for mercy while the night rages in a Category 5 Hurricane and your only fresh reading material is a copy of Reader's Digest you have flipped through already 15 times. Your mind goes hungry, for something unanswered and unknown, and you will recall this book hiding in some dark corner of the bookshelf covered in dust and a three month old edition of Fast Company magazine. You will pull it off the shelf and find yourself drawn to the words expressed inside and the walls of illusion come crashing down inside your mind. Either that or you'll take a gun and pull a Hemmingway.

It features a variety of projects to suit anyone's taste, including stationery, interiors, fabric, furniture and decorative objects. Though many of them look very sophisticated and time consuming, they are very quick and easy to create.The book starts out with the basics of photocopying such as making enlarging and reducing, reversing as image, adapting an image to fit a standard format and paper selection. Copyright issues are also discussed. Both black &amp; white and color copies are used in the book and these are available at very reasonable prices from most print shops if you do not have direct access to the right kind of copier.The projects follow. Most are very simple to make and use easy to find supplies. The instructions are excellent and include step-by-step instructions accompanied by illustrations. A large full-color picture of the finished project is also shown. Some of my favorites include fish wall adornments, a classical fireplace, a timepiece valance, patchwork kitchen curtains, a canceled postage stamp T-shirt and magnets. I love the idea of photocopying your child's artwork and putting on a cupboard.As a bonus, the book includes several pages of black &amp; white images to use in your artwork including many of the elements used in the projects. This makes a nice house-warming gift and some projects are great for kids too."},{"Title":"Creative Photocopying: Using the Photocopier for Crafts, Design, and Interior Decoration","review":"Re: another reviewer's comments regarding the cumbersome conversion and outdated technology - well, I hate math more than anybody, but I still think this book is worth it, and I don't think technology, in regard to copy machines, has changed all that much since 1997 (the publication date of the book). Yes, you can now use scanners and printers to digitally manipulate images, (if that is what the other reviewer meant by technology, I'm not sure) but that's not what this book is about. All you really need to know is that you should use a machine that uses TONER, not any kind of water-based ink. Toner is archival, water-based ink is not, and is prone to fade at a much faster rate, especially in sunlight, of course. It used to be that all copy machines only used toner. While this is no longer the case, there are still plenty of toner-based machines (in black AND color, go to your local copy store) available.The ideas in it are original and extremely creative. I flipped when I saw this book, and had to have it. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in craft / creative hobbies, and I'm pretty darn picky about what books I choose to buy."},{"Title":"Creative Photocopying: Using the Photocopier for Crafts, Design, and Interior Decoration","review":"This title was included in a Carol Duval show recently and sounded like a good purchase for general craft use. It wasn't. First, it's over a decade old and hasn't been updated. So many things have changed since this was written that much of what they say is now irrelevant particularly in the technology area. Second, it's written by an English couple which means those of us in the States have to convert many examples as we go. There are a large number of black and white sample designs at the back of the book which could be useful to some. Also for those involved in papermaking and decorating paper it has some useful information. However, OVERALL it's really outdated and not a smart buy for the general crafter."},{"Title":"Wine Cellars: An Exploration of Stylish Storage","review":"Beautiful pictures, it gives you plenty of things to talk about and think about if you are planning a wine cellar.

Found that many of the photos are poor quality/amateur in nature. Some cellars displayed are spectacular but many are ho-hum. Nor does the book have any substantive material. Simple text descriptions accompany photos but only so much can be learned by looking at pictures. I agree with other reviews that this is a good coffee table or \\"idea\\" book. However, I expected more interesting photos with meaningful descriptions of the space, conditions, materials, lighting, etc... If you have to have it buy it used.A much better book is: The Home Wine Cellar: A Complete Guide To Design And Construction by Perry Sims.

The author explains his subject both in simple, practical terms (for example - a quick and easy way to decrease the lag time of a variometer is to stuff a few copper wool scrubbing pads into the capacity bottle to diminish the effects of temperature change), and also a generous discussion of theoretical and mathematical information including equations to solve many common tactical and strategic questions (for example - a sailplane polar can be expressed fairly accurately, for use in calculations, by the quadratic equation). This is not an introductory work - it presupposes some knowledge of soaring, however, anyone interested in the topic will be able to understand a lot of it. Just remember that Reichmann was a world champion soaring pilot with a Ph.D., having written his thesis on this same subject."},{"Title":"Cross-Country Soaring (Streckensegelflug), 7th Edition","review":"THE standard read for the intermediate soaring pilot.

This book should be mandatory reading for any person considering becoming a pilot, no matter what the level. Never mind that it lacks current data on final glide computers. Just look when it was first published, back in BC. (Before computers)! Besides any half baked nitwit can interpolate and extrapolate the data to an electric box! Don't forget that these boys flew without all that fancy gadgetry and relied on little more than ingenuity and the occasional prayer wheel. Anybody who challeges Helmuts position better have flown several thousand kilometer flights before they dare mumble their insipid inaccurate opinions. The attention to detail in Helmuts book is beyond reproach. I will never sell my copy, not for any price. Get them while you can and learn many of the ancient secrets of soaring flight.

This book provides the reader with a comprehensive overview of the fundamentals of cross country soaring, including in-flight strategy and decision making, weather analysis, sailplane performance calculations, basic flying skills, etc. This is a technical manual on soaring, but it should be read in a serious manner by every soaring pilot.

The book has both technique and theory, beautifully arranged, and is a phenomenal resource for student or master. My instructor urged me (and my 16-year old son, who is also a motorglider student)to get the book and read it. It is obvious why: the book reads like you're sitting at the feet of the world's premier soaring pilot who loves to teach and loves those who want to learn. His passion for the sport comes through as does his Ph.D. expertise and his decades of championship soaring.

The photographs are stunning. They help the reader see the great contrasts between the various classes of Petersburg's people. While one might enjoy the fine views of the city's palaces and pictures of the Tsars and other members of the upper classes, the vivid pictures of the city's flophouses (dross houses) remind the reader of the hideous gap between the rich and the poor classes. This book is a must read for history buffs who want to see what life was like in pre-World War I Russia. It is entirely suitable for the family--the pictures will surely grab the attention of school-age children, while the older readers will enjoy the highly readable texts which accompany the photographs. The last photograph in this book is quite poignant. It shows Tsar Nicholas II at the balcony of his palace at the start of Russia's participation in World War I. One can tell, from Nicholas' face, that his decision to participate in that war would be, in the end, a fatal one. World War I would help hasten the end of the Russian monarchy and the coming of the Soviet regime."},{"Title":"St. Petersburg: Portrait of an Imperial City","review":"The pictures and history were wonderful.

I'm used to finding great technical content in their books--that's what they're famous for--but media tools like DVD Studio Pro require a more visual approach for explanation, and Marc delivers this extremely effectively.The examples are numerous, on target, and very thorough. They walk you through the process of learning and achieving anything you might need to produce a compelling, professional DVD experience. And what really struck me is how unbelievably good the book looks. Every page is beautiful, glossy color with a clean, easy-to-follow layout, and huge numbers of screen shots and visuals.If you have a chance to flip through this book in person you'll realize how much you need it when you're starting to create DVDs. Or you can order it sight unseen and be pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"DVD Studio Pro 3 In The Studio (O'Reilly Digital Studio)","review":"The Apple DVD Studio Pro is a popular but very complex tool for authoring DVDs. This book shows why it is popular, and also offers an improvement on the Apple documentation. The program has immense ability to record audio and video and to merge these in as intricate a fashion as you desire. There is a panoply of editing functions. For such things as adding subtitles to video tracks. Or supporting several languages using the audio tracks. Or to have a multistory project.Where ever possible, the book shows how Studio Pro has automated the steps in each of these tasks. There are many colour screen captures revealing the menus you invoke, and the results they generate.Plus, in today's Web oriented world, Studio Pro lets you insert hyperlinks using DVD@ccess. These links can go into menus, markers and slides. So that the user can reach out into the Web (or local files). In this way, you can use the DVD and Web to complement each other. Imagine producing a game DVD with links to your website. So that a gamer can easily engage in a multiplayer scenario, or download the latest 3 dimensional world. In this way, you can offer more fresh material to the gamer. Increases the value of your website, and helps you get paid."},{"Title":"DVD Studio Pro 3 In The Studio (O'Reilly Digital Studio)","review":"If ever Apple made an application that could use some usability work it's DVD Studio Pro. It's a comprehensive and powerful application that has a user interface that only a mother could love. That's why I found this book so critical. It's an end-to-end guide from the very basics of DVD construction through to using templates and building custom transitions. There are also pitstops along the way into building DVD games and creating easter eggs.As with O'Reilly's other book on DVD construction, Adobe Encore DVD, one of the other benefits of the book is the content ideas that it gives you. Though I found the examples in this book slightly less appealing than those in the Encore book.Very well written with appropriate, not overwhelming, use of screenshots and illustrations. This is a must have for DVD Studio Pro users."},{"Title":"DVD Studio Pro 3 In The Studio (O'Reilly Digital Studio)","review":"but I found this book to be one of the most difficult tutorial references I've ever used.Firstly, it appears that there was a second release of the DVD that accompanies the book and some of the file references don't match what's in print (e.g., you are told to look for a file called \\"filename_unfinished\\", but that file isn't on the DVD). Secondly, some of the lessons either omit steps or don't include all of the information you need to thoroughly understand it. The author will say \\"Don't worry about setting the target for this button - we'll do that later\\" and then you never do that so when you run your simulation, your project doesn't do what it's supposed to (unless you figure it out for yourself). I've been through most of the chapters at this point and I did learn a lot (thanks to already being an advanced user) - but I have to say it wasn't easy and that's not because the software is difficult to learn, but because this book is really not well written or organized.Thirdly - my biggest pet peeve - the author loves tangents into lessons involving other software and it sometimes feels like this book was really just designed to sell you about 6 other programs. I do realize the value of all of those programs because I already own and use most of them - but if you didn't, you would simply find this book too frustrating to deal with because of all the constant sidetracking. The examples that involve forays into Final Cut would require you to have at least intermediate skills in the program to be able to finish the lesson. Ditto for those that involve Photoshop and After Effects. To add insult to injury, in those lessons, the explanations for using the other program are either skeletal or non-existent (barring one example in iMovie for creating a slideshow, which for some odd reason walks you through ever single step). In a nutshell, this book assumes you already know a lot.Also - the scripting information is almost useless. I struggled with the second lesson (which I'm convinced has an incorrect figure in it), learned a few minor things, and afterwards went online and found at least four tutorials that were leaps and bounds better and easier to understand.Don't get me wrong - this book can teach you something, if you're persistent enough. I spent four evenings with it and I've already authored one great project. But I'm an advanced user with some video/audio background already and I still found the book frustrating at times.If you're really interested in learning DVD Studio Pro 3 in an organized and logical manner, save yourself some hair follicles and find a different tutorial."},{"Title":"Colonial Ironwork in Old Philadelphia","review":"Mr. Wallace's studies of Philadelphia's colonial architectural legacy are a must for any self-respecting architect, preservationist, or metalsmith.

Rather it is a fine example of what true Theological examination looks like. Gerhard von Rad takes Genesis and dissects it into fine details. Rarely does von Rad overlook a single detail. Taking into account language, history, and literary device, von Rad deals with Genesis in a way that will open up the stories into a new light, revealing pictures you've never even noticed before.

Its main characters are firefighters, trying to get dressed for the big parade, but they don't have the correct amount of buttons. They have a variety of sizes and shapes but they must be able to sort them in such a way that each firefighter has a set of four. There is a typo in the beginning that talks about the number os sets - it says there needs to be four sets of three instead of three sets of four, but other than that, it's just a great little book. My little one wants it read repeatedly each night. What a great way to start your toddler off right, particularly if you have a boy who loves firetrucks and firefighters! Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"3 Little Firefighters (MathStart 1)","review":"Three young children plan to dress as firefighter for a parage.

Join them as they discover various ways of sorting.I liked the suggested activities in this book that will provide parents with ideas to share with their kids about simple math concepts. An entertaining short picture-book that will delight preschool aged children.We recommed this book because kids will love the pictures and the story line is too cute!"},{"Title":"3 Little Firefighters (MathStart 1)","review":"*3 Little Firefighters* has just under 300 words, and it's part of a series purporting to deal with math skills. So you really have to wonder what kind of breathtakingly incompetent editor would allow a number error to make it into such a small book--on p. 11, the text says, \\"We've got to find four sets,\\" when in fact, the book is only dealing with three sets. Now, obviously, a parent dealing with a child who can't read yet can correct this mistake himself, but I think the error is indicative of the lack of care and thought that has gone into these books. The rhymes lack creativity, the stories have no charm, and most of the books, including this one, try to teach skills that a child should pick up naturally through daily interaction with an adult. My advice: Skip this one; skip the whole series.And whoever was supposed to edit this book at HarperTrophy should learn how to read."},{"Title":"3 Little Firefighters (MathStart 1)","review":"This is a great book to introduce sorting.

Net: This is the best book on people &amp; leadership I have ever read, and Hal Shook is a true American icon. I have worked with many leaders, some excellent and some right out of Dilbert. This book reminds me of the excellent leader, one who can create a win-win scenario for both employees AND customers. The leaders and companies who implement the Flying Spirit formula will have employees delighted to come to work. This is a MUST READ."},{"Title":"Flying Spirit: A Leader's Guide to Creating Great Organizations","review":"It takes a special outlook to draw lessons from life experience, and a rarer genius still to share the benefits of these lessons with other people. Hal Shook has done both by translating lessons learned in the air to those which can be applied on the ground. It shows you how to walk the talk of leadership where it matters most, in organizational life. Flying Spirit is a flight manual for the workplace, addressing critical issues from values and mission to alignment, problem solving, and team effort, demonstrating that organizations are made of, by, and for people. While the book claims to be a leader's guide to creating great organizations, the underlying message is empowerment of the individuals and teams that make up the organization.A common complaint of job seekers and leaders alike is that you can't get a job without experience, and you can't get experience without a job. Experience is the said to be a poor teacher, because it gives the test before the lesson. Flying Spirit gives you both at the same time, through vivid anecdotes from the author's experience, concise questions to focus your thinking, useful reference charts, and interactive exercises that translate ideas into action.After reading this book it will never be so easy to blame the boss or the system, because it shows how adversarial thinking works against everyone. The challenge will be how to apply it where you work, even if it means having to change the place that you work. Wherever you work, this book will show you how to get more out of your work than just a paycheck.I first met Hal &amp; Marilyn Shook over 20 years ago, attending their course in Career and Life Planning, which they still offer through their company, Life Management Services. The emphasis of the course at that time was individual job search and career development, and I remember thinking at the time that this course empowered individuals to use the same tools of creative strategic planning that organizations used. In Flying Spirit it is as if the tools of career and life planning have been boldly reapplied at the organizational level, so that everyone wins.An organization imbued with Flying Spirit will have no problem attracting good people. I would like to see individuals encouraged to expect this kind of approach from the organizations they work for. Some things are worth driving a hard bargain for, and this book shows why."},{"Title":"Flying Spirit: A Leader's Guide to Creating Great Organizations","review":"Flying Spirit is a very good book to add to one's portfolio of resources relating business performance to organizational dynamics. What leaders and managers often fail to recognize is the relationship between product and people. And that to achieve outstanding performance requires that business understand that goals and objectives are only achieved through people.Another vital concept that Flying Spirit speaks to is the alignment of organizational and individual mission-values-players. In great organizations, there is an alignment of shared purpose. The real differentiation among companies is alignment, look at Southwest Airlines as a model for this.Hal Shook takes these principles and shows how they worked for him in the military. Good story telling with a key component of execution, making it all happen.This is a working book. For me highlighted, tabbed and underlined. Very readable.

I wanted a rhyming dictionary I could throw in my purse and consult when the sonnet mood strikes. This is not the most horrible rhyming dictionary I've every used, but it is weirdly organized, and it would help if the introduction explained that the multisyllabic (feminine) rhymes are filed right after the single syllable ones. Once I figured that out, I tried to look up a rhyme for \\"self,\\" but had no joy. For some reason, this word, along with elf, shelf, and pelf, is filed with a random H in it -- ehlf. \\"Sehlf\\"? Excuse me? I noticed that the dictionary seems to want to throw in this odd H in every word that has a short vowel. This doesn't match any phonetic code I ever saw, and I used to teach linguistics. Also, it's small, but it's bigger than my 1963 NEW RHYMING DICTIONARY. And then of course, I can use the web to find rhymes.

A week hunting for the mythological Ogopogo in British Columbia is the perfect thing to break up summer vacation. But they've hardly left before things start going wrong. First, Joel sneaks on board. Then they find dynamite in the motor home they are traveling in. Things only get worse when they arrive. Ricky's going to have to think overtime to put all the pieces together in time to spare his friends' lives.This has been my favorite in the series from the very first time I read it. All the clues are right there in the open, but you never know what they are and what they mean until Ricky tells you. And since he's often confused, that makes things even more interesting. When first published, one aspect of the story was never fully explained, but that's been fixed for the republishing, and it's nice to finally have that answered. The friends are at their teasing best, and there are several laugh-out-loud moments in the story. There are even a couple interesting discussions on science and the Bible thrown in for good measure.I recommend this series to anyone who likes a good mystery story. It's equally fun for kids and adults. This book stands above the rest for its wonderful plotting and strong story."},{"Title":"Creature of the Mists (Accidental Detectives, Book 6)","review":"Even though I'm fourteen and this book is geared toward a 9-12 audience, I love it.

Not to mention, the plot and the mystery are very strong, and keep the pages turning. This is also one of the funniest books I have ever read!"},{"Title":"The End","review":"The best (scariest) part of this novel is that it's now &quot;far fetched&quot; like most stuff in this genre. Cockfield uses actual science and the real world to create a scenario that really REALLY hits home as you read it.This is not a book for people who want to escape into a fantasy world. It's fiction, but not. I highly reccomend it to anyone who's either into Michael Creighton or the Left Behind series of books. It has elements of both. A good read, worth getting."},{"Title":"The End","review":"Surprisingly good read, face-paced, well-written. I read the whole thing in one sitting. Hope this author produces a sequel."},{"Title":"Moby Dick or the Whale Leather Ornate Binding (Collector's Edition)","review":"Moby Dick is one of the canons of American literature. At a superficial level, it is a book about the sea, but in reality, it is about a man's obsession with revenge that lures him into madness and finally self destruction. It's not an easy read, but well worth the effort. The Easton Press version is more than a book, it is a display piece."},{"Title":"The Lady in Gray (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"I am a big fan of Patricia Oliver's, but this book didn't please me as much as her others. Maybe it was the over-the-top rudeness of Nicholas, the main male character, when we are first introduced to him. Maybe it was that Sylvia had lots of social interaction in the neighborhood, even though she was &quot;disgraced.&quot; Maybe it was the irritating love affair between her aunt and her aunt's paramour. I almost put the book away twice unfinished. However, Patricia Oliver is an excellent writer, and I will continue to read her books."},{"Title":"The Lady in Gray (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"I bought this book because I'd loved everything else I've read by Patricia Oliver. Her series of linked books, using recurring characters, is entertaining and very enjoyable and I had initially hoped that this book would be another in the series. It isn't, unfortunately.It was well written, certainly, but the plot unfortunately did not grip me in the way her other books did. That's not to say it isn't a good and well-plotted book, just that for me it doesn't come up to the standard of 'An Unsuitable Match,' or 'Lord Gresham's Lady'."},{"Title":"The Lady in Gray (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"This is the lowest rating I've given any book by Patricia Oliver; I normally rate her books at five stars, with one or two at four stars. For some reason, this book didn't grip me at all, and I found parts of it boring. The characters were not as interesting, and the plot not as entertaining, as her other books.The sub-plot with the painting, and the mystery about the Earl's past and his dead first wife, just didn't appeal to me, and when, close to the end, the heroine's life was at risk I wasn't remotely gripped by any sense of danger. The hero and heroine's antagonism didn't seem to ring true for me either.Not sure why... but this wasn't up to Oliver's usual standards as far as I was concerned. Still way ahead of many other authors in this genre, though!"},{"Title":"The Lady in Gray (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"I read a lot of regencies because they calm my world. Yes, most are predictable and all reflect a time very unlike our own. This book is very poorly written and is one of the few books I didn't bother finishing. What a waste of time. It is very jumbled, repetitive, predictable and disjointed. In my opinion. I just skimmed the last 100 pages of the book and found that almost painful."},{"Title":"The Lady in Gray (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"Lord Nicholas Morley made a disastrous marriage in 1804. He brought his dazzling, and possibly nymphomaniac, bride to his estate in Cornwall where they lived only a few months before she died under mysterious circumstances. He took his mother and aunt and boarded a ship for India where they lived for the next 10 years.At about the same time in 1804, Lady Sylvia Sutherland, a headstrong young woman, stymied the marriage plans her father had arranged by running away with another beau whom she loved and found both handsome, and charming. Two weeks later when she was retrieved by her father she discovered her marriage lines were phony, her \\"husband\\" had deserted her, and she was irretrievably ruined. She was shipped off to an isolated estate in Cornwall to live with a flamboyant, unconventional, artistic aunt who had lived unmarried with her Italian lover for 10 years. For the next 10 years Lady Sylvia poured all of her passion and energy into her art, becoming a professional-grade artist.Nicholas and Sylvia meet shortly after the Morley family returns to their estate in Cornwall, and re-enter the social round (which rather amazingly includes the unmarried aunt, her paramour, and the ruined Lady Sylvia). At this point the story develops into a who-done-it mystery around the death of Nicholas's wife 10 years earlier.There are a number of lost opportunities in this story. For example, Sylvia's aunt and her paramour are an undeveloped secondary romance. After a 20-year love affair which still sizzles after-all-these-years (we are never told why they never married), we are told several times that the Italian lover wants to marry Sylvia's aunt. She refuses but we are never really told why, and her continued refusal appears to cause no strain in their relationship. In another vein, Lady Sylvia always wear gray. Why? This idiosyncrasy is never addressed, though Nicholas near the end has a vision of her by the entry door of his castle wearing a green dress. Perhaps gray was for half-mourning--though it had usually been trimmed with pink--and green for new life).Finally, Lord Nicholas was thoroughly humiliated by his late wife (so much so that he moved to India for 10 years and only returned to Cornwall due to concerns about his mother's health), and yet Lady Sylvia is offended by his pride and feels he needs to be taken down a couple of notches. I thought it a shame that Nicholas fell in love with Sylvia.This is my first story from Patricia Oliver. I read reviews of several of her books here and so went to my public library to find one of her works. The Lady in Gray was a disappointment. Cousin Kate, or The Quiet Gentleman by Georgette Heyer are along the same lines, but much better written."},{"Title":"The Lady in Gray (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"I was stuck re-reading some Regency novels at a relative's house - ones I had loaned them and had already read before. I picked up The Lady in Gray and remembered it as one I enjoyed before. As I write my review, I am surprised by the other reviews. I found the characters interesting and the plot different than most other Regency novels. The mystery surrounding the former Lady Longueville's death and her rather risque behavior was very unusual. There are few books that show what happens to a woman after her fall from grace. Sylvia was sent to a loving relative's home and seemed to be well treated - I am sure that was NOT the outcome for most disgraced girls. The flashbacks from the Earl's point of view about his marriage to Angelica added very positively to the storyline. He did seem to change his tune very quickly from wanting Sylvia to be his mistress to wanting her as his wife. I am not sure the story showed the emotional connection to have pulled that off as quickly as it did. But this book held my attention and I was happy to have spent an afternoon reading it again."},{"Title":"Rousseau and romanticism","review":"Not Babbitt's greatest work.

Most of the lyrics are 4 lines, relatively short lines so that the poetry must be clear and precise - nothing extraneous or wasted. An example:When daylight comesmy griefs begin to grow;only the shadows of darkest nightcomfort my soul.If haiku is the poetry of observation, observation of what is true (in a Buddhist sense), these poems are the poetry of passion - pleasurable and/or horrible.

Some people hide these feeling. Our Gypsy brothers and sisters relish them."},{"Title":"Rites and Religions of the Anglo-Saxons","review":"This particular book on Anglo-Saxon Heathenism is unique to my knowledge in that it extends its subject matter to all the religions known to have been practiced by the Anglo-Saxons, and thus discusses their practice of Catholic Christianity as well. It sets the stage for the arrival in Britain of the peoples who became the Anglo-Saxons by pointing out that Celtic and Greco-Roman Paganism, as well as Christianity (both the form which due mostly to political patronage eventually became the \\"catholic\\" i.e. \\"universal\\" form and various \\"heresies\\") predated in Britain the Germanic Heathenism brought in by the Anglo-Saxons.In the first chapter, the use of Scandinavian sources to elucidate the fragmentary remains of Anglo-Saxon Heathenism is taken for granted. Tacitus' Germania is also consulted. As in all books of this sort, the role of place-names in determining which Gods the early English worshipped receives due attention. More information can be extracted from the writings of the venerable Bede and other Old English authors. Quotes from these are supplied both in the original Old English and in translation. English runic inscriptions and art and artifacts hinting at Heathen rites and beliefs are also important sources of information.The second chapter, \\"Everyday life in Pagan times,\\" looks at both literary remnants and the archaeological record. The results of the excavation of a likely Heathen temple at Yeavering in Northumberland are described. A brief exposition of the possible religious/cultural significance of the individual Runes of the Anglo-Saxon Futhork adds to the value of this book for the modern Heathen reader.The third chapter discusses cremation and inhumation burials, mostly of the common folk. The fourth chapter describes ship burials, the probable howe of King Rdwald at Sutton Hoo being of course the best known. This custom was likely of Scandinavian, specifically Swedish derivation and was reserved for the upper tiers of society.The remaining chapters deal with Christianity among the Anglo-Saxons but still hold much interest for the Heathen reader. Happily, the British/Welsh were quite content to leave the English in their Heathenism as an easy way, from their jaundiced perspective, to consign their hereditary enemies to \\"hell.\\" They only got in on the burgeoning missionary enterprise after the Italians under St. Augustine began the whole conversion process. This entire sad story is told in more detail than you'll probably want to read. However, many interesting tidbits of information come to light in the process. For instance, the Catholic Christianity of that time was not all that much more homogenous than Heathenry was!Heathenism enjoyed a brief and initially promising renaissance when Vikings settled in England, but was in steep decline by the Norman conquest of 1066, which ended the Anglo-Saxon period. One likely reason for its failure was that, unlike in the Harry Harrison alternative history trilogy beloved of many Heathens, the Vikings failed (or more likely never even tried) to interest the native English in their religion. A Benedictine-led renewal of Christian religious life, patronized enthusiastically by the last Anglo-Saxon kings, was instrumental in the extirpation of Heathenism. On that sad note, Rites and Religions of the Anglo-Saxons draws to a close. This is just as well from a Heathen viewpoint as the centuries which follow hold little of religious interest to us.The England which would emerge at the end of Norman rule, I should elaborate, would be a far different place both culturally and linguistically. There would be nothing \\"Heathen\\" left there besides the names of a relative handful of places, most already worn down to the point of unintelligibility, the days of the week, and some originally Heathen folklore and customs, many of which would be suppressed by the Puritans following the establishment of the Protestant Reformation in that nation.While it is sometimes lacking in depth and detail, I nevertheless recommend this book as a good general overview and introduction to its subject. Rites and Religions of the Anglo-Saxons was originally copyrighted in 1981, while the edition I purchased came out in 1996. Although this work is out of print, there were a couple of copies listed on amazon.com at a reasonable price if you cannot obtain it via interlibrary loan."},{"Title":"E-learning Companion: A Student&#039;s Guide to Online Success","review":"I bought this book as my professor wanted citations from it, for an assignment, to be honest, I never opened it again.

Some people just can't improve their bodies very much regardless of their workouts.A few things I like about this book though are: the split. It suggests a push, pull, legs/abs split along with cardio. I haven't found a more convenient split. BUT, don't think this split will work wonders and make you gain muscle and better than any other because it won't.I did the lean body promise to a tee for 2 years, and frankly it doesn't work much if any better than just working out any old way.Frankly, the big wonderful eating many times a day everyone pretends is a god's gift to bodybuilding hasn't helped me one bit.

He does not consult any scientific reference, let alone educating himself about common social, psychological, or physiological issues that interplay in health and fitness.His secrets for success in bodybuilding were mainly due to eating less and exercising more. That he explains rightfully as inducing \\"calorie-deficit\\" in order to rid off excess fat. Yet, he believes that with such individual personal circumstances he could master the whole knowledge of nutrition and health applicable to diverse and wide human population. For example, he argues that there are two main reasons that cause people to fail in maintaining healthy and fit living and describes them as (1) map or knowledge of what to do and (2) fuel or motivation to keep doing it. That is very simplistic approach to understating why people end up the way they are. Socioeconomic factors play greater role in the final outcome of engaging in fitness. Moreover, when people start exercising late in life, change is exceedingly difficult with or without motivation or knowledge.By relying solely on his shallow understanding of nutrition, the author erred on describing the macronutrients and their caloric meaning. For example, he classifies carbohydrates as a separate category from fruits, vegetables, and deserts, which sound like carbohydrates aren't chemical ingredients of food but rather their generic names. He also makes the common mistake that a single gram of alcohol contains about seven calories, on Page 92. Moreover, he claims that alcohol hardens your arteries without citing any authoritative reference.His poor knowledge in anatomy is demonstrated on Page 124, where he advocates that the Sit-ups and the Good Mornings should be outlawed because the former trains the iliopsoas while the latter stresses the low back. As if the iliopsoas muscle is not vital to healthy spine or stressing the low back differs from stressing other joints for the sake of strengthening them. From his workout chapter, you could easily see his sole emphasis on the upper body, using machines, and isolation exercises. He does not recognize the existence of \\"power clean\\" or coordinated lifting. All his workout routines are imitation of many books on weight lifting that are mainly geared for profit with minimal effort on the author's part. His statement that bending the legs in the sit-ups converts them into crunches shows his inaptitude in understanding muscular function. His understanding of fitness as massive musculature has caused him a hunched upper back that many bodybuilder experience due to building excessive and isolated muscles without checking their functional balance in the interim of building up.The flawed data in the inspiration chapter are apparent in the very low body fat index in chubby males. Some falls in the range of 6% to 12% for apparently not so skinny folks while a skeleton-like man in his photos has an 18% body fat index. It sounds like the author believes that body fat index is the ultimate index for assessing fitness. These inaccuracies in presenting data add to the general impression of a sloppy author. Also, starting each chapter with his own photo is another paranoid fix. Had the author strived to educate himself on the physiology and anatomy of exercise, he might have succeeded on transforming his personal success in bodybuilding into a wider scope of educating others with more humble attitude other than claiming to transform the whole state of Texas into a less-fat state.Mohamed F.

The only downside are the \\"jokes\\" that for an international odiens are not funny. It is a bit \\"too american\\". My suggestion would have been to keep it more targetted to the worldwide population.I also would have used more colours for \\"visual\\" people."},{"Title":"The Lean Body Promise CD: Burn Away Fat and Release the Leaner, Stronger Body Inside You","review":"I've been in the fitness industry for over a decade and have seen many many \\"starter programs.\\" Most become short-lived fads and overemphasize one thing or another (no carbs, or no fats, or all strength training, etc.)The first one in my view to be time-efficient, well-balanced and effective was Body for Life by Bill Phillips. That's a great program, based on well-accepted science, for a 12 week jumpstart to fitness, nutrition, weight loss, looking and feeling good.The minor problems with Phillip's approach, in my view, were that it was a bit rigid and becoming slightly dated on a couple points.Lean Body Promise, I feel, is as good as Body for Life, and improves on it in several ways:- First, it is ALMOST identical to Body for Life. In fact, the author cites Phillips in his acknowledgements.- While both are highly motivational and nicely written, I felt Phillips is a little over the top in some of the emotional fluff -- Labrada strikes a bit better balance- The strength programs are both split routines. Phillips uses an upper body / lower body split. Labrada uses a push, pull, legs split. Phillips does an ascending half pyramid with a super set at the end. Labrada uses 3 sets of 10 reps on 2 exercises per muscle group. These are both perfectly valid and widely used approaches to strength training. I prefer Labrada's mainly because I don't have to change the weights every set! But overall, you're doing about 6 sets per muscle group with a minute of rest in each program.- The CV programs are both interval training. Phillips is 20 minutes with 5 different settings, changing every minute. Labrada does a 26 minute routine with 3 levels changing less frequently. Again, both are extremely effective and time efficient, but I slightly prefer Labrada's because you're not constantly changing the machine level every minute.- Diet is extremely similar too. 5-6 meals, spread every few hours. A palm of lean protien, a fist of whole grain carbs, some veggies... A shake or a bar when you're rushed. Phillips prescribes 1 cheat day per week. Labrada prescribes 2 cheat meals per week. Very similar. This REALLY works though -- takes a couple weeks to get used to, but you don't feel hungry and you get fast results. And it's not a half-baked fad -- this is good science of a balanced healthy diet you can live with long term.- Rotation of workouts: Phillips alternates cv and strength each day, with 1 off-day per week. Labrada does 2 strength then 1 cv, with a suggestion that you fill in an extra cv or 2 per week on light strength days. He doesn't build in a day off, but assumes you might miss a day here and there, in which case you pick up where you left off. I like that approach a lot -- there's some built in flexibility to add the cv when you can fit it in. There isn't a fixed expectation that you can schedule your off day perfectly.Again, I like the notion that Labrada builds in that you're going to miss a day here and there. That you might be faced with only unhealthy meal choices at a party some time. Etc. And he gives specific suggestions on dealing with those. He also gives suggestions on dealing with the desire to overdo it at times. Phillips, while also excellent, prescribes more rigidly and as a result doesn't build in a lot of information on how to recover from speedbumps.Overall, this is a great program that you're absolutely going to see results on if you follow, and hopefully can make an ongoing lifestyle change using.You can't go wrong with Phillips either, but I think this one's a little easier to stick with and will give the same results."},{"Title":"The Lean Body Promise CD: Burn Away Fat and Release the Leaner, Stronger Body Inside You","review":"I was skeptical when I first thought about getting The Lean Body Promise. I had tried every other book out there that promised to help me lose weight, be healthy, and feel better. None of them worked. I've always been \\"husky\\"; it's been like that since I was a kid.As I sat thinking about the book for a day or two, I wondered: could this be the book that finally works for me?In the past I had gotten my hopes up about other books, only to end up wasting my money and being disappointed. So, I wasn't expecting much this time. I also decided that I wasn't going to buy another book on getting healthy if The Lean Body Promise didn't work. If it didn't work, I figured that I was probably meant to be the way I've always been - husky.When the book came in the mail, I wanted to open it, but I didn't. I let it sit on my coffee table for a couple of day, and I'd look at it whenever I walked to my kitchen. I didn't know what to expect when I finally opened it, but I was curious. I got excited right away.On the first page I read that I could do anything - if I had the truth about how to be healthy. I also learned that it wasn't my fault for failing before on other programs - and that this time was going be different because this book told the truth.I was still skeptical, but as I flipped through the book, I saw that all of the tools I needed to get healthy were there. And, to my surprise, I actually understood the advice in it. It was refreshing to know what to do, and to know why I was doing it. It was simple. It all made sense. I was relieved.Unlike other books and programs I've tried, there were no confusing \\"points\\" to add up, no scientific terms that only a doctor can understand, and I didn't have to live in the gym for hours (I have a real life!), or end up starving myself.I love food. I always have. I always will. My mom was a great cook, and at this point in my life, I'm not going to give up my favorite foods. The only problem is that sometimes I eat too much of what I love, and I end up feeling sick. My wife always tells me to stop, but I usually don't listen.Now that I'm doing the program, I can still eat what I love, but I've learned to eat less - to eat in moderation. I don't have to starve myself, and I don't have to give up what I love. Now, I enjoy my favorite foods without feeling sick, or guilty.This book has a section of recipes. I'd like to see more because there's only a few of them, but they all taste pretty good. I'm never hungry when I eat now, and I don't get strong cravings anymore. In fact, I'm eating more now than I've ever eaten.This book also got me off of the couch so now I'm more active. I'm not a gym rat, but it's pretty easy to follow the weight programs in the book; all I do is take the book to the gym with me, look at the pictures, and do the exercises. 30 minutes later, I'm heading home.I've been doing the Lean Body Promise program for about six weeks now. I've lost six pounds of fat, and my wife says my stomach is smaller. I feel good, and I'm happy again.This is a good book if you've tried other programs that don't work. It's the only book that's ever worked for me. If you're like me, I know that you know what I mean when I say it's not easy.It's never been easy for me, but I'm doing it now."},{"Title":"The Lean Body Promise CD: Burn Away Fat and Release the Leaner, Stronger Body Inside You","review":"In The Lean Body Promise, Lee Labrada presents a balanced, easy to understand program for fat loss and fitness.The former Mr. Universe's program attacks excess body fat from all angles, strength training, cardio and a balanced eating plan.The workouts are brief, and when I did them they were as short as 25 minutes and as long as 40 minutes, but they're very intense and require a daily commitment. I can see how working out really hard day after day can become a grind after a while, but if you can stay motivated to give your best effort every day, you should see some good results. Labrada also provides a ramp-up program that true beginners can follow to prepare themselves for the rigors of the full program.The eating plan is easy to understand and requires nothing more than food you can buy in your local grocery store. Yes, Labrada owns a nutritional supplement company and he does recommend his products (mostly the meal replacement products), but they're not absolutely essential unless you plan on entering his company's transformation contest. At no point does he make it sound as if supplements are an essential part of the program. You can do quite well on the plan with real food if you really want to do it. The recipies are easy to make and the ones I've tried are quite good.Labrada also tries to entertain the reader, making little corny jokes throughout the book. It seems like he's trying too hard when he does this but it keeps the book from getting boring."},{"Title":"The Lean Body Promise CD: Burn Away Fat and Release the Leaner, Stronger Body Inside You","review":"I own 'Lean Body', the work of Lee Labrada and his friend and nutritionist, Keith Klein, as well as Lean Body Promise. After reading both, I tend to enjoy Lean Body a little more than Lean Body Promise (LBP), but I understand the idea of Labrada's latest book.'Lean Body' is really geared more toward someone who would like to actually become a body builder. The overall eating and exercise plan in 'Lean Body' is more strict than the one given in LBP, telling me Labrada is trying to target a larger audience who does not want to get down to 3-4% body fat. But that approach makes sense, seeing there are many more people in the US who simply need to lose weight rather than those who want to become bodybuilders. So at worst, Labrada is giving this nation another no-nonsense fat loss program that truly works.I am a big fan of Labrada and think he provides people with a good motivational base to start a TRUE fat loss program. Others have said the info in his book can be found for free online, but I dare you to find such info in as inspriational a book as this one. But since we are talking about free items, you can go to Labrada's website and find tons of free resources to supplement this book.To me, the info in LBP is common sense, but the fact of the matter is that MANY people don't know about the very simple concepts presented in this book. Eating 5-6 small meals a day, cutting out refined carbs, not spending 2 hours a night in the gym....these are all things Labrada reinforces in his book. If you did not have this knowledge and found it in this book for the $20-25 price and used it to lose 30, 50 or 100 pounds, then you'd think it was worth it right? Of course so!! That is really what Labrada is trying to do with LBP - make losing fat as simple as possible so ANYONE can do it.Despite presenting a fat loss program that is simple and effective, Labrada makes sure the reader realizes that it takes hard work to achieve a lean body. Many programs are sugar coated and make the reader believe that it will take minimal effort to lose fat, when in fact it takes serious dedication and consistency to achieve fat loss (for most folks that is).Is it the \\"end all, be all\\" diet and exercise book? Of course not, but most books are never the ONLY book one needs for any given discipline. In my opinion, it is a great book to add to anyone's fitness and nutrition library. It has a great combo of inspiration, true stories, a model for an exercise and diet program, and great recipes.Being a 29 year old who used the program in his first book once before to lose 30 lbs in 12 weeks (and is doing it for a second time to get below 10% body fat), I can attest that the info in this book is more than worth the price of admission. After completing the program in late-May 2005, the weight has stayed off, which is an even bigger testament to how the program provides long-term results.Even better, I have a 55 year old mother who followed this same program to lose weight when no other fat loss program ever worked for her. So I have first hand experience with the info Labrada provides and can give my personal seal of approval.At the end of the day, the reader has to execute and want fat loss bad enough to make the program work. But Lean Body Promise sets the stage for anyone to successfully lose fat and keep it off. The fact that the info in his book is simple should not discount the fact that it is VALUABLE info."},{"Title":"The Lean Body Promise CD: Burn Away Fat and Release the Leaner, Stronger Body Inside You","review":"We've all heard the saying that if you commit to doing something long enough, then it will very quickly become a habit and a regular part of your routine. And that is the secret behind former Mr. Universe Lee Labrada's book entitled The Lean Body Promise: Burn Away Fat and Release the Leaner, Stronger Body Inside You.I think I love this guy (in a brotherly kind of way, of course!) because he just makes sense. And he should know what he's talking about since he has appeared on magazine covers, on television shows, and headed up an anti-obesity campaign in Houston, Texas. As a world-class bodybuilder, Labrada has seen all the good and the bad when it comes to health and he shares it in this engaging book.With a natural wit and ability to connect with his reader, Labrada goes through step-by-step what YOU need to do to overcome the mental obstacles that stand in the way of your eventual success, provides examples of people who have been successful to serve as inspiration for your new journey, arm you with ample motivation for getting the job done, providing specifics about the kind of diet you should be eating to attain optimal results, and, of course, give you specific direction about how to workout your body to look and feel better than you ever imagined.Sounds awesome, doesn't it? But aren't books like The Lean Body Promise just a bunch of marketing hype from people who have never had to deal with being overweight and out of shape? While that's probably true about many such programs, you can sense Labrada takes a personal interest in seeing real success from average everyday people like you and me. I think he really does care about YOUR success and will celebrate with you once you reach your goals.The chapters in this book zoom by quickly thanks to Labrada's unique conversational style and the very clean formatting. Of course, it doesn't hurt to have his smiling picture looking at you from time to time to encourage you to implement his strategies into your life to change it for the better. It's like he's watching you as your own personal weight and fitness coach!Easy-to-digest sections in each chapter are followed up by \\"The Skinny So Far...\\" to recap the primary points Labrada wanted you to remember. This is an extremely helpful way to reinforce the lessons you have learned so that you'll be well on your way to having that \\"lean body\\" he promises in just three months! YOU CAN DO IT!As someone who has lost nearly 200 pounds on the low-carb lifestyle, I did have a few concerns about Labrada's views about diet in The Lean Body Promise. It wasn't all bad, especially his disdain for sugar and simple carbs, processed foods, trans fats, junk foods, and even those packaged low-fat foods. We totally agree that these are NOT good for you no matter how you slice it.Where we part company is on the subjects of saturated fat and complex carbs.Tons of research has come out and will be coming out very soon (remember the names Dr. Jeff Volek and Dr. Stephen Phinney) showing the minimized impact of saturated fat on the body when carbohydrate-restriction is in place. On a low-carb diet, such as Dr. Atkins New Diet Revolution (the one I followed), consumption of red meat, egg yolks, bacon, butter, and the like are all extremely healthy for you because the atherogenic impact is minimized.Actually, what Volek and Phinney have found is those who eat a high-carb diet that is lower in saturated fat content actually have more saturated fat in their blood than those who eat a low-carb diet that is higher in saturated fat content. This is a revolutionary new discovery that's gonna turn everything we've ever known about fat and heart health on its head. It's something the late great Dr. Robert C. Atkins talked about frequently and now the science is catching up to him.As for the subject of complex carbohydrates, Labrada claims these are not as bad for you as simple carbs because they take more time to be digested and broken down which slows their impact on your blood sugar. While that's true, these carbs are still metabolized in the body as sugar. Even the supposedly \\"healthy\\" whole grain foods like oatmeal, brown rice, beans, corn, rice cakes, peas, and whole-grain breads and pastas should be avoided as much as possible to limit insulin spikes.Despite our differences on these issues, I am still glad to know there are people like Lee Labrada out there trumpeting the cause of improving health and helping people realize they CAN change their diet for the better. The Lean Body Promise is an excellent resource for anyone who wants to learn more about how to whip their body into shape, shed the pounds, burn the body fat, and get healthier than they've ever been in their entire life.That's a promise this former Mr. Universe says you can take to the bank!"},{"Title":"The Lean Body Promise CD: Burn Away Fat and Release the Leaner, Stronger Body Inside You","review":"This book is somewhat similar to Body For Life in that it preaches a balance of diet and exercise. It also shows pictures and information of contestants that have entered their challenge for inspiration and motivation. I feel this is better than Body For Life in that it goes further into explanation with exercises and the nutrition. Also gives good advice for eating at fast food resaurants or restaurants. I like the 3 way training split in this book better than the 2 way split found in Body For Life. I recommend this book for anyone whether they are advanced or just starting out. Lee Labrada obviously practices what he preaches and is a Hall of Fame pro bodybuilder. I'd much rather listen to his advice than some typical out of shape doctor."},{"Title":"The Lean Body Promise CD: Burn Away Fat and Release the Leaner, Stronger Body Inside You","review":"I had been into fitness for some time searching for a sort of definitive guide to get in the best shape of my life. And I definitely found this in the book \\"Lean Body Promise\\" Just as Mr. Labrada indicated, if you follow to the letter, you can and will see an incredible transformation in your body in as little as 12 weeks. I went from 199 lbs. to 160. I am 61, and I have my same body as I did when I was 30. I can slide into a sexy pair of 31-inch tight jeans, and I sport a healthy musculature that has me wearing more tee-shirts that normal.All in all, this is a very practical book, that shows you how to use progressive weight resistance, clean eating and proper aerobic activity. And it is easy to follow. Lee Labrada knows health and he knows fitness. Look. Enough talk.

The size of this book is not bigger than your palm and it has a summary of the original book.So if you have a previous experience at the GYM and you target to loose weight and get lean in 12 weeks I advice you with this edition, but if you are a biggner and want to loose weight I advice that you buy the original book and buy the 'GYM EDITION' if you want it to be as a reminder for the exercises that you forget."},{"Title":"The Lean Body Promise CD: Burn Away Fat and Release the Leaner, Stronger Body Inside You","review":"I am in no way trying to be a body builder or to be extremely cut or ripped but I wanted practical excercises that would help me tone/build muscle. I believe this book is ideal. While the excercises are not difficult they are a little on the challenging side especially if you are a sedentary beginner. Therefore, I suggest starting off with lighter weights and then as your strength and endurance grows increase the weights.I just got this book in August but since I added weight training to my routine I am seeing more results. In his book Lee suggests cardio once a week. I do a cardio routine for 20 to 30 minutes after after weight training because while I'm trying to tone/build I want to loose fat and cardio is another important method of fat loss. So that's what I do for myselfI also like the nutritional tips and suggestions provided. However, I have a much better book on the nutrition that I got from Amazon for $11. If excercise and nutrition is important to you then this book and Dr. Jamie McManus' Guide to Wellness book should be in your library.Everyone is a little different and some of these things won't work the same for everyone but ultimately you will see results. Buy the book. It's worth it."},{"Title":"The Lean Body Promise CD: Burn Away Fat and Release the Leaner, Stronger Body Inside You","review":"Lee has provided a \\"complete package\\" with\\"The Lean Body Promise\\".In very understandable terms Lee leads the reader through all the basics.

Planning tools, tracking sheets, explanations of excersises, meal plan explanations, workout suggestions and perhaps the most important aspect ...that Lee will continue to support via his website. All this done with a down to earth positive attitude.This book has given me the motivation to get off the couch and do something positive towards a more leaner me.Thanks Lee."},{"Title":"Walt Whitman: Words for America (New York Times Best Illustrated Children's Books (Awards))","review":"\\"There was never any more inception than there is now,Nor any more youth or age than there is now;And will never be any more perfection than there is now,Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.\\"--One of my favorite passages from Walt Whitman's \\"Song of Myself\\" from Leaves of Grass,Technically speaking, \\"breathtaking\\" is a term which denotes a combined physical and emotional reaction that can sometimes result from a significant stimulus to one or more of the senses.Unfortunately, \\"breathtaking,\\" (often written as \\"BREATHTAKING!!!\\"), has become an over-utilized adjective that is regularly tossed out when describing teeth whiteners, automobiles, photos from Mars, movies in which one or more people die, vacation rentals, revealing swim attire, and various other goods and services being offered for sale.Therefore, I hesitate to use the term \\"breathtaking,\\" even though it most accurately describes my initial reaction to a series of Brian Selznick's illustrations in the upcoming WALT WHITMAN: WORDS FOR AMERICA, Selznick's second illustrated biography with author Barbara Kerley.This is a very different book for me than their previous collaboration, THE DINOSAURS OF WATERHOUSE HAWKINS, which received a 2002 Caldecott Honor. I had never even heard of Waterhouse Hawkins, and thus my fondest memories of that book naturally tend toward aspects of the man's unusual story, such as the extraordinary New Year's Eve feast Hawkins hosted inside a life-size iguanodon model, and the horror of Boss Tweed's having ordered the destruction and burial of the models Hawkins had spent years painstakingly laboring to build for an ill-fated Central Park museum.In the case of Walt Whitman, I grew up on Long Island near Walt Whitman Road, Walt Whitman Mall, and various Walt Whitman historic markers. I became basically familiar with the work of Walt Whitman in high school English classes, and already knew the general highlights of his life. What I was hoping for, when I learned that Brian and Barbara were working on this book, was a new look at the man that would cause myself and young readers to feel like we had really gotten to know this great American poet.As with Waterhouse Hawkins, they have succeeded in this regard with Walt Whitman.In WALT WHITMAN: WORDS FOR AMERICA, Barbara Kerley begins with a wonderful portrayal of the poet's younger years that will provoke questions about the lives of kids in that era.\\"At age 12, he began work as a printer's apprentice, learning to typeset newspaper articles. He saw the boxes of letters as a great mystery, waiting to unfold. Awkwardly, he held the compositor's stick, eager to see the words form--letter by letter--beneath his inky fingers.\\"\\"Within two years he was setting articles that he himself had written. After the newspaper was printed, his heart thumped 'double beat' as he smoothed it open and admired his work. Even when he wasn't working, Walt surrounded himself with words. He listened to famous speakers and joined a debating society. He attended plays, appreciating a fine performance 'in every...cell' of his head and heart.\\"So how does Selznick begin his visual accompaniment to Kerley's words? Opposite the title page he illustrates a wooden-framed typeset of that facing title page--the perfect mirror image as far as the type itself is concerned. The surrounding pieces of wood are shaded with the hints of rose and purples that anyone intimately familar with wood-grains will be able to immediately feel on their fingertips and savor just by looking at them.In fact, throughout the book, one of the aspects to repeatedly strike me about Selznick's illustrations is his incredible success in creating that feel of the various woodgrains and the lamplight which illuminates the wood, whether it is raw wood or honeyed from varnish, wax, or wear. There was no such thing as plastic in Whitman's lifetime, and I was constantly drawn to the fact that Brian's paintings so meticulously and (yes) breathtakingly portray in every detail the texture and materials of the 19th century world in which the poet lived.And then there are Selznick's various paintings of Whitman himself, from boy to man, to elderly poet. There is one such large portrait thoroughly etched into my brain, where Whitman, apparently reacting to the assassination of Lincoln, stares pensively out at us while a few whisps of his white hair fall across his brow.Another unforgettable (and heartbreaking) vision is that of a family at home during the Civil War, reacting to having just received a letter from Whitman letting them know that their son, whom Whitman had been caring for in a hospital, was no longer.Beyond the actual story, both Kerley and Selznick provide thoroughly fascinating notes at the conclusion of the book. For instance, Brian notes that:\\"Ms. [Barbara] Henry told me that the capital letters were placed on the upper shelf and the others on the lower shelf which is why we now have the terms 'uppercase' and 'lowercase.' \\"The book also concludes with the poems from which the excerpts in the story are taken.I knew a bunch about Walt Whitman, but for the first time the storied namesake of paved roads and shopping emporiums has become a real person for me, both in words and in pictures."},{"Title":"Walt Whitman: Words for America (New York Times Best Illustrated Children's Books (Awards))","review":"I am doing my Masters Project on the life of Walt Whitman during the Civil War. Though this book does not add anything new to my project, I am including it in my Bibliography because it is a book I think everyone should read. Yes, it is a children's book, but it accurately portrays the life of Whitman from the time he was a child to the time of his death. I particularly like the section about the Civil War and I know that the author has all the facts correct. What makes this book such a great reading experience is the accompanying art work on each page. The art is exceptional and adds to the reading experience. Whether you are a child or an adult with a passing interest in Whitman, this book should be on the top of your reading list.My favorite page is the one directly after the Civil War spread. It contains the portraits of Civil War soldiers. What makes this special is that each picture is based on an actual photo of real people, and the one portrait in color is really Whitman's brother George (I am using the same picture in my Masters Project). Each painting of the portrait really captures the expression of the soldiers. My other favorite painting is the close up of Whitman's face as an old man at the end of the book. The sparkle in his eye captures the sparkle in the man's entire life.This is a fantastic book that I highly recommend. You should look at it as an experience - it is not a complete biography of America's famous poet, but an interactive experience between the important events in his life and the paintings that convey meaning and significance. I am very happy I came across this book, and I think everyone who buys and reads this book will also be impressed."},{"Title":"Walt Whitman: Words for America (New York Times Best Illustrated Children's Books (Awards))","review":"The Barbara Kerly/Brian Selznick combination becomes more powerful each time it occurs. First of all, if you haven't gone out and viewed their \\"Dinosaurs of Waterhouse Hawkins\\" then you should do so immediately. Do not halt for man, angel, or beast. Just get out there, grab yourself a copy, and thank the high heavens that you did so before reaching the end of your brief span upon this globe. After having read that book (and you will be glad you did) you'll be ready to fully appreciate this author/illustrator duo's latest exploration into another fabulous human being's life. Our dear gay American poet Walt Whitman is their most recent subject and he is rendered here in full glorious life. Spotted with his poetry, his beliefs, and his incredible life, \\"Walt Whitman: Words For America\\" offers an answer to any kid who wonders why the heck they should study some old dead white guy from more than 100 years ago. A stirring answer at that.Aside from the circular picture of Walt standing with a cocky fist on his hip, your first image in this book of the man displays him at the tender age of 12. Working carefully as a typesetter for a newspaper (comparisons to Ben Franklin seem obvious at this point), Walt began his career as a poet with a job that put him into direct messy contact with all kinds of letters and words. In addition to creating his own newspaper at 19, Walt read fantastical stories for his own amusement. You see him as a young man rushing through the streets of Manhattan fully clothed and along the beaches of Long Island buck naked (tastefully, of course). As Walt grew, his concern for fellow human beings, including the slaves of the South, did as well. He published \\"Leaves of Grass\\", traveled the country, then became involved with the war between the states. It's the Civil War that takes up most of Walt's life in this book. Whether he was tending to those wounded in battle, debating his own feelings towards President Lincoln, or collapsing from the exhaustion of working too darn hard, the book follows Whitman hither and thither. By the end Whitman truly became the poet of the people, giving the world poems that have remained deeply embedded in the human psyche, whether we know it or not.As with their previous collaboration, Kerly and Selznick follow up their book with a long and extended section of additional facts about Mr. Whitman. They talk about how they become interested in the project, where their research took them, and how they feel about the man. They offer addition info on his life (preferring not to mention the whole homosexual aspect, I guess), Lincoln's life, and what Walt's life was like after the war. They also include eight poems, some complete and some just important snippets. It makes for a truly comprehensive picture book, I can tell you.The book itself, however, is a visual delight. There are some truly gutsy moves being made within its pages. At one point you see only a bright blue sky containing a yellow sun and fast moving clouds containing the words, \\"Whoever you are now I place my hand upon you that you be my poem\\". At another point Selznick takes the photographs of the wounded holding slates and puts a word from a Whitman poem on each and every one. I was pleased to note that the authentic daguerreotypes that Selznick has reproduced here include black as well as white soldiers (something not every illustrator would think to include). Finally, in a truly cute move, Selznick just barely includes the two oranges and paper crane he found at Whitman's grave in the picture of the same.As picture biographies go, this one is wordy but worth it. Kerley knows how to write an exciting tale and Whitman makes for a remarkably exciting personality. He's one of those heroes you aren't ashamed to call as such. A wonderful addition for anyone whose juvenile Whitman section seems a bit lacking."},{"Title":"Walt Whitman: Words for America (New York Times Best Illustrated Children's Books (Awards))","review":"Walt Whitman lived a life of a \\"rough\\", or an everyman, and his poetry reflected his very special common uniqueness. Going against prescribed form of the time, Whitman fashioned himself a style of poetry unto itself, brash, fresh, untamed. Such words can be used to descirbe this stunning, and I mean absolutely stunning, children's book on the life of Walt Whitman, by Barbara Kerley, illustrated by Brian Selznick.Never before have I seen a celebration of a poet's life done so wonderfully. It manages to capture the beautiful essence of the man, while explaining to children in an easy to understand manner. The life of Walt comes alive, from his childhood to the very last years of his life, and the text is peppered with awesome quotes from some of his most famous poems.Particularly amazing his how Kerley describes Walt's selfless love of the Civl War soldiers whom he tended in Washington DC hospitals. His actions during this time show the depth of feeling he had for these poor boys, and children will respond with their innate sense of empathy towards Walt.The text is amazing, and the pictures equal it. Selznick has illustrated Walt in all stages of his life, from child to the wizened old man we've all come to associate with him. Selznick's pictures are honest and endearing, again, those that relate to Walt's caring of the soldiers. Even using type similiar to that Walt would have used in his earlier typesetting days, the pictures support and extend the text timelessly.It's been amazing that within the last few years, a spate of books celebrating our nation's most beloved poets are coming to fruition. It's about time. Our youth need to hear the voices of these people... Langston Hughes... Emily Dickinson... and now Walt Whitman, not only to instill a sense of pride with the country that they live, but also, within the sense of pride within themselves. This book will serve as a benchmark for these books in years to come."},{"Title":"Walt Whitman: Words for America (New York Times Best Illustrated Children's Books (Awards))","review":"WALT WHITMAN: words for America by Barbara Kerley and illustrated by Brian Selznick is an award winning pictorial exploration of the life of the life of the father of American poetry.

If I never know anything else about this special gentleman, then what I learned from this book is more than enough. He loved America with every fiber of his being and seeing the torment that this country went through during the Civil War, tore him up inside. He wanted to be the voice of and for America and felt that with his poetry, he could attempt to be a small part of expressing that.Secondly, he was the humblest and had the most giving of servant's hearts. After learning of an injury his brother had received and witnessing firsthand the broken and hurting soldiers, this touched him to give himself over to their care. He spent years in hospitals giving personal care, tending wounds, sitting, listening, and crying with these fallen heroes. He wore himself down to exhaustion and wished he could do more for all of them together and each one individually.This simple children's book brought me to tears more than once. I truly felt like I was able to look deep into this man's heart and be inspired to be an even better me. Who will I touch and at what depths will I go to reach many or even just one? Each person has a story, needs, and is significant. Who will you stretch out to reach today?Scholastic sent me the above book for review purposes. It will allow me to keep the book. I have no other connection to and have received no other compensation from Scholastic Books."},{"Title":"Walt Whitman: Words for America (New York Times Best Illustrated Children's Books (Awards))","review":"This is the life story of the famous poet Walt Whitman. We learn about his life growing up on into adulthood. We learn that he had a real passion for America and it;'s people. This is where the inispration for his poems came from.The book was written in picture book/ storty book form. Although it was a non-fiction book it was fun and easy to read.We would recommed this book to others who are interested in knowing more about Walt Whitman.

Don't be surprised if this book brings him his long deserved Caldecott medal."},{"Title":"Walt Whitman: Words for America (New York Times Best Illustrated Children's Books (Awards))","review":"This is an extremely bias book that portrays Whitman as a lover of the \\"common people\\" and as a true red-blooded, patriotic, heroic American (complete propaganda for the U.S..) Extremely questionable \\"facts\\" are included that assume Whitman was in favor of the abolition of slavery and would constantly see Abraham Lincoln trotting by on Whitman's way to work. While the aforementioned may be true (no sources listed), I don't think I can believe it based on his quoted disgust of Mexico when America wanted its land. Additionally, the language and imagery of this book may make it uninteresting to children. +1 for the interesting variety of page formats throughout the book."},{"Title":"Exploring Genesis","review":"This is the best single volume commentary that I have seen to date on the book of Genesis. John Phillips offers simple, clear Biblical wisdom and guidance and moves you into the passages and stories of the text. He brings Abraham, Isaac and Jacob to life and lifts up the sinfulness of sin and the truly amazing grace of God in Jesus Christ.The expository outlines alone would justify purchasing the book, but the richness and clarity with which he brings out the gospel truth is almost matchless.I would recommend this book to any student of the Scriptures.

The outlines are extra good and useable. The spritual insight is very challenging and preachable. The best commentary I have read on Genisus."},{"Title":"Exploring Genesis","review":"The author examines Genesis from a strict fundamentalist/literalist/&quot;scientific creationism&quot; point of view. Typical quotes from the book are: &quot;The other books of the Pentateuch, Moses wrote out of his experience, but not Genesis. Genesis he learned at his mother's knee.&quot; &quot;The basic command for all living things is that each reproduce 'after its kind'... It is the rock upon which the whole theory of evolution perishes.&quot; &quot;One great factor in precipitating the Flood was the intercourse between 'the sons of God' and the daughters of men that resulted in a demon progeny of extraordinary influence.&quot; &quot;Noah was fruitful... Three sons. That does not look like very much fruit, but from those three sons every man, woman, and child on the planet has descended.&quot; The book's principal weakness is that the author continually draws conclusions from scripture that the text does not substantiate. For example, about Joseph's brother Gad, a man of whom the Bible tells us only his name, Phillips writes as follows: &quot;There was something about Gad that savored of the gang. He was the bully type, the kind who would pick a fight when it was safe, when numbers were on his side... Gad, the coward.&quot;"},{"Title":"Exploring Genesis","review":"This book and several others in this series served as the primary textbooks at the Bible college I attended early in my academic career. What attempts to pass itself as 'interpretation' is simply allegory and eisegesis of the highest order, much of which would make even Matthew Henry blush. The series as a whole is a platform for spreading the Keswick 'Higher Life' Fundamentalist/ Dispensational/semi-Pelagian perspective in spades. Phillip's 'illustrations' are drawn from his personal assumptions rather than from the text of the Genesis itself, which is most problematic. He tries too hard to squeeze sermon illustrations out of the text at every turn that are the product of his vivid imagination more than the fruit of sound exegesis. In his attempts to be pastoral, Phillips sounds rather negative and noticeably legalistic. It's as though he derives pleasure in brow beating rather than rebuking and gently correcting God's people for their lack of holiness. Paul is a much better model for those seeking to give a necessary rebuke in love than Phillips. As to be expected of Phillips is an underlying denial of humanity's natural tendency to sin and its rebellion against God as a result of the Fall. Total depravity is orthodox Christianity; semi-Pelagianism is not, regardless of Phillip's claims in this volume. The Wesleyan 'Christian perfectionism' and Keswick 'higher life' overtones that permeate these pages are almost mind-numbing, both in their legalism and condescension! For those seeking a commentary that will help them preach and teach from the text of Genesis more reasonably, PLEASE ignore Phillips and buy a copy of either Allen P. Ross's Creation & Blessing: A Guide to the Study and Exposition of Genesis or John H. Walton's Genesis volume in the NIV Application Commentary, which is vastly superior in EVERY conceivable way for those purposes.The most irritating aspect of Phillips' Exploring Genesis is his willingness to arbitrarily vilify some of the central figures within the narrative that the text of Genesis itself never does explicitly, especially the descendants of Cain in Genesis 4 and Joseph in Genesis 37. For those truly serious about 'exploring Genesis' and encountering the text of the book itself, please don't waste your money on this tripe. Your money is better spent investing in one or more of the excellent linguistic commentaries on Genesis written by conservative scholars that are currently available, such as those by Victor P. Hamilton, Kenneth A. Matthews, Bruce K. Waltke, and Gordon J. Wenham. I have never seen a commentator's own personal bias and agenda placed above the text of Scripture so blatantly as it is by Phillips.I apologize for this overly-negative review, but sometimes Christians need to be reminded of what resources NOT to use to ensure Spiritual health within the body of Christ. It's a real tragedy that Phillips simply does NOT submit himself to the plain meaning of Scripture and draw his insights from grammatical exegesis of Genesis itself. Instead, he makes the text a slave to his own imagination and forces it to mean whatever he deems fit for homiletical purposes. The results offer readers little more than ludicrous illustrations and overly self-righteous platitudes. It's difficult not to feel like Philips is talking down to the reader rather than encouraging them gently to grow in Christ. It's too bad we'll never be as holy as Philips evidently believes he is (or at least would have his readers think). Attention, Mr. Philips' we're saved by and clothed with Christ's righteousness, not our own! This is the same allegorical nonsense that was popular during the monastic period, only here, it's written in modern English. Origen would have loved this crap, since he believed that allegorizing and spiritualizing the text was the only way to truly understand it. I have to be brutally honest about this volume, especially since there are much better resources available for preaching and teaching Genesis that equal both time and money well spent for your consideration.This commentary certainly serves as a useful demonstration of classical Dispensational interpretation of Genesis written for a popular audience. Since Dispensationalists largely see no relationship between Israel and the Church, they are forced to allegorize the OT and Philips does exactly that with this Genesis commentary."},{"Title":"Exploring Genesis","review":"Most of the book is trying to show how the Bible must be true by discrediting Science, and then backing up the Bible by using Science.Here is an e-mail to the author:Dear John,I'm sure you've heard this all before but as I was reading your book \\"Exporing Genesis\\", I read something that I had never heard before. I was barely a few pages into the book on page 39. You write that \\"the science of Kepler, Copernicus, and Newton is obsolete\\" and that \\"Scientists have what they call a five-year half life.\\"I am a Science teacher to 7th grade students and I have a BA in Biology. I have no problem with most religions and letting people have their own beliefs but the two statements above are lies.Your God tells you to not to bear false witness. I hope the mistakes are from your ignorance and not to purposefully mislead people. I used to be a member of another church and one of the main reasons I left was because they would use arguements like these that made no sense, in order to keep me in the religion. When I left that church, I attended the local Baptist church for awhile, but their attitude was just as bad, and most times worse.I'm not even going to bother to refute the above two statements except to say that Copernicus and Kepler's laws of planetary motion are still used today, Newton's 3 laws of motion are sitll used today, but the christian church's outdated viewpoint that the Earth is the center of the universe is not.I am atheist now and it bothers me when religions zealots try to discredit science in order to build people's faith. This is why I left my belief in God years ago. Your arguements sound pathetic to anyone who understands anything about science. Scientists believe in what they can see. You believe what you feel is more important than what you see. That's fine. It doesn't bother me at all.Just leave Science to the Scientists."},{"Title":"Rottweilers For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"I just got a seven week old Rottweiler puppy and I needed a reference to help me learn about the breed and to learn basic information to teach the dog certain rituals. I found this book and it is a true gem. This book will teach you about the breed, whether or not the dog is right for you, and a plethora of other useful information about the dog. Rottweilers are actually one of the most loving breeds of dog that there is and one part of the book will help people to realize that these dog are great dogs that are good with children and people if they are treated and taught well from the first day that you bring your dog home.This superlative reference is broken up into is broken up into four parts with numerous chapters that fall under that specific topic. The main things that are discussed in this great book are getting to know Rottweilers, where you find out about the dog and whether or not the dog is right for you; the next part is called searching for a soulmate where you get information on knowing what you are looking for in the dog and how to choose what to get; part three of the book discusses how you can keep your Rottweiler in good health by learning about the dog's basic anatomy, feeding and exercise rituals, and health problems; the final part lists ten reasons to own or not to own a Rottweiler, and training and traveling tips. This is a handy reference because of the multitude of topics that are discussed in this book.I detracted one star from the book because I felt that the training information in the book was not specific and that I didn't get a great deal of information regarding my dog's habits for doing bathroom rituals. I didn't get a lot of information as to how many times a day I should take my dog out and how often my dog should be fed. Because of this I recommend another book in the &quot;Dummies&quot; series on training dogs.As with all &quot;Dummies&quot; books the information that is found here is concise and to the point, written in an easy-to-read manner. I recommend this great reference to anybody that is looking for information on the Rottweiler breed of dogs. These dogs are one of the most loving creatures to walk the planet but this book is very neccesary. If you do not read this book you may be letting your dog do things that may result in long term problems, behavioral or physical.

I love it! Written by a former art instructor, Dorothee Mella discovered trends in her students' color preferences. Intrigued, she decided to work directly with many people to find correlations based on observation to develop this book. (The approach has no metaphysical nor occult origin, and it is NOT a New Age book as one might suspect. Anyone can use it regardless of belief system.) Those on more of the intuitive/artsy side and interested in self-insight would especially enjoy The Language of Color.The main feature is a simple, fourteen question color test called SICA (Self-Image Color Analysis). There are twenty possible color categories to chose from for your answers to each question. These colors ranges even include achromatics and basic metallics (gold and silver). The result is an accurate personality and mood profile which is easily decoded by the book's answers. It gives insight into one's identity, inspiration, motivation, stresses, and all other sorts of helpful things!Out of interest, I've learned about several psych & personality \\"typing\\" systems over the years. With this approach, however, rather than falling into one of a short number of \\"types\\", the SICA really provides a very unique portrait from over 1.6 quintillion possible combination results! The interpretations for each answer are straightforward, fast and easy.The rest of this book explains how to utilize one's personal portrait colors for enhanced communication, self-actualization, and even decorating various environments with color from your office to your bathroom! There are charts and lists explaining color symbolism and images for business, the messages you give according to what colors you wear, and best color recommendations for your wardrobe according to your SICA. I especially enjoyed her case examples of unhappy people who chose new careers, improved relationships and thus changed their lives after their personal Self-Image Color Analyses. Fun, fast, accurate - The Language of Color is a rare and fun find, a real treasure in the legacy of color research."},{"Title":"Language of Color","review":"Dorothee Mella has insightful ideas, but applies them inaccurately with archaic and biased color stereotypes. Her book is very fun to read but provides less information about yourself than she promises. She does, however, show you how to practically incorporate needed colors where it may be difficult.I usually give authors the benefit of the doubt but her quiz analysis is vague and phrased in such a way that any answer would apply. So much time is spent discussing what you'll discover about yourself. But many of the quiz results are a trite, one word sentence analysis. I also found the results of the quiz to be unusually inaccurate when my friends and I took them.She understands the importance of color as a powerful tool. She has insightful ideas of how colors can be applied to your psyche. For example, how your yuck color reflects an aspect of yourself where you are weak. This is great, except she make seems to use biased and archaic stereotypes of colors. For instance:--She assumes anything related to the color Gold is about finances and wealth. The actual psychological influence of gold is warmth, beauty and power.--She views Black as depressing and it means you're better off alone than with a partner. She fails to see the security and calm that many people are attracted to in the color black.--She makes the mistake of applying an object in the world to the color. Like mint green and apple green. Your feelings about the color is now swayed toward your emotions for the object, not the color. I've never liked mint so its hard for me to have an unbiased opinion about the color the way she has written it.My friends have difficulty answering simply: \\"What is your favorite color?\\" They would have a tough time with her questions like:which color represents you the best, which is different from but not conflicting with your first color, which color unifies the other colors, which color harmonizes with your first color, which color motivates all those colors.I would recommend the book Life Colors by Pamala Oslie. People of all kinds have gotten sucked into this book when I bring it with me. Everyone who has taken her quiz finds it incredibly accurate. I have never seen this amount of accuracy in a quiz or book before. So far 15 people around me have asked me to do the quiz with them and all of them were inspired by the answers. Many have asked to borrow my book and have bought the book themselves afterwards. I've loved colors all my life and no one has been this interested in colors before. Its been a joy to learn about my friends and acquaintances so thoroughly through the Life Colors book. The Language of Color was fun but not so accurate.If you like colors, buy Life Colors not The Language of Color."},{"Title":"Language of Color","review":"I actually purchased this book first in 1990 at a book sale in the library because I thought it was kind of interesting. After I began to take the test and research the color's meanings, I found myself quite hooked. I managed to buy a second copy five or six years later, after my old copy had become totally overused. Although there are some things I disagree with, I've found her meanings to be quite accurate, even in so far as for assisting healings. This is a simple test with twenty colors."},{"Title":"Language of Color","review":"The first time I read this book, it was on a loan from a dear friend!

She really knows her stuff!"},{"Title":"Language of Color","review":"This book's best feature is a color quiz that turns out to be a powerful tool for understanding your own psychological makeup--both the long view and the present-moment snapshot. I first took it in 1993, then again in 1997, and was shocked to see how much this test revealed to me about me, now that I can look back at who I was then and who I am now. It was eerily accurate!

Thorton Wilder.Mas, hasta cuando estaba hablando, otros pensamientos pasaban detr&aacute;s de su mente. \\" Hasta ahora---pens&oacute;---casi nadie a no ser yo, recuerda a Esteban y a Pepita. Solo Camila recuerda a su T&iacute;o P&iacute;o y a su hijo; esta mujer, a su madre. Pero pronto moriremos y con nosotras todo el recuerdo de aquellos cinco que dejaron la tierra, y a nosotras mismas nos amaran un poco de tiempo y nos olvidar&aacute;n. Mas el amor habr&aacute; bastado; y todos los impulsos de amor retornaran al amor de donde vinieron. Ni siquiera el recuerdo es necesario para el amor. Hay una tierra de vivos y una de muertos, y el puente que las une es el amor, lo &uacute;nico que sobrevive, lo &uacute;nico que tiene sentido.\\"P 123.Junipero, un franciscano que presencio la ca&iacute;da del puente de San Luis Rey se embarca en la misi&oacute;n de establecer el significado de la vida de esas cinco personas que en ese momento perecieron. La historia de esas cinco vidas es una tarea demasiado copiosa para el religioso y al final su obra es quemada junto con &eacute;l, quien es acusado de herej&iacute;a, cuando lo &uacute;nico que trataba de hacer era demostrar que Dios tiene un plan para cada ser humano y que el fin de esas vidas iba de acuerdo a Su Plan.Esta historia, situada en el m&iacute;tico Per&uacute; de 1714, podr&iacute;a estar situada en cualquier pa&iacute;s y en cualquier tiempo remoto, es mas una alegor&iacute;a, una disecci&oacute;n de la vida de los personajes hasta el momento en que sus vidas se ven cortadas por la ca&iacute;da del puente. Al final solo nos quedan sus recuerdos, como son recordados por las personas quienes los amaban. Pero como dice el autor, el amor vuelve al amor y eso es lo &uacute;nico que importa.La obra esta escrita de la forma hermosa a las que nos tiene acostumbrado el autor. Para los que no han tenido la oportunidad de leer a Wilder, les dir&eacute; que es un escritor en quien lo po&eacute;tico se realza por encima de la obra contada, llegando en ocasiones a escribir obras de hermoso virtuosismo literario, pero carentes de sentido o direcci&oacute;n, como en el caso de Teophilus North. En este caso, El Puente de San Luis Rey, la novela tiene sentido, se mueve. La vida de los personajes es intensa, como en el caso de la Marquesa de Montemayor, solitaria, como en el caso de los gemelos y aun naciente como en el caso del hijo de Micaela.&iquest;Qui&eacute;n nos recuerda?Al morir solo las personas que nos aman y que aun viven. Despu&eacute;s de su muerte, morimos la segunda muerte, la del olvido de nuestras cualidades que se tornan difusas y despu&eacute;s se olvidan para siempre. &iquest;Acaso no tiene sentido la vida y el esfuerzo, cuando la muerte y el olvido nos borran? &iquest;Acaso volvemos despu&eacute;s en otra vida y en otro tiempo, o acaso hay un plan maestro del cual somos meras piezas? No estamos destinados a saberlo y el autor en lugar de caer en pesimismos nos da una obra bella que realza el amor como sentimiento que no se elimina con la muerte y el olvido sino que retorna a s&iacute; mismo y crece.Luis M&eacute;ndez."},{"Title":"Loudspeaker Design Cookbook","review":"This is an excellent book on speaker design.

Frankly, an expert would already understand the information presented in this book, while it's well beyond the novice's capabilities, so I don't know where it would really be of oustanding value... perhaps as a lab reference manual?

Unlike most books on the subject, this one has plenty of graphs so you can see the effects of different design methods. This book also has the most in-depth look at crossover design I have read in any book bar none. It looks at crossover design both with AND WITHOUT the use of design software.However, if you are designing without software be prepared for a bit of trial and error. It's a well- known fact of crossover design that you need to go through a few iterations before you get it right. If you have powerful computer software such as LEAP, you can let the computer do the dirty work.Also, be aware that designing and building monitor loudspeakers will NOT save you money. You will find that the cost of test equipment and parts will exceed the cost of a pair of excellent loudspeakers. If you are looking to save money, you should probably replicate some designs that Vance Dickason shows in this book.On the other hand, if you are interested in owning high performance subwoofers, you can save yourself $500 or more by designing your own. This is because you don't need to buy expensive test equipment and design crossovers. You can just use a few proven methods and formulas contained in this book along with some killer deal drivers available through the Internet. I recommend the Adire Shivas 12&quot; drivers available at www.adireaudio.com.This book will teach you proven methods for designing and building your own great sounding speakers.

The sections that most people would find interesting or need information on such as transmission lines were left to a 2 paragraph chapter.

He did go into great detail on an accoustic lever that I have never heard of in 18 years of doing audio professionally let alone be able to find any parts to build such a device. Total waste of money.

Such is the kind of surprise that may await you with &quot;The Loudspeaker Design Cookbook.&quot;The promotion on the cover offers &quot;everything you need to know to build that dream loudspeaker system for your home, your car, or your home theatre.&quot; Obviously, whoever wrote that advertising copy never cracked the cover of this book. The book essentially is not a How To sort of book. For example, if the reader wanted to learn the functions of the components of crossover networks he would be out of luck. The discussions in this book are way beyond any such mundane considerations. The book is so saturated with technical language that I suspect 95 percent of readers will be able to glean little or no practical information from it. Mr. Dickason obviously knows what he is talking about but he doesn't have the gift of explaining so essential to technical writers.Still, the book has a catchy title and will no doubt continue to sell by the thousands. A more apt title might be &quot;Advanced Theory on the Physics of Loudspeakers&quot; but, of course, that probably wouldn't sell as many copies."},{"Title":"Loudspeaker Design Cookbook","review":"The font size used for my 6th edition as quite small, dust off those reading glasses! Even the hundreds of graphs will need a magnifying glass if you need to determine what is presented in the graph.

Look for larger sized fonts and reasonably sized graphs in the next edition. The book rarely presents alternatives to commercial software (and, similarly, to commercial hardware) for calculations and measurements. Some calculations, maybe even most of them, can be handled with a simple spreadsheet, yet the book rarely offers the full equation, instead directing the reader to commercial software, which costs well in excess of the price of a couple pairs of good bookshelf speakers. Home built test equipment is presented, for lesser devices, but here again, for all Thiele-Small parameters, you'd need to purchase commercial equipment. Some tests do not need professionally designed equipment! Regarding content, some points are not definitively explained, despite the authors obvious skills for explanation. In some cases, the equations which are actually offered contain unexplained terms: you might have just read about one term, but the equation might be calling for a subscript of the term, with no explanation as to what conditions define the subscripted term.... what, then, would you use for a value? My review sounds a bit negative, but above all, these kinds of problems can easily be searched in online forums related to loudspeaker design (if indeed you have internet access).

It also has a complete home theater system plan that uses the latest drivers and passive designs to provide an excellent home theater, including 7.1 should you decide to go that way.

Hard core hobbyists or speaker design professionals may find some useful models, empirical studies and references in this book. For the beginner, the minimum vital data needed to design and build a speaker is interwoven in to a jumble of esoteric empirical tests and computer simulations. For the more experienced speaker builder, the depth of this book is great and the footnote references are very complete. While the breadth is great, the depth of technical explanation for fundamental speaker enclosure modeling physics was a lacking. I guess I need to buy another book or research the footnotes myself.This book could be a lot better with some solid editing. The writing - for the most part - is clear, but there are sections that are hard to read and there are some errors. The fonts are too small (many of the subscripts are illegible). The graphics are horrible. The book has over 100 frequency domain plots (developed with speaker CAD packages), which are illegible and poorly labeled.

The Loudspeaker Design Cookbook by Vance Dickanson, currently in its 6th edition, will teach you more than you ever wanted to know or even thought existed when it comes to both the art and (mostly) science of desgining loudspeaker systems. You'll also find out first hand how useful that algebra you learned in high school really is.This book covers the most popular types of enclosures from the simple acoustic suspension (think old AR and Kloss designs) to ported bass reflex and bandpass designs that are so popular now. There is also a wealth of information on crossover design.Dickanson builds upon the work of Thiele and Small in treating speaker systems with filter theory. The days of building a box, sticking a driver in it and hoping for the best are gone.

However, the equations are definately insufficient for the professional.A lot of space is spent on diagrams giving information already implied by previous ones. Additionally the hole book is based upon simulations by a $2500 software pack (LEAP &amp; FilterShop by LinearX)!

Terminology, box design, and some of the principles of crossover design are all much clearer to me.However, the book left me wanting much more.

I have been a loyal subscriber since the early eighties and it's sadly apparent that the publication (now AudioXPress) is in its last days. While the High End industry gets more esoteric and expensive every year, it's obvious now that its market is to people who specifically want really expensive and bizarre looking items for prestiege and ego gratification.A simple guide to building a few different speakers is probably what most readers expect, and this isn't that book.This is just not a suitable book for loudspeaker construction for the amateur, which is what its title (at least, to me) implies."},{"Title":"Loudspeaker Design Cookbook","review":"The Loudspeaker Design Cookbook is awesome, but believe it or not, it doesn't have an index.

I start skimming the text and I see those letters with subscripts scattered here and there like annoying gray dandelion balls in the front yard. So I keep flipping backward, expecting to see them defined somewhere. Nope... nope... wait... there's some of them... but where is Q? And what is f_s? Flipping... flipping... and now I'm on the first page in Chapter 0 and I haven't found a definition for Q. He talks about it, but never defines it. So I go for the index. Oh wait... there IS no index. But there is a bunch of annoying advertisements in the back like the car magazines I read every month. So I check the table of contents - finally after a few minutes I find Q defined somewhere around page 24 in Chapter 1, but he mentions it repeatedly before then.There are two rules I've learned about technical writing:1) Tell them what you are going to tell them, tell them, and then tell them what you told them.2) Re-invent the wheel so your readers don't have to.Vance Dickason must have lost these rules of thumb in the piles of papers he's sure to have on his desk.

So that's what it was about? Who'd ever guess? How, for that matter, did the person who wrote the copy, unless it was Gass himself, pulling our leg just a little bit.-- Philosophical allusions do indeed abound in \\"Cartesian Sonata\\"--the collection and each of the novellas that comprise it--but to fix a pat and reductive interpretation on these stories is misleading...and a mistake.-- What are they about? In general, they are about how we interpret/misinterpret the world around us and try to gain some degree of mastery and control over it through signs, symbols, and objects.-- In this sense, using Descartes as a touchstone is perhaps of some help. Is there anything we know for certain? If so, how so? \\"I think therefore I am.\\" Maybe. But the further we stray from that citadel of \\"I\\" the less clear everything becomes.-- A woman harboring a possibly lethal obsession with the poetry and the private lives of Elizabeth Bishop and Marianne Moore. A traveling accountant who finds \\"salvation\\" in a scrupulously appointed bed and breakfast. A man who's devoted his life to the mastery of petty vengeance in theory and practice. The dysfunctional marriage of a dying psychic and an insurance salesman.-- Gass riffs off these unlikely scenarios with a great deal of wit, erudition, and imagination. He's a fantastic prose stylist, the kind that some readers will find unreadable precisely because he's so good; he stretches, twists, and redesigns the language into what amounts to a prose rollercoaster. And he's funny--very funny in a way that makes literature even of scatology.--If you're looking for stories in which \\"a+b+c+d\\" happens and ends neatly wrapped up in \\"e,\\" \\"Cartesian Sonata\\" is probably going to grate on your nerves and seem a pretentious bag of Gass signifying not much at all.--But if you can appreciate the sort of writing that finds a justification for its existence in the beauty of the writing itself, that apprehends reality in the musing about what its nature might be, and that seems to delight in the rush and exhilaration of expression, as if our despair were somehow mitigated by how well we can sing it, then \\"Cartesian Sonata\\" may well be music to your ears."},{"Title":"Cartesian Sonata: and Other Novellas","review":"A stunning realization of the Cartesian halves: the mind (on the one side); the flesh (on the other).

It introduces essential basic tools for understanding the laser physics with a succinct but complete description of the theory of lasers. The optics part of the book is organized in a new way following the 6 principal processes occurring with light: interference, diffraction, refraction, reflection, dispersion, and polarization. This structure of the optics section helps to avoid redundancies often found in standard textbooks. The Dirac notation and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle are used to explain properties of light. This gives a solid mathematical and physical background to solve the optics problems arising in the design and construction of tunable laser optical systems and other optical instrumentation. The book uses the matrix method for the description of propagation of light in systems with lenses, diffraction gratings, and prisms. In summary, Tunable Laser Optics introduces the &quot;warfare&quot; that a student, or an experimentalist, needs to understand for the successful design and construction of tunable lasers and optical devices."},{"Title":"Tunable Laser Optics","review":"The author is the leading world's expert in the field of Tunable Laser Design.

The use of Dirac's notation for the calcualtion of the interference and diffraction efects of the tuning elements proves an elegant and powerful techique for designing tunable laser systems. The complete coverage of the technical area and the easy readable writing style of the author will ensure that Tunable Laser Optics will be a classic reference that will be enjoyed by both students and researchers. I give Tunable Laser Optics my strongest recommendation."},{"Title":"Michelin London Mini-Spiral Atlas No. 2034 (Michelin Maps & Atlases)","review":"The draw for me to this particular map of London was the inclusion of street numbers, allowing first-time visitors (like myself) to have a better idea of where places were located given only their addresses.

The painting has been hidden for hundreds of years. Now, found by a New York gallery owner, it shakes the few he dares show it to, to their foundations. But this isn't the story of the painting, as much as the twentieth century artist who travels to Germany to piece together the story of the painting. Martin Heidegger the German Philosopher talks about art in terms of a temple where the gods have fled, and the true artist being someone who can bring them back. Barrett is a master at creating a sense of the spiritual in his readers. In Shape of Illusion he brings life into the temple of the human spirit. Don't get me wrong. Although Barrett was Catholic and his books reflect that, there is no secularism in this story. In fact the protagonist is a agnostic and his beliefs don't change. But his sense of something powerful outside himself does. And the way he figures out he's met the girl he's supposed to marry is worth the read alone."},{"Title":"The Shape of Illusion","review":"A 29 year old painter is confronted with a painting. It represents the inner court yard of Pontius Pilatus' palace. Pilatus has just washed his hands. There are Roman soldiers, a croud of agitated jews, and ofcourse a battered Jesus.At first glance people admire the painting as a technical masterpiece. But very soon, scanning details of the picture, every spectator sees his own face somewhere in the painting. Perhaps a jew throwing rocks at Jesus, perhaps a stoic soldier. Some people run away, ashamed before the others (not knowing everybody only sees himself), some people look inward for the truth of things. And the young painter goes on a quest in order to find out who has painted this remarkeble painting.Not 5 stars, because the painting gradually becomes secundairy on the quest, which is not my favorite plot twist."},{"Title":"The Shape of Illusion","review":"I have never read a more inspirational novel. Thank you for making it available. I will read more booksby William F. Barrett."},{"Title":"The Shape of Illusion","review":"This is the 3rd book I have read by this author. I like his books because the main character is always a deep, philosophical person who accepts and questions thing. They all have a religious discussion going on in them.This book is about a group of men interested in art who are shown an old painting of the crowds condemning Jesus carrying his cross. They see their faces painted on the characters in this painting that was painted in the 1600's. In order to discover more about this unknow painter one of the group, who is an artist himself, travels to the german town to do some research.He meets a young woman on his trip who is there to report on a play of the life of Jesus that is performed every 10 years. The main character sees this play with her. Unfortunately all his books have the two lovers start out not liking each other or at least are neutral to each other eventually falling in love. It kind of makes his books more \\"assembly line\\" books.What I do like is all the discussion that go on between the characters i.e about faith, religion, spirtuality. In the book \\"A Woman in the House\\" that I read I wished I had written down lots of the philosophical phrases that the main character speaks. They are quite interesting.Anyway, this is not one of his better books. Kind of boring and predictable."},{"Title":"Teaching the Word of Truth","review":"With the way the people acted who told me to get this book. I do not know if this really is the truth."},{"Title":"Curtains: A Design Sourcebook","review":"This book is great for anyone searching for ideas for a clean modern sophisticated interior. The design concepts are tailored for the transitional to contemporary home. It is not a resource for curtain construction."},{"Title":"Curtains: A Design Sourcebook","review":"This book is not for someone who truly wants a resource book for making curtains. There's not a lot to this book, just some 70's style window treatments, no real substance. It's pretty to look at, once, then sit on the coffee table."},{"Title":"Curtains: A Design Sourcebook","review":"I thought the book had some really great ideas for window dressing but as an amateur trying to achieve the looks on offer, felt the instructions on making could be made easier. I had to find another book with easier intructions and follow the two books in order to make my curtains!"},{"Title":"Curtains: A Design Sourcebook","review":"There are many well-done photographs of rooms and windows, but not enough detail and instruction for a Design resource."},{"Title":"Curtains: A Design Sourcebook","review":"I love a window treatment design book that not only focuses on the window, but a room in its entirety. The curtain styles in this book are appealing in that they enhance the look of the corresponding room and its contents; they do not overpower. Curtains: A Design Source Book offers ideas to accomodate practically every window type and shape. Best of all, the results do not appear overdone or contrived: many simple looks with natural fiber fabrics . I am forever looking for decorating books to add to my home library and this book is a must- have. I move quite frequently as a military spouse and seldom find that all my window treatments adapt to my &quot;new&quot; dwelling. I look forward to creating interesting window treatments in the near future and Caroline Clifton-Mogg's books are my favorite references."},{"Title":"Curtains: A Design Sourcebook","review":"I absolutely LOVE this book. I hardly ever read the text in decorating books--preferring to absorb the pictures and captions--but I actually read this one and learned a lot about the topic. Now I open up this book, look at a few pages, and then feel inspired to go and try my own take on some of the ideas shown. It gets me going for a weekend filled with projects!! One of the best decorating books I've bought (and, guiltily, I've got quite a stash.)"},{"Title":"Making Candles & Soaps For Dummies (For Dummies (Sports & Hobbies))","review":"The Weakest of Books, Better AvailableBeing a professional candle maker (3rd generation) and an avid reader, I have a huge collection of candle and soap making books. After looking over \\"Making Candles & Soaps for Dummies\\" for perhaps the 3rd time, I can honestly say that there are many better books covering both subjects. This book covers only the very basic information and will leave you with more questions than answers.For the candle side, I highly recommendBeginner's Guide to Candlemakingor the instructional videoIntroduction To Candle MakingOn the soap side, trySmart Soapmaking: The Simple Guide to Making Traditional Handmade Soap Quickl Safely, and Reliably, or How to Make Luxurious Handcrafted Soaps for Family, Friends, and Yourself.These are both great hobbies that can become good sideline business and there are good resources available on the subject... this book is not one of them."},{"Title":"Making Candles & Soaps For Dummies (For Dummies (Sports & Hobbies))","review":"If you've never made a candle, or done pour-and-mold soap, this book will tell you how. It will also warn you of every concievable mishap you could encounter. In today's litigious society, I suppose that's required, but it did detract from the rest of the work, in my opinion. Then again, I was looking for pointers and updates on materials, since I hadn't made any candles since the late 1980's. In that regard, it introduced me to soy wax and a few products I did not know existed.However, the pictures offered were not all that helpful, and the instructions very basic. Any of this information could be gotten from a decent online search. The best part of this book was the part in the back which listed a lot of websites for supplies and further information.I found the author's style to be rather pedantic, and overly \\"upbeat\\", as if she were trying too hard to make this a fun and enjoyable book by interjecting bits of humorous commentary that didn't quite \\"gel\\".As a series, the \\"for Dummies\\" line seems to me to be stretching a bit thin. I have quite a few of them, and the originality of the first few made learning fun. Now it simply makes it tedious, and the attempts at fun and humor are becoming tiresome.All in all, the series overall has become what the name implies: books for beginners and dilettantes. There is nothing wrong with that, by any means. But it wasn't what I was looking for in this book."},{"Title":"Making Candles & Soaps For Dummies (For Dummies (Sports & Hobbies))","review":"I did not read the sections on candle making, so this review is strictly based on the soap sections. I found this book to be one of the most helpful ones I've read (I checked out a lot from the library). True, it does not cover the cold process, but as the more simple, melt and pour method is all that I'm interested in, this book is right on target for my needs.In addition to the color and fragrance info, it discusses stenciled soap, soap on a rope, variegated soap, embedded soap, three-dimensional soap, imprinted soap, soap balls, customized shampoo, massage oil, bath salts liquid soap and more.I also enjoyed Chapter 19 which is devoted entirely to aromatherapy. It lets you know what a particular scent is noted for (i.e. boosting memory, fighting infections, relieving congestion, calming effect, etc.), as well as whether it is photosensitizing (increases your chance for a sunburn), a possible irritant to sensitive skin, possesses antibacterial qualities, etc."},{"Title":"Making Candles & Soaps For Dummies (For Dummies (Sports & Hobbies))","review":"I appologize that this is not an actual review of the book but a warning about one of the merchants that the book suggests you buy products from. I suggest that you DO NOT order soap making products from Well Naturally Products. Check out the Better Business Bureau on line first. I unfortunately failed to do that and had my credit card billed 60.00 and so far it's been a month with no products and no replys to my inquiries.This may have been a fine company when the book was written...but I'm not so sure about that now."},{"Title":"Making Candles & Soaps For Dummies (For Dummies (Sports & Hobbies))","review":"I usually love the \\"Dummies\\" books and was hoping this one could teach me about soapmaking.

Thanks!!!"},{"Title":"Making Candles & Soaps For Dummies (For Dummies (Sports & Hobbies))","review":"Book does not discuss the cold or hot method, the former is the most important method of making real soap by home or cottage industry soap makers. Why not ? The author claims it can be too dangerous for you (I guess we are dummies), but I suspect the true motive is to boost sales (for melt and pour base) and thus profits for craft stores. But what is in those bases (who knows) and using that stuff is like saying your a baker because you baked a cake from an instant cake box.

Later, I read it over again many times. It is a wonderful story of struggle and triumph, but most important it is a wonderful story of a loving family. My favorite parts of the book are the way the family &quot;adopts&quot; just about everyone who is lucky enough to cross their path, and the way that of all Karen's achievements, the ones they are proudest of are her sense of humor and her loving heart. I also love the way that the sequel shows that they are committed to what is best for Karen, rather than traditional concepts of &quot;normality&quot; or even previous goals like walking."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I read this book when I was about 10 years old - it caught my attention in the library because my name was Karen also. I have always remembered this book and was curious when I saw With Love, From Karen at the library - it brought back all those warm, emotional sensations that this book evokes. Any one I told of the book thought it would be a depressing, sad story - but I couldn't emphasize enough that it was heartwarming, beautiful and a joyous celebration of life. I read so many of the reviews, and many people, like myself would like to know what became of Karen and her family. If you know, please send me a message.

Their story helped influence many of my values as I developed into a young adult and still now as I struggle to parent my children in this world. Perseverance, hope, community helping those in need, sacrifice, unconditional love; these are just a few of the lessons I learned from the wonderfully written telling of their story. I wanted to order the book and its sequel for my daughter who is now in junior high and am saddened to learn they are out of print. The experience of the Killilea family is universal and very important to tell in order to share these values that will serve our society well."},{"Title":"Karen","review":"I just love this book!!
