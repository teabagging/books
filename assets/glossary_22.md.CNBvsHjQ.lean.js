This book really has a wealth of information about creating a multilingual/international website. A lot of the initial information concerned WHY you should have an international website, which I could have done without, but perhaps this would be helpful to some. Bishop gets into lots of areas of creating the site, including character encoding, priming your site for international search engines, using PDF, Real Audio, translation services, etc. There's almost too much to digest at one time. A whole chapter is devoted to resources on the internet, but Bishop provides links to appropriates sites throughout the book. My only complaint is that he didn't discuss how much Unicode has superceded some of the other character encoding schemes. By including so much information on other schemes, he seems to be indicating that Unicode is still not used by many, but it's a little unclear. However, this may not be a top issue for most, it just happened to be a question I'm coming up against in my project."},{"Title":"How to Build a Successful International Web Site: Designing Web Pages for Multilingual Markets at the National and International Level","review":"I heard about this book last week and I wanted 20 copies for my IT department at Zacky Farms.

Literally millions of people, companies and individuals alike, are eager to share information about the products and services they have to offer, as well as other helpful and often important information. While some may be content to market themselves within a particular geographical area, others may desire to market themselves globally, targeting a much wider online audience. This can present some problems for some people.Mark Bishop has written How to Build a Successful International Web Site to offer insight on how to design Websites that will appeal to a more diverse online community. In the design stage of creating Websites what is commonly overlooked is the fact that once Websites are online the entire Internet community has access to them. Furthermore, we may take for granted that most people in the world can figure out what we are trying to accompl! ish with them. Mark Bishop offers sound advice on how Websites can be designed to benefit a wider range of people groups. For instance, he points out that time considerations are an important factor. Website designers should be clear, for example, as to what the normal hours of operation of a company are and that they are clearly communicated (what country?, city?, time zone?, A.M/P.M.?, etc.).When designing a Website with the intention of drawing international attention it is important to know your audience. Bishop encourages his readers to become familiar with the different language and people groups you want to specifically target. Bishops offers some good international marketing strategies, including the effective use of &quot;META&quot; tags and designing Websites around the major search engines. An excellent number of online resources and services are listed that will aid the development of international business Websites. Important information about language tra! nslation, language servers, browsers, HTML editors, softwar! e, graphics, and sound files is provided to alert readers to other international considerations that cannot be overlooked!Begin creating successful international Websites for yourself and for others with this thought-provoking book today. The CD that accompanies the book is loaded with software programs, audio clips, and other goodies to get an international Website up and running. This book will do wonders to open the door to successful international relations and, you guessed it, possibly even some money making opportunities!"},{"Title":"The Mobility of Workers Under Advanced Capitalism","review":"This is an absolutely fabulous text for understanding Dominicans in the United States. Hernandez uses a historical-structuralist approach for understanding Dominican immigration, which I found an important corrective in a generally celebratory literature that ignores real social problems confronting immigrants of color. Hernandez takes race seriously and does an excellent job with her data. The book is well worth the investment if only for the data, although I'm comfortable asserting that Hernandez is exemplary in her race-class-gender analysis among immigrants of color (Dominicans) in NYC. An absolute REQUIREMENT for any serious engagement of Dominicans in the United States."},{"Title":"What are we waiting for?: A commentary on Revelation","review":"This commentary is not for Amill or Post-mill persuasion. This commentary approaches the Book of Revelation from Pre-mill view point. This commentary is a very good book, because:1. It is short and concise. It is basically a passage by passage commentary, so Robert Mounce dwells on the main points of the passage. He does not go into too much detail, but he does address important issues. But if you want more detailed treatment of the subject you can always refer to his commentary on Revelation in NICNT series.2. It provides interesting insights. For example, I was impressed by his interpretation on Rev.3:15,16 -- concerning \\"you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold...\\" Mounce comments, \\"The basic fault of the Laodicea church is that is it lukewarm. This has been understood to mean that spiritually the church was neither hot nor cold, but had settled for an insipid lukewarmness. It is regularly noted that several miles to the north of Laodicea, the hot mineral water from springs in Hieropolis spills over the cliff above the Lycus River and covers the wide escarpment with a layer of white mineral. By the time the water reaches the spillway, it has become lukewarm and is nauseous to the taste. The problem with this interpretation is the difficulty in understanding why it is better to be spiritually cold than lukewarm. The real contrast appears to be between the medicinal waters of Hieropolis, which would provide healing, and the cool drinking water of Colossae, ten miles on up the Lycus glen, which would provide refreshment. The Laodiceans were lukewarm in the sense that their Christianity provided neither healing for the spiritually sick nor refreshment for those who were spiritually weary\\" (p. 17). And like this, he provides insights throughout the book.3. It is stimulating. While the book is short in length, its quality is not. He anticipates different views and addresses them and explains why his view is more reasonable.Overall, the book is great for beginners without being intimidated by the difficulty of Revelation. I recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"What are we waiting for?: A commentary on Revelation","review":"Okay if you're looking for an easy-to-read, very concise commentary on Revelation. I thought it would be a little meatier, and was surprised at how thin this was.

I would recommend this for someone just getting started in the Scriptures."},{"Title":"Sweet Mountain Magic","review":"I enjoyed this story, however, I did not like the way all the male characters in the book wanted to either rape her or take advantage of her in some way.

This text is vastly superior to that book and Chapman's Electric Machinery book. The book covers many topics both from the internal operation of the machine and when the machine is connected to external equipment.The book is clearly written for the undergraduate engineer and he places plenty of examples in the text.I believe the practicing engineer will also find this book useful as well as there are many practice problems that relate to re-world situations."},{"Title":"Electric Machines","review":"This is an excellent text. Gross takes the often butchered subject of EM machines and shows how it should be taught. In industry, you don't just consider the electric motor and generator alone. There are controls and governors and prime movers and then there's the consideration of the load. Also, inrush currents are very important in applications. Unless you actually design electric machines for a living, most texts that neglect the real-world aspect of EM machines are doing the student a very great disservice. It's nice to have a book that really gives an accurate idea about how motors and generators are used in the real world. Most texts neglect this, including the Fitzgerald staple, and if they don't it's at the end of the text and very vague.So, Gross takes those concepts and integrates them into the fundamentals of the motor and generator. Someone who reads this text will be very well educated on how motors and generators are really used in the real world, not to mention transformers. What's really impressive about this book is that Gross uses schematics that mimic real-life industry schematics, like his 3-line diagram for transformers. He even includes the zig-zag wired transformer! I have never seen that in a book like this. I highly recommend this book.P.S. I also highly recommend his power systems book."},{"Title":"Electric Machines","review":"This book has lots of info but it will require that the instructor explains and goes over things for better understanding especially for students/ppl that never dealt with electric motors.This book worked for me."},{"Title":"Electric Machines","review":"The book got here before the expected date.

Neither Kate nor Josie are looking forward to this year's reunion because Ned has asked for and gotten a separation and is living on the other side of the country. When Kate and Josie arrive at the home of Kate's parents, she is greeted by her temporary guardian angel Augusta Goodnight and her young apprentice Penelope.Augusta thinks Kate might be in danger and events at Bramblewood seem to indicate something is very wrong. Ernest's housekeeper Ella is found injured in a ravine and just before she falls into a coma, she tells Kate someone pushed her. The police discover that the girlfriend of Kate's cousin Grady was deliberately murdered when somebody cut the brake lines on her car. Skeletal remains of a murder victim are found in the local cemetery when the church group are cleaning up the place. Kate's Aunt Violet thinks all of these events are related so the intrepid females bait a trap to catch a murderer.The latest Augusta Goodnight mystery is a charming, often times whimsical small town angelic cozy starring characters that are so delightful and amusing that readers will want to finish the book in one sitting to see if there is a happily ever after ending for the McBrides. Mignon F. Ballard knows how to write a captivating who-done-it that doesn't depend on blood and gore to keep reader interest.

Kate is at the end of her rope, estranged from her husband and unhappy at the prospect of a possible divorce, all stemming from the rift that was caused by her recent miscarriage. Even worse, her daughter Josie is giving her the silent treatment, placing the blame for Kate's failing marriage squarely on Kate's shoulders. Too, Kate dreads facing the questions about her marriage that are sure to arise during the reunion. Her unhappiness is pushed aside soon after she arrives, however, when her uncle's elderly housekeeper is found near death, pushed to the bottom of a steep ravine. As the family awaits the news of her outcome, other strange events begin occurring around the house, including the discovery of a corpse that may or may not be connected to several mysterious events that occurred around the house forty years ago, including the disappearance of Kate's uncle's wife, the drowning of a couple of hippies and the discovery of a dead vagrant. Does the current mystery have anything to do with any of them? And is anyone still in danger today? Kate, with Augusta's angelic help, is drawn into trying to solve the mystery before someone else - especially her young daughter - gets hurt. Could someone in her own family be a murderer? Kate is unwilling to face that possibility but realizes that it could be true and it's up to her to find out.For a light, sweet read, this was a perfect book. Augusta doesn't play quite as prominent a role in the story, which is a bit unfortunate, as the other characters aren't really quite as interesting. In addition, the story is a bit convoluted at times but the mystery unravels at just the right pace and is just engaging enough to keep the reader interested. Overall, a good recommendation for anyone looking for a quick, cozy read."},{"Title":"Start Your Own Specialty Travel & Tour Business (Start Your Own Specialty Travel & Tour Business)","review":"Not a bad book, but covers this glamorous and supposedly fun business in a boring tone.

Once in awhile I used the exercises which follow the story, but usually I made up my own speech themes related to each chapter. We read one story every two weeks. The first week, we read the story aloud, and talked about it. The second week we read the story aloud again, and then students gave short speeches about the theme. The stories them selves are intriguing, but it was my students' own related stories which made them like the book. I prefer these two texts to _Easy True Stories in the News_ because that one is written entirely in the present tense. My students had a lot of difficulty using past tenses, so I wanted to use texts which featured those forms."},{"Title":"True Stories in the News","review":"I can't say enough about this reader. I found it by chance at the bookstore of my nephew's college two years ago, which has a big ESL department, and have been amazed with its effectiveness every since. It works for readers of all ages and I have students from elementary school to adults. It has high interest stories written with high frequency verbs in past simple, it introduces one or two new vocabulary words in each story and then repeats them so that the students learns them easily while reading the story. There are questions and activities which I don't use but are well thought out. The stories really capture the attention of all of my students and don't condescend at all.I have my students read the stories in English, translate them to Spanish (I teach in Spain and have found that their comfort level goes way up when they fully understand the story and can process it in their minds in Spanish), and then ask them to relate the story back to me in their own words in English. It's been an absolute revelation. The fact that the stories are true means that the students relate to the stories more easily and appreciate them. I bought the intermediate level book which was too big a jump and introduces too many new vocabulary words for my students, but I'm going to try the high beginner book.I can't recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"True Stories in the News","review":"This is a great book for beginning English Language Learners.

Nothing could be farther from the truth. Even though he gave the animals human traits, as C. S. Lewis did in THE NARDIA CHRONICLES, they were meant for adults and gained wide recognition as they were passed along for centuries through oral (word of mouth, as many of his companions could not read) tradition. His start in life was lowly, born into slavery in 620 B.C. as a hunchback with a speech impediment. His early years were spent on the Balkan Peninsula, a part of Turkey, where \\"slaves toiled hard as miners, plantation workers, or if they were lucky, household servants. It was possible [then] for a slave to earn freedom (called manumission) through diligent work and loyal service.\\" Freed slaves were permitted to \\"engage in civic affairs and to travel wherever they wanted.\\"Aesop served two masters during his enslavement, but was eventually granted his freedom because of his \\"intelligence, wit and tact as a servant.\\" As he traveled and observed how underlings were treated, he began his story-telling (with morals) and, after a time, \\"his reputation grew as a wise and 'noble' man.\\" He went to Sardis in Asia Minor where the King sent him on diplomatic missions to Athens and Corinth, and he used his fables to calm tensions. Because of his keen mind, tactfulness and honesty, the King trusted him to distribute a large amount of gold fairly to the citizens of Delphi, which at that time was \\"the home of the Oracle and the most influential religious sanctuary in ancient Greece.\\" He was unjustly murdered by being thrown off a cliff around 560 B.C.The people of Delphi eventually atoned and made amends for their crime against Aesop. \\"Lysippus, a famous Greek sculptor, immortalized the fabulist by erecting a statue to him in Athens.\\" In 300 B.C., two hundred of his fables were compiled in written form as ASSEMBLIES OF AESOP'S FABLES. \\"Three centuries later, another freed Greek slave named Phaedrus translated the collection of stories into Latin for a much broader audience. About AD 230, a Greek poet named Valerius Babrius combined fables from India with their Greek counterparts and published the entire collection of tales in the most widely read set of fables in world literature today. Later they were translated into Arabic. \\"After the Third Crusade these fables, expanded by 60 new ones from the Arabian writer Bidapi, were translated by an Englishman named Alfred. Some of Alfred's fables, attributed to Aesop, were translated into English verse.\\""},{"Title":"The Gentleman From Angell Street: Memories of H.P. Lovecraft","review":"I recently picked this book up from the author's grandson at a Lovecraft convention, and despite some of the flaws of the book, I found it to be an interesting read. Among other things, there are a scattering of explanations about sources of Lovecraft's story ideas, an interesting look at his nocturnal habits and episodes of his wandering soul, which took him and Mr. Eddy on many intriguing strolls late and night and to obscure places of local antiquity. Plus there is are a couple of photos in it that I'd never seen before -- including one of a slightly pudgy Lovecraft! (Well, it's relative, but he is much better filled out than otherwise seen!) All in all it gave me an extra angle of insight into Lovecraft's personality, more personal than that found in, say, L. Sprague de Camp's biography, and a nice supplement to de Camp's account. I definitely feel like I have a bit better idea of what he was like in his personal social circles now. Having said that, there are inherent flaws in the book, the most unfortunate being that it is really quite brief, and sadly a decent percentage of the information given is repeated at least once in the course of the essays from Muriel and C. M. Eddy. There is also a very personal slant to Muriel's essays which can come across as presumptuous sometimes, but that is part of what happens when one writes a &quot;personal&quot; memoir of one's experiences, so I don't think that's necessarily a flaw. However, in summation, I feel that it was well worth the full price I paid for it, and I am not disappointed, in fact I was at times fully delighted by the tales the Eddys told. :)"},{"Title":"The Gentleman From Angell Street: Memories of H.P.

If you have read it, then you will find little new in this book since Joshi mined most of it. The memorial poems are nothing distinguished, and the brief recollections of the Eddys' daughter, Ruth, add little. Like Joshi, I'm suspicious of Muriel's statements about her early acquaintance with the Lovecraft family before actually meeting HPL.However, the book is a treat if you haven't read Joshi's biography. The Eddys were some of Lovecraft's few friends in Providence, and C.M even collaborated with Lovecraft on the necrophilic tale \\"The Loved Dead\\" as well as some other, less notable, tales of Eddy's. The Lovecraft that comes through here is a warm, generous man with a sweet tooth and a love of cats, a gifted reader of his own work, haunter of Providence and its surrounding swamps. Muriel's romantic notions of a match between the divorced Lovecraft and his ghostwriting client Hazel Heald bring a smile.As thin as the book is, it suffers from repeated anecdotes and facts because it is a collection of reminisces and not a single essay.It does include photos of its authors, Lovecraft's wife and his parents, and a surprisingly pudgy Lovecraft from his doomed sojourn in New York City."},{"Title":"Wireless Security End-to-End","review":"I have to admit I was very naive about wireless security, hence the need to educate myself. The problem is there is so much noise out there, misleading, conflicting or confusing information regarding the topic. This was the first book I was able to really walk away from feeling very comfortable that I covered the most important angles.Right off the bat I was happy to find that it's very &quot;vendor agnostic&quot;, not focusing on tools or techniques that are unique to certain commercial systems. The pace of the book is good, first walking you through the basics of wireless network security, then moving into the components of network security then how they relate to wireless networks. It's also nice that they have an entire chapter dedicated to integrating wireless access into an existing network - something most of us are needing to do these days. Lastly, it covers a variety of differing security models. These become very helpful because you can use them as a basis for cumstomizing your own wireless security system.Overall, if you're a network security professional looking for a good solid foundation in how it pertains to wireless networks, this a great book to have around."},{"Title":"The leprechaun's kingdom","review":"This book is fun, informative, and quite enjoyable.As mentioned in the title, this is a collection of anecdotes and short tales, with charming illustrations.

Includes medieval woodcuts, Victorian art, and contemporary art.(Four and a half stars, rounded up.)"},{"Title":"The leprechaun's kingdom","review":"I first encountered this book when i was in the fifth grade. The book was available to be checked out through the school library. I have always been interested in these types of books (ie. lengends, witches, etc.) so when i saw other students fascinated with this book I wanted my turn to check out what was so great about this book. Unfortunately the book was so popular that it was nearly impossible to get my hands on. I had only been able to catch glimpes of what was inside. Time and time went on and soon I forgot all about the book. Then about two years ago i found this book on this website... i didn't know it was the book at first until i received it in the mail. I remebered it as the exact book i was never able to read when i was in fifth grade. I was very pleased. THE END...... oh... you want to hear about content.... whoops.... just thought i would tell a cheesy little story. Anyhow... the book is alright. Filled with mostly false information (it adorns leprechauns as the \\"little shoe makers.\\" If you know much about leprechauns you would see where i am coming from)it does although skim the surface of whats going on in the land of the fae. I personally enjoyed the book despite of the misinformation.... lots of strange stories and great illustrations."},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"Not sure what I was expecting but what I got wasn't it, but I am quite pleased I got what I did rather than \\"just another knitting book.\\" This one is all about multiple color knitting. Great book, text is witty, and fun to read, patterns are simply amazing... wish I had ordered it back in June so I could make some of these things for this Christmas... good thing Christmas comes every year! Excellent book!"},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"I have to say that I was a little bit disappointed of the patterns. Nothing new, nothing exciting. Sure, the pattern seem to be \\"authentic\\", but I can find them in other books as well.But the \\"how to\\" area is very well written and helpful even for an intermediate or advanced knitter."},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"I've had this book for over a year, and I browse through it from time to time. There are a few sweaters that I happen to like, although I have found that the knitting instructions are very, very chatty rather than precise (Swansen's personality is more important to her than the knitting). The yarns used -- I orderedsome from Schoolhouse Press -- are the cheaper, lower grade wools, almost suitable for rugs rather than knitwear. Some of these sweaters have promise if you are willing to convert them into much higher quality (and not much more expensive!) yarns. It's is difficult to convert, however, since Meg does us the favor of not including diagrams or measurements in the patterns, ultimately thinking we'd all make them in the same yarns and get the same stitch gauge, which is surprising from a woman who is supposed to be a knitting expert. But, yes, some of the sweaters are quite nice and photographed well, though I did get tired of seeing the author in most of the photos, reading the author's rather dull autobiography and reading the author's overly-personalized text -- rather like this is a book about Swansen with the sweaters incidental. The sweaters themselves are presented nicely, but the color of the yarns used, for the most part, are awful. Either the colors are too bland, blending into each other, or they are horribly garish. Swansen needs to take a class in color theory for garments. Shudder. Swansen presents only sweaters for adults, and another surprise is how effeminate are the sweaters for men. I guess the men where Swansen is from (is it Minnesota or something?) are much, much sillier than those here on the east coast. I also found the book way overpriced. This was a big bestseller when it first came out, owing to Meg's friends who posted gushing reviews. Knitters are always hungry for new books, and I don't begrudge having this one added to my library. I would recommend, as I think another reviewer did, that you look at this in a store before purchasing -- the garishness and roughness of the sweaters, combined with the chatty and often unhelpful instructions may be a caution on whether or not you want to invest."},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"I've flipped through this book countless times while browsing my local library's knitting section and I'm always turned off by the boring and frequently ugly designs and color schemes. This author apparently has never met an earth tone she didn't like. How about adding a little sparkle to some of those muddier colors with some jewel tones? I can't speak for technique having never used the book. My advise is to browse through it at the library or book store before purchasing it here. Put it this way--it never inspires me enough to check it out of the library---for free! Of course, I'm not a big fan of her mother's book, Knitting Without Tears (I can imagine the gasps of outrage since she seems to be a knitting godess) and wish I'd spent my money on something less boring. I've had Knitting Without Tears for nearly four years now and have yet to use it for anything. It's just wasting space on my shelf. Since this book is a much bigger investment be wise and borrow a copy before buying."},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"I don't like to pan anyone's efforts, but before you purchase this book, look at it in the store. The sweaters hang awkwardly on the models, making me wonder how they were constructed. If models can't wear them well, can any of us real people? The designs are not striking, and as both an avid collector of knitting books/pattern books (I suppose all knitters are?) as well as a designer, I found that what Swanson presents was done much better in other designers' collections. I even think these designs did not take much artistic effort. Some even looked fairly outdated. Save your money, or better yet try some of the higher quality designers out there, like Jo Sharp (Knitting Bazaar, her newest, is very nice) or Sally Melville. Jo Sharp does some monotone and two color sweaters that greatly outclass Swanson's. And there's always Alice Starmore if you want truly glorious fair isle or Aran/Aran-type sweaters. All these other books are available here at Amazon, too."},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"I'm biased about this book because I know Meg Swansen well, and am grateful to her for teaching me a great many things about knitting. That aside, I still must sing the praises of this amazing book.There is no other work I know of that encompasses the techniques of the crocheted steek (a Mary Hounsell invention), jogless color changes in 2-color knitting (which Meg invented), the Purl-When-you-Can border (which Meg also invented), and knitting a tube (sleeve or sock) with 2 circular needles instead of double-pointed needles (a Joyce Williams invention). These are innovative techniques that have never been pulled into one place before, and if you're a &quot;thinking knitter&quot;, you really should read this book! Meg is a collector of new techniques and variations, and in this book she shares freely the cream of the crop.Meg's writing style is open and compelling, and she gives you glimpses into her life as Elizabeth Zimmermann's daughter and as a thinking knitter on her own.You will love this book."},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"This is a great book for the library of any intermediate or advanced knitter. Meg has designed clever and stunning sweaters. The Turkish pair are all but mesmorizing. Still, I may never knit any of the sweaters. They're beautiful but I've seen them in person and they are generally too heavy for my climate. All the same, they're photographed beautifully and are simply wonderful to drool over even if you live in warmer parts of the world.Still, the quality that makes this book a keeper is the wonderful tricks and techniques section in the front of the book. Tired of bloops of underlying color when attaching i-cord; Meg offers a simple and totally effective solution. There are dozens of these tips which can transform your knitting from amateur to finished."},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"I just received this book yesterday and spent all last evening poring over the beautiful photographs and knitting patterns. Ever since I picked up Elizabeth Zimmerman's Knitting Workshop, I've been an avowed Knitter-in-the-Round, and this book of Meg's has some excellent designs. I can't wait to finish the gansey I'm working on now so I can start work on the Weeping Sun pullover or the Fairisle Cardigan. Looks like my knitting basket will be stuffed again with 3 or 4 concurrent projects! If you knit, get this book. If you don't knit--get it anyway and learn how!! I'd also recommend any of her mother Elizabeth Zimmerman's books (Especially Knitting Around) to get you started. If I can teach myself to knit(with help from books) anyone can!"},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"Meg Swansen continues in her mother's revered footsteps with her book, MEG SWANSEN'S KNITTING, then &quot;Knits On&quot;. The patterns are timeless, the colors are gorgeous - classic with a lovely update. I wish I were a friend of Meg Swansen, I'd love to sit with Meg and a pot of tea for the afternoon of knitting. I find her style of writing very easy to understand, very helpful on many levels. This is the type of book I keep by my bedside to dream over. The pictures are a treat in themselves. I'll be busy knitting for a long time with this lovely book."},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"Just received this book for my birthday. I am so happy to have it. The photos are so wonderful--clear and detailed. I love details! What a wonderful service she performs for us (Eliz. Zimmermann Blind Followers). Like her mom, she gives the rough idea and then thoughfully for us 'turtles' lagging behind, she spells out the details so we can't miss creating our own treasure.I like the personal tidbits, parts of her life that haven't been reported by her mother with charming photos relating to her part of the knitting milleau. I like reading how she is inspired to create an item. Her devotion to the art of knitting is clear. She makes efforts to clear up confusion over the term 'fair isle.'I can pick up this book and get lost for a long time. I love and respect Elizabeth Zimmermann for her knitting architecture--I haven't always been so excited about her actual designs. Now, Meg has the design sense and all of her mom's 'architectural' skills to boot. Yes, what a treasure we have in this woman and this book! Thank you , Meg!"},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"This is one of the better knitting books I have read. The patterns are given for the blind follower(one who follows line by line} and also directions are for those of us who like most of the pattern but need to adjust for size etc. Its sort of like finding a book within a book. Once a person finds Meg's and Elizabeth's percentage method and adapts the great patterns there is enough to keep an avid knitter busy for years. I also like the sweaters modeled by real people we recognize. Makes the whole book REAL! Thanks a lot Meg for another great book."},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"For me, the best part of this book is the techniques that are explored and explained, with a few appropriate photos. It is well worth the price based on this alone. I'm still thinking about the style of the sweaters. They seem more along the lines of rustic rather than fashionable, the sort of thing that is suitable for just what the photos show: a stroll in the great outdoors. They are nice, but somehow if you look in other pattern books (I think someone below mentioned Alice Starmore for fair isle and celtic) they are not that creative. For instance, there is a Norwegian design (Swansen has an entertaining video on making this sweater too, highly recommended just for the fun of knitting along), but Dale of Norway does much more lively and complex designs. The word &quot;competent&quot; keeps coming to my mind. These are competent designs, and maybe we don't have enough of that, so I'm certain the designs will find their niche. Also, I like my sweaters big, and if you do as well, some of the sweaters in this book look like rather a snug fit, lacking ease, for instance, around the arm. So they don't look comfortable, and a few of them seem to sag along the neckline, but I wonder if that is just due to the yarn being used? Hopefully someone who has knit a few of these can let us all know if they come out better than they look at first glance. Normally I like the earth tones for sweaters, but Swansen seems to pursue these a bit much, so the colors start to look dull after a while, especially since they are photographed against what looks like a fading autumn landscape. I'm a little disappointed that the yarns used in the sweaters I want to knit or adapt from the book are all rather obscure yarns -- not that easy to find or, since they are unfamiliar yarns, that easy to substitute. Nor are there any diagrams with measurements, which make knitting a lot easier (at least for me). The three vest designs at the back of the book are what really convinced me to purchase. In these three vests, Swansen suddenly gets more creative, and even innovative, I'd say. On the whole, I'm happy with the book, especially as I keep saying, for the info on knitting techniques. Not being a friend of the author's, like a number of reviewers below, I'm not certain the bio at the start of the book was all that necessary. And this is the first time I've seen Swansen's designs (or actually her sweater philosophy) so I'm iffy on how much I like them. I have my eye on the vests and two or three of the sweaters, and I might adapt other sweaters for different wools and different sizing/design. The book is worth having for the techniques and the subsequent inspiration."},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"I just received my copy of Meg Swansen's Knitting and already my pages are becoming dog-eared! The photography is beautiful. I loved the fact that they used real people, including members of Meg's family to model the sweaters. It's always nice to know how sweaters look on real folks! I think the back cover shot is especially haunting - for those of you who haven't seen it yet - it's a closeup of Cully with Meg in a soft focus in the background. Absolutely breathtaking. My knitting to do list just became much larger after viewing the gorgeous sweaters. If you are new to knitting, or to Meg Swansen and her mother, Elizabeth Zimmermann, this is a wonderful introduction to their sensible approach to knitting. I would highly recommend this book to beginning or advanced knitters."},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"For those who love knitting there is nothing more enjoyable (besides knitting) than sitting down with a good book about knitting. With her newest book Meg Swansen provides the avid knitter with a treasure to savor for hours. Her thoughts at the beginning of the book provide insight into her personal life. She has filled the rest of the book with designs that take the readers breath away and placed the designs on herself and many of those that she loves. The book also includes some of the basics of Elizabeth Zimmerman's famous &quot;unventions&quot; including the &quot;percentage system&quot; . All in one package Meg has done it again writing a book you will never want to put down."},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"Being an avid knitter and an even more avid collector of knitting books, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. I was a little worried when I read the &quot;tense&quot; review of it on Amazon.com. FORTUNATELY, that review was shucked with some bad acrylic yarn when I received Meg's new book in the mail. (OK, I couldn't wait till Christmas!) What a wonderful book! The photos are beautiful, and I literally felt as though I were sitting and talking to Meg while we all curled up and knit away. Thanks Meg for taking the time to keep all of your fans like me going...your efforts were more than worth it!"},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"This book is full of timeless treasures, no trendy, here today gone tomorrow designs,all done in the round,steeks, cutting all my favorites. Well done Meg!"},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"This book is thought provoking and helpful - especially the first section of techniques. The designs are not for beginning knitters - which is just fine. I found that a reaading of E. Zimmerman's book (Knitting without Tears) first went a long way in helping to make things more clear. As another reviewer stated the arms on most of the sweaters look very narrow - again this is fine if you are used to adjusting patterns to fit your needs."},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"This book has given me all the tools to no longer be a slave to a pattern. Meg Swansen has so freely given her knowledge so all knitters can have the confidence to knit anything. There is a project in this book for all levels of knitters. This book will be number one in my knitters library."},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"I would buy this book sight un-seen. Since I do have it, I highly recommend it for all knitting levels. The pictures are wonderful, the designs are ones that I will knit again and again. The book allows creativity, but yet is simple enough for those of us who just want to knit the design as is. Meg is a wonderful knitter/designer/technician and I would buy any book she writes on knitting without a second thought."},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"I love knitted garments that draw from the designs of the Turkish, Russian, and Scandanavian cultures. The colors and textures used in this book are timeless. The construction techniques illustrated are indispensible. Needless to say, I am an avid fan of circular knitting and look specifically for books which cover this particular type of knitting whenever and wherever I can. As with any art, it takes time and effort to master technique. And really no one book is the best book for everyone to learn from. That's why it's wonderful that there's a demand for knitters to share their ideas and publish their designs. I applaud Mrs. Swansen for yet another winner. I use her books as a benchmark. If I can master the techniques in her books, I know I'm on the right track.P.S. A word to the wise...please remember to knit a swatch in the ROUND first before attempting any circular knitting project. Tension is different in the round vs. knitting back and forth on straight needles."},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"I find this book delightful. An up-to-the-minute collection of miscellaneous techniques is at the beginning of the book. Then, in addition to the great patterns, Meg has scattered other orignal tips throughout."},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"This was a used book that was in perfect condition and arrived amazingly fast.And who could say any thing bad about EZ's daughter. Trying to complete the complete line of books by both EZ and Meg."},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"An excellent source book but excellent for the patterns! For beginner or advanced this book is a must for learning and just for knitting new patterns!"},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"I am still in the looking stage of this book, but love it. I will begin knitting out of it when I decide on I a pattern. So far I can't decide, i want them all.Great book"},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"I love anything by Meg Swansen. Like visiting with a good friend. Patterns are challenging but doable if your knitting skills are intermediate or better, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"This one tops them all! Meg has outdone herself in this beautiful book. The patterns are wonderful and inspiring and make me itch to get going on one of the vests at the back of the book. I love the autobiographical section at the beginning and the techniques section is worth the price of the book alone. Meg is surely following in the footsteps of her talented mother, Elizabeth Zimmermann. I would recommend this book full of great patterns and beautiful photos taken in natural settings to any knitter, beginner to expert. There is something here for everyone! Kudos, Meg!"},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"Loved the book - use it with her videos and without -- find it easy to understand compared to most other patterns available today. This book will never leave my library. Her teaching method allows me to design my own patterns without a lot of fuss. Writes in a way that makes me feel like she is sitting in the living room helping out. She simplifies everything she can and makes knitting friendly again. --And that doesnt mean she is making simple sweaters - it just means she is making beautiful sweaters easy to knit. Full price would be a bargain for this book! Happy Knitting!"},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"It's her life's work and it shows. Meg Swansen uses each of her unique knitting designs to teach knitters in depth: helping us to learn with text and marvelous color photos; close ups of difficult areas; clear charts and directions. I've knitted many Fassett and Starmore designs and they're gorgeous, but Meg's thoughtful consideration of actual knitting has lead me into designs, such as saddle shoulders, I never could have done without her guidance. Buy this book, your library needs it!"},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"Need your hand held? Meg will do it. Want to sprout wings &amp; fly? Meg will teach you how!

The designs are fresh and the styling classic. I've bought several copies as gifts for both confident and not-so-confident knitters; I think it's perfect for each."},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"The ideas that take shape in these patterns and garments are inspired and in turn will inspire all knitters who understand the beauty of these &quot;knitterly&quot; designs. This book could provoke an even greater renaissance of thinking knitters. These knitting patterns flow perfectly with the rhythm of the art. Nothing is slapped on for show. Take a look at the Phoenix sweater. Incredible!"},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"This book is NOT for the beginning knitter. The technique section in the front has very terse, hard-to-understand directions and hardly any pictures. The techniques are great, don't get me wrong, but please try your directions out on rank beginners before publishing. For example the circular needle trick to avoid double points is hard enough to understand in the Knitter's Magazine article--if I hadn't seen it, I wouldn't learn it from this book.As to the sweaters--they are definitely for places with REAL winters (very heavy), and are definitely for people who will do anything to avoid sewing seams (steeks and so forth). I don't understand the obsession with being seamless--it's not as though you're going to wear these inside out.The Sun/Moon design is the nicest of the sweaters but would have a horrendous amount of twisting colors to avoid long floats. It would make a really nice pillow. I do agree that the vest patterns are the nicest, but even they would be improved by seams to help them hang straight. The socks were okay for those who like to knit socks (I don't), but it would have been nice to include some hats.This book is for hardcore Elizabeth Zimmerman and Meg Swansen fans--everyone else look before you buy to make sure you can understand the writing style."},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"Meg Swansen's KNITTING is a must have book! It is truly inspirational and showcases techniques that all knitters can use to personalize their knitting and create their own one-of-a-kind garments. Meg's ideas are fresh and will not go out of style. If I could purchase only one knitting book this year, Meg Swansen's KNITTING is without a doubt THE ONE I would buy!"},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"I looked at this prize knitting book recently at my favorite YS..and it has stayed in my mind.

The designs are awesome. It is an inspiring book to look at and it will be a choice book for my shelves ! I foresee a splendid winter at my fireplace with this book and skeins of wonderful yarns ! My only criticism, and this has nothing to do with the contents of the book, it is expensive and I think that publisher(s) should do some serious thinking about this."},{"Title":"Meg Swansen's Knitting","review":"This is a must for your knitting library.

This story is inspired by the actual dollhouse that the author had built for her daughter while they were living in Mexico in the early 1950's. However, the story is more about accepting people from other cultures then about the dollhouse. Not surprisingly, the story is set in the mid-1950's, as Nancy has recently recovered from a chilhood bout of polio. Nancy's dollhouse and its dollhouse family, the Dandys, helped get her through a difficult time of recovery. In this third book in The Dandy Dollhouse series, the focus is on a new girl and the problems she must overcome.The new girl at Nancy and Katie's school is from Mexico. Her name is \\"Rosalinda Chavez\\", she dresses in traditional Mexican clothes and is still learning English. Nancy knows what it is like to be teased because of her polio and the leg brace she had to wear, so she and her friend, Katie, offer their friendship to Rosalinda.In a world of prejudice and racial suspicion, the girls find that they have something in common with Rosalinda. She has a wonderful dollhouse! The reader learns something about Mexican families through the \\"living\\" dollhouse family in the Mexican dollhouse.The most valuable lesson this book teaches, though, is the lesson of friendship. Friendship is not always easy, but that doesn't mean that one should not reach out to others who may be different. In this multi-cultural world, it may be less rare to see diversity, but reading this book may gently bring up the topic of prejudice and stereotypes. It offers a role model of three girls and their dollhouse families who do the right thing when it isn't the popular thing to do."},{"Title":"The mental hospital;: A study of institutional participation in psychiatric illness and treatment","review":"The Mental Hospital has been used as a text in the past to explore the administration and day to day running of a big mental hospital. Written by Alfred Stanton, who ran the McLean Hospital for many years , it is an insiders look at what it took to keep such an institution going. It also provides a glimpse of treatments and therapies long out of favor. While it is a somewhat dry read, the authors seem determined to impart every shred of knowledge they may have,it gives a glimpse of how the staff of a large hospital were viewed, and the somewhat elevated position those who ran such a facility were prone to adopting. Many of the treatments and ideas expressed have long gone out of favor, and some of the ideas presented would never be given consideration today. The basic premise , the care and treatment of the mentally ill,and how to present that on a large scale, is still a timely topic and it is by studying such a text that we are able to see the evolution of the mental health care we use today."},{"Title":"Tennessee Williams's the Glass Menagerie & a Streetcar Named Desire (Barron's Book Notes)","review":"I don't agree with those Amazon readers who wrote reviews that 'The Glass Menagerie'is bad. I object! It's like saying Beethoven is a drag; or that Picasso is in need of glasses. What such readers essentially mean is that it's not to their taste. Because they don't like it, it just can't possibly be good. I think if they could manage to drag themselves away from 'Desperate Housewives', for a moment, they'd be able to learn that sensitive and intelligent writing about women is possible, as Tennessee Williams' great masterpiece 'A streetcar Named Desire', 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof', and 'The Glass Menagerie' reveal so well. George Ehrenhaft's a good place to sample what Streetcar & Glass Menagerie are all about; or why I'm making such a fuss about them."},{"Title":"Tennessee Williams's the Glass Menagerie & a Streetcar Named Desire (Barron's Book Notes)","review":"One of the classics of our time.

Colleges and High Schools are known to always to do this play. But it is a sensitive piece of work and is a great piece to preform. Laura's character is so self- conscious and fragile in contrast to her boasterous and out going ex-southern belle mother. This is also interesting because it is actually based upon Tennesse William's family situation. The Charracters are well developed, interesting and natural dialogue and the plot is very interesting."},{"Title":"Tennessee Williams's the Glass Menagerie & a Streetcar Named Desire (Barron's Book Notes)","review":"5 Stars -- for being the worst book I ever read!"},{"Title":"Tennessee Williams's the Glass Menagerie & a Streetcar Named Desire (Barron's Book Notes)","review":"It's not neccesary to read that book - or maybe I'm to stupid to do :-"},{"Title":"College algebra-trigonometry: Examination section, questions and answers (College level examination series / CLEP 7)","review":"A pathetic waste of money! This book is consists mostly of practice exams that have been collected and placed into one volume. Some of the diagrams and graphs on these exams are hand written and barely legible. After each exam is a solution page that gives the answers to the questions. The Solution page, unfortunately,doesn't explain the theories behind the answers. At the end of the book there is a short study guide, written is small font, that provides an overview to the material needed for the exam. Overall, this book looks like bits and pieces from other books that have shoved together into one volume. ...s, one should expect a better organised study guide."},{"Title":"The Nephilim Seed","review":"My first encounter with James Scott Bell's fiction was &quot;Final Witness.&quot; I loved the book. The characters dealt with real emotions in real ways, and the Christian elements didn't seem forced.In &quot;The Nephilim Seed,&quot; although Bell takes a while to unveil the intents of the villian, he creates passable suspense, particularly through the eyes of a young kidnapped girl. Her simple faith is, for the most part, believable. Her mother's casual reliance on prayer is less credible. As a father of two girls, it was difficult for me to believe her response. In particular, she puts little pressure on the authorities to find her daughter; in fact, the police are almost entirely missing from that element of the story. Every time the mother thinks about her missing daughter (not as often as you might suppose), a quick prayer seems to ease her fears.Unfortunately, Bell's books are becoming increasingly pedantic even as they continue to explore broader ideas. As always, he comes up with an intriguing enough plot. Here, he deals with the issue of the &quot;God Spot&quot; in the brain, and whether it's a true desire for God, or an evolutionary result of our need for comfort. His characters and dialogue are fairly believable. This time, though, he makes sure to let us know his Christian viewpoints within the first few pages.James Scott Bell can write well. He has the ability to put me on the edge of my seat. He's capable of making spiritual points. Since he deals with sometimes violent situations in his fiction, perhaps his publishers and/or readers have asked him to infuse his books with more straightforward spiritual statements. This might please the general audience of Christian fiction, but there really are many of us out here who want a story that deals with tough issues head-on while refusing to whitewash the difficulties. Bell gives a decent story here, but fails to deal with the true problems he presents. Instead, he trusts cliches and knee-jerk Christian sayings to settle the characters' struggles.I'll still look for his books, but I hope he goes back to the nitty-gritty. John Grisham displayed that element in &quot;The Testament.&quot; T. Davis Bunn did so in &quot;The Great Divide.&quot; I believe James Scott Bell can do the same again--as long as he doesn't worry about the rumblings of dissent from the choir. Ignore the naysayers, I ask. Give it to us straight from the heart."},{"Title":"The Nephilim Seed","review":"I'm blown away. I just finished reading it seconds ago. I am completely blown away. \\"Christian Futuristic Mystery/Thriller\\" is how I'd classify it.you know how you listen to a milestone of a music CD (something by Elvis, the Beetles, Led Zepplin, Iron Maiden, or Metallica - you know, something of that nature) and you wish you could give it about 10,000 stars on amazon? I wish I could do that with this book.I'm not about to tell you about the story itself. I'll tell you that this author utilizes every word in the English language that he features in this book to perfection. The reader is left shocked countless times (ex. page 360 of the 375 page version - this shock is about as big as if... ... I really can't think of anything on that scale). I compare the first 90 or so pages to a \\"combination of My Cousin Vinny and Big Daddy.\\" That'll give you a sense of what the plot is about. But the aforementioned page 360 is one of the biggest shocks I've ever seen in my life, turning a phrase said often throughout the book into... not what the ending deals with.One surprise after another. Written to perfection. The last book I read was one a lot like this, so as I was on about page 40 of this book I was saying to myself \\"good move, moron - read the same kind of book back to back and automatically, the 2nd one sucks.\\" based on what you've read thus far of this review, you think that's what happened?Humor is intertwined in a way I've never seen it before. I never burst out laughing at the wrong times, though. In other words, if there's a gun in the current scene, expect dead seriousness. But if the characters are on a boat ride (something that actually DOESN'T happen in this book), expect to fall on the floor laughing.Its a story for the emotional just as much as it is a story for one who's passion can drive them into dangerous situations (and I mean DANGEROUS), one who is interested in the everlasting battle between Christians and evolutionists, or someone who just wants a book to read. as long as you don't think you'd be offended by the Christianism (but you're not exactly going to feel a dying urge to become super-religious upon completion of the book, though such thoughts may appear suggested, particularly at the very (somehow and somewhat happy) ending.bottom line: ask me if you think you should read this book and other than the hesitation with the whole Christian aspect, I will tell you: \\"Go read it.\\" There's a lot more than just Christianness in this book."},{"Title":"The Nephilim Seed","review":"Jim Bell has knocked one over the far fences with this one! The characters fairly leap off the pages and the plot is, as in all of Jim's books, relentless. His theme is torn right off today's headlines as he has explored areas new to Christian fiction. Can a movie treatment be far behind? Get the &quot;Seed&quot;, and bring it home. But a caveat...prepare to lose sleep for a few nights; it's that good.So move over, Grisham...&quot;The Nephilim Seed&quot; cooks!"},{"Title":"The Nephilim Seed","review":"The Nephilim Seed is among the best Christian novels I have ever read, and one of the only Christian novels that I would recommend to my non-Christian friends. The book was obviously written expressly for the Christian market - the characters are quick to pray, quick to talk about what church they attend, and wear their faith on their sleeves - but despite the typical propagandizing, the book's characters are much more finely drawn and believable than those you find in your typical thriller from Tami Hoag or Sue Grafton. The story line is one of the most intelligent plots I've read in a long time, and the characters are as likely to talk about Nietzche and modern philosophy as they are about the Bible. The book explores the disturbing possibilities of genetic technology wedded to post-modern thought (a topic explored chillingly in the non-fiction book The Biotech Century by Jeremy Rifkin). I recommend it heartily."},{"Title":"The Nephilim Seed","review":"The Nephilim Seed had me in suspense.

The fast pace literally propells you from chapter to chapter and you'll find yourself wishing you could take the whole day for reading &quot;to find out what happens next!&quot; Bell's salty character &quot;Jed&quot; is a winner, and someone you'll root for from beginning to end."},{"Title":"The Nephilim Seed","review":"This is one of the best new novels I have read this year. It is filled with suspenseful action and intrigue as the author follows several characters through a fast-paced mystery. Yet, it also makes a powerful statement about the ominious implications of biotechnology and the lack of ethics surrounding these developments. A page turner all the way, it includes a surprise twist near the end that keeps you guessing. If the author can keep it up, he may rate comparisons to John Grisham -- one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"The Nephilim Seed","review":"If you love suspense and enjoy the precariouis position of sitting on the edge of your seat, you MUST read The Nephilim Seed!

Janice Ramsey is shopping in a grocery store when a man runs by and steals her purse. AFter briefly chasing after the man, she returns to find that her ten-year old daughter, Lauren, has been kidnapped. Janice is convinced her ex-husband, Sam, is behind it because they are involved in a custody battle.A bounty hunter named Jed is searching for the killers of his brother Sterling Brown. Jed finds the man who killed Sterling and finds a connection to Sam on the killer's computer. Jed hooks up with Janice and they begin a trip to the East Coast to try and find the truth behind Laurnen's dissappearance and Sterling's killer.That \\"thruth\\" is Bentley Davis, a Harvard Professor with designs on controlling the world through genetic engineering. Davis has designed a gene, the Nephelim seed, that can cause people to lose all emotional thought and to even doubt the existence of God.The novel is basically a race agains time. Can Janice and Jed rescue Lauren before it is too late? While the plot was engaging, I found the characters to be what kept me turning the pages. Janice has faced the ultimate horror, having a child kidnapped. Lauren is the innocent child who constantly prays to God for guidance. Jed has fallen away from God after he felt God abandoned him in times of trouble. Bentley Davis hates God and thinks he has found the answer: an injection that takes away the need for God and emotion-based thought.The religious message of the novel is hit and miss. Bell hints at spiritual warfare covered in his later novels. Characters also send mixed messages about why bad things happen. In one scene, when her father is threatening her, Lauren wonders \\"Why is God letting this happen?\\"This is a fun novel full of riveting characters that have the depth needed to make this a page turner. Fans of Bell shouldn't hesitate to read this book."},{"Title":"The Nephilim Seed","review":"If you love suspense and enjoy the precariouis position of sitting on the edge of your seat, you MUST read The Nephilim Seed!

I gave it 5 stars because I couldn't think of anything I'd rather do than race to the finish line of The Nephilim Seed. I was hooked on the first page; swept into every scene by characters so well imagined I'll remember them forever. I wanted to protect Lauren, hunt down her father, encourage her mother and go to the police academy so I could personally arrest Davis and all those involved in UniGen. If this isn't a movie--I don't know what is. Man! James, where's the sequel? Facsinating! P.S. Circumstancial Evidence, Blind Justice are great reads too."},{"Title":"Best of Britain's Steam Railways: Exploring Britain's Railway Heritage","review":"The book claims to feature 100 of Britain's steam railways, but actually features fewer than half that number in ay detail. Even if you add in those mentioned briefly in the features on narrow gauge railways, miniature railways, working museums and main line railways on which steam trains sometimes run (notably the Settle and Carlisle), the total comes nowhere near 100 - more like 60. As I hadn't paid much attention to these claims when I found copies on offer at a bargain price, I wasn't that bothered but I nevertheless feel it necessary to drop a star for the false claim. I knew from the book's title that it wasn't a comprehensive guide so I wasn't expecting one, but if the book had featured 100 railways, I would certainly have expected the Embsay and Bolton Abbey Railway in Yorkshire and the Colne Valley Railway in Essex to be among the featured railways, and they aren\`t the only surprise omissions. Still, there are many other books about heritage railways, some of which attempt to be comprehensive. All the really famous heritage railways are featured here including the Talyllyn (the first ever railway to be preserved for heritage), the Ffestiniog, the Snowdon Mountain, the Keighley and Worth Valley, the Bluebell and the Severn Valley.Seeing another review that pokes fun at the book, I should point out that it is more of an appreciation of heritage railways rather than a serious study. It is therefore ideal for those who want to see some steam trains who but are looking to build a day out around them. So you won't find lists of locomotives to be found on each railway, but you will find comments about the railway in general and what can be seen in the area. Tourists (especially families) will appreciate the advice about getting off the train at a particular intermediate station to spend time visiting some attraction that might otherwise pass them by. Indeed, such attractions may provide an excuse for a family day out on a steam railway. Some of the books primarily intended for steam buffs won't bother with this type of information.Yes, there are plenty of great photographs but enough other information is provided to enable anybody to decide whether their local steam railways (or those near their holiday destinations) are worth a visit - if they are among those featured..Tourists wishing to see one of Britain's heritage railways will find this a useful guide, especially if they want to know what else they can do while they're there. Steam buffs are likely to be less keen on the book, though some of them will see it as an opportunity to persuade the family that these railways are worth visiting for reasons other than just the trains. Website addresses and telephone numbers are provided for all featured railways, together with a description of services provided, though it's possible that some are out of date or misprinted. Anybody planning a visit would be well advised to check the website for the latest information about train schedules and special events. Whatever their original intention, these heritage railways now accept that their main income derives from tourism and their timetables reflect this, so services don't run to any regular pattern as commercial services do.This book would easily justify five stars if it weren't for the publisher's claim to feature 100 railways. Still, there is something ironic about the publishing arm of a motoring organization releasing a book about the delights of steam railways."},{"Title":"Patrick's Corner","review":"I can count on one hand the titles of the books I have been unable to put down, and this is one of them.

Modesitt gives us more than just characters to read about, but instead &quot;people&quot; to &quot;follow.&quot; This book was a quick read, due to the fact that you don't wish to put it down.

It's evident from the more recent books involving Chaos masters that neither Chaos nor Order is intrinsically good or evil; it's the use those masters make of those forces.We know from _The Order War_, _Fall of Angels_ and _The Chaos Balance_ that at deep and fundamental levels, Order and Chaos are balanced, and that an increase in either triggers an increase in the other. The entrenched Order of Recluce helped power Fairhaven in _The Order War_ . The Chaos on the continent of Candar in _The Magic of Recluce_ fed the white wizards.And we know from _The Order War_ that Lerris' uncle, Justen, greatly reduced the forces of Chaos by annihilating Fairhaven and the core of white wizards who lived there sometime before Lerris was born. Under the Balance, the power of Order necessarily declined, too. The Mighty Ten became the less mighty three.Yet in _The Death of Chaos_, we surely have in the mature Lerris surely the most powerful Order Master that Recluce has produced. More than any of the extraordinarily powerful Order Masters of the past, Lerris changes the world. His are, quite literally, Apocalyptic powers. So, under Modesitt's carefully crafted rules, where does this power come from? Where is the Chaos that permits Lerris to have such power? We know about Chaos focuses; what causes Lerris, in a time when there are a significant number of other Order Masters (his father, his uncle and his aunt, to name three), to have such world-changing powers? If there is such a thing as an &quot;Order focus,&quot; why does it exist in Lerris? His father and uncle, remember, destroyed Fairhaven.It's a question Modesitt doesn't explain or even acknowledge. While _The Death of Chaos_ clearly calls for a sequel (What will Hamor do next? What has happened to the Angels? To Naclos? To the Balance?), it's hard to see how he can explain his way out of the problem he has created. Lerris simply should not be able to do what he does. For that matter, why are the Order-Chaos Balanced relatives of Lerris reduced to dust for heaven's sake? Did Lerris completely destroy the Balance? The epilogue suggests otherwise.This is a good yarn, and it helped foreshadow Modssitt's break of the link between good and Order and between evil and Chaos that has followed in subsequent Recluce books. But for me the huge logical inconsistency that's the premise of the story makes it a less successful book."},{"Title":"The Death of Chaos (Saga of Recluce, Book 5)","review":"Did I mention that L.E. Modesitt Jr. is my hero? So anyway...here I am, reading this absolutely wonderful book, drooling over books to come, and along comes the end. I wasn't happy with the end, but it was done well if I'm forced to be honest. Anyway, here's the good vs. bad points:Good:1) More woodworking! Long, detailed and easy-paced sections with Lerris making furnature. Its cool. I've never read a fantasy story like this, where the main character destroys evil on Sunday, and makes a nice furniture set on Monday. And it works.2) I got to see a number of great characters from previous books all show up. Kinda like when the cast of the Love Boat showed up on Fantasy Island (heh).3) I love the clever ways Lerris learns to use Order and Chaos.4) The plotting as to why this latest crisis has come about is realistic (within the bounds of that universe), which is important.Bad points (my policy is to write something negative in all reviews, however trifling):1) Not enough woodworking! I'd be happy with an entire book with Lerris making furnature, trying to meet deadlines, getting new commissions, making his \\"masterpiece\\", etc.2) I sort of wish the characters weren't so worried about killing the people who want to kill them. They seem a bit squeemish. I think this is because the alternative is characters with tremendous powers who don't have any obstacles. If you make them worried about the mayhem they create, it limits them, and the story becomes less of a cakewalk for the heros.3) I didn't find the crisis between Krystal and Lerris to be something I could sympathize with. It seemed geared to making certain things happen later in the story. I could see the strings of the puppeteer.4) The ending was executed well, no spelling errors or anything, but I wasn't happy with the outcome."},{"Title":"The Death of Chaos (Saga of Recluce, Book 5)","review":"In the Death of Chaos, the story of Lerris, Justen, Krystal, Tamra and the other exiles of recluce comes full circle. The story line was great, with lots of awesome battle scenes and crazy magic preformed by black, white, and gray wizards. The story culminates with Hamor attacking Candar and Recluce with a massive fleet of battleships and cannon.Not only the story line makes this the best book in the series thus far. The characters are lovable and believable, while at the same time completely badass. The dialect and the relationships between characters in this book are very well thought out and realistic. The one thing that I thought Modesitt could use a little work on is his obsession with minute details, some of which don't really need to be included. I mean, he kinda turns a long story into an even longer book by included lots of information that isn't really pertinant to the storyline."},{"Title":"The Death of Chaos (Saga of Recluce, Book 5)","review":"Mr. Modesitt's &quot;Death of Chaos&quot; is A VERY GOOD BOOK, but I like no LOVE his &quot;Magic of Recluce&quot; better. =-)"},{"Title":"The Death of Chaos (Saga of Recluce, Book 5)","review":"I wish there were more books with the same cast of characters.

I thought it was so-so. I read another in the series after it, and thouroughly enjoyed it. When I came back to 'The Towers', I loved it. I only say this, because it seems a lot of the books in the series were like that. I missed the deeper picture. 'The Death of Chaos' is one of the best books I have had the pleasure to read. I found it to be thoughful, and insightful, and consistent. One of the points in the other reviews is the lack of consistency in that Lerris, the main character, is an order focus at a time of too much order. In Modesitt's world, magic is divided into Chaos and Order. These different aspects are always balanced. If there is too much Order, Chaos will start popping up in the form of White Chaos wizard foci. The fact is that he was a 'grey' wizard, with great power of the balance. He didn't tilt the scales either way, leaving the rules set by Modesitt intact. Another aspect of Modesitt that was hard to get used to was the style of his writing. He leaves much to the imagination, which once I got used to I found again to be highly rewarding. With his wit, and turn of phrase, Modesitt seems to show that almost every line in the book was written with care, to bring you to careening to the climatic ending. All in all one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Death of Chaos (Saga of Recluce, Book 5)","review":"This is, imho, the best of the series to this point. The wait for the return of lerris was more than worth it. The book has a more human than human quality that I find almost unbearable in its poignancy. I could wish there was less tech and more magic, but that is almost a sideline to the real struggle in the book as lerris comes to manhood. I am not ashamed to say I cried several times while reading the book, and at the oddest parts. I cannot recommend it highly enough, the characters, the magic, the imagery are outstanding and original. I rank recluce with black company, sword of truth, wheel of time and curse of the mistrwraith."},{"Title":"The Death of Chaos (Saga of Recluce, Book 5)","review":"I've notice this crazy trend with online reviews - raves with little explanation equal positive feedback from readers, and those that are critical receive quite low marks. Now tell me - those of us who are &quot;well read&quot; in the genre of science fiction and epic fantasy - can any of us really say that Modesitt is in the upper echelon of fantasy authors? Certainly not. Were there such a list though, men like Jordan, Martin, Tolkein, Rawn, and Jacques would be at the top. Their worlds are captivating, believable, with characters that DO rather than say, and you feel transported. Modesitt does have numerous redeeming qualities: a good magic system, interesting political commentary (moreso than most fantasy), and a penchant for making his heroes so mellow and modest. On the other hand, the meal scenes are intolerably long, slow, and frequent. There's a lot of inexplicable happenings - for example - why did Lerris and Krystal need to be bonded? In that area of the book - I reread the same 10 or 15 pages that SEEMED to be explaining, but I was baffled at to the apparent necessity. My theory - just so that we could have more lovey dialogue and a few situations where she could answer question he had thought and not spoken. At least there was more conflict than in previous books (the Magic Engineer was awful), and that perked my interest and saved me from many naps that otherwise would have been taken. I would caution anyone who has not read - this is SLOW stuff. There's nothing wrong with that if done right, but I can only safely say that the Recluce series gets it partially right."},{"Title":"The Death of Chaos (Saga of Recluce, Book 5)","review":"This book has the same formula which has worked well in the previous books in the Recluse series, but in The Death of Chaos it seems to be getting a little tired. In each of the previous books, the hero settles a major problem of the time (and creates the groundwork for future problems), and makes a discovery about the order/chaos balance. In The Death of Chaos, however, Lerris' solution is virtually the same as Justen's in The Order War, and it seems that we're right back where we were after the destruction of Fairhaven. I also find it strange that Justen and Dayala would be in favor of such a resolution. In spite of my objections to the conclusion, the storytelling is as strong as ever and The Death of Chaos is a difficult book to put down."},{"Title":"The Death of Chaos (Saga of Recluce, Book 5)","review":"This book is very interesting and a rewarding read. Having read the first 6 books of the series this has to be one of the best ones. The &quot;inconsistencies&quot; stated in some of the other reviews really aren't there at all. Lerris as well as Justen were GREY wizards (and you could make a case for Gunnar being one too). So there powers balance out since they use both chaos and order. As to Lerris' relatives, since Lerris pretty much destroyed all the order and chaos in the world they could not hold there ancient bodies together without order. All in all this is one of the best books I've ever read and is well worth the price."},{"Title":"The Death of Chaos (Saga of Recluce, Book 5)","review":"This book is great, it was such a quick read because I just didn't want to put it down. I would recommend it to everyone because, Modesitts world, is so vividly real. A few have the skills to master the power of Chaos, and a few have the skills to master the power of Order. Lerris is an Order Master, probably the most powerful to have lived yet, in the world of Recluce. He is happy to just be considered a Woodcrafter, but when a situation arises he goes into action using his Order abilities, which he likes to be very modest about. This book has definitely lived up to my expectations, since the first book ends with a statement that made me really want to read this book. I really liked the way Modesitt described the gruesome, Medieval-like battle scenes and Lerris' heroics. It was interesting reading about Lerris' newfound magical powers. Overall this was a great book. If you are interested in fantasy books this is for you."},{"Title":"The Death of Chaos (Saga of Recluce, Book 5)","review":"This book is one of the most exciting that I have ever read. Practically from the beginning to the end of this novel something significant is occuring. Even when Modesitt writes casual conversations, they are relative to the story as a whole. This, I think, is the authors greatest attribute; the ability to make the profound seem innocuous. Lerris, the erstwhile hero in this culminatory book,seems a ' simple carpenter' and is content with this, but when faced with adversity, is able to rise to a situation. The battleground of Order and Chaos serves as the basis for greater themes - such as the application of volition and the hegemony of societies. This book should be read since it is the final edition of the Recluce Series and, still greater, for the prodigious skill and ability of Modesitt as a writer."},{"Title":"The Death of Chaos (Saga of Recluce, Book 5)","review":"What can I say, I am a HUGE Recluse Saga fan. I think the books in the series are excellent and I love the flowing writing style. These are those books that you read and can't put down. I have often come to the end of a chapter and needed to go to bed or go do something else, and been so \\"into\\" the story that I had to start the next chapter. This Saga will capture you.The books can be read out of order but some books in the series are sequential - the first book starts a story about a given character, the next book in the sequence finishes off that story. Be sure to read the first of these to start. Other books in the series are stand alone and can be read solo. But trust me, it would be VERY tough to read only one book in this series.Some series have great \\"re-read\\" value and I hold this Recluse Saga as one of my most \\"re-read\\" ever. Some of these I have read 4 or 5 times and still enjoy them and have trouble putting them down. From Karl the cooper to Rahl and his issues, the characters in these books come alive and we get real buy-in to what happens to them.Do yourself a favor and pick up a couple of the Recluse Saga books. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Death of Chaos (Saga of Recluce, Book 5)","review":"So I've read the recluse books up to and through this point, and I have to say, they're very mediocre at best. He writes very detailed descriptions of the crafting involved, in this book woodworking, and you can tell the guy spent more than a few Sundays at the Amish village making chairs. But, really, his books have very little point. They just drag on and on and then come to a pretty unsatisfying ending, this one as much as the others. I enjoy them in a sense because they're easy reads that are mildly entertaining, but people saying these are the best books they've ever read are very misguided. Overall, two stars seems harsh, but three stars is generous. I'll leave it with three because I did read three of the books to get to this point, and I don't feel bitter about it."},{"Title":"The Death of Chaos (Saga of Recluce, Book 5)","review":"L. E. Modesitt Jr. always produces a great story that keeps you wanting to read more. I have many of his books."},{"Title":"The Stars for a Light (Cheney Duvall, M.D.)","review":"I'll admit I was skeptical at first. While I read Christian fiction all the time and enjoy it, I'd never read a Christian historical fiction book that I really liked. My cousin highly recommended these books, so I thought I would give the first one a try. Of course I became hooked almost right away.I liked the premise before I even started to read the book. A female doctor in the 1860's? Great premise! The book met and exceded any expectations I had for such a premise. As Dr. Cheney Duvall and her nurse, Shiloh Irons, travel from New York to Seattle with Asa Mercer and his hundred belles, they face danger and disease, along with more common shipboard problems. I was so disappointed when I finished this book, simply because I didn't have the next book in the series (Shadow of the Mountains) along, so I had to wait to start it.Lynn and Gilbert Morris make a fantastic writing team. The plot is swift and intriguing. The characters are well fleshed-out and believeably, delightfully human. The dialogue is fun to read. All in all, this is a wonderfully well done book. Needless to say, not only do I love this book, but I love the others in the series that I have read so far. I definitely recommend this, even if you don't think Christian historical fiction is your thing."},{"Title":"The Stars for a Light (Cheney Duvall, M.D.)","review":"The Stars for a Light by Lynn and Gilbert Morris is the first book of the Cheney Duval, M.D. series which consists of 8 books and a subsequent series called the Inheritance. So far, that contains only 1 book.Overall, this is a nice, entertaining book. The series is fun, too, although sometimes the adventures seem rather unrealistic. However, there are adventures, and they are exciting. This book/series has that, plus mystery and romance. I'm not a big fan of christian literature, but I did like these books. I reccomend it for people who like christian fiction or historical fiction.The Stars for a Light tells the story of Cheney Duvall, a lady physician who struggles to become accepted in an all-male medical world. Other physcians look down on her, and patients don't trust a woman to doctor them. As a last resort, Cheney gets a job escorting/doctoring a group of women traveling by ship to California in order to add more women to the western population. Cheney brings along a nurse, who was reccomended by a friend. Mr. Shiloh Irons. He's an orphan, with his name coming from the crate marked Shiloh Ironworks in which he was found.This unlikely pair (a female doctor and male nurse) travel to California with plenty of adventures to keep them busy, including Shiloh's hobby/second job of fighting, fires on board the ship, disease, and other excitements.It is a good book. The characters are likeable and realistic, with their own particular traits. The dialogue is fun and the characters seem to work well with one another. It's well written and original, showing character development aplenty during the series. If you start on this, read it all. By the fourth book, you'll be hooked. I was."},{"Title":"The Stars for a Light (Cheney Duvall, M.D.)","review":"I really liked this book. Mr. Morris is very capable of writing books that capture your attention, and yet he weaves a remarkable tale of God's love into his stories. This is by far one of my favorite series.

I read all the books several times through when I was younger. Gilbert Morris has always been known for his fantastic historical fiction, but the characters can be a bit formulaic. I feel Lynn brings a wonderful realness to Cheney and Shiloh on top of the expected historic detail. There are plot twists, realistic character development and beautiful descriptions of the settings. I can't think of a Christian book series I love more than Cheney Duvall, M.D. I highly recommend it. This is the first in the series, so I'd recommend starting here. :-)"},{"Title":"The Stars for a Light (Cheney Duvall, M.D.)","review":"This is the first book in a great series by Gilbert and Lynn Morris.

Gilbert & Lynn Morris are excellent writers. I started reading the series first. Then my mom started and she also couldn't put them down.

I have already read the second book the The Inheritance series (I read it in 2 1/2 days, I couldn't put it down). I am now ready for book three to come in the summer of 2005.

Cheney Duvall is a doctor upon a ship taking 200 women to the Washington Teeritory to find husbands. She loading her supplies and almost raped. A mand saves her and turns out to be her nurse, Shiloh Irons. They face many hardships including disease and fights amoung the ship. All through the story the love story blossoms and very wonderful in the end"},{"Title":"The Stars for a Light (Cheney Duvall, M.D.)","review":"Although this book was a bit slow-moving at times, I stuck with it and started to enjoy it more towards the end as the action seemed to pick up a bit. But then came the ending scene which I found to be very offensive. The last scene is supposed to be a romantic scene between Cheney Duvall, the woman doctor and Shiloh Irons, the male nurse who has assisted her on the ship. She has resisted his advances all along even though she is secretly attracted to him. In the final scene, she is still resisting his advances until he forces himself on her, forcibly kissing her and holding onto her until she finally gives in and kisses him in return and holds onto him, and confesses her attraction to him. This is a very inappropriate way to have women treated. It is the old stereotypical idea that women don't really mean it when they tell a man no and that all he has to do is push hard enough, even force himself on her, to get her to give in and enjoy his advances. This is the view that makes men feel justified in mistreating women even to the point of rape. It is sad that this is considered to be Christian fiction since truly Christian men who follow the Biblical way of treating women would never treat a woman like this. And this kind of treatment of women should not be viewed as positive!"},{"Title":"IF I ASKED U WOULD U STAY PB","review":"This is a more adult-teenager story about two 17-year-olds who have run away (separately) and are trying to live on their own. One is seeking love; the other is fleeing it. The title is long, awkward and revealing. Set in a coastal resort in southern California, this book presents two lonely young people who meet when He rescues Her from the ocean. She fears pursuit from a vicious man while he cherishes a hopeless lost love.His hideout is unusual and interesting: a hidden room above an abandoned carousel along a popular boardwalk. Can these two kids make it on their own, or even in tandem? Can he protect her from her Present? Can she help him overcome his obsession with the Past, which is not even his own? Very adult themes and situations, so this is not a book for elementary children.Eve Bunting is a wonderful author whom I respect, for she deals with many serious social issues: --Teenage Runaways --Homeless People who live in airports --Orphan trains which transplant the unwanted children of NY city to midwestern farms --chemical poisoning of the land --responsible babysitting"},{"Title":"IF I ASKED U WOULD U STAY PB","review":"In the novel, If I Asked You Would You Stay, there were two teens wondering and looking for their place in life. They have never met, but soon after they do, they fall in love. If I Asked You Would You Stay was a very good book. It was interesting and if I had to rate this book, I would rate it 8/10. (Ten being the highest and one being the lowest.) Although in some places it does move at a slow pace. Even though it moves at a slow pace, I recommend this book for anyone who likes to read adventure novels, but also for the people who like a little bit of romance in their novels."},{"Title":"IF I ASKED U WOULD U STAY PB","review":"I had been searching for this book for forever. I know it must sound corny but I had ran across it in middle school and had fallen in love with the story. Its not so much a real mushy love story, its more of the kind that keeps you on the edge of your seat at times, and makes you want to keep turning the pages. Even as I read it now, and even though I know the story, reading it over years later, still leaves me interest and i dont want to stop turning the pages cause I remember how much of a good book it was then and im so happy to own it and able to read it at my own leisure.

Dohrmann is the founder of a group called IBI (http://www.ibiglobal.com), and I have heard him speak on a couple of occasions. I was impressed with his speaking ability and enthusiasm, which is what lead me to get this book.It was a major disappointment.BJ Dorhmann is a much better speaker than he is a writer. I think part of the problem is that he attempts to write in exactly the same style as he speaks, which just doesn't come out very good. Another thing I noticed after I read the book, and went back and listened carefully to him speak again, is that he tends to speak in platitudes that are lacking in any real meaning, and he is prone to non sequitur. The faithful, of course, will insist that every word is deathless prose (and no doubt they will take issue with this review!)This book, UNFORTUNATELY, is a HARD READ because of the pointless EMPHASIS (using CAPITAL letters just like that) that he SCATTERS at RANDOM throughout the FIRST 2/3rds of THE book. He doesn't even consistently write in complete grammatically-correct sentences until near the end, where he goes off on a political tangent that resembles some of the ramblings I've seen on \\"Trilateralist\\" conspiracy theories."},{"Title":"Super Achiever Mindsets","review":"This is easily the most badly written book I've read in years. Here is an example of one of the better parts -- a paragraph that begins at the bottom of page 174:\\"Super Achievers believe that a free will demands eddies in the stream of creative conscious behavior; as all forms of creative endeavor struggle to flow back to an increasingly closer relationship to the creative source (in awareness). Awareness is a personal Gameboy that never runs low on batteries as you play your own game. Awareness is a one operator Gameboy. Each plays his own game and records his own score. It's more fun to play by those with similar scores. We call angels Super Achievers. The natural order is the most exciting of all games; we call this game Life.\\"If you want 236+ pages of that and worse, go ahead and read it."},{"Title":"Super Achiever Mindsets","review":"I did not purchase this book, I received it as a prize at a networking event. I felt bad that I hadn't touched the book for a few months but I was already deep in other personal development books. When I did finally give it some time, I was very disappointed. Dohrmann begins with a personal anecdote that lasts way too long and leaves you wondering what the point of the story is. Dohrmann uses a technique of capitalizing entire words (like THIS) to create emphasis. This may work for him as a speaker but it makes for a very frustrating read. This will be the last time I deviate from NY Times best selling authors."},{"Title":"Super Achiever Mindsets","review":"All I can say is about 30 minutes into the book i have no idea what I'm reading other than his experiences he's had... big deal.. book is now in the garbage.."},{"Title":"Super Achiever Mindsets","review":"Anyone who likes Napoleon Hill, Og Mandino, and the Super Stars of philosophy will love BJ Dohrmann's books.

I purchased this book as soon as I heard it was available and was able to get Mr. Dohrmann to autograph my copy.BJ is a man with a quest and his legacy will live on many years after he is gone. I will strongly suggest that those who have the opportunity to purchase this book do so. It will guide those who follow the principals offered to new heights of achievement.Of course, this book is a threat to those who want to continue to have Americans living in need of government to take care of them and be their safety net in life. I am not sure if those who believe in safety nets have really thought about this, but nets have holes between every strand. With BJ's book people will be able to take charge of their own lives and have a future filled with abundance.This is a book that certain political groups do not want you to read. Once you acquire this book and start to use the principals within and learn to become a part of an ever growing circle of entrepreneurs, investors, and thousands of other people whose goal is to help dreams become a reality you will be able to break free of want and live in the law of abundance."},{"Title":"Shadowrun 33: Psychotrope","review":"This was one of the first Shadowrun novels I ever picked up, and it's also the one that got me hooked on the series. While the intimate descriptions of the surroundings may get you confused, you have to realize that the world they're in, the Matrix, usually looks different for each inhabitant. And when everything changes to suit an evil computer, well you just have to be able to understand that long descriptions matter. The characters are flawless and interesting to read about. A top quality book for anyone interested in the Shadowrun genre."},{"Title":"Shadowrun 33: Psychotrope","review":"This book was an excellent read, especially for the people who GM matrices in SR.

However, the ending (involving the Otaku &amp; the mystery of the &quot;Deep Resonance,&quot; and the motivations/goals of the &quot;D.R.&quot;) was in my mind unsuccessful, though I can't say I blame the author for this because it was probably inspired by remarks on the subject in Virtual Realities 2.0 (p.148).However, I do think Stephen Kenson handled a similar theme much more successfully in Technobabel, so Psychotrope suffers by comparison."},{"Title":"Shadowrun 33: Psychotrope","review":"I've beena big fan of the shadowrun novels, since my first one, Dead Air.

This is really an interesting read which I enjoyed very much even though the book is very short. I read it immediately after the \\"Explaining The Resurrection\\" and I think that both could make one volume (\\"When Jesus Returns\\" is a good follow up as well).Many of Jesus words and deeds could be understood well if we know where is he now, why he should be there and what is he doing now. His disciples understood his ascension and was so glad that they worshiped him. That we can't see Jesus today doesn't mean that he is not real (there is a chapter about where is heaven). He went to ask his Father to send the Holy Spirit on others, still baptises people in his Spirit. He also received all authority in heaven and earth and still rules the universe. Our hope is also in him to return on earth (as angels said the same way he ascended)."},{"Title":"Origin and Meaning of Hasidism, The","review":"Maurice Friedman Buber's great interpreter and faithful student said that \\"in this book Buber completed his lifework of recreating and interpreting Hasidism.

Van Vogt did for me in Sci Fi what Nathaniel Hawthorne did in his \\"Last of the Mohicans\\". The central character in each story is a man of courage who goes against societal norms to reach out to members of completely alien cultures, to save those he loves from a common enemy. Here, Trevor Jamieson encounters blind and unyielding hatred from fellow humans for the Ezwal, a creature whom only he knows may hold the secret to humanity's life-or-death struggle with the insectoid Rull, a struggle which until now they were losing. In dealing with this hatred, he teaches those humans with whom he works the necessity of overcoming their fears and prejudices, to build the kind of alliances that would save them. Van Vogt's book begins with Jamieson's efforts to link up with an extremely hostile and dangerous Ezwal, to survive being stranded on Eristan II, a planet inhabited by the most intensely feral life forms in the galaxy. His survival there, his close brush with asassination on Carson's Planet, and his enlistment of his young son in the struggle were all wonderfully enjoyable reading. Make no mistake, the technology in the story may be dated, but so what........ The courage, empathy, fierce determination, and vision are all character traits that are timeless. Now if only we could see this wonderful creature - the Ezwal - come alive in the movies................"},{"Title":"The War Against the Rull","review":"I read this book, or parts of it over 30 (!) years ago when I wanted blasters and spaceships and lots of BEMs. It is one of the items in my 'keeper' library. The Rull enemy has a fantasy element (shapechanger) that will appeal, and a cold-blooded ability to eradicate the humans it opposes. Read it as an adventure yarn, and not as a comment on civilization."},{"Title":"The War Against the Rull","review":"My favourite van vogt book. This is the book which got me hooked on to sci-fi. Exciting and gripping till the end."},{"Title":"The War Against the Rull","review":"Earth is at war with a hive-mind, chameleon skinned, human-sized race of insects, the Rull.That's pretty much it as far as the story is concerned... but on a space opera/adventure point of view, there's just a little bit of everything for everyone.Space faring, giant six-legged telepathic blue crocodiles (the Ezwals) that may hold the key to victory, amazonia-like planets expeditions, and the ever-present threat of the invisible enemy, the Rull...This was my first sci-fi read over 15 years ago, and the wonder of it still lingers around from time to time. That's the main reason for those 4 stars up there. I guess many people wouldn't be so generous with it, though. Don't expect a masterpiece, but be ready for something like a cross between Doc Savage and Forbidden Planet (I know, *EEEW* what a terrible mix, but that's the most accurate I can think of)Sometimes it even feels like reading E. R. Burrough's Tarzan: you get a course on how to get rid of a giant vampire-like creature that has trapped you inside a cave. (I won't spoil this one, but now I think I'd survive such an encounter - sci-fi pulp can be very educating)The opening set of chapters summarizes it all: a rescue anti-grav platform is slowly going down towards the deadly surface of a swamp planet. The hero is strapped to the underside of it. An Ezwal that has been captured and taken off his homeworld sits on top of it. The Ezwal, who caused the ship they both were in to explode, promises his human hunter that he'll become the prey once the platform touches down. And anyway the predators down there will take care of him when night falls...Now THAT is adventure !!!Overall a very enjoyable summer read. Go for it."},{"Title":"The War Against the Rull","review":"I have read this book several times and have always thought it should be turned into a movie.

And that creates this feeling of something missing.The book as a whole is a great adventure , with a great backround story , and the end is remarkeble , a truely Van Vogtian ending. It's a book I recommend to pre-campbellian readers."},{"Title":"The War Against the Rull","review":"I first read this about 30-odd years ago, and have re-read it many times.

Van VogtThis is a pretty good adventure story (or series of stories) with lots of classic SF elements: ravenous over-sized monsters, mysterious aliens, ray guns, an interstellar war between space empires, interstellar diplomacy, and an heroic scientist who has to talk sense into closed-minded politicians and military men. The War Against the Rull is a solid effort worth the time of classic SF fans.I read the 1999 Tor edition of this 1959 fix up, based on short stories Van Vogt wrote in the 1940s.

Here is Trevor Jamieson, hundreds of feet above the ground, dangling by three cables from an antigravity plate. And there on top of the plate is the massive, blue-headed, telepathic ezwal:A great claw-studded paw slid over the side of the raft, flicked down at one of the three slender cables that supported Jamieson's harness. There was a bright steely _ping_ as the cable parted from the slashing blow, and the force of it lifted Jamieson in his harness several feet. He dropped back heavily and began swinging from the remaining cables as from a trapeze. (1)I would not for a million rubles dream of revealing what happens next. The action of the book as a whole involves a conflict between humans and the remorseless Rull. The Rull are wormlike, bellicose, ruthless aliens. By means of a shape changing ability, they can take on the appearance of most other creatures. They can impersonate the President of the Galactic Federation, Commander Kramer of the Space Patrol, or your kindly Uncle Abner. _Anybody_ could be a Rull!There is a theme of paranoia that pervades the novel, much in the tradition of such 1950s films as _Invasion of the Body Snatchers_, _The Thing_, and _I Married a Monster From Outer Space_. The Rull themselves are highly paranoid. Any creature not a Rull is considered a deadly enemy. Because they are such masters of disguise, they force humans to adopt paranoid defenses. Various individual characters in the novel are paranoid (and thus overly rigid and unco-operative in the face of big problems that demand flexibility and teamwork). Jamieson is the voice of reason. But few people listen to him and many want to kill him. If you think that all of this has the makings of a good space opera, you would be right.But..._but_... There is a problem. The book is a fixup novel comprised of five _Astounding_ novelettes published between 1940 and 1950, and they are not all of equal quality. The best two novelettes, with thrill-a-minute action, form the beginning of the novel, while the others are a bit more anticlimactic. And the conclusion to the novel is abrupt and less than credible.So we do not have a novel that represents van Vogt at his best (as with _The World of Null-A_ and _The Weapon Shops of Isher_). But it is not van Vogt at his worst (_The Beast_, _Rogue Ship_), either. That is something to be thankful for. We have a novel about on par with _The Mixed Men_ and _The Silkie_. Not great, but good. Worth a bit of your time."},{"Title":"The War Against the Rull","review":"I have a ancient, eternally dusty edition of this book, and even if it's really, as I said, old-fashioned, it's a nice way to have a good time. And it has at least one really interesting creature, the ezwal."},{"Title":"Stories of the ballets","review":"This is exactly what it says it is--a book about ballet. Loved all the stories, used it for a research paper when I needed the story line of several classical ballets and it was perfect! My only complaint...it was damaged in shipping. The hard cover was smashed or something while it was being shipped and now there three lovely holes in it. But the book itself is wonderful!"},{"Title":"Keeping Kids Reading: How to Raise Avid Readers in the Video Age","review":"If you love reading the way I do, there is very little more important to you than raising children who love to read. I thought this book was wonderful. The author is obviously passionate about getting kids hooked on reading, and believes that you should do just about anything to acheive this goal. She points out how many parents that don't hesitate to spend tons of money on toys and clothes balk at buying kids books, and points out how books can be found at lawn sales and book sales by the ton for very cheap, and how money spent on books is an investment of the best kind. She advocates letting kids read what they enjoy reading, and letting that lead to reading you find more worthwhile, but wants us to keep in mind that just getting them to READ is the goal. Her kids loved Richie Rich comics (as did I as a kid!) I love her writing style---it's very honest and direct. A great book!"},{"Title":"Keeping Kids Reading: How to Raise Avid Readers in the Video Age","review":"This is Leonhardt's second book, published three years afterParents Who Love Reading, Kids Who Don't: How It Happens and What You Can Do About It(see my review). In it she again shares her experience as a parent and an educator and breaks some new ground from the previous volume. As early as page 19 she flatly states, \\"Children must love reading. This goal is absolute. No one--teachers, parents, librarians, curriculum directors, book reviewers--must do or recommend anything that puts [it] in jeopardy...[A]ll of the skill exercises that children dislike--but are 'good' for them--are not allowed if they cause a child to dislike reading.\\" She later adds that, as a parent, you shouldn't \\"try to force [your child] to read [a specific book] or argue her out of her dislike of [it].\\" From a teacher, this is, of course, a radical stand: doubtless all of us can remember plowing through some such title as \\"A Tale of Two Cities,\\" or picking Shakespeare to pieces, because they were \\"required reading\\" (even some of the librarians I know, who have somehow managed to retain their love of books despite such experiences, recount them with bitterness). Leonhardt explains that in the high-school classes she teaches, any kid can get an A for his weekly reading if he reads 200 or more pages *of a book or books chosen by himself*. She also tells how all the young avid readers she has interviewed either grew up in homes filled with books, or lived within biking (or walking) distance of a library. (Having done both myself, I can testify that they are indispensable--although once a kid is 10 or 12, I would add that bussing distance, or perhaps nearness to the child's school, is also permissible.) And, as if picking up on my previous review, she declares that \\"Turning kids off...by insisting on too much analysis and criticism is winning a battle only to lose the war...[Many kids are] turned off by English teachers who insist that they analyze difficult poems they don't even like...\\" She points out, too, that reading often leads to writing, which, since most teens are reluctant to talk to their parents about their troubles (or just can't find the words to express their feelings), may help your kids to stay out of trouble as they enter \\"the angst-filled teen years. You want them home writing poetry and stories when they're troubled--not looking for the nearest drug dealer.\\" Most important, she describes four basic \\"reading paths\\" and explains how to use them to find books that kids--at any age and reading level--can enjoy, books that will make them want to read not only the current title but more books, and eventually adult-level and even \\"difficult\\" or \\"classic\\" books. While many books about kids' or teens' lit break books into broad categories, such as animal stories, adventure, or nonfiction, this is the first time I've seen anyone try to separate those categories according to the type of kid who may be attracted to them.As might be expected of a teacher, Leonhardt unfortunately shares the unhealthy fixation we have about college in the US; she describes how, on a visit to Ireland, she told young people there that to get a \\"good job\\" here, you have to attend college--which severely disappointed her listeners, who wanted to know about jobs for \\"ordinary lads like us.\\" (It's true, of course, that we're moving rapidly away from an industrial economy, but there are still plenty of useful, good-paying jobs that can be learned through apprenticeship (like welding or construction) or at community colleges (which continue to prosper).) But the chief problem I have with her is that, for the most part, she tends to ignore a great many fine old books--in all possible paths--in favor of books that are current, recent, or in print, even as she praises libraries for offering the books that aren't. She says, for example, that \\"...most multicultural literature pushed in the schools is boring even to the group it showcases.\\" Yet I can remember reading many fascinating books about what was then called \\"children of other lands,\\" books like Robert Davis'sPepperfoot of Thursday market,or Louise Rankin'sDaughter of the Mountains (Newbery Library, Puffin)--many of which are now OP, and which had the great merit of (because of their age) not being \\"dumbed down\\" as so many more recent titles are. One of her recommendations is to \\"keep trying poetry,\\" particularly for elementary-schoolers, yet she doesn't suggest themed poetry anthologies like the many assembled by William Cole or the Brewtons. In describing Path #4, \\"Action/Adventure Reading With Realistic Elements,\\" she laments that readers of this type (almost always boys) find a paucity of books, especially fiction, about sports or military subjects in libraries; for example, she suggests only Matt Christopher, without seeming to realize that he can lead to, say, Lester Chadwick's Baseball Joe series (a Stratemeyer Syndicate offering to be sure, but so are Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys, both of which she praises as the kind of books that can ignite a child's love of reading) or Clair Bee's Chip Hilton or John R. Tunis's long string of sports novels. She also totally ignores the girls (often tomboys, if not necessarily sports freaks) who may be of this type (and having been one, I can say without fear of contradiction that they do exist--and they enjoy \\"boys' books\\" too). And she doesn't even mention such excellent (and prolific) authors for older readers (boys and girls alike) as Stephen W. Meader and G. A. Henty, both of whom are currently being brought back into print by specialty publishers, or Joseph A. Altsheler (all of them adventure tales focusing on \\"realistic,\\" as opposed to magical or relationship-oriented, action). It has long seemed to me that if we want our kids to read \\"good books,\\" we have to make *all* books available to them, and in that Leonhardt and I agree; but so many libraries subscribe to ruthless age-based weeding policies, and so many publishers are so totally focused on the bottom line, that our youngsters grow up completely unaware of the treasure trove of well-written and interesting older titles that we baby-boomers knew and loved. I hope that in a future volume Leonhardt may begin to relate these authors to her \\"fourfold path.\\" The fact that she hasn't in this one is the reason I give it only a four-star rating: she's definitely on the right track as far as she goes, but she hasn't yet gone quite far enough."},{"Title":"Keeping Kids Reading: How to Raise Avid Readers in the Video Age","review":"I first read this book about a decade ago when my oldest children were new readers. My husband and I are lifelong avid readers and it is very important to us to share our love of reading with our children. This book has given me so much help in choosing books for my children by helping me to identify their reading \\"paths\\". For a while, I kept offering the wrong books to the kids, and I was baffled by their disinterest. This book helped me understand their reading \\"paths\\" and made me much more successful at offering books they would like. When I started implementing her advice, their reading took off: in elementary school they were reading about 3 hours a day of books of their own choosing. Now they are older with a much more demanding study schedule, but they still find time to read on their own. Reading is just a natural part of their life. I now have 3 other children as well, and I'm seeing the same kinds of results with them. Even my oldest daughter, who took a while to warm up to reading, is now an avid reader. Believe me, I had my doubts that anything would work with her--she seemed for so long to be so indifferent to reading. And when she did read, it was books which I secretly thought were trashy. But I kept following Leonhardt's advice through the years, and it totally worked. She is positively hooked on reading, and loves even difficult, classical books---as long as they are within her preferred genre. She hasn't yet moved into books outside her interest, but I have faith that it will happen.Over and over, this author repeats the message to trust your children. That can be so hard to do, which is why I needed to reread the book several times when I first encountered it. But it works! I've watched my children move from easy readers to longer books to Oscar Wilde, and I've known that they're doing it in their own time. If I started worrying that they've been reading \\"below their level\\" or conversely that they may be choosing books that are too hard, I remembered the goals of making them love reading, and have a habit of reading, and I realized they were on the right track. I can personally vouch for Leonhardt's assertions that a diet of comic books and what some snobby educators call \\"twaddle\\" does *not* ruin a child for great literature, and conversely feeds the fire for the love of reading.I can't recommend this book enough!"},{"Title":"Keeping Kids Reading: How to Raise Avid Readers in the Video Age","review":"I think every parent should have to read this.

The writing is beautiful, and the content and organization show Taylor's long and deep study of George MacDonald, her profound thinking, and most of all her love of God and all that God has created.Taylor states three questions to whose answers the writings of MacDonald make valuable contributions. One might wish that in the twenty-first century it were not still necessary to face these questions, but our observations of churches, schools, halls of government, and even bumper stickers show that they continue unabatedly to generate debate and, yes, conflict. To each of the three questions the answer is an emphatic \\"No.\\"First, \\"Can God be less loving than Jesus?\\" Despite some teachings that seem to indicate that God the Father has a major concern for his own glorification, Taylor gives MacDonald's convincing reasoning that the loving, suffering, and self-denial of Jesus express the same qualities of the Father. In MacDonald's own words, \\"Whatever is not like Christ is not like God.\\"The second question is \\"Can God be less forgiving than Jesus?\\" One part of this question is whether God would ordain that some of his children would never find him. Two of MacDonald's thoughts that bear on this subject are \\"Human mercy cannot exceed God's, because God's mercy is infinite, no more, no less\\" and \\" God desires neither punishment nor revenge, but the destruction of sin within the sinner.\\"Finally, \\"Must scientific truths and religious truths clash?\\" On this question MacDonald said of God, \\"That he should ever require us to believe of him what we think wrong, I do not believe.\\" He saw God \\"as being under no law, but as law itself, and the cause of the laws we know.\\" Not only does Taylor state many thoughts of George MacDonald, but also she quotes several modern-day scientists who offer light on the question. For example the physicist Stephen Hawking was thinking about the \\"Why\\" questions of religion as well as the \\"How\\" questions of science when he wrote, \\"Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?\\"I treasure Mary Taylor's book and strongly recommend it to others regardless of their religious convictions or their attitutde toward the relationship of science and religion. I think my favorite sentence in the book is from one of MacDonald's sermons: \\"Nothing is inexorable except love.\\""},{"Title":"George MacDonald Exposes False Conflicts: \\"JESUS/GOD, JUSTICE/MERCY, SCIENCE/RELIGION\\"","review":"I have read Mrs. Taylor's book several times and discovered that George MacDonald was a theologian ahead of his time.

I always welcome a new approach to writing, and I especially enjoy erotica. Unfortunately there were a few stories that crossed the line for me. The only thing I could compare it to would be if you were to read a story from the perspective of the police officers that commited the rape of Abner Louima and how much fun they had while engaging in the act. If that sort of thing turns you on, then you should have no problem reading and enjoying the stories in this book.

The stories are a dark feast of deviant fiction encompassing the taboos of necrophilia, rape and bondage, death, lust and fear.

I wonder, is the content memorable or do we make it more memorable because of what we imagine in our mind's-eye?

Cara Bruce is one of a kind - very young she has more talent then most"},{"Title":"Viscera","review":"Not entertaining at all, a collection of 25 of the worst (and fortunately very short) stories I have read. I read many short story collections in the sci-fi/horror genre and this is indeed at the bottom of the pile. There are not even inventive tales of necrophilia in this trashpile such as the editor&#65533;s review hints at; merely deviant tales of gay sex, gay violence, and other deviant sexual practices.I was looking for more&#65533;well&#65533;visceral performances from these unknown authors. Now I know why they are unknown.The writings are amateurish and comical in their attempts to gross out the reader, but fall short because of the desperation that seeps from the pores of the pages. Instead of a titillating blood fest or visceral discomfort, all they produced was sympathy for their pathetic efforts to raise sadistic sex and poop stories to the elevation of true revulsion or horror.There are a few, and only a few, elements of this book that make it even worthy of a one star rating. Cara Bruce&#65533;s introduction to the book itself is the most interesting part of this compilation of nonsense. In it, she describes her feelings of numbness,and an inability to feel even pain, very common in clinical depression. She describes going to extreme lengths in order just to feel anything at all.When she put the book together, she says (quote from Introduction) &#65533;I asked for sick stories. I asked for murder, disgust, and of course sex. I wanted pain, suffering, blood, guts, or just plain weirdness. Instead most of the stories I got made me laugh. They were so ridiculous I couldn&#65533;t help it&#65533;.I thought I had needed to feel more pain to heal, or to feel the pain I thought I deserved. I didn&#65533;t. I needed to laugh.&#65533;This is the most well written and eloquent statement in the entirety of this 188 page mess. Ms. Bruce herself wrote the only story in the book that contained even a hint at oddity with her tale called &#65533;Cheng&#65533;, about a dwarf with two mouths. To give her due credit, she has also done a decent job of editing and putting together her compilation.Honorable mention goes out to Sonia Greenfield for her tale &#65533;A Girl On The Train&#65533;, which brings a small amount of irony into the collection, notably about how deceiving looks can be.And that is it. Those are the only jewels to be found in this unsatisfying conglomeration, if they can even be called jewels. More like lumps of coal.Do yourself a favor and find a better collection if you are looking for horror or erotic horror or even strange horror. If you want a Poppy Brite like journey into violent and graphic gay or deviant sex, then maybe this is for you. It certainly wasn&#65533;t for me.To me it simply tasted bad."},{"Title":"Viscera","review":"My favorite erotica book ever! This is the hottest erotic anthology I've read. BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Viscera","review":"I found this book after reading Cara Bruce's Best Bisexual Women's Erotica book (which I LOVED). This book is so much fun! Way different then any other erotic anthology I've EVER read. This is one of my new Top Ten!!"},{"Title":"Viscera","review":"If you are a fan of erotic horror short stories, such as those in the excellent \\"Hot Blood\\" series, you are in for a severe letdown with this book.Why? I'll let the editor speak for herself, from her own introduction: \\"I asked for sick stories. I asked for murder, disgust and, of course, sex. I wanted pain, suffering, blood, guts, or just plain weirdness. Instead most of the stories I got made me laugh. They were so ridiculous I couldn't help it...\\"So, she rejected them, right??? NO!!! She accepted them, and here they are! Why did she accept these \\"ridiculous\\" stories? \\"I needed to laugh,\\" she tells us.Well, I don't know about you, but when I pick up a book of \\"erotic horror\\" stories, a laugh is about the last thing I'm looking for. I want to be thrilled, scared, stimulated, excited, weirded-out and aroused. I'm looking for imaginative and incisive explorations of the dark side of human sexuality, and thus of human nature itself.A remarkable number of these stories are set in and/or by writers from San Francisco, the editor's home base. Besides that leading to the creeping suspicion that she just asked a bunch of her close friends and associates to knock out some stories for her, rather than seeking out the best writers and stories she could find across the nation, it also leads to something else you might expect: a lot of stories about homosexuality.In this case, all of the homosexual stories are exclusively about lesbians and female bi-sexuals. If you're a male and happen to be turned on by that stuff, let me warn you: these are not written for you. This is erotica about female homosexuality FOR female homosexuals, and the aspects of female-female sex that men find erotic (which are admittedly often romanticized and unrealistic) are not present here.There is a strong current of man-hating sentiment running through this book. I suppose in a way that's fair because some (but not most) of the erotic horror that's out there is misogynistic in nature. (Ever notice that with centuries to develop, the English language has STILL not come up with a corresponding word for misogyny - a term which dates back to the early Greek language - that would mean \\"hatred of men\\"? I wonder why?) So, if you are a woman that hates men, you'll probably find stories like \\"The Decapitation Party\\" a real hoot. In it, a woman spontaneously cuts off her husband's head for no apparent reason, then invites her best friends over to show them his body and have a celebration. They then decide to have sex with the dead body, which obediently and silently performs to satisfy their needs. Admittedly weird, possibly an archetypical female fantasy, and truly unforgettable. But is it a good story? Not really. But I suppose it might give you a vicarious thrill, or a good laugh, if you're a woman who hates her husband.There ARE a couple of good stories here, which are solely responsible for me giving this book two stars instead of one. The best of these is Carol Queen's \\"Knife\\" (and that one's not even original to this anthology). It's a suspenseful, erotic exploration of a woman courting terror to obtain sexual thrills, and pushes the issue of \\"trust\\" to its extremes. Also good is Heather Corinna's \\"Restoration\\", a \\"Twilight Zone\\"-type twister with a uniquely sensual point of view and excellent, stylistic writing.But a couple of winners in a collection of 25 very short stories does not justify the cost of this book.As a male, I may in fact be panning a book that some females may find to be very good. In fact, I note that almost all of the previous positive reviews of this book that appear here seem to have come from females. I in fact purchased this book based on those reviews. Gee, thanks.It's commonly supposed that what females find erotic and what males find erotic are often very different. Stereotypically, for instance, males find explicit sexual descriptions more arousing. Well, some of the stories here are pretty darn explicit. But I find very few of them arousing.So, I don't know - if you're female, you may like this book. If you're lesbian you probably have an even better chance of liking it. Read some other reviews before you decide.I can only offer one male's point of view, and from that point of view this is a limp exercise in self-indulgence from an editor who put together a collection that was ostensibly to be comprised of erotic horror stories, and who then lets you know right from the beginning that she has betrayed you, if those were indeed the kind of stories you were looking for.I'm glad she got her laughs.Me, I'm mad as hell."},{"Title":"Viscera","review":"This is NOT erotica, this book is for sick an demented psychos and not for a normal healthy sexual human being.

IF you can get them to send the right number of the right volumes at the right price, this is an excellent reprint of a harder-than-it-should-be-to-find masterwork.

Did no one in the bindery look at the text they were binding???I realize, of course, that books that were written and printed 100 to 300 years ago are hard to find, but that this was a \\"printed on demand\\" copy was nowhere indicated in the description on Amazon.For other \\"purists\\" this should be an alert to double check everything one gets from formerly \\"reliable\\" sources.

In the book, is told the history of the Fiat 124 Sport Spider (designed by Pininfarina), Sport Coup&eacute; and Rally Abarth (used in the Italian and international rallies), and the Pininfarina Spidereuropa. The text (in Italian) contains a lot of informations about the cars, and it's accompanied by many beautiful photographs; most of them, are in black and white. At the end of the volume, there is a chapter concerning the technical specifications of the car, that is rich in technical details, and contains the characteristics of the carburettors, that are useful for the setting up of them."},{"Title":"Falling for Her","review":"I hope no one takes offence at my honesty - I realise some people might think I'm overly harsh . . . I even debated giving this book 2 stars, but then changed my mind because I felt I had to be completely honest. I did not like this book. I literally had to force myself to finish it just because I hate not finishing a book - no matter how bad it is.It's obvious that a lot of research was put into Fallin for Her, and I commend the author on it, but it simply isn't enough to make it a good read for me.There are several things I did not like about this book.I felt little to no connection between the hero,Varin and the heroine, Roscelyn. Varin seems to be a complete dimwit and the only thing he has going for him is his good looks. Roscelyn is a petulant whiner who really doesn't act much like an 11th century noblewoman. All they do is argue. I have no idea how their relationship blossomed. The only possible reason I could think of would be attraction, and even that is lacking. Indeed, the love scenes leave something to be desired.But then, in my opinion, the entire book leaves many things to be desired: Romance, sexual tension . . . logic. Obviously there can be no romance or sexual tension between two people who have the chemistry of two paperweights, but it really irked me that alot of things in the book just made no sense.For instance, at the beginning of the book, the peasants are mad at the witchwife and want to burn her hut. Roscelyn, in an attemt to stop them, climbs atop the roof only to fall through it. This scene is used to introduce the hero and the heroine as Varin walks in and discovers Ros dangling in this compromising position. This would have been an excellent intro had there been any mention afterward of the peasants hating the witchwife, but instead she is portrayed as a much needed healer whom the peasants do not dislike at all. This is just one of many things about this book that didn't have much purpose. I'd name more but it would take forever and I don't want to give away the book.All in all, Falling For Her could have been an excellent book if only it was written better. It just didn't have any flow. But mostly, there was just too much focus on outside elements, and not nearly enough focus on the characters and their developing relationship. I bought the book expecting a romance and I was sorely disappointed.If I could change it at all, I would take out the endless, boring pages that drone on about wheat and barley and sheep and peasants and replace them with the things I expect to find in a romance novel: Realistic, likable characters; a strong romantic core revolving around the developing relationship between the hero and the herione; well-balanced conflict and sexuall tension; sensuality; easy reading (flow); etc - none of which I found in Falling for Her.I'm not giving Falling for Her a bad review just for the fun of it. I seriously disliked this book, and I'm not alone . . . but there are also many people who think this book is amazing, so don't just take my word for it.I spent $1 on this book and I feel it was $1 too much, but maybe you'll buy it, read it and think it was the best \\"insert price here\\" you ever spent."},{"Title":"Falling for Her","review":"In 1066 Cyning, Saxon Lady Roscelyn cannot believe the disgusting chutzpah of her odious new husband Cerdic. On their wedding night, Cerdic tried to seduce his newlywed's nine-year-old sister. Roscelyn thinks she might just have to murder her spouse. However, before she can put a plan in motion, the Saxon battle cry erupts as Harold calls for an army to repel the invading Normans. Her family dies in the war.To the victors go the spoils so King William gives Cyning to his loyal knight Varin de Brionne. Roscelyn wants to keep her people safe from Varin and his men. However instead of an arrogant barbarian, Varin surprises her by working hard with her people to improve their lot. To her chagrin, Roscelyn begins to fall in love with the nurturing Varin. He returns the feelings, but Cerdic still lives and demands what he believes is rightfully his: Cyning and Roscelyn.Though the star-crossed lovers during William's reign have been told in novels almost as much as Adam and Eve's tale, FALLING FOR HER is an enjoyable medieval romance. The story line is fun because of the dichotomy of feelings that seem genuine. Roscelyn is a brave person wondering how she can fall in love with the hated Norman even though he is quite the charmer who obviously cares for her people's lot. Though Cerdic is so amoral that he is the only person that seems unreal, Sandra Lee, as she did with LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT, provides fans with a fabulous reading experience.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Falling for Her","review":"I'm going to have to go with the majority here.

I love the concept of stillness and energy and synergy.

I am glad that I ordered this book- not only does the author talk about \\"lines of energy\\" in the body when one practices yoga, it describes how to approach your \\"edge\\" in a posture- getting a good idea of how to be hard and soft in a practice, or even examining what feels comfortable or not in a pose as a way to be present. The best part was getting detailed breakdowns of very basic movements and asana, because the simplest aspect can really change the way you practice. This is most important to pay attention to and play with in a yoga practice since nobody is ever going to perfect any one posture, ever. How can you go deeper? How do you breathe? What is your intention? How do you modify? What's your energy level? Where are you \\"at\\", today? These are all questions that can be answered by experimentation and practice, which is exactly what I was looking for-another viewpoint on what is going on inside the body as well as outside, not just a \\"how-to\\" book. I would read this along with TKV Desikachar's \\"Heart of Yoga\\"-more thoughts on the science of mindful movement with breath."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"I'm a currently going through a 200 hr registered yoga teacher training and have been using this book as my go-to guide whenever I thought explanations in the material that we're working with in class weren't sufficient. Very detailed, very thorough and step by step. All the meditative parts in it - the icing on the cake. My favorite yoga manual so far (and by far)!"},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"I love this yoga book.

I lead a yoga class and return to the book often to refresh my knowledge about different poses."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"I bought this book on the advice of my yoga instructor, it is a great book, with poses shown in exacting detail. The first half is about how to get to that \\"yoga place.\\""},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"Whether you are a teacher or student, beginner or advanced, this book has so much to offer. At many levels, Schiffmann beautifully, humbly and skillfully presents the essence of Yoga. From the simplest level of detailed asanas to the most subtle exploration of activated stillness, clarity, reality, and love, this is a comprehensive and thought-provoking book. He is a gifted writer/teacher in that he leads you to think, feel, practice and ultimately discover it (whatever that is for you) on your own while providing support and encouragement.This book is accessible, inspiring and a true joy. It is a core Yoga text that is referenced time and time again and I highly recommend to any serious student or teacher of Yoga."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"This book has a beautiful flow that matches what Yoga is all about. The pictures of poses and the explanations are simple. I only wish the instruction of poses was audible."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"I as always got great service from amazon!Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into StillnessThis book is great for taking yoga out of the gym & into something meaningful & not just another sweaty activity."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"My yoga instructor often referred to this book and I thought I would buy it. I'm glad I did! Erich Schiffman goes into great detail about the breath, meditation and especially the benefits of each asana. He explains in detail how to do the different poses and even has a sample home practice for an overall workout. I recommend this book for anyone, whether new to yoga or a seasoned practioner."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"I teach a yoga-based class and was looking for a yoga book with good descriptions of the purpose and procedure of the poses. I've looked through many (many!) books that lay out the basic alignment of common poses, but was looking for one that went a bit further. This is it. Knowing that most people cannot immediately and comfortably sit right down and do lotus pose, the author gives preparatory poses to get you there. Even then, he admits that it took him several years to get into the pose comfortably. It's that sense of humility, empathy and lack of pretention that runs throughout the book.His step-by-step instruction is very clear. Rather than just giving the \\"do this, move that\\" kind of instruction, he's more of a coach through the pose. Knowing that many people will be discouraged when they don't look like a yoga model in their own pose, he always encourages you to be comfortable where you are now. Addtionally, his writings on meditation and relaxation practices were not only right on target, but just beautiful to read.I learned a lot from this book that made me a better teacher and enriched my own experience. I'd highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"I discovered Erich Schiffman's wonderful book about 9 years ago, soon after I started practicing Yoga, and I haven't missed a day of practice in all those years. This book was probably the most single significant tool that helped me to develop a safe and sound practice. In fact I love it so much that I bought my Yoga teacher a copy as a \\"studio warming\\" gift when she first opened her studio. I wanted her to have a copy for the studio's collection of books so that other students could have access to it.First there is a wonderful introduction which introduces you to Erich's background, one of the premier teachers not only in the U.S. but perhaps the world. It's very interesting to see how he came to become a Yoga teacher and the things that influenced his unique approach to Yoga.This is not just a book about the poses but an approach to Yoga that takes you to the core and depths of the practice. For me, the first section of the book gives you tools that you can take into practicing any style of Yoga. You learn about breathing, how to sensitively play your edges and find lines of energy in your poses and much much more.The section on Asana (the poses) gives in depth instruction which are much more than just \\"bend your leg this way, raise your arm that way\\". There is tremendous detail which will help you deepen your experience of the poses and create an awareness that starts with your body and eventually move into your whole life.I have several shelves of Yoga books and if I had to choose one out of all of them there is no doubt that this would be the one I would choose above all others.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"&quot;The Spirit and Practice of Moving Into Stillness&quot; very much sums up the spirit of this book on yoga. Being still in meditation is the goal of the author and he uses the poses to move toward that place. The tone is nurturing and clear, and gives the reader a sense of accessibility to the material, as opposed to unattainability. There are many photographs and the approach is different than what is found in other books. I read the book regularly and use it in my own teaching"},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"This book is required in the yoga teacher training that I am taking but could be assimilated and enjoyed by a person who has never done yoga. Eric talks about mindful living and using energy to improve your life which is fascinating. His prose is fluid and very calming. He also tells an interesting life story in the beginning. I also like his organic style of yoga whereby the emphasis is on the process and not the perfect pose."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"A perfect title. Love it. Om Shanti. Anyway, I thought I had enough books on poses but this book surprised me on how lacking my other material was. He is very detailed yet easy to understand and like someone else said this is organic yoga from the inside out. This has changed and enlivened my practice and really helped me to understand how a pose should feel to me. He points out this is your practice which hit home with me that instead of just following a routine of sorts I needed to really feel it and make it me. The breathing, alignment, lines of energy and moving meditation are brought to life. Obviously, I am very happy I bought this book."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"After almost 25 years of practice, this book not only provided new insights but also validated my own experiences. I recommend it so highly I gave away my first copy. Ideal for both beginners and advanced practictioners, it expresses the inner spirit of yoga without the mystical fog that surrounds many advanced books."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"This book conveys a rich, personal, and utterly human approach to hatha. Erich manages to combine a deep passion for hatha yoga with a compelling and authentic personal statement of its role in his life. What is so inspiring about the book is that it combines the precision and beauty of Iyengar yoga with the intensely personal vision of a fellow American. Erich views yoga as a wide highway on which all can travel at their own speed. I would not be without this beautiful and inspiring book."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"After dipping into and out of various yoga and meditation texts -- and their accompanying philosophical bases -- I can say this book is the best I have ever found. I use it daily, it encourages both thoughtful contemplation and regular mindful practice without a lot of gobblydygook. Schiffmann's style is both easy and surprisingly far-reaching. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to center themselves and learn to sit still."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"Most yoga books focus on how to do the postures from the outside in---the external approach. Erich Schiffmann's book shows us how to do yoga from the inside out---the internal approach.

Not only is he a most accomplished practitioner but an eloquent writer.

Even if meditation or yoga isn't 'your thing', the book will invite you to think about your Self in a more expansive way. Nothing to fear here, just like a cool guy talking to you... perfect for the cynic or dweeb in your life who snubs all things 'crunchy', or alternative.

You will learn plenty and grow with this book and find your bliss."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"I have practiced and taught yoga for about 5 years now.

Schiffmann nurtures us along beautifully, spiritually, and tenderly. Get this if you are serious about your yoga!"},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"Erich, if you have ever experienced his teaching in person, is an interesting teacher. He has a very exploratory nature when it comes to yoga and frequently practices at home and makes up new postures as he goes.

The visuals I received from his descriptions of the poses and what you want to have happen in your body were wonderful, opening up new avenues in my yoga.

It always seemed to be a struggle against my mind and body. Somehow i just didn't get the deeper meaning and it remained a form of physical exercise. Fortunately i began to develop some intuitive understanding and awareness in my practice. That's when I came across Schiffmann. His book expressed beautifully what I was beginning to realize. Every asana I have tried using Schiffmann's approach has been a joy to practice. Buy this book. Use it. It will change your life."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"I love the yoga sequences and descriptions of asanas in this book. In order to really use it, I had to go through and highlight the important elements of each asana, since his descripition last for pages and is quite detailed, and you just can't hold it long enough to read everything! I also love the guiding priciples he offers, like lines of energy. However, the beginning portion of the book, before the descriptions of the asanas, is a little difficult to read. He is very wordy, I read sections to my family and friends that actually made them laugh as he goes on and on about something, making a good point but making is about 7 times before he moves on. Better too much explanation than too little, I guess, but please be sure to get past that part to to the asanas, don't get discouraged! Erich Schiffmann is a wonderful teacher and a very wise man, his message has changed and reinvigorated my practice."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"The majority of the information in this book is extremely valuable to the practitioner. The explanations of the asanas are very accurate and give all the detail necessary to effectively begin to practice any given pose. Also, the more difficult poses include preliminary exercises that are geared towards the beginner or those otherwise physically unable to immediately perform the asana; I have personally found this aspect of the book to be exceedingly useful.In addition, I was surprised to discover that this book included a very useful section on meditation. Although many of the ideas presented are exceedingly simple, I found them nonetheless highly effective.The tricky part of the book is the verbose method used to describe every detail of each asana. An entire paragraph is often devoted to each individual movement. This is at first overwhelming to the point that the asana appears to be much more difficult than it really is. In most cases I have ended up reading the explanation, then typing up a condensed version of the asana that can actually be used while first learning the pose. After some practice with the asana, the book can then be referred to again to pick up on the details and further perfect the pose.Finally, there is one aspect of the book that I found a bit monotonous. When he attempts to describe the more spiritual aspects of yoga he has trouble expressing himself. He will go on for pages trying to get across a single point that never really seems to be clearly expressed. He says it best when he mentions that these things cannot be understood until experienced directly. Nonetheless he tries (and tries, and tries) to explain these experiences, but is ultimately unsuccessful.Overall, though, this book is not to be missed by beginning or intermediate students. I have found it to be comprehensive and effective while managing to remain highly accessible. It is rare to find all of these qualities in one book."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"Erich Schiffmann was my very favorite Yoga teacher when I lived in LA. Now I live outside of Paris and miss his yoga classes very much. His style was so in the moment, so well thought out, so complete. His love of Yoga is so much a part of his life and how he teaches. Though I knew his style and teaching, I found this book so easy to understand and interesting. I love how he explains his own journey into yoga and how it has become so much a part of his life.

Many fine yogis write books on how to get into a pose and what to get out of it. If you tried to explain it yourself you would quickly realize how difficult it is! Every body is different, each person comes to yoga with unique strengths, weaknesses, injuries, and mental \\"stuff\\" so how do you teach them a pose? And what is it supposed to look like? Few of us can hope to end up on the cover of Yoga Journal. Just about anyone though, can benefit from a thoughtful yoga practice.Teacher or self-teacher you'll find the \\"steps\\" or modifications offered for poses useful. Even if you have no problem with a simple forward fold, do yourself a favor and start with the \\"step one\\" version. By the time you ease into the full forward fold you'll be in the pose like you never experienced it before! I love that.One reviewer took issue with the cover photo. The person inside the book is a pony tailed man, the reviewer complained, not the attractive looking woman. Well that's just silly isn't it? I think the guy in the book is the author! But even if he isn't, the man in the photos is executing the asana in such a clear manner it's like awesome.This book's great strength is that it will show you how to be your own teacher."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"Everyone should read this book and begin reading the Introduction.

He masterfully describes how to enter poses and keep your self aligned properly. Also the benefits of each pose are listed so you can determine what poses to use for certain issues. My favorite part of the book are chapters 7 and 8. In chapter 7 he describes in my opinion the \\"real essence\\" of yoga by elaborating on how you get the energy to flow in the poses. This is the real aim in that you are trying to get a release. If you follow his lead here you will discover it for yourself. He follows in chapter 8 with the concepts of the edge and how to protect yourself once you have established the pose.I highly recommend this book for any yoga teacher or student.This is a classic text!"},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"Outstanding text, very clear.

That voice is Erich Schiffmann's from Ali Macgraw's video Yoga Mind & Body. The original tape has been replaced by a DVD and there have been times over the years I've tried to ignore Erich, but still, he resides in head. \\"Keep it Simple.\\"The message is his book is clear: find stillness and listen. Ask what do you need. Trust that voice that you hear. Keep it simple.What made me jump for joy in Yoga: the Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness is that as soon as I opened this book, Erich Schiffmann discusses meditation. Not just half way through the book, not just at the end, not as just a component of the Eight Limbs of Yoga - right from the beginning and all throughout the book. Yes, most modern yoga books mention meditation in a part of the book but they don't weave into the context of the whole. (Can you tell I'm into meditation?)In the asana section, Erich offers the postures he values as foundational to all practitioners. He has broken them down into steps so we can get into our \\"feeling tone\\" and understand the poses in our bodies. He does this so we can develop our intuition in our practice, to find freedom.He uses language like \\"snuggle your feet into the floor\\", \\"stretch up from your core\\", \\"plug your sit bones into the Earth\\", \\"be as relaxed as you can be\\", and \\"hips are in dog tilt (or cat tilt)\\". Understandable directions that don't require an anatomy book. This book is about feeling your way into your body and listening to what it tells you back.By listening and feeling you come into stillness, and it that stillness you can hear God, which in the end is you. Erich is not afraid to talk about God, another thing that I appreciate very much. He is clear about Divinity being in each and everyone of us, and he wants as all to find that.I'm not sure why that in my seventeen years of practice that I haven't read this book before. Perhaps its because Erich voice was already in my head and I didn't want to change that. Or that I was afraid the man behind the voice wouldn't be the same as in the book and I'd be let down. However, I was not disappointed one tiny bit and his voice is still in my head, maybe stronger.Thank you Erich Schiffmann for this beautiful book."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"One of the best books on hatha yoga ever. There's nothing difficult to understand or apply. But the material will probably change the way you practice. It certainly did for me. I've been practicing yoga, on and off, for about ten years. I've taken classes with terrific teachers and even an agonizing series of 6 a.m. seminars with K. Pattabhi Jois. Yoga never got beyond the physical for me until I read Schiffman's book. Sometimes I wondered what the real difference was between a good hatha yogi and a contortionist. That question has been answered. Schiffman teaches the internals of yoga. His focus is on mobilizing the body's intrinsic energy--qi or prana--in each posture. The postures act as energy templates, he explains, but it's necessary to understand the lines of flow and circulation. He makes this very easy to understand and apply. And when you do, the external technique improves and you become precise without thinking about every distracting detail. Also, Schiffman's approach is beautiful. He teaches you to sense your limits and learn when you want to stay well within them, and when you want to push them. This is a method of gentle, &quot;occasional healthy pain, tremendous gain.&quot; Schiffman is schooled in the Iyengar and Desikachar approaches. Precision is important to him. But he's taken it a quantum step farther. With Iyengar's Light on Yoga and Donna Farhi's Yoga Mind, Body &amp; Spirit, Schiffman's book completes a trinity of the three most impressive, helpful books on hatha yoga I've seen, regardless of which style you practice or your level of skill."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"This book is excellent for a number of reasons. The detailed descriptions of how to do the postures are wonderful. There are excellent hints for progressing through difficult postures, including some really helpful exercises for helping you get your hip joints in shape to do the lotus pose. Erich really understands how the different poses affect the physical body and the energy field, and imparts this knowledge clearly and eloquently.There is a whole section on breathing with the postures which I've not seen done so well in any other book. Also, he explains his concept of \\"lines of energy\\" which really bring the postures alive. A line of energy is a directional path of force that moves through your body during a pose. For instance, when you are doing the Mountain (basic standing) pose, you allow two lines of energy to develop: one which starts at the navel and runs down through your legs and feet, anchoring you down into the earth; the other lifting you from the navel upwards through the crown of your head. Understanding these lines helps the practitioner to experience each pose as a way of reorienting one's energy, rather than just a set of muscle stretches.Perhaps Erich's greatest contribution to the yoga literature is his way of explaining how asana practice goes with meditation practice. Before, I was never sure how asanas fit in with the rest of yoga practice. Now I understand a lot better. I found Erich's spiritual writings very unpretentious and inspiring. The meditation exercises are wonderful both for beginners as well as people who've been meditating for a while.This is a wonderful book from a teacher who knows his subject well and who seems to have a truly open heart. I would love to take a class from him someday."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"If you buy only one yoga book, this is the one. By a mile. Practically glutted with commonsense advice, especially from the mental point of view, here at last is a book that can take you a long long way in the privacy of your own home. Particularly useful is the exquisitely detailed information on the poses. Information that may at first seem like overkill, but isn't. Instead what you have is a comprehensive system for progressing slowly, naturally, and correctly. I love the author's comments on &quot;feeling your edges&quot; and &quot;lines of energy&quot; which really open your eyes right up. Superb photos. And an outstanding description of ujjayi breathing -- a difficult concept to describe but done beautifully here. A brilliant book which took 10 years to write. Good things obviously take time. My only advice is when it comes to meditation, take a look at Lorin Roche's, &quot;Meditation Made Easy.&quot; Or Roche and Maurine's, &quot;Meditation Secrets for Women.&quot; With these three books in your possession, you'll be cooking."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"I have many books on yoga, including Iyengar's &quot;Light on Yoga&quot;. While I enjoy my other books, I have to say this one is my favorite. It explains the asanas (poses) in easy-to-understand language, yet it is very precise and true to the essence of yoga. I also like how the poses are referred to in their traditional names as well as their western names (such as downward dog, tree, etc.). It makes it easier to look up poses in the back, and integrate it with what you learn in class. The back of the book also has sample routines for beginner to advanced students. An all around great book!!!"},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"The spirit and practice of Erich Schiffmann is well transmitted in this distillation of Erich's classes turned into a book. His engaging personal style and deeply-held convictions about using yoga as a primary channel for self-knowledge and enlightenment make his book a great introduction to starting or expanding your yoga practice.This book opens a lot of doors. Erich's unique personal history with Krishnamurti and B.K.S. Iyengar contribute well to the common sense and precision of his theme of &quot;Moving Into Stillness&quot; and as a 6'4&quot;, 200+ lbs. XXL-sized teacher, Erich shows that yoga is not the exclusive province of the small and lithe.If your just looking for a book or video to show you the basic postures, there are plenty of sources that can fill the bill. If, however, you are looking for the why and how of yoga as deep resource for transformation, Erich's user-friendly guide is an invaluable vade-mecum to the journey.To get a taste of Erich's &quot;voice&quot;, start with Chapter 11,&quot;Listening for Guidance- The Aerial Perspective&quot;pp.329-331.Let Erich help you join your mind to the Infinite Mind, which, after all, is the true goal of yoga."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"This is by far the most practical,lucid and inspiring book on yoga I have ever read.I am a yoga teacher and have been practicing for over twenty years.It is the only book I know of that teaches how to develope a truely personal practice,based on the experience of truth.Through the cultivation of inner awareness,gentleness and compassion the author guides us to connect with,honor and express the truth of our divine nature .This is the heart of yoga. I recommend that if anyone reads this book and doesn't connect with it immediately,keep reading until you do!It's well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"Nothing can replace a good teacher. But for those who are looking to practice yoga on their own this is the only book I can recommend. Many famous books like \\"Light on Yoga\\" by B.K.S.Iyengar fail here, they include many poses but few details so practicing them can increase the danger of injury and enforce wrong techniques. Here you will find only 49 most important poses with every detail for safe practice. After two years of suing Iyengar books I returned to learn basics with this author, just few months with it gave me much more than two previous years."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"Buy this, and immediately take it to your nearest copy shop; have them remove its spine and give it a spiral binding so that it will lie flat. That way, you can lay it flat on the floor, where it can more handily serve as your guide while you study and practice a pose. It is the ideal first yoga text, but it is constructed to remain of use, no matter how advanced your yoga study gets. An ideal accompaniment for work with a teacher or a video, it is clearly written, helpfully illustrated by instructive photographs, and well organized for easy referencing. It includes a comprehensive collection of poses, and the poses are broken down into different levels of skill development, so that no matter how flexible or inflexible your body is, no matter how elementary or advanced your yoga learning, you can find the right pose and the right version of it for you. Even though it is a superb guide for anyone starting to develop or even just continuing a home practice in yoga, it also opens with an inspiring autiobiographical introduction and includes instruction in meditation, as well as explanations of yoga philosophy, giving some sense of how yoga can transform one's entire approach to living--without becoming evangelical about it. Schiffman has studied with a remarkable variety of yoga masters, so his text will suit students from a variety of yoga teaching traditions--Krishnamurti, Desikachar, Iyengar, Scaravelli, and so on--but not Ashtanga. There are many good yoga texts out there, but if you had to whittle your yoga library down to only one text, this one would be my choice."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"I bought this book after reading a recommendation off a listmania list. Wish I had this earlier.The book is fascinating; without going into the terminology of Yoga, the author tells you what Yoga is all about; how it affects the mind; why should one do postures; how he came to choose Yoga and stick with it. I had hitherto read a lot of hard-core philosophy of Yoga - the sutras, the translations, etc, but reading Erich's book gives you a simpler translation of the both process and the outcome.A student of Jiddu Krishnamurthy, the author easily and fluently speaks Yoga; the Who am I excercise in helping one to know oneself is a simple and profound way of getting deeper into our consciousness. If you ever thought why you should do Yoga at all, read the chapter on &quot;Why Yoga?&quot; and ye shall be convinced.The coverage on postures, while detailed and broken into numerous steps, are a bit long-ish for a quick read; but that is what Yoga is about - no quick lunch anytime.Another highlight of the book is the various sets of routines one can follow for all levels of students."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"This book is a must for all but the most advanced practitioner. Mr. Schiffman's perspective is unique. Most books don't give anywhere near enough detail. On first look, it would seem that Mr. Schiffman gives way too much detail; after reading, and trying, his instructions, I've seen that there's no such thing as too much detail. Postures I'd given up because they didn't do anything for me now feel really good. If you're serious about your practice, you want this book."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"I actually haven't read this book, but have been taking yoga classes from the man himself here in Santa Monica, and just realized this book exists.. All I want to add is that Erich is the most radiant happy being I think I've ever met. Such a beautiful soul, with such a gentle and beautiful practice. Erich is most definitely the real deal!

But the nice lady on the cover is not an indication of its content. The entire book is just one man with a pony tail doing all the poses and he made me inexplicably uncomfortable. Also the discussions on each pose really wasn't what I was looking for. I returned this book for \\"Hatha Yoga Illustrated\\" by Kirk, which I enjoy MUCH more."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"The first few chapters seemed like the usual mumbo jumbo. He went to India and saw a guru and learned some important &quot;values&quot;. The second section where he describes about breathing and asanas is the most useful along with his description of how to do the poses. I think he is also over-elaborate in doing the poses."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"I am disappointed in this book. I was expecting a book which takes you right into practicing Yoga but the first Chapter is all about the author's youthful years in England and India. Then the next Chapters are on meditation. I got bored and put it down and haven't picked up it since."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"Renowned yoga master Erich Schiffmann offers an easy-to-follow technique. Through simple instruction and essential illustrations, this book reveals more than one hundred poses and yoga routines for all levels of ability that will slow or even reverse aging, increase stamina and strength, and slim and tone the body; a complete program of meditation to promote self-realization, decrease stress, and promote creativity. Discover how to feel balanced, centered, and coordinated, increase flexibility, eliminate pain, and become free of life's negativity through the spirit and practice of Yoga. In my opinion, there are a lot of better yoga books out there and this one is a bit advanced, especially if you're a beginner. This isn't one I'd recommed to anyone.. there's too much theory and not enough yoga."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"this is the third copy i have bought to give to a friend.i am a yoga and meditation teacher. i also suggest erichs book to my students. i really think you can put all other yoga books aside and i really like many of them, but the way erich writes you can feel the poses.the last chapter on meditation is the very best.read every word and go out into the world and do every word.this is the only meditation book you will need. you can relate so simply to his real approach. i think he should publish the meditation chapter on its own."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"The book opens with an inspiring yoga bio, then divides into four sections: 1) Mr. Schiffmann's yogic philosophy or approach, 2) an overview of how to approach asanas, breathing and energy, 3) asana instructions divided by type (standing postures, forward bends, backward bends, etc), and 4) meditation. This struck me as a totally reasonable way of going about things and is sufficient to whet any would-be yogi's appetites.Regarding the first part, occupying pages 3-40: Schiffmann is definitely a New Agey, pseudo-theistic \\"all is one, one is all\\" kind of guy, and if that is your leaning, you are likely to enjoy and get benefit from this section. For better or worse, I am not that sort, and so I found myself skipping and rarely (actually, never) employing my ever handy hi-liter. So while I enjoyed the bio, part one was pretty much a wash for me, though like I said, I think this is on account of my temperamental and intellectual bent than on account of any lack of insight on the author's part.In part two I started perking up. My hi-liter got some action and I felt I was learning things that I could really use. One thing Schiffmann did well was his discussion of ujjayi breathing while doing the asanas. Part three is a quite detailed review of various yoga postures--a little too detailed for my taste, actually. This may be on account of my having done many--if not most--of these postures at some time or another, so again, I think it depends on where you are in your yoga training. Newbies will especially benefit from this section.I admit I skimmed part four. The New Agey-\\"God and the Self\\" talk returned, and the instructions are rather basic. This is not to say they are no good, though. It's just not the way I prefer to go about my meditation. Schiffmann discusses \\"centering,\\" and \\"communing inwardly.\\" He emphasizes \\"listening for guidance,\\" the development of intuition and devotional surrender. All of these are perfectly fine practices and can lead down wonderful roads of self-discovery, but they are definitely not for everyone (such as yours truly). That being the case, I'm not even sure I am the right person to make a judgement here. My advice would be that if you do feel this approach fits/benefits you, then go for it. Make the most of it and I am sure you will be rewarded.All in all, it is a good book and I am happy I bought and read it. The most important thing I learned was very valuable: For right now, Iyengar's \\"bible of yoga\\" is all I need."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"This book is definitely for advanced students. My daughter loves it because she is 18 and can more easily twist herself into a pretzel than I could ever dream of. Eric is amazing and if nothing else, I look at this book periodically for the WOW factor and keep dreaming that some day I'll be able to do these postures."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"I have many books on Yoga and this book I am having a hard time putting down. Everything he says is so easy to understand and you are able to relate to each page. I decided to write this before I am even through with this book since I am so enspired by it! I can't say enough about this book!! Thanks so much for letting me see the true beauty of Yoga."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"Some of the criticisms of the book I can understand, because it depends on what you are looking for.Very detailed guidance on completing poses with a focus on good \\"form\\" in the pose and stimulating the energy of a pose. Yes.Guidance on how to move towards more difficult poses from somewhat easier. Yes.Guidance on working to your own level and easing into poses. Yes.Somewhat pedantic and detailed with his instruction for some tastes, with a degree of repetition in the writing style. Yes.Too demanding of good form for those prefering an easier yoga. Yes.Schiffmann has a spiritual view based on God being in all things and Gods voice for you being accessible through listening to the inner voice in meditation and the inner voice during your daily (non-yoga i.e. normal life) routine. Some will find this too new age-y and others will find it a helpful and a positive perspective and experience. But in his detailed description of the asanas and in finding the \\"edge\\" and use of breath, awareness in a pose and relaxation I would say the more new age-y elements are not a significant intrusion for those that might be disinclined to that thinking.As a yoga teacher for 50 plus year old students I have found lots of good detail that brought new perspectives to many poses plus some new poses that I have found helpful to introduce immediately. I don't expect my class to be doing all the poses in this book anytime soon, nor necessarily at all, but I have already introduced more than I would have otherwise and the book has certainly enriched our classes. It has been very helpful in keeping our sessions stimulating and gently progressive. Younger, more supple and athletic beginner yogis may well find the challenge and progression Schiffmann offers ideal.I'd highly recommend to anyone interested in a detailed guide to yoga practice. Not really a beginners guide, though it could be used as that, because Shiffmann provides a series of yoga routines from beginner through to advanced levels at the back of the book, eventually drawing on all 45 poses the book covers as you progress. If you want a fast starting quick and decent intro to easier poses, and a more superficial guide, then this isn't the book; but if you are looking for a deep appreciation of yoga and wanting a book that will progress you from and well beyond a gymnastic or beginner approach then this is a great addition to any yoga library."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"This is an excellent how-to for just about anyone interested in learning about hatha yoga as experience, both as pose and meditation. Even if you've been practicing for many years (as indeed I had been when I purchased this book), you will learn a lot.Schiffmann does not rush into a discussion on asanas as most books on yoga do. Instead, he spends the first eighty or so pages talking about the intangibles needed for each pose, including the right mindset, breathing techniques, body awareness of tension (or prana) in each pose, and the intuition to work with those tensions to become more comfortable with and aware of oneself in a pose.Only then does he discuss the experience and benefits of many basic poses, including standing poses, sun salutations, backbends, forward bends, inversions, twists, and shoulder and hip openers. He talks about how to move into each pose, introduces preparatory stretches to each pose, and details how to deepen a pose into another stage once the body has become more experienced and flexible with time. Each pose and its different stages are depicted with photos and just enough biology in Schiffmann's accessible prose to ensure that the reader knows what body part should be where. His very useful concluding chapters on meditation are more or less non-denominational and in any event genuine, and so likely to speak to everyone, spiritual agenda or no.He emphasizes self-acceptance as a road to self-discovery (rather than self-discovery as a road to self-transformation) by encouraging the reader to let themselves experience exactly where they are in a pose on any given day. The clear overtone is that accepting how we experience a pose right here, right now, opens the door to understanding, accepting, and even savoring who we are.Definitely make room for this book in your budget."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"This is a short review, much in line with others here. This book explains and insists that yoga is not something you do to get fit or lose weight. It is yoga from the inside out, it is not about moving into an asana as a milestone and then moving into the next milestone. Please read it, but be aware that it will take you out of your yoga classes and put you into a room alone with your mat and props."},{"Title":"Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness","review":"He seems like a real person, writing what he experiencedin yoga; lots of practical advise and stretches for thosetoo stiff to do classical yoga poses.

She was married at the age of 18 to a man in his late fifties, because her family was practically bankrupt and they needed the marriage settlement to save them. At the time, she'd been in love with her childhood friend, Tom Russell, and both of them had been devastated that Felicity had to marry someone else.However, time passes and heals many wounds, and now that Felicity is free again at the age of 26 she's matured and she feels that Tom would have been the wrong man for her. He's a country farmer, after all, and she likes Society life. She wants a man who is not only charming, handsome and close to her own age - all of which Tom is - but who is also wealthy, titled and who enjoys Society life.In London, she meets Lord Edmond Waite, a handsome sophisticate who is obviously attracted to her; unfortunately, she discovers very quickly that he wants her as his mistress, which is something she's definitely not interested in. So how to make him come around to the idea of marriage?Simple - make him jealous.And how better to do that than to enlist the help of her oldest friend, who most conveniently has followed her to London and is squiring her and her younger twin sisters about?So Tom agrees to pretend to be a devoted suitor, and of course they have to be very convincing in order to make Lord Edmond believe that he really has competition. The only problem for Felicity is: is she risking awakening old feelings by getting so close to Tom again? Is she absolutely sure that what she once felt for him is dead?This is another Balogh classic, which I was delighted to find. As usual, she creates some very believable and entertaining characters - in particular, I loved the secondary characters of twins Lucy and Laura, and their suitors. And as usual, Balogh doesn't write a one-dimensional villain; I'm looking forward to seeing his story in the third book of the trilogy to which this belongs!Admittedly, at first I thought that Felicity was rather shallow, with her desire for a life of froth and pleasure and her wish to marry a titled, wealthy man (who cares about love?). But then I realised that her nature at that point - or at least what she believes to be her preferences - were very much influenced by her sudden freedom from a marriage to a man much older than she was. It's a classic case of someone thinking that they know what they want, only to discover, when they have it, that it wasn't what they wanted after all.If I had one criticism of The Trysting Place, it's that Tom is just a little bit too perfect. He agrees to everything Felicity asks of him, including pretending to be engaged to her; he's always there when she needs him; and, even though he's deeply in love with her and the thought of seeing her married to another man almost kills him inside, he's still unselfish enough to help her get what she thinks she wants. Once or twice I wanted to scream at him to develop some backbone... but then he is a pretty unselfish character.As this is an early Balogh, there's a minor niggle in the shape of titles used incorrectly: for instance, Lord Waite is not the same title (and therefore person) as Lord Edmond Waite, and likewise Lady Dorothea Page may not also be addressed as Lady Page. However, Balogh doesn't make these errors in later books.All in all, definitely a keeper and one of my favourites of the early Baloghs.wmr-uk"},{"Title":"The Trysting Place","review":"The amazing thing about being an author is \\"your characters\\" can become anything you want.

Breaking free from her widow's grieving period, Felicity's campaign is to find a young, titled, FUN husband. She will flourish and the rest of the world can rot.

Good old Tom takes it like a faithful hound waiting patiently for Felicity's adoration.

These young women come to London to take advantage of the \\"season\\" and score they do! Merrily, both receive advantageous marriage proposals. This writing ploy is a good strategy by the author. It eases the tension and allows her reader to continue with the book.Mary Balogh is very good at her craft, but this storyline is uncomfortable. Although, in the end everyone lives happily ever after, it was a brutal journey to get there.And there are some critical flaws:Page 134. A viscount's wife is a viscountess -- not a countess.Page 9. Exactly why was Felicity called Lady \\"Felicity\\" Wren? It was not a birthright. Her father was only a country gentleman.Page 11. Felicity referred to her late husband as Sir Wilfred Wren, so she is simply Lady Wren.Ok, they may be pointless errors, but as I read, they drove me crazy.This is one of the many Signet Regency Romance books written during the late eighties and nineties.

Once or twice I wanted to scream at him to develop some backbone... but then he is a pretty unselfish character.As this is an early Balogh, there's a minor niggle in the shape of titles used incorrectly: for instance, Lord Waite is not the same title (and therefore person) as Lord Edmond Waite, and likewise Lady Dorothea Page may not also be addressed as Lady Page. However, Balogh doesn't make these errors in later books.All in all, definitely a keeper and one of my favourites of the early Baloghs."},{"Title":"Sculpture by Picasso,: With a catalogue of the works","review":"\\"Like New\\" has a new meaning, the cover has transparent plastic stock to it all over and the side has coffee (or something) sucked up in to the paper."},{"Title":"Passion for Manufacturing","review":"Dauch's achievements as a leader are phenomenal: youngest plant manager in the history of General Motors, leader of VW of America from concept to better cars then the Germans themselves were making in less than five years, and a key part of the Chrysler rescue.

Two companies- Brazil Techimotores-Electronics and Oyama Construction have bidded for the cable, and Oyama has won. Transporting the cable from Falling Angel to LEO via the Space Shuttle Anansi/Ion Drive Tug Gabriel, the six-day voyage gives BTE enough time to join forces with a group of Iranian terrorists. Stealing and launching a Soviet Prometheus ground-to-orbit missile, they destroy the Gabriel and cripple the Anansi and cable re-entry pod, also killing an Anansi crewmember. With the Anansi stranded in orbit, with no way to re-enter and no way to get back to Falling Angel, BTE launches two Space Shuttles.

Shults argues forcefully for a public, interdisciplinary theology and in so doing links together the different domains of theological and philosophical reflection by moving on the cutting edge of contemporary theories of rationality.Shults accomplishes this major task by taking on the theology of prominent German theologian Wolfhart Pannenberg as a case study for dialogue with a very diverse and pluralist contemporary North American theology. In this dynamic process he creatively revisions the theology of Pannenberg and places it in a challenging postfoundationalist dialogue with theology in this country. Shults delivers a major contribution to postfoundationalist thought by carefully developing the idea that all theological thought is deeply embedded in tradition and interpreted experience, while at the same time reaching out to contemporary culture in interdisciplinary and transcultural conversation. In doing this Shults takes very seriously the challenge of constructive postmodernism as well as theology's enduring obligation to public withness, argument, and testimony.This book is a must-read for all philosophical and systematic theologians: not only is the theology of Pannenberg revisioned to become a true dialogue partner for North American theologians, but the vitality of a postfoundationalist rethinking of the task of theology points to new and exciting developments for theology in this country. Very strongly recommended."},{"Title":"The Postfoundationalist Task of Theology","review":"F. LeRon Shults is becoming increasingly well known for his efforts in inter-disciplinary dialogue between the contemporary sciences (e.g. anthropology, psychology, biology) and theological and philosophical themes that pervade Christian self-understanding. These themes are evident in his quickly increasing number of publications, including \\"Reforming the Doctrine of God,\\"; \\"Reforming theological anthropology\\"; \\"The Faces of Forgiveness\\" co-written with psychologist Steven Sandage, amongst a host of others. This is the book that started it all.Whether or not one wants to start writing things like \\"the demise of foundationalism\\", or the \\"hope of contextualism,\\" one cannot deny that the modern (meaning, I suppose, post-modern) thought is saturated with epistemological conflict. Indeed in some instances, a la Jacque Derrida, there has been something of an anti-epistemology, a deconstruction that denies solid starting points (in this case, a denial of the referential abilities of language to point to a supposedly exterior world) on which to create explanation. Also in the philosophical hermeneutics of Richard Rorty's pragmatism, which says all readings are a function of social convention, or similarly later Wittgenstein (and in a theological inference, George Lindbeck's semi-adoption of Wittgensteinian rule-theory) which understands language not as a vehicle for \\"factual\\" or \\"world-fitting\\" description, but as artifices of habitual and communal use, there is a decided suspicion of the modern concept of \\"truth\\" as \\"world-fit\\" or \\"correspondance.\\" In most instances this is because the so called \\"correspondance\\" theory of truth generally presupposes in its epistemology a \\"foundationalist\\" method, whereby all truths and all methods are derived from a single, non-debatable element. It is no secret that Descartes instances an example of this, attempting to doubt all things until he reached the point of his own self existence, which he could not doubt, because to doubt he must exist (hence \\"cogito ergo sum\\"-- I think, therefore I am). All other conceptions, for Descartes, are derived from this so called \\"foundational\\" moment of his reflection. With the late (or post) modern turn to the contextual embeddedness of reason, those like Lyotard have questioned the validity of \\"meta-narratives\\" which are not just \\"grand stories,\\" explaining the world in a unified theory, as is commonly misunderstood (especially in reactionary evangelical circles) but \\"grand narratives\\" that are legitimated by supposedly \\"neutral\\" reason or empiricism serving as an underived foundation for all subsequent theorizing. The result of this late-modern tendency has been the turn to coherentism, the idea that something is true if it fits in with a web of pre-established beliefs, generally the standardized beliefs of a particular community. The loss is, of course, any concept of actual \\"truth,\\" or any hope of adjudicating between apparently contradictory claims.F. LeRon Shults' book is written with the hope in mind to transcend and yet include within itself, this supposed dialectic of choice between foundationalism and non-foundationalist coherentism. To do this, Shults engages with Wolfhart Pannenberg's theology in the hopes to better explain and elucidate his own ideas on the subject. The result is a startling combination of Shult's own epistemology (which he terms \\"post-foundationalist,\\" following, I believe, J. Wentzel van Huyssteen's similar use of the term) and a, quite frankly, spectacular evaluation of Wolfhart Pannenberg's methodology.To begin with, Wolfhart Pannenberg, debatabley not only (one of) the greatest systematic theologians of the 20th century, but one of the greatest Christian thinkers of all time, has often been accused of falling prey to the modernist project of neutral, \\"indubitable\\" foundations, i.e. truth as \\"world fit,\\" or \\"the-thing-in-itself.\\" Ironically he has also, due to other statements in his overall theological program, been accused by conservatives as merely a \\"coherentist\\". Shults attempts to overcome these misunderstandings of Pannenbergs subtle and exhaustive theological system. Shults brilliantly outlines how Pannenberg uses neither rational or philosophical anthropological conceptions nor particular theological convictions as \\"foundationilist\\" starting points, but rather the two are paired to one another in a relationship Shults deems \\"bipolar asymetric relational unity.\\" The compexity of Pannenberg's system is wonderfully elucidated by Shults (and is actually lauded by Pannenberg himself). While Pannenberg begins with general anthropological considerations (e.g. from biology, sociology, psychology, anthropology) this is not \\"foundational\\" in the sense that it \\"neutrally\\" assumes this data without theology, or that theology merely uncritically accepts modern scientific findings and alters itself accordingly. Nor is anthropological data from the sciences accepted or rejected because of presupposed theological convictions (e.g. the early fundamentalist rejection of evolution). Rather the \\"fundamental\\" moment of anthropology attempts to best explain the modern understanding of man with views to the potential implications in theological understanding. Theology then \\"sublates\\" (takes up into itself while transforming) the anthropological data with the concrete expressions of man as it is understood in theology. Hence ultimately it is a \\"bipolar\\" relationship (meaning the two movements need to not collapse into one another but remain distinct) that is ultimately unified (e.g. both sides, the fundamental or from below movement, and the systematic and from above theological movement, are both encompassing of the entire subject and hence do not exist as compartmentalized moments that somehow do not already rely on the other pole of the movement, even though they are distinct conceptions) and asymetric (in that the attempt of the relationship is meant to show that theology as an explanatory paradigm is ultimately the best explanatory model, over against, say naturalistic or atheistic models, and so the fundamental movement in theology is not totally equal to its systematic counterpart).So, for a concrete example, in anthropology there is a fascination with what is known as \\"weltoffenheit\\" or world-openness, meaning mans' ability to always seek beyond his current situation, ultimately beyond all boundaries. This data is presented and then \\"sublated\\" in Pannenberg's argument, where Jesus is seens as the fulfillment of human world-openness, which is now understood theologically as \\"open-ness\\" to God (which Pannenberg also sublates, i.e. \\"brings up into\\" the discussion of the nature of the imago Dei). Hence anthropological considerations need a reality to explain their findings, while theology needs a presupposed \\"need\\" of which it is the fulfillment. But neither are left untouched by the other, as if theological or anthropological conceptions were merely what they were without the other, but rather each mutually modify the other in the course of the dialogue. This isn't like Tillich's method of correspondence where philosophical ontology asks existentially relevent questions that are answered by theology. The questions and the answers, according to Pannenberg and Shults, are not \\"outside\\" eachother but are part of the same overall task: neither the fundamental or \\"from below\\" moment nor the systematic or \\"from above\\" moment is a starting point that somehow does not initially include the other, as if they were two atomistic starting points (hence once again, they are bipolar in the sense that they cannot be collapsed into one, but are unified because they do not ever exist without modification from the other). For anthropology, claims Pannenberg, its concepts of the unity of human identity already presupposes in itself the unity of the world, and hence the unity of God, while theology already presupposes some model of anthropological reality. Like Calvin states at the beginning of his Institutes: To understand the self, one must understand God, to understand God one must understand the self. The two cannot be thought without the other.\\" Indeed, it is as such that Pannenberg in his book on Anthropology can point out to the strong implications Christian theological considerations have had on supposedly \\"secular\\" anthropological concepts. But vice-versa, the concepts have themselves been modified by continued data and paradigm acquisition. Hence the method is \\"foundational\\" in the same sense of all epistemology, in that the task must start somewhere, but, as Shults takes great pains to emphasize, it is not \\"foundationalist\\" because it doesn't \\"hold-on-to\\" the starting point uncritically, unilaterally, or unmodified. (Please forgive the brevity and perhaps opacity of this presentation, which is certainly not a fault of the book, but of the limited time of this review. Don't let the quality of the review dissuade you from the book!)All of this is done in interaction with Shults \\"post-foundationalist\\" epistemology. He creates four \\"couplets\\" which mutually modify eachother something akin to the process that Shults elaborates in Pannenberg:I. Interpreted experience engenders and nourishes a web of beliefs, while the web of beleifs informs the interpretation of experienceII. The unity of truth is a presupposition for the intelligible search for knowledge, while the subjective multiplicity of knowledge indicates the fallibitly of truth claimsIII.Rational judgement is the activity of socially situated individuals while the cultural community indeterminately mediates the criterion for rationalityIV. Explnation aims for universal, transcontextual understanding, while understanding arises out of particular contextualized explanations.The first two couplets (I+II) Shults considers the \\"epistemological\\" side, while (III+IV) are the \\"hermeneutical\\" side of the procedure, with the \\"epistemological\\" and the \\"hermeneutical\\" also being dialectically paired to one-another, along with their sub-couplets. The entire book really serves as a continual unpacking of the specifics of Shults' program, and its potential implciations for interdisciplinary theological study. Shults then critiques Pannenberg in light of Shult's revision of the task. For example, he believes Pannenberg needed to be more sensitive to the so called \\"post modern\\" concern over the task of anthropology or hermeneutics, in that Pannenberg is still overly reliant on Popperian rationalism and never questions that a systematic ordering needs or can be done at all. Indeed, if one is to take Pannenberg's task seriously, now, Shults ammends, we need to show and justify the very idea of the unity of truth. Also, Pannenberg is critiqued by Shults again because he merely assumes that intersubjectively criticizable criteria and method exist, which is exactly what the broadly \\"post-modern\\" landscape calls into question.Overall this book is simply fantastic. I can't really recommend this for the casually interested (though I really do think everyone should read this book) because of the technical aspects of the discussion. At the same time, though, Shults does a great job of providing a very layman-friendly exposition. This book does what great theological books should do (provide an engaging, spectrum wide assessment of its topic), and it does it TWICE -- once in relation to the field of Epistemological and Hermeneutical theory, and its relation to science and theology, and AGAIN in an amazing study of Pannenberg's methodological concerns (which is in itself astounding). As a source to understanding the broad scope of Pannenberg's system alone, I would recommend this book, and vice-versa as an interesting discussion piece for epistemology this book carries its own weight. It becomes all the more worth while when it does both. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Postfoundationalist Task of Theology","review":"If you are like me, you wish you could get your hands on more stuff that Wolfhart Pannenberg wrote on just about anything. Shultz works through philosophical issues concerning modernist's foundationalism and postmodern thinking that Pannenberg did not spend much time commenting on explicitly. Shultz scours Pannenberg's work to show how he anticipated these kinds of questions and implies a practical middle way between them that Shultz calls \\"post-foundationalism.\\" Best of all, rather than giving pure speculation, the author obtained an endorsement and consent from Pannenberg who writes a couple of pages at the beginning of the book to show his approval. The book is dense and not necessarily easy to follow for the beginner in Pannenberg, theology, or philosophy. Nevertheless, a careful reading of Shultz will prove insightful and practical for grasping today's \\"postfoundationalist task of theology.\\""},{"Title":"The Postfoundationalist Task of Theology","review":"Shults' &quot;Postfoundationalist Task of Theology&quot; represents a foot-in-the-door to cutting edge theology today. As Pannenberg himself has expressed, Shults' scholarship is sound and offers his audience thorough research munificent with keen insights, and is constructively refreshing for those who wish to move beyond the traps yet remaining from an era of scholastic proliferation. Is Shults a contemporary bellwether? Well in some ways it appears that this may increasingly become the case. As opposed to the all-too-typical and soporific work published by some scholars which tends to simply repeat itself as a method of argumentation, Shults is just beginning to make a strong case at the outset of his budding career as a theologian in opting for the adoption of an interdisciplinarian methodology which seeks the input of a wide variety of fields of study. For this reason, his scholarship should have lasting significance as it engages a mosaic of intellectual disciplines, while seeking to integrate the vast array of intuitions found therein. Although Shults already deserves recognition as a prolific author relative to his age given his publications in journals, books chapters, etc., this is his first published book, but one which clearly portends promising and exciting scholarship to come."},{"Title":"Compass of the Heart: Embodying Medicine Wheel Teachings","review":"This book's prose is very lyrical and flows over the mind very easily.

Other names for East include Spring, Morning, Mind, Child, Perception, Beginning, I Ching, and Awareness.In addition to the cardinal directions, there is also Earth, Sky, and Center.

In August, the Amistad and the Africans were seized off Long Island. These events set off a judicial, legislative, and diplomatic battle that would not be completely resolved until the Civil War ended slavery in the United States. Mutiny on the Amistad looks at the laws, issues, and people involved in this landmark case.The key questions are: Who has jurisdiction over the case? Are the Africans legally slaves? If so, who has the rights to them? Are they \\"salvage,\\" like the Amistad? Will the case worsen the relations with Spain and strengthen Great Britain's claims in Cuba? Will it become the catalyst the abolitionists need to give them and their cause credibility with the northern public? And how will Martin Van Buren's administration deal with such a controversial case in a re-election year?While the case attracted the attention of abolitionists like Arthur and Lewis Tappan and John Quincy Adams; the administration of Martin Van Buren and even those of some of his successors; and several governments, including those of Spain and Great Britain, Jones's repetitive treatment of the story robs it of much of its drama. For example, he makes the declarative statement that the Van Buren administration's focus was solely on re-election and ensuring the Amistad case did not interfere with that objective more than a dozen times. Some of the primary source quotes do not seem well selected to expand upon the contemporary view; in too many cases, quotes consist of one or two words, such as \\"gross injustice,\\" that are too out of context or are such common expressions that they become meaningless. The best quotes come, not from the case or the participants, but from the various southern, northern, and abolitionist publications; these headlines reveal contemporary perceptions, beliefs, and biases. As for the participants, the only voice that seems to express any passion is that of John Quincy Adams, who is clearly emotional about the abolitionist cause.In the meantime, the voices of Joseph Cinqu&eacute; and the rest of the Africans-the subjects of the entire controversy-are heard only rarely, primarily through letters to the abolitionists complaining about the poor conditions they are subjected to in prison. It is not clear if this is because their testimony was generally deemed irrelevant (they seldom speak for themselves) or if their feelings and thoughts are poorly documented because of the language and literacy barriers they initially face. Jones does try to interject them periodically, but during the long passages in which they are missing the reader feels as though the case has become an exercise in legal argument without victims.Ultimately, it is not clear what the Amistad case accomplished. For many in the north, Cinqu&eacute; and the other Africans are objects of both curiosity and sympathy, but it is not apparent that the Amistad case significantly advanced the cause of abolition-in itself an irony since Cinqu&eacute; and company were never legally slaves (one point that the courts and even the district attorney agree upon). Jones asserts that the case raised public awareness of the conflict between natural law (such as man's right to freedom and to kill to obtain it) and positive law (such as that enabling slavery and preventing slaves from rebelling). The scope of Jones's research and quotations, save those from newspapers, does not support this; there is little presented to show that the case was discussed every day in ballrooms, parlors, and bars or that the general public's perception was permanently altered. What is clear, however, is the racism that is prevalent throughout. Even some of the abolitionists, most of whom are spiritual leaders who find slavery an abomination against God, do not consider Africans their equals.The facts of the case are all here, along with much of the background. Some of the conclusions seem incomplete. Throughout, one gets the impression this could have been a shorter, more succinct, and, more importantly, a more dramatic and tightly argued book had Jones or his editor cut the repetitions, redundancies, and minutiae and focused on a more cohesive discussion of the relevant specifics of the case and its effects on the public, the U.S. government, and policy. As it is, in Jones's hands this case appears less interesting and less important historically than it probably was, and even the source of all this, Cinqu&eacute; and his comrades, lose their three-dimensionality-their humanity, as it were. If you are interested in the Amistad case and in the story of the abolitionist movement, this is probably a must-read-but don't stop here.Diane L. Schirf, 16 February 2004."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Amistad","review":"I have not seen the movie yet, but I plan to to get a better idea of the events. Jones' accounting of the legal procceedings seems very repetitive, and overshadows the human element in the story. He could have done much more with the facts than simply repeat them, using barely any adjectives. But his account is very accurate and gives a good picture of the government's feeling toward slavery at that time."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Amistad","review":"I saw the movie, and it performed its function well: it piqued my interest. But, of course, being a dramatization, it was not bound by little things like facts; it took the basic story, and made it as interesting and dramatic as possible.This caused me to develop an interest in the subject, and a curiosity as to what the actual truth of the story was, and this book served admirably to answer that question.If you're interested in an entertaining story that has drama, characterization, and closure, see the movie. But if you're interested in historical facts, and literal truth rather than symbolic truth, read this book."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Amistad","review":"Steven Spielberg's movie Amistad won high critical acclaim, my wife and I included, for its insightful and inspiring portrayal of a relatively minor yet bellwether event in our history. Because I wanted to learn more, I picked up Howard Jones' Mutiny on the Amistad from the remainder table of my local bookstore. I must say I was disappointed. Jones succeeded in saying in 215 academically-bloated pages what perhaps could be told in half the length. As a lawyer, I am interested in and readily follow legal arguments, which is most of what Jones endeavors to recount. Each time an argument is referred to, however, Jones restates it in full rather than assuming his reader had read the preceding chapter or has some attention span. This fills a book already made ponderous by academic style and language. This book reads like a PhD dissertation; if, in fact, it was, I'm sure Jones deserves his degree, but I'm not confident he should win readers outside the ivory tower."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Amistad","review":"Mutiny on the Amistad by Dr. Howard Jones is an exceptional piece of historical research. For the reader who wishes to read an exceptional historical treatise buy the book. One fully comprehends the the roles of Spain, England, the United States and the cruelty of the slave trade. After reading this book one can comprehend how race initially was and still is a significant factor in the cultural life and politics of the United States. Dr. Jones is to be congratulated for a balance historical presentation and insightful view of cultural history as well...if you are seriously interested in the events of the Amistad and the world that created this incident, you will greatly appreciate Dr. Jones' scholarship.

This IS one dry, boring book. And that is a shame because this event is a signal event in the course of our Nation's history. This 1839 mutiny by black Africans aboard a Spanish slave ship resulted in a trial before the US Supreme Court that pitted former President John Quincy Adams, who came out of retirement to defend the Africans, against the federal government. Importantly, this trial was held during the time in which the Gag Rule was in effect within the United States Congress, i.e., it was illegal to simply speak about slavery within Congress.It is a shame that this, the most famous and compelling slavery case before Dred Scott, is dealt with so poorly in this book"},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Amistad","review":"if you have a short attention span, watch the movie instead. this is a book for people who like to read...and think."},{"Title":"Mutiny on the Amistad","review":"Howard Jones has brought one of America's most important (and often ignored until recently) cases to light.

First there's the opening chapter on shopping (cuts, grades, organic), cooking techniques and equipment. Each chapter opens with a pink embroidered cow, pig or lamb illustrating their respective cuts and the recipes are step-by-step straightforward. This is a book for the kitchen. It's even spiral bound and modest-sized for easy use.There are recipes for every cut and once you get past the too-cute names: Busty Burgers Three-Way Filet, Slow-Lovin' Beef Brisket; there's a wealth of solid information and good ideas like the warm onion relish for steak, and burgers with blue cheese inside. Actually the cutesy names mostly peter out after the Beef chapter, giving way to more descriptive names like Tangy Tarragon Pork Roast and Bacon, Basil, and Apple Sandwich.Even a novice can turn out great chops, roasts, braises and stews with the Meat Club girls.--Portsmouth Herald"},{"Title":"The Meat Club Cookbook: For Gals Who Love Their Meat!","review":"This is a great cookbook that's informative as well.

The cancer is almost totally gone and the terminal diagnois has been lifted. Chemotherapy side-effects were kept at minimum, and once I started Reiki, my friend never again experienced pain.For my new students and those unaccquainted with Reiki, this little book is a great and inspiring introduction to what Reiki is and the incredible things that Reiki can do."},{"Title":"Reiki : Hawayo Takata's Story","review":"This compact book imparts the spirit of Reiki.

So, Reiki teachings to non-Japanese Reiki students proceded from her. Hence, her teachings are of the highest importance.She demonstrated that she became a simple, childlike, MERE CHANNEL for Reiki Energy (otherwise known as: Universal-Life-Energy, Chi, Prana, God Force, etc.) - rather than an Engineer/Scientist who learned to control/manipulate that Universal-Life-Energy by force of will.I believe that far more people would have purchased this special little book and then rated it (at 5 stars) if they had known that it is primarily a compilation of Takata's lectures, and only secondarily a biography.This book made such a powerful impact on me that I thoroughly immersed myself in it.Then, I even created an index for it - which I pasted onto the inside of the back cover.This is the only book that I have ever done such a thing with.I cannot think of a more powerful endorsement for this book that I could make.Otherwise, I would make it."},{"Title":"Reiki : Hawayo Takata's Story","review":"This is my favorite book on Reiki.

It's basically a bio of Hawayo Takata, the woman responsible for introducing Reiki to the U.S. starting in 1937. It reviews how she came to be trained in reiki and her accomplishments with it, including some of the healings attributed to her use of reiki. Some of them are quite remarkable and seem to have a clear relation to the energy healing and some of the healings can be placed under the heading \\"Probably Would Have Happened Anyway\\". One of the most striking accounts was toward the end of her life, after many decades of using reiki: she was brought to the bedside of a woman who had just died and though she didn't think there was anything she could do, she felt drawn to pray. She prayed and used reiki for four hours upon the deceased and the woman was revived. As an RN, I know there are people to whom this occurs, some more than once, but it is EXTREMELY rare. And I do believe in the power of prayer (else I would not be taking this class). To me, reiki is a form of concentrated prayer affecting the energy field the Lord gifted us all with. People can learn to sense this field even without formal training. It was an interesting read but I really look forward to learning reiki firsthand."},{"Title":"Reiki : Hawayo Takata's Story","review":"Besides asking my students to read my own book,Reiki: A Comprehensive Guide, I encourage them to read Helen Haberly's REIKI: Hawayo Takata's Story.

I assigned five chapters and encouraged reading the whole book.There is no other text that I know of like this and it gives a perspective which is extremely valuable for understanding functions and changes in marriage.There are so many forms to marriage and family historically and culturally that obviously no one book could survey them all. But this one does an excellent job of giving a taste of the complexity, especially concentrating on those antecedent influences on the American (and much of the Canadian) heritage. But it also gives some other examples for contrast, (e.g., the Chinese, etc.), that are not part of the usual heritage.The book has chapters on the families of the polyandrous Toda; matrilieal Hopi; traditional Chinese; the Kibbutz; ancient Hebrews; ancient and later Romans; early Christians;Anglo-Saxons; Medieval English; colonial American; modern American; contemporary Black; and Mexican-American to name all but three or four chapters.While written from a socioloigical point of view, anthropologists, psychologists, marriage and family therapists, and many other students of marriage and family will find it a rich treasure. Most chapters are heavily footnoted so there are ready references to other sources.I still look up things in my copy or reread chapters and it's a shame this book is no lonmger in print. Fortunately, there are a number of cheap used copies available and I sometimes order one or two to give as gifts to friends interested in the area. I'm sorry that I've not posted a review earlier. (If you do a Google on the title, you'll see this text is still being used in several upper division courses in the US and Canada.)I don't know what earlier editions are like (I think the first edition was published in 1952!) but I suggest anything from the fourth edition (1974; 460 pp.) on will be valuable. As I recall, the edition in which Jill Quadagno joined the original two authors resulted in a somewhat easier reading book; I'm not sure if the book was shortened at all with her addition."},{"Title":"The family in various cultures (Preceptor)","review":"This book is a sociological overview of the variety of family types found throughout the world. It describes cultures that practice polyandry (exemplified by the Toda of South India), cultures that practice polygamy (exemplified by the Baganda of Uganda), matrilineal cultures (exemplified by the Hopi of Arizona), patriarchal cultures (exemplified by the Chinese), and cultures with minimal families (exemplified by the kibbutz culture of Israel). For each of these cultures, a detailed description is provided that includes information about family organization, kinship orientation and terminology, mate selection, responsibilities and typical practices of family members at different stages of life (birth, infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood and old age), family controls, division of the family, and functions of the family. The descriptions are based on published anthropological accounts of the cultures in question, and specific details are cited with endnotes that appear following each chapter. The parallel organization of the first five chapters facilitates easy comparison of each feature across the different cultures.The second part of the book attempts to explore contemporary (1950s in the 3rd ed) American families by seeking historical roots of family traditions. The authors implicitly assume a Classical Western Civilization source of American family traditions and present a linear history that goes from colonial families to British families, to families of the Roman empire, to early Christian families, and ultimately back to Hebrew families. To me, this part of the book sounds a bit of a stretch, and a closed-minded one at that. I don't think cultural traditions work in such a closed, linear way. I would guess that American families probably have some things in common with other heterogeneous cultures of immigrants, like those found in Israel, Brazil, or New Zealand, in that ties with ancestors and extended family were severed with emigration from the home countries, and may not have been rebuilt by later generations. In addition, certainly Slavic, Spanish and Muslim, and Scandinavian family traditions must all have played some role in creating the culture of the contemporary American family, a role that certainly equaled that contributed by the early Roman or Hebrew cultures. The book closes with a chapter on the American \\"Negro\\" family, which highlights some reasons why family traditions in African American families can be so very different from European American (WASP) families.Overall, I found the book somewhat informative and occasionally even interesting. In places, it seemed that the book focused a bit too much on mating customs and wedding traditions, and didn't delve into the more important questions such as \\"What is a family in this culture?\\" or \\"How do the children view their families in this culture?\\" In order to facilitate the discussion, the focus is on the ideal family in each culture, such as a family with a patriarch and 3 or 4 generations living under one roof. What doesn't receive enough discussion is what happens when the patriarch passes away, since although this doesn't meet the ideal for family composition in the culture, it certainly happens within every family, and everyone in the culture at some point is going to live in a broken family. How do they manage then? The authors brush these questions aside, providing at most a paragraph or two about divorce for each culture. Despite these shortcomings, for a cross-cultural overview of family traditions that is accessible to the general reader, this book may nevertheless prove adequate."},{"Title":"Breaking the Rules of Aging","review":"It's nice to hear from a doctor who doesn't chant the party line. Lipschitz is not afraid to criticize common medical mistreatments: unncessary heart surgery, overmedication, and overemphasis on weight.

Yes, people over seventy can be active healthy and sexual. For my career coaching clients who say they're too old to go back to school, I plan to share the story of the man who completed a doctorate at seventy-five.I especially appreciated the discussion of weight and weight gain. So...being \\"a little bit chubby\\" can actually be healthy? About time we heard this view! And he questions the prevailing wisdom of light exercise. Work out and work hard, he says, and weight-lifting is the preferred exercise for the midlife-to-elderly set.Lipschitz also offers well-informed guidance about excessive or overzealous medicine -- topics doctors usually avoid. Under certain circumstances, he says, chemotherapy and other strong measures can make sense. But sometimes doctors are guilty of jumping in with painful measures to save a life that's already doomed.On the downside, Lipschitz encourages us to believe we can control our destiny, yet he glosses over the aspects of life that we cannot control. He deplores the six-minute office visit, yet most people will deal with time-stressed physicians in HMOs or worse. He encourages us not to be overconcerned with weight loss, yet he says those who gain weight in their midsection (\\"apples\\") are at greater risk than those who gain in their thighs (\\"pears\\"). We can't control where the weight lands and we need more discussion of these implications.Lipschitz devotes considerable space to discussing heart attack prevention, yet ignores other killers, such as diabetes, and other life-destroying conditions, such as hearing and sight impairment. Of course one book can't cover everything, but this book is relatively small for a hardcover (250 pages). A few chapters on other quality-of-life conditions would have been welcome.And I can't help noting a minor error on page 6 -- possibly a typo. The research, he says, is unambiguous. After age 70, weight and longevity are \\"inversely\\" correlated: the heavier you are after age 70, the longer you are likely to live. This correlation is positive, not inverse. Well, nearly every doctor has trouble with statistics -- although the subject is important for interpreting medical studies, as Lipschitz himself amply demonstrates throughout the book.Finally, Lipschitz's patents seem to have ample income and social support as they age. Going back to graduate school at age 70 calls for not only health, but also some financial reserves. Many of the elderly lack funds and many are estranged from family, with few close friends.Medical care is cold, impersonal and often wasteful under the best of conditions. Try seeking medical services when you're not accompanied by a six-foot, able-bodied son or a daughter who just happens to be an attorney! Lipschitz's examples seem to live in a well-cushioned vacuum, and that perhaps is what's missing in an otherwise strong contribution."},{"Title":"Breaking the Rules of Aging","review":"Wonder how our understanding in aging has evolved over years.It was high time someone from medical field put to light the real facts about aging in 21st century. Who could have done it better than Dr Lipschitz, a leading world expert in Geriatrics, well known by public as Dr David.This book is brilliantly written, easy to understand by our lay baby-boomers who need to know these facts not just for the parents, they are involved in taking care of but also for themselves. The book is divided into 12 chapters. One by one, Dr Lipschitz tears down the age old myths about 'obesity' in elderly; and the real role of high tech medical interventions and too many pills that almost every elderly, especially nursing home residents are being prescribed. He systematically explains how myths about harmful effects of sex in old age are plain wrong. Chapter on benefits of increasing one's excercise regimen gradually is very enlightening as well.I myself loved chapters on alternative & anti-aging medicine. There is a lot out there with tall claims but little proof. An authentic voice has long been needed to lay down the facts about parallel health care industry today, most of it is still evolving and not proven thus far. Dr Lipschitz does it brilliantly.Being a geriatrician myself, I have read and reread this book. Each of my patients whom I recommended this book, have found it an extremely useful read as well.Here is a chance for those who might have missed Dr Lipschitz in PBS series, \\"Aging Successfully with Doctor David\\", to get acquainted with today's reality with growing old gracefully and not being shy on going to buy a Harley, as Dr Lipschitz puts it, to experience a fulfilled life right till our last day!"},{"Title":"Breaking the Rules of Aging","review":"Dr. David has put together the sum total of all of the aging research that is at his fingertips as Director of the Donald W. Reynolds Center on Aging. He has written it down in an easy to understand practical manner. It is obvious why US News and World report has named his geriatric program at UAMS among the country's top ten. He openly shatters the myths that are fed to seniors by their doctors, the media, supplement companies, and fitness guru's. Dr. David's advice is based upon a no-nonsense, unbiased look at the medical research. If you are &quot;young&quot; and want to be a healthy, happy senior - read this book. If you, or your loved ones, are in the &quot;third&quot; stage of life (60+) then this book will open your eyes and your mind to healthy, scientifically based, and refreshing ideas that your doctor isn't likely to share with you. Dr. David empowers the reader with his knowledge and skillfully mixes conservative medicine with a focus on healthy lifestyles and disease prevention. I would have loved to have a class from Dr. David during my doctoral studies. I plan to use the information in this book in my life and for my patients. Don't hesitate to buy it, you will be pleased."},{"Title":"Breaking the Rules of Aging","review":"This is a &quot;must have&quot; book for all of us baby boomers who are beginning to show the signs of aging.

Dr. David has filled this book with so much great information and tells us humorous stories along the way. He convinced me to start that strength training program. Don't miss this one!"},{"Title":"Breaking the Rules of Aging","review":"What a book! Dr. David has written a book in layman's terms that is easy to understand and practical in terms of application.

If all individuals would read and apply the information contained in this book to their daily lives, and if doctors, medical institutions, insurance companies, and government agencies would guide treatments and policies according to the principles outlined therein, much of the skyrocketing medical costs we are experiencing in this country could be greatly reduced. I am a retired biologist, and am so impressed with this book that I have decided to order copies (used, of course!) for several friends and relatives (I want to keep mine, and feel sure they will want to keep their copies as well, rather than passing them along to others, as we often do)."},{"Title":"Breaking the Rules of Aging","review":"I just loved this book. The negative review total misses the point of this book. It describes how to live longer and be independent and following an approach that is sensible and gets away from much of the modern dogma. I suspect that the last reviewer is an alternative medicine nut. I particularly liked the chapters on antiaging and alternative medicine as they provide the kind of approach that makes sense and is realistic. This book is for you if you are older and especially for you if you are younger."},{"Title":"Breaking the Rules of Aging","review":"I was disappointed in this book. The audience is geared to the 70+ crowd where it is too late to be proactive in staying healthy. A lot of what he says in this book is common sense. He doesn't appear to believe in proactively staying healthy to avoid problems, rather wait until you have a problem and then treat it. This attitude is what causes people to look for alternative methods of medicine that he abhors. (Keep in mind I didn't read the entire book, I only read the first half before I quit wasting my time.)If you are younger or healthy, I recommend reading books that proactively find ways of staying healthy. Perricone is a good author."},{"Title":"Breaking the Rules of Aging","review":"Very Good"},{"Title":"Yankee genius : a biography of Roger W. Babson, pioneer in investment counseling and business forecasting who capitalized on investment patience","review":"The following Review of Yankee Genius, A Biography of Roger W. Babson, by Earl L. Smith (Harper & Brothers Publishers, New York, 1954 summarizes the life of a seminal figure in American history. Mr. Smith describes in detail the living conditions and hardships of an American growing up in a New England town in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The book is also a Horatio Alger success story showing what intelligence and industry can do for an individual and for the community in which he lived.Roger Babson (1875-1967), a nationally respected economist in the United States in the 20's & 30's was born in Gloucester, Massachusetts. His father was a shopkeeper and his mother a member of the Congregational Church. Between the two Babsons he acquired a taste for mathematics and a sense of propriety that fostered standards of morality and of fortitude that inspired him as he pursued his education and his business. He was a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1898) at a time when scientific and business education was not as rigorous and specialized as it was to become. His aptitude for mathematics and his moral up-bringing attracted the attention of would-be employers. Knowing about the booms and busts of American business and also aware how stockbrokers gambled with paper stocks rather than with the produce the stocks represented, he was skeptical of the relation of stock prices to their past and present values. He saw how stock speculation based on the anticipation of future yields in production could lead to exaggerated stock values that were not based on conditions of supply and demand. Misjudged anticipations of stock market values could bring about inflation, excessive stock accretion, and a situation in which the expansive optimism of investors could result in a succession of booms and busts as stocks and commodities adjusted to oversupplies and decreasing demands. Prone as he was to mathematics, his compilations and analyses of business statistics went against prevailing opinion. As a result, he was thought to be a Cassandra to whom nobody would listen. Finally the stock market crash of 1929 proved the wisdom of Babson's gloomy theories and predictions.Proofs Babson advanced to back up his ideas attracted reporters and investors. It was only a matter of time before he set up institutions to spread his ideas, one of which Babson College in Wellesley, Mass. exists to this day.Ultimately the bureau and the periodicals that Babson established to advertise his theories were acquired and replaced by Standard and Poors, whose rating system for stock purchases has given usually accurate but not always infallible information. In terms of finance, Babson's great warning was to use caution whenever a bubble was thought to be developing, as occurred in the past with regards to whale oil and the railroad, real estate and copper mining industries. Babson's advice to buy low and sell high has become a mantra among investors, though the difficulty lies in determining when the high is too high & the low is too low. This practical advice is of limited value when commodities on the stock marker are of no value whatsoever. That is why success in the stock market is not always guaranteed and luck can sometimes be more important than science.While Babson's writings and schools concentrated on the best ways to earn a fortune, he was entrenched in the ideals of his childhood. Like Benjamin Franklin, though in a more Puritanical way, he counseled his students to work hard, to live clean lives, to avoid liquor, and to attend church regularly. He was an admirer of William Tyndale who was the first to translate the Bible into English from Hebrew and Greek texts. He believed that he could find what God expected him to do by reading the Book. In a like manner he could understand the stock market by examining its operations rather than by listening to other people's views..Always a native of Gloucester and a New Englander he gave people in Gloucester much avuncular advice. Like Benjamin Franklin's maxims in his Almanac, Babson inscribed on the granite boulders of Dogtown maxims that had guided his life: HELP MOTHER, GET A JOB, KEEP OUT OF DEBT. As an indication that he knew that their was more to life than pens and ledgers, he took pains to establish a bird sanctuary and a watershed for reservoirs in Dogtown, efforts that may have been prompted by his economic leanings but were also derived from his moral sense that the future of man and of nature needed guidance and protection.He may not be hip in the modern sense of the word, but the old-fashioned notions of Roger Babson and the old-fashioned world in which he lived has helped to show succeeding generations what to cherish and what to seek."},{"Title":"KJV/Amplified Parallel Bible, Large Print (King James Version)","review":"I really enjoy this product.

The item came at the expected date. I have a soft copy of Amplified Bible in my tablet (YouVersion) and iPhone, already but would be very convenient to have a hard copy, in case of battery outage, or of no internet coverage (YouVersion made the AMP to be download only, I've download it before, but then I had to restore my iPhone and all my downloaded Bibles was gone). Then I stumbled upon this on Amazon, a Parallel Bible of KJV and Amplified.The reason I like AMP is because of the \\"amplification\\" that is in the text, not a commentary in footnotes (although at certain points footnotes are there to explain some more things, one thing that's not present in the Android or iOS app, but available in BibleGateway.com). But when it comes to reading it out loud, this isn't the right book, so the KJV text is always a help.This book contains only the Parallel Bible, footnotes, and the concordance, oh and the beautiful red font for words of Christ. No maps or dictionary, but no worries for me. There is also paragraph break marks, and subhead titles like modern bible versions (and my Indonesian Bible), and the italicized words in italic of the KJV are present also.I'm kinda concerned about the KJV text. At certain points it agrees with the 1873 Scrivener/Cambridge edition, but I found that Matthew 26:73, the KJV text reads \\"betrayeth\\" whereas both 1917 Oxford and 1873 Cambridge uses \\"bewrayeth\\" so I have no idea which edition of KJV that Zondervan uses.

I have a large-print Amplified Bible that is really large print and easy to read.I rechecked, and the Bible does say \\"Large Print\\" on the cover and on the inside, so unless this Bible is defective, what they call the \\"Large Print\\" version is not really large print at all.

And, recently I've been learning a lot from Joyce Meyer, and I find that she uses a lot of the Amplified version in her teaching and explanation of the bible. What a blessing to find a 2-in-1 bible with side-by-side scripture comparison, and I can read from one version and refer back to the other right on the same page! It's amazing to think that I can hold on to the part of my chilhood when KJV was so familiar to me, and to have a deeper explanation and easy-to-read version.

However, this bible is hard to read because the text size is very small. The print is also very light. It's almost as if the bible was printed in pencil instead of ink because it is so light. I have a bilingual bible which is spanish and english version side by side and the size is readable and the text is much more bolder. if you buy this bible you better have extremely good eyes and read it in good lighting.The amplified bible has a lot of amplification (lots of words put in text), which is sometimes very good in understanding the meaning of scriptures, but sometimes so much extra words are added that instead of clearing up the scripture, it makes it harder and more confusing to read. Much of the words used to amplify the scripture are very sophisticated and difficult words so that instead of making the scripture easier to understand, it just makes the scripture harder to understand. Also, many times the amplification disturbs the flow of reading. Hence this bible has two hard versions to read. (king james version is hard to read. amplified is supposed to be easier but it isn't)I recomend getting a NKJV bible (new king james bible). It's close to the king james version but it is a lot easier to read."},{"Title":"KJV/Amplified Parallel Bible, Large Print (King James Version)","review":"I have never ordered books on-line before, so I wasn't sure what to expect.

Personally, I prefer paragraphed editions such as The Bible in Penguin Classics Series.Amplified Bible is an English translation that attempts to clarify the meanings of words in original Biblical languages (Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic). It uses multiple English word equivalents to amplify meanings that may otherwise have been concealed by the traditional translation method. It is very convenient to use. Unfortunately, the \\"amplification\\" is unreliable, often exaggerating or distorting the nuances of the words in original languages. The readers are misled to believe that he/she has uncovered \\"hidden treasure\\" not seen in standard English translations(KJV, NASB, NIV, etc.). In fact, most popular-level word study references suffer from this weakness. If you are serious about word study, but have no working knowledge of original Biblical languages, you should consult more reliable references such as Mounce's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old & New Testament Words, Hebrew-Greek Key Word Study Bible, Interlinear for the Rest of Us, and ESV English-Greek Reverse Interlinear."},{"Title":"KJV/Amplified Parallel Bible, Large Print (King James Version)","review":"After several months of searching several Barnes and Noble Stores and numerous Christian Book stores in N.E.

I like the leather bound version with thinner pages as it has a classic and respectful feel about it. However, I imagine the hard cover would be just as useful.

When Tom decides to act against a copper mine, he does so not out of simplistic ideological purity but because of a complex of reasons, largely having to do with his own identity. (And he was uncritically working as a logger before that.)Nevertheless, this is a profoundly environmentalist novel, with intensely beautiful descriptions of wilderness. It's an environmentalist novel because of the unbreakable connection it creates between humans and their environment and because of its challenge to the ideals of short-term profit. (At the same time, the problems of poverty are never glossed over.)Owens wrote beautifully and incorporated stunning passages of magic realism. Tom is a believable character--confused, irresponsible (college drop-out), lonely, fierce, and ultimately heroic in the same way animals are in those old Western novels where wolves and mustangs leap off cliffs rather than be captured."},{"Title":"Wolfsong: A Novel (American Indian Literature and Critical Studies Series)","review":"Wolfsong is a cautionary tale of what could potentially happenin the North Cascades.

Native American Tom Joseph returns home toattend his uncle's funeral and to unconsciously assume the mantle oftrickster and to learn what drove his uncle to acts of ecoterrorism andmonkeywrenching. Readers will get a true feel for the temperate rainforests of Western Washington while reading this novel, and may betempted to don a slicker or their climbing boots by the time it isfinished. Owens lets the reader decide many of the outcomes inthis novel, though the meaning is always clear, the humor is rampantand the small town was probably a role model for Northern Exposure,right down to troubled sexy waitress and a fly bouncing aroundin the pie case.For wilderness supporters, this book is a horror story. The book isbased on the very real possibility that a copper mine couldbe opened with the attendant roads and carnage, on Miner's Ridge,north of Glacier Peak in the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area.

Read Paul Fussell's excellent essay on Douglas, \\"Norman Douglas's Temporary Attachments\\" and you will understand. InAbroad: British Literary Traveling between the Wars"},{"Title":"Old Calabria, (The modern library of the world's best books)","review":"This book is a masterpiece of English literature on Italy. However the book description on Amazon is misleading. It is not about Calabria but \\"Old Calabria.\\" To the ancients the area between northern Apulia (Puglia) and Calabria, and of course Calabria itself, was Calabria. The first half of the book is mostly about the area which is called Tavoliere di Puglia, which is in current-day Puglia, and parts of Basilicata (the old Lucania). Only the second half deals with current-day Calabria.Norman Douglas's knowledge and grasp of Southern Italy is unsurpassed. I also highly recommend \\"Siren Land.\\" Add to these Goethe's \\"Italian Journey\\" and you will have gained the kind of insight that no contemporary, olive-tree hugging, marketing-conscious author can ever provide."},{"Title":"Old Calabria, (The modern library of the world's best books)","review":"This was a brilliant book and thoroughly enjoyable. At first I got it to look into the nature of the Calabrian people but soon realized it was the story of one man's interpretation of his own travels through Southern Italy in areas that may at one time have been part of Calabria. Interestingly San Giuseppe di Cupertino was mentioned in the book but he is from Le Marche, far north of Calabria if old. Still a witty and sarcastic endeavor that was fun to read."},{"Title":"Old Calabria, (The modern library of the world's best books)","review":"'Old Calabria' is a travelogue reporting a British aristocrat's journey to Southern Italy and Calabria at the turn of the 20th century. For readers interested in Calabria, its real value lies in its depiction of how Southern Italy must have appeared to a foreigner's eyes at the time. Aside from the literary ability of the author, the book's subsequent success has depended more from the paucity of other accounts on Calabria in English than for any other intrinsic merit. Indeed, the book is much more interesting as an account of how Calabria has been represented by foreigners. There are a number of other accounts by English speakers on Calabria that are more nuanced and therefore more interesting. 'Old Calabria' reveals more about the common prejudices held by educated English speakers on Calabria than the region itself. In this book Norman Douglas perpetuates a number of mythologies regarding the South of Italy that are still current today as exoticising motifs, both in the negative and the positive: the \\"wildness\\" and \\"impenetrability\\" of Calabria, its deployment as a borderland between the great constructs called \\"Orient\\" and the \\"West\\" and so forth. For those people of Calabrian origins who have read the book in search of a sense of identity and feelings of self worth, this book may have loomed the larger, the greater their actual alienation from their origins. Rather than bringing them closer to an understanding of their identities, I would argue that the book has distanced them even further. It is through the very discourses that books such as these have perpetuated and legitimated in the English speaking world, that diasporic Calabrians have been alienated from themselves."},{"Title":"Old Calabria, (The modern library of the world's best books)","review":"The book was not as I expected and rather dated in content, so it was no help to me in my current search for information on Calabria.

If so, the Silver Branch is a book for you. Set in Roman Britan, over a century after the first book in the series, The Eagle of the Ninth, the book paints a picture of the life of two Romans, who seek to overthrow a tyrannical emperor who has separated himself, and Britan, from Rome. Rosemary Sutcliff has indeed woven a story whose plot is exceedingly diverse and well thought-out. The book gives the reader a gripping plot in which the reader is given a picture of the Roman world. The book paints a vivid picture of a Roman town, Legion, a gladiator fight, and the Roman's enemies the Saxon barbarians. Rosemary Sutcliff has the gift of being able to write very good historical novels."},{"Title":"The Silver Branch","review":"I found this book to be fantastic. I love the time and setting, but it was much more than that. The characters are all so real and alive, the historical events are so accuratly portrayed, and, most of all, the writing is excellent. Rosemary Sutcliff has fast become one of my very favorite authors, and I would definately reccommend this book to almost anyone, especially if you have any interest in the Roman Empire or Britian/early British history. (I only might not reccommend this to some kids, because the writing isn't always so easy, and they might get bogged down or confused)"},{"Title":"The Silver Branch","review":"This is the second in a loosely linked trilogy (the 1st and 3rd books are 'Eagle of the Ninth' and 'The Lantern Bearers'), and is arguably the best of the three. Sutcliff's narrative is evocative and colorful, and the story is both engaging and full of surprises. If the book has any fault it is in a certain license taken with actual historical events, but since the setting is a very obscure period of Roman-occupied Britain, the liberty is easily overlooked. If you are a Sutcliff fan (and I have yet to meet anyone who has read her who isn't!) you will love this book!"},{"Title":"The Silver Branch","review":"I would have given this book 4 stars but I don't think it deserves these really bad reviews. it's a great book. But you have to know about the late Roman Empire to explain why its so confusing. IF YOU CAN KEEP TRACK OF THE PLOT IT IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS EVER WRITTEN! I like this book more than the others of this really great series the reason being that the 1st book is superb but seems hazy and that the 3rd book is a materpiece but so hopelessly depressing, this book seems more alive than the others . The reason i would give this book 4 stars is because this story badly needs an epilouge even though you know where the 2ndary character lands. I like how the author chooses a family failure as a character.

I'm a big fan of hers. I love how she pulls you into the story without trying to go into matter-of-fact detail. Her descriptions are very intense anyway, and this is one of her best. It's a sequel to \\"Eagle of the Ninth,\\" but you don't necessarily have to read that one first. Her characters are very real, and they are trying desperately to achieve a very difficult goal. Think spy-ring, war scenes, and a many-layered hero. Even the villian is masterfully done. Sutcliff isn't necessarily a Christian writer, but I like how she uses Christian characters to make a historical point. Very, very historically good, and a good read as well. It can get confusing at times, if you're not paying attention, but the pieces are all there--you just have to find them. Maybe that's one of the reasons I like her so well. She makes the reader think about the story almost as much as the characters in it do!"},{"Title":"The Silver Branch","review":"I first read this book over 20 years ago--it was probably my first Rosemary Sutcliff. I loved it then and I love it now. It's a great read! I've always loved the way Sutcliff brings her ancient British settings to life."},{"Title":"The Silver Branch","review":"Like the first book in Rosemary Sutcliff's series on Roman Britain, The Silver Branch is a finely-written story that gives a vivid and detailed look at life in Roman Britain. Although part of a series, the books are only loosely connected (one of the main characters in The Silver Branch is the grandson of the main character of The Eagle of the Ninth) and it is not necessary to read the first book in order to enjoy the second.Sutcliff's books were originally intended for young adults, and there is plenty of evidence of that: the shortness (less than 200 pages) of the book; the straightforwardness of the plot; the lack of complexity in the characters or their relationships with each other; the main theme of friendship and comradeship. However, Sutcliff's style should appeal to adults, as well, particularly those with an interest in this timeframe; her writing exhibits sophistication and skill.The book tells the story of an actual series of events that took place in the waning years of Roman rule in Britain, and of two young men who get caught up in the political treachery that took place. Sutcliff's description of the countryside, the lifestyle of the people, and the military battles are detailed and vivid. Indeed, the only \\"flaw\\" I found in the entire book -- and a weak one at that -- was that I found it highly unlikely that, when the local head of an espionage and smuggling operation on the southern coast of Britain is killed, the mantle of his leadership falls on the two very young and relatively inexperienced main characters, and all the other operatives -- who are much older and experienced -- automatically look to them for leadership. However, I accepted that this book was written for young readers, and so enjoyed the story for the adventurous tale it was intended to be.I highly recommend Rosemary Sutcliff's books and look forward to reading more of them."},{"Title":"The Silver Branch","review":"The Silver Branch is the second novel in the loosely linked Roman Britain trilogy by Rosemary Sutcliff. It was published in 1957, just a few years after the tremendous success ofThe Eagle(The Eagle of The Ninth), the first book. Like all of Sutcliff's work, The Silver Branch was written for children, but thanks to its rich prose and compelling story, also holds considerable appeal for adults. Sutcliff died in 1992, and while she has been far from forgotten, her name has this year come into the limelight once more. The Eagle is currently showing in movie complexes all over the world, no doubt winning over a huge new audience for her wonderfully written books.I for one have no need of being won over. It's thirty years or more since I first became acquainted with Rosemary Sutcliff, and I've been a fan ever since. The Roman Britain trilogy is partly responsible for helping me to change professions too - from that of a veterinarian to a writer of military historical fiction, namely about the Romans. As a mark of my respect for Sutcliff, the title of my second book, The Silver Eagle refers to this book and The Eagle of the Ninth.The plotline of The Silver Branch has been well described by other reviewers, so I won't go into it here. The book has a much larger list of characters than The Eagle of the Ninth, and this adds to its appeal. As well as Justin and Flavius, we have the genial Carausius, the cold, calculating Allectus, Evicatos, the brooding warrior, and Cullen, the faithful King's Hound. Last but not least, there is the fierce old matriarch, Great-Aunt Honoria. Every one of these protagonists is simply but splendidly drawn, and their presence successfully enlarges the tale for the reader.Rich images from the first book also reappear: the Aquila signet ring with the carved green dolphin at its heart and the eagle standard that Marcus retrieved in Scotland. Themes of comradeship and loyalty - to family and friends, as well as to ideals - are central to the plotline, and appeal to us all. As always, Sutcliff's descriptions of the time are vivid and for the most part, extremely authentic. It is this rare ability to draw us completely into ancient times that makes The Silver Branch and her other works such a joy to read. Be sure to read The Eagle of the Ninth first, however!Ben Kane, author of The Forgotten Legion."},{"Title":"The Silver Branch","review":"I have always loved Rosemary Sutcliff. I have been reading her books since I was quite young,(around 10) and will continue to enjoy them through the years. I don't especially like series that continue without end, but I do like the small intertwining throughout her books. It is awesome!Rosemary rocks!"},{"Title":"The Silver Branch","review":"THE SILVER BRANCH is set about 200 years after THE EAGLE. Marcus Flavius Aquila's namesake grandson (called Flavius rather than Marcus) and his cousin Justin come across something that points to treason in the Emperor's general staff. Young and naive, they immediately find a way of informing the emperor.In what follows the cousins find themselves caught up in the messy politics of divided loyalties as the people who live in Britain put up a fierce resistance against the Saxon invaders.If one could fault Rosemary Sutcliff's writing craft, it would be to say that her characters are not very emotional, and that large things happen via small reactions. Which, of course, is very British. Or at least the way the British were famously so in the 19th and 20th centuries. But were the Romans like that? Or the Painted People? I somehow doubt it. While there is no doubt that some people are unemotional, I would say that the relative majority express their emotions quite vividly. And this is something that Ms. Sutcliff just fails to capture.In THE SILVER BRANCH, which centers around the friendship of two young men, the emotions are muted as before. But in this context that seems to work. I think it worked less well between Marcus and his fiancee Cottia in THE EAGLE and between Aquila and his wife Ness in THE LANTERN BEARERS. I thought those scenes between a man and a woman whose lives are so closely bound together should have and could have been a whole lot more passionate. Especially as the women were both strong-willed and opinionated.

I don't know much about Roman history as it spanned a very long time with a lot of succession of groups and leaders. This may have been easier to read as I got my research out of the way when reading the Ninth. The first half of the book, I kept Wikipedia available and a dictionary. By the time I got to this book, I understood a cohort vs a legion, Hibernia vs Albu. As another reviewer stated, there's no harm in challenging your reading. If you're not learning something and reflecting after reading a book, then it wasn't very good was it? Entertaining, it may be, but not useful. Useful makes your brain bigger. This book was fast paced and pointed, which was great for me. I learned a lot about Rome's complexity in itself, much less with its incorporation of Britain. I'm fascinated by how Europe's tribal people came to be Western civilization as it is today.Note to kids: Read about history. Even if it's \\"based on a true story\\". It teaches you that humankind is not that different, regardless as to what time period they're from or what color/ethnicity/tribe they're from. People have the same issues today like there were in Roman times. Different faces, same problems. Maybe one day we'll figure out how NOT to repeat our mindsets.

Mercury, Lead and Carbon are imaginary, the rest autobiographical. My favorite chapter is the story of the chemists at lunch, and the slice of onion in the linseed oil. But they're all good, even \\"Argon\\", the inert gas that serves in Levi's gentle portrait of his family. (Aren't most of our families, well, pretty inert? Yeah.) I wish I could write about MY life and work with half the beauty that Levi writes about his. Practice, man, practice!Levi is Italian and writes in Italian- the book I read was a translation and I heartily commend the translator for a superb job. To produce something so concise, so laugh-out-loud funny, so telling and reflective, in a different language than it was originally written in! Nearly as skillful as writing the original book. Well done!"},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"It's an emblematic title for a book designed whit tales that confection a whole history. The book is a metaphor of the periodic table: elements conform substance so words conform ideas.Primo Levi is a mentor; he begins a melancholic tale, connecting us with characters and at less expected time we receive a little lesson about chemistry, -it's a good way to spread science, didn't it?- but that's not enough for him so we also get his testimony about how he suffered WWII.Primo's statement is hard: \\"... I felt guilty at being man, because man had built Auschwitz...\\" at last it's not clear if he got peace at his mind; but, I must recognize he is honest, because somewhere in the book he says that Primo Levi writes for Primo Levi.In conclusion, it's a gentle book wrote to present a testimony of a man who was born Jewish in Italy, studied chemistry and suffered the war."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"I didn't know what to expect when picking up this book. I'd recently finished the not unrelated Garden of the Finzi-Continis and thought I might find some variant on this. Yes, both books consider Jewish-Italian culture in the years surrounding WWII, with the specter of the holocaust in the background (mainly). But they are quite different. F.C. has at its roots the humanities, and P.T., the sciences. And what I most enjoyed about P.T. was the chemistry. It's a rarity in literature to find a subtle appreciation for the career of the scientist, and Levi succeeds admirably. This book would be an outstanding choice for any science and engineering student to read just to see how one can ply a trade, be it in the laboratory, the mine, or the consulting business. Bravo, Dr. Levi."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"I read this book for the first time about five years ago, but since then I've read it many times (and as a matter of fact, all Primo Levi's books). The special thing about THE PERIODIC TABLE is that brings the joy of life ans science, and also of lecture, to everyone who reads it. I know this is the greatest book ever written: it's simplicity deserves every acclamation."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"In this collection of stories, Primo Levi lets go of the Holocaust theme, and tells the story of his life through the prism of his profession as a chemist. As others have said, each chapter is headed up by a different element, and through the properties of that element he explores a theme. There are two chapters--\\"Lead\\" and \\"Mercury\\"--which are completely fanciful. \\"Lead\\" is about a mythical tribe that makes its living mining lead. Not knowing that the metal is deadly, they all ultimately die of a mysterious disease, but they accept it as their fate, the price they pay for fulfilling a special role among men. \\"Mercury\\" is about a couple living on a desert island, which holds inexhaustible reserves of mercury, and what happens when two newcomers, one an alchemist, joins them. Both stories are riveting.I have to admit that I, as well as my very literate book group, lost a lot by having forgotten most if not all of our knowledge of chemistry--not that we had much to begin with. Some familiarity with the science I'm sure reveals a whole new level to the writing.Some reviewers criticized the lack of insight about the author's time in Auschwitz, but I see that as one of the amazing aspects of this book. For good reason, so many Holocaust survivors are irreversibly marked and changed forever by their experiences. That Levi can write a rich and compelling book that gives weight and significance to the other parts of his life is evidence of an amazingly strong and resilient spirit."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"Levi is one of my heroes - a scientist who overcame a horrific life experience (the Holocaust camp experience), losing friends and relatives yet did not become bitter or carry his anger for ages. The writer is the face of Western humanism and his Jewish Italian roots seem to make him almost humble in tone.The idea of naming each chapter after an element then creating a life story around it is exactly the kind of writing to which I and apparently many others are drawn. Besides dispensing scientific facts along the way, Levi teaches us the meaning of life and living and even humor. One of the best and most approachable \\"science\\" books around."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"Primo Levi's The Periodic Table was, I will admit, a very difficult book for me to read, primarily because I'm not schooled in chemistry and am not at all familiar with the Periodic Table. Sad but true. The idea of the book, however, peeked my interest in the sense that Levi tells his life story through the use of the elements, and it is quite a life history.Telling his absorbing yet horrifying story through 21 autobiographical vignettes or short stories, each chapter represents one of the Periodic elements. Its characteristics each reflect a component of Levi's self with the elements. One element has a component of utter strength. He therefore makes the correlation to the strength of his survival. Another element helped him earn bread for three months while dealing with the horrors of the Nazi camps. However, I am getting ahead of myself. The book really starts off with the element of Argon, and with the use of this element, Levi tells the story of the Jewish ghetto and of his quirky ancestors and neighbors. From there he moves on to his development to chemistry, and this is where the reading gets a little difficult, because he goes on to explain the various importances of the elements. Rather, he features what they are and what they are not good for, how they have been helpful and how they have not been. Each element, in its way, is like its own person with its own character traits. But Levi understands this only through personal and direct human experience. As you read on and learn about the elements, which I fully did, (I got a duel literary and scientific education), things begin to unexpectedly \\"pop\\" up, things like poverty, starvation and the gradual emergence of the war as well as the atrocities against the Jews. Levi doesn't go into blatant description of the horrors, but he'll make an off-the-cuff and disturbing comment that will jar you temporarily away from the elements. You will then focus on interrogation, Fossoli di Carpi and Auschwitz. Then you fully realize what he's talking about, and it isn't science that he's dwelling on. He uses it as a tool or device to get into the core of his soul, to extricate the demons of his past.The Periodic Table was a very slow read for me, but it was one of value whereby I really learned something, not just scientifically and literally but something even deeper then that, something unexplainable. Because the elements have such a resounding resiliency, there was a sense of hope that was conveyed that in our own human nature we too have that perseverance and determination to confront evil and see it for what it is. And most importantly confront it with all our painful might so that it never happens again. This was a stellar and winsome read, especially the latter chapters, heartbreaking, uplifting and just amazingly crafted."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"Difficult to classify, not quite an autobiography, but it is nearly so. More a loose collection of short stories principally from the life of the author each based on a chemical element as the focus of the story. Levi then expands on the story more to the why then the what. A search for meaning beneath the activities of the characters leads to a multidimensional feel for them.The writing style is the main strength of this work. From time to time it does lead Levi to digress farther than I feel he should. Mostly his digressions are positive and add feeling.This is not a light read. I struggled with the first chapter and if I had not been waiting to be impaneled in a jury for 3 hours I may not have made it through the beginning (and would have been my loss). If you find the beginning difficult, skipping the first chapter, \\"argon\\" will not detract from the rest of the work.I hope you will find this work enjoyable from the discussions of insurmountable struggle in \\"nickel\\", the fanciful \\"lead\\", the mystery novel in \\"silver\\", or the powerful examination of how we live with our past actions in \\"vanadium\\". How we each apply revisionist history to our own lives in \\"uranium\\" is a tale we can all grow from.I would have rated the work higher if it had more cohesion, and if from time to time I had not felt the author was adding words merely because he could (see comment of chapter 1 \\"argon\\"). And keep your dictionary handy; \\"The Periodic Table\\" will be good for your vocabulary."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"I read a review of this book in a chemical engineering magazine I subscribe to. After reading the review, I purchased the book and finished in about 2 days. After finishing this book, I went and purchased the other books written by this fascinating man.

Primo Levi is on my all-time top 100 list of people I wish I could have met."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"When I was 14, my high school chemistry teacher gave my class a writing assignment, which really pissed us off. We were in a chemistry class, why did Mr. Ellison expect us to write a short story? It wasn't actually an entire story: the first half was already written for us. It was about the 'adventures' of one atom of carbon. I felt like I was reading a book for small children on molecular chemistry because the writing style was simple, with no extra flourishes and long, scientific phrases. How demeaning to 14 year old me! In any case, I went home and wrote a completely uninspired ending to the carbon-atom fairy tale. If I remember correctly, the rest of the class did the same thing. Some were better than others, but none of them even began to come close to the original ending.Mr. Ellison took our mediocre stories and, in a bargain where we definately got the better deal, gave us the end of Primo Levi's Carbon, the last chapter of The Periodic Table. Nothing had prepared me for it. That simple style that I had so despised the night before was in fact the work of a writer who had stripped off all of those unnecessary phrases that I had been looking for, who had left nothing but the unadorned truth. Struck by this, I went out and bought the book.It consists of 21 chapters, each of which have an element of the periodic table as their themes. But in truth each chapter/story is based on one idea which is explored. Some stories are pure fiction, some are remembrances, and some are meditations. They range from family gatherings to amusing teenage chemistry mistakes to the threads that bind us all together. Levi was not only a gifted chemist and a gifted writer, but someone who had that rare talent of opening his personal philosphies to the reader, and you can't help but feel that you've gotten to know him by the end of the book, which certainly makes the read worth it."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"Primo Levi was a gifted writer that happened to practice chemistry. In these short memoirs he tells the story of a chemist, a chemist that is living in Mussolini's Italy, a chemist that is Jewish and survived Auschwitz. Levi has written of Auschwitz previously and only a single chapter in \\"The Periodic Table\\" directly discusses Auschwitz.To many readers the career of a chemist might seem as exciting as the career of an accountant or a tax attorney, essential to society, but better left to someone else. It hardly seems the subject for a remarkable literary work.Levi paints an intriguing portrait of a chemist, a detective unraveling the secrets of matter, a philosopher searching for meaning. We learn much about the kinds of problems that excite a chemist and how a chemist goes about searching for answers. But we learn more about Levi himself, about life in a Fascist state, and about human relationships in difficult situations.Primo Levi titled each chapter with the name of an element that either plays a role in that particular chapter or exhibits characteristics that are metaphorically descriptive of human relationships portrayed in that chapter.Most chapters revolve about an important biographical event. However, the first chapter, Argon, tells a rather quiet (inert) story of the unexciting Levi family history and it might be best to skip chapter one until later. Hydrogen, the second chapter, is more exciting, almost explosive. Zinc, Iron, Potassium, Nickel, and others follow.Three chapters - Lead, Mercury, and Carbon - are fictional. I was absolutely fascinated by all three. Levi is a great story teller. Lead should be read by students of history and Mercury likewise. Carbon should be mandatory reading for all students of chemistry and biology, probably for all humanities majors too.I have read \\"The Periodic Table\\" several times and it remains one of my favorite books. It melds sadness and humor, offers prose that is almost poetry, and uniquely blends history, chemistry, and memoir. It is widely recognized as an exceptional work of literature."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"This book, like all truly great books, can be viewed in many ways. A possible, rewarding one is to view it as the story of an education. Each chapter, named after the periodic table of the elements, tells about the acquisition of an important piece of the mosaic that was Primo Levi.There is the discovery of the &quot;essential language&quot; of science, as opposed to the void rethoric of fascism, the discovery of courage, in the chapter named &quot;Iron&quot;, of rigor, in the &quot;potassium&quot;. But this is not a didactical book. This is a series of wonderful tales, of exquisite poetry and of life, true life. I didn't read more than five books comparable to this one."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"Nobel Laureate Saul Bellow said, regarding this book, &quot;There is nothing superfluous here; everything this book contains is essential. It is wonderfully pure and beautifully translated.&quot;Since I read this book in the original Italian, I cannot attest to the beauty of the translation. However, I would agree with Bellow that the book is wonderfully pure and lacking in the superfluous.The Periodic Table, Primo Levi's fantasy regarding chemical elements and written in his elegant, spare style, is filled with images that animate the chemist's world. To a trained chemist, as Levi was, the molecular world is very real, and the its underlying events do not go unnoticed. This is the world that exists beneath the one we usually see; the world that gives matter its colors, tastes, smells, shapes and capacities. Levi's desire for a more complete understanding of the chemical world parallels his desire for a more complete understanding of the spiritual world of mankind.In this book, Levi tells us, in part, of his years as a teenager and of his experiences with another young man named Enrico. Both boys wanted to become chemists, but for very different reasons. Enrico thought that chemistry would be the key to a more secure life. Levi, however, looked at chemistry as a way to understand and make sense of the universe. He says, &quot;Chemistry represented an indefinite cloud of future potentialities which enveloped my life to come in black evolutes torn by fiery flashes.&quot; He goes on to describe his burning desire to find the truths hidden in chemistry by telling us that he would have grabbed Proteus, himself, by the throat and forced him to speak, so great was his hunger.Levi's burning desire for a deeper understanding of the universe and all it contains is not new. The ancients, such as Aristotle, and later, Newton, also searched for the key to the mysteries of life. But Levi's desire was perhaps more pure, more essential. He writes, &quot;Conquering matter is to understand it, and understanding matter is necessary to understanding the universe and ourselves.&quot;Although chiefly a Holocaust memoir, the book is not without its lighter moments. In school, Levi had decided that chemistry alone could no longer fulfill his needs and he resolved to pursue physics. As an assistant, he was called upon to prepare pure dry benzene for an experiment by distilling the solvent over sodium. However, using potassium instead of sodium, Levi caused a laboratory fire.The quest for knowledge of the universe is ongoing. Levi, however, sadly found himself spurred on by the prejudices that only man can inflict on man."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"Frankly, the problem with most great writers is this: outside of their craft, they don't have a life. They look down their noses at us and treat us like pathetic ants, often with no insight into our lives and our work. Here then is Primo Levi, on one hand, an accomplished chemist, on the other, someone who lived to speak of the Death Camps. This experience allows him to write the twenty one gems in &quot;Periodic Table&quot;. Each one of these stories crystallizes around a seed element. The seeds form the basis for a detective story into the chemical mystery of a failed paint, an ancient plumber's life ruined by lead, and work in a chemistry lab inside Auschewitz. Levi has a dramatic literary style built for the short story. His writing is pithy and to the point. He builds the stories to encapsulate and expose a single core idea. Each one is about something, entering into the experience of one of the millions of people who lead lives worthy of examination.Hey look, I'll help Amazon sell a book here, how much does it say you'll pay for it, $9.00 maybe? If you have a scientific bent, you'll surely find the stories here entertaining and interesting. Primo Levi was a unique person and that, coupled to his excellent style, makes this book a very good read."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"I first read The Periodic Table in a college course on 20th century Italian literature. Since then I have reread it perhaps a half dozen times. Parts of it -- the chapter about Sandro, for instance, and the last chapter -- I have reread many more times than that.It is such a great book -- such a clear-eyed, deeply felt, wide-ranging look at the human cost of Fascism and the Holocaust -- that anything I could possibly say about it would be idiotically trite. All I can really say, in honesty, is that I think it is one of the greatest books ever written. In any language. In any century. On any topic.Having never read it in translation, I have trouble imagining how a translator could capture the poetry and the rich literary resonances of Levi's deceptively simple writing style. It is the kind of writing where you read sentences over again, sometimes aloud, just for their rythm and sound. However, friends who have read it in English say the translation is excellent. Even if it weren't, it's a book no thinking person should go without reading. It has a beauty and a gripping quality that goes far, far beyond style.Just read it.

Well, I am not a great writer myself, but I do love well-written, gripping stories, and Periodic Table is all of that.

The story traces the author's life as a young Chemistry student in pre-war Italy through his experience as an Auschwitz survivor and post-war chemist. Much of the book is factual and historical, parts are fictional and whimsical.Each chapter is named for and takes its theme from an element in the periodic table. I must admit that the first chapter is so mind numbingly, stunningly bad that I barely made it to chapter two. Thereafter, the story picks up and soon becomes quite gripping until the final chapter (Carbon) that lost me completely. The chapters are roughly autobiographical and chronological in order, with the exception of two short stories (Lead and Mercury), written by the young Levi prior to his Auschwitz experience. The autobiographical chapters are actually vignettes rather than part of a single narrative. In essence, the whole book is actually a collection of stand-alone, short stories.Bottom line: Skip chapter one. It is absolutely meaningless and in my opinion contributes nothing to the book. If you try to read it, you run the risk of tossing the book before reaching chapter two, where the fun begins. The final chapter returns to the pleasure level of chapter one. If this were a sandwich, I'd throw away the bread (first and last chapter) and just eat the meat."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"No, this book will not teach you what you missed in Chem 101. It is instead a stirring memoir of an Italian Jew ,a chemist, who survived the years of Italian Fascism and the subsequent Nazi occupation, by the the force of his creativity and sensitivity to the harrowing events that befell him. The memoir feels like a set of short stories. Each chapter is named for a chemical element.The use of this device was incredibly creative. In one case, Chapter 2 Hydrogen, the author recounts his teenage adventure with a friend, that generated hydrogen from water. In another chapter, Iron, the author describes his best friend and their mountain adventures. The friend seemed to have the qualities of Iron. Just as the elements have personalities- that is, they share, steal or give up electrons to form bonds with other elements, people also have personalities- resilient, affiliative, inert- and Dr. Levi draws parallels between these chemical and human personalities.And what stories he has to tell. A romance that might have been. Surviving a death camp by making flints for cigarette lighters. Uncovering a Nazi in a postwar business relationship. 3 amazing chapters which are wholly works of fantasy- not biography at all. The last chapter is a chemical story, the story of one element without a human subtext, the most important element to life on earth.The book is a tour de force, and a tribute to the fascination of scientific inquiry and experiment."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"Through periodic memories, chapter by chapter, each titled by a periodic table element, we read of memories that tell of being a Jew in Italy before, during and after WWII. He worried about passing his exams, he thrilled at having the title Doctor, he wanted a wife, he survived the camps, he worried about earning enough to eat. Through it all, some philosophical insights produced by chemistry sustain him as much as actual lab work of producing chemical reactions. This is a beautifully written work which explores the mysteries of survival. The framework is the life of a chemist during war time, but the stories are full of discovery and wonder at how people react to events.The fictional interludes were atmospheric; I think Levi was writing of incidents that moved his story forward while at the same time illustrating how without ultimate meaning it all was, other than being events in his life.Surviving a genocide must call into question if any human life has any real meaning or purpose."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"An odd-ball blend of autobiography and short fictions, organized around a motif that would be almost cute if Levi didn't approach everything in his life with somber, intelligent reflection. As odd as it sounds, this is exactly the sort of writing I would expect from a life-long chemist. Even when he waxes heavy on entomological minutia, (something which I think he gets from his fellow Italian, Vico), this is all clearly the product of a highly analytical mind. He barely touches on what happened to him in Auschwitz here, but you can feel the weight of it pressing down almost constantly.

And that made me wonder about the signs the character had missed in his wife's decline that lead to her suicide. Should he have seen them? Did the writer plot them into the story in a meaningful way? Did I miss them? So I got off to a bad start with 'The Periodic Table' when I read that Promo Levi ended his life in suicide. Should I try and see the indicators in this novel that were pointing to that - as it turned out - inevitability? What a task to put on oneself!Much of 'The Periodic Table' is entertaining in the quirky way of modern fiction; quirky and annoying for me. Even trivial. It may be interesting to learn a bit about a chemist's occupation, especially a chemist of the past, but this does seem to be an artifice to carry the novel - unless it carries some deeper allegory.And allegory is important for me here. I have a story to tell myself but I will not tell it the way survivors of Auschwitz keep telling theirs. I need an allegory and I have yet to find a satisfactory one. I don't doubt that we did need stories of Auschwitz to inform the world - stories from survivors, stories from workers in the camps, stories from the liberators, even imagined stories from those who did not survive. But 'The Periodic Table' was written in 1975 by an author who had already written of his experiences. It seems to me that this is too late to keep telling the stories - it is time for allegories. 'What happened to me is described elsewhere (p122)' is an annoying quote for me.I also take issue at comments like 'so this is what it meant to be different: this was the price for being the salt of the earth (p104)'. I don't doubt that Jewishness does carry a weight that imposes especially on young people. And Jews like Levi experienced terrible times. But then so did Gypsies, so do people in today's times in many places all over the world. For me everyone is 'different' and has to accomodate their own special differentness and cope with the constraints it imposes on them.Finally, I return to the matter of Levi's suicide (and you can probably guess that the whole notion of suicide is anathema to me, inconceivable - but perhaps I am lucky in that). There is no doubt that the best chapter for me in this book was the second last one in which Auschwitz does impose on the time of Levi's writing in an entirely justifiable way. I leave it to the reader of this review to decide for themselves when they read the chapter if they can see any pointers to the author's suicide.Other recommendations:Schubert's song cycle 'Die Winterreise'"},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"I remember reading \\"surviving auschwitz\\" almost a decade ago, confounded by its pervading darkness interspersed with the author's brilliant interpretations of life.

And he did write this story -- and it is the last one in his book called \\"The Periodic Table\\". It is curious to notice that both stories \\"Carbon\\" and \\"Gold\\" are the most important ones in this book.\\"Gold\\", placed about in the middle of the book, is the one in which an expected tragedy happens. But this is expected only by the readers -- who know about Levi's life and what happened to him. Part autobiography, part literary fantasy and part a gritty drama, the collection \\"The Periodic Table\\" is a book we read with a heavy heart, because we readers are expecting for something that will cut short the innocence of the early texts.It is not, by any means, an easy and light reading. On the contrary, it requires a patient and interested reader to go through all these stories. Most of them are sad, and it is totally understandable. Levi's choice of words and narrative progress is peculiar and require readers to pay close attention to understand and absorb what he means.\\"The Periodic Table\\" is a book that requires multiple readings. As the reader grows older, he/she will certainly have a different approach to the stories and Levis's worldview. He had a very interesting life that is very worthy telling -- probably that's one of the reason why he wrote some autobiographical books.The people he meets throughout the book are genuine human beings and very touching in their fears and joys. Probably the most unforgettable \`character' is Mr M&uuml;ller in a story called \\"Vanadium\\". This is one of the proofs that the world turns and we will always meet again ghosts from the past.\\"The Periodic Table\\" is a book from the past that aims the present and reaches the future. Levi's stories are important any time, any place."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"In the third to last chapter of The Periodic Table, the narrator - Levi - goes to his 25th University Anniversary. He meets a colleague of his, one that he did not know too well during university, and they swap stories on chemistry, a passion and an occupation both dear to their hearts and the thorn in their side. Levi informs the man of the latest book he is writing, a small book, one that, he hopes, will convey the quiet satisfaction he derives from chemistry, because it 'did not seem fair to me that the world should know everything about how the doctor, prostitute, sailor, assassin, countess, Ancient Roman, conspirator and Polynesian lives and nothing about how we transformers of matter live.'That sentence sums up very well the thrust of the novel. Split into chapters named after a different element of the Periodic Table, Levi takes us on a journey through his life, from boyhood to adulthood, the primary preoccupation of which being chemistry. There is a very large section that he glosses over - the trauma he experienced in a Nazi concentration camp - and this is because he has, in his own words, more than adequately dealt with that subject matter previously. No, this book is not an upraised fist at Nazi Germany, but it does not shy away from the topic, either. First and foremost, it is a series of essays on chemistry. Not the grandiose, world-changing chemistry, but the small achievements, the humble failures, the baffling oddities.First, is Argon. Argon is an inert gas, resistant to change. Just like his family, Levi muses, rapidly jumping back a century and recounting his extended family history from there, with liberal doses of Jewish linguistics and customs thrown in for good measure. Now, acquainted as to the sort of man Levi is, we wander through his college years, each chapter focusing both on his growth as a chemist and a person, but also on the element for which it is named. Interspersed throughout are a few, largely unrelated short stories that deal with a specific element in an interesting way, the story of lead being a particular highlight. These are stories that he composed as a young man, polished and presented in an easily consumed fashion in this, his endstone book.The second last chapter briefly touches on Levi's World War II experience. Through a 'typical' chemistry story involving Vanadium, he engages in correspondence with a man who is later revealed to have been one of the many German officers in Bruno, where Levi was incarcerated. This story is sad, and for me was the most powerful of the fifteen or so on offer. Levi is frightened at the idea of meeting this man again - not because the German was specifically cruel, but because it brings back a life since over. The German, Dr Muller, is anxious to be forgiven, trying to 'settle his accounts with the past and they didn't tally'. For Muller, this meeting might even the score, for Levi, it could never. This chapter is one of the shortest, but carries with it the full weight of experience, sadness, and forgotten terror.For the most part, however, the novel is not depressing or bleak. Rather, it shows the small joys allowed to a chemist who truly loves his occupation. Chemistry puzzles are solved, there are adventures involving chicken excrement and lipstick - don't ask - and throughout, there is a sense that chemistry can be fun, can be enjoyable, can be exciting. No, it is enjoyable, fun and exciting, but only for certain people. And for these people - Levi obviously included - it is a passion, a friend, a lover, and he wishes to share this joy with us, the sadly ignorant reader. I thank him for that."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"A friend of mine, recommending this book to me, said &quot;The first chapter was kind of boring, but I kept reading, and at some point I realized that it was just ... beautiful.&quot; It is."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"Primo Levi's \\"The Periodic Table\\" is a personal memoir of startling innovation, the curriculum vitae of an industrial chemist with the florid eloquence of a poet. Each of the twenty-one chapters is named after an element of the periodic table which relates directly or metaphorically to the topic Levi discusses in that chapter. For example, in \\"Hydrogen,\\" he recalls an amusing electrolysis experiment he performed as a teenager with a budding interest in chemistry. To prove to a skeptical friend that a battery driving an electric current through a beaker of water produced a quantity of hydrogen gas, he holds a match to the opening of a glass jar filled with this premier element, exploding and shattering it in an inadvertently symbolic demonstration of the Big Bang.\\"The Periodic Table\\" is not an autobiography because it intermixes other types of narratives with anecdotes from Levi's uncommonly interesting life. He was raised in the Jewish community of the Piedmont region in northwest Italy during the reign of Mussolini: \\"noble, inert, and rare,\\" in the chapter called \\"Argon,\\" is how he describes his Spanish-bred ancestors who never quite assimilated Italian gentile customs. His education was conducted under the ominous shadow of Hitler's conquest of Europe, and by the time he received his doctorate in 1941, \\"the world was racing to catastrophe.\\" Despite civil laws that tried to separate Jews from gentile society, he was offered a series of professional jobs in a variety of analytical capacities.His career was interrupted--this is an understatement--by imprisonment at Auschwitz, where he and a friend working in a laboratory came across sticks of cerium which they tried to turn into flint for the sake of bartering goods. Many years later, while investigating a defective resin for a varnish manufacturer, Levi had an opportunity to correspond with a German man named Muller whom he had known as a civilian inspector at the laboratory and confront him with questions about the atrocities that were condoned.After the war, Levi's work as a consultant brought him some intriguing cases. A cobbler came to him one day with a parcel of sugar, a gift from a rival cobbler, and asked him to inspect it for poison. A cosmetics manufacturer hired him to find out why his lipstick was running; here we are fed Levi's opinion that a red dye called alloxan, whose molecule comprises two nitrogen, two hydrogen, four carbon, and four oxygen atoms, has a \\"pretty structure.\\" Indeed, it's difficult to deny the neatness of its symmetry (Levi shows us a diagram), for such symmetry usually indicates a durability analogous to that of sturdily designed engineering structures.One of the two \\"external\\" narratives takes place in the Bronze Age and is told by a sage named Rodmund from barbarian lands of the north who travels the world searching for lead with which to craft useful items; he is a pioneering metallurgist. Mercury is the subject of another, in which an English sailor discovers a vein of quicksilver under the volcano which forms the small desolate island on which he lives. These two chapters enter the realm of imaginative fiction and are like the irresistible icing on an already rich cake.Levi writes about chemistry and the techniques of chemical analysis with professional assurance but also with the lucid language of a novelist eager to tell a fascinating story. Non-chemists need not be intimidated by the subject matter because Levi is the most welcoming of writers, willing to share his knowledge but never pedantic and, surprisingly, never pretentious in his literary aspirations; he is as much at home with the pen as he is with the Pyrex."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"I started this book expecting a story of how a Jew survived the Holocaust in Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. I thought that I'd read about tragedy and misfortune, but I didn't get what I expected.What I got was a tale of subtle defiance and quiet resiliency to the war that looms in the background of the book. The author hints at the drama and struggle of the war through his many short vignettes--each related to an element from the Periodic Table--but he is never overcome by it, remaining distant from the events, submitting helplessly to the way things were, but looking brightly toward the future.This was altogether a very interesting book. Strangely inspiring, aloof but aware, it provided me a view of the second world war that I never would have imagined."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"Entertaining, sad, and insightful. What a loss to the world. \\"Carbon\\" chapter is fascinating. Began second reading immediately following the first."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"The Periodic Table by Primo Levi is quite a fascinating book. Although the first chapter is slow (as pointed out in other reviews) the other chapters are pretty interesting. Although only one chapter directly relates to Auschwitz there is another about Primo's involvement with the partisans in Italy (including the bit about the gun he doesn't know how to use), and a very interesting chapter called Vanadium which is the second last chapter. This chapter is based on Primo's dealings with a German chemist (Dr Muller) in 1967. Dr Muller was a head of the Buna Rubber plant at Auschwitz where Primo worked. Basically Primo has business dealings with this person as well as personal correspondence although it's not as insightful as you might think because by Primo's own admission Dr Muller does not make a perfect protagonist because he was a civilian (business chief of Buna which was part of IG Farben I believe) and not a member of the SS, and therefore Primo realises that he won't get answers to questions like &quot;Why Auschwitz?&quot; (Although Primo corresponding with one of the butchers of Auschwitz could be a bit too weird). Nonetheless Primo's dealings with this person are very complex/interesting/multilayered/etc.The tale about the centuries long journey of a carbon atom from being part of limestone to being part of Primo's brain is pretty way out too."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"I was a once a chemistry student, so I particularly liked this book. You will, too. The language and imagery are beautiful, the humour and pathos remarkable, the translation magnificent. Levi is lost to us, but he left this book. Read it"},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"THE PERIODIC TABLE is, essentially, a memoir, but it is a very singular one, just as Primo Levi was a very singular person. He is best known for his eyewitness account of his year at Auschwitz, entitled \\"If This Is a Man\\" (although its American publishers have disfigured it with the overly commercial title \\"Survival in Auschwitz\\"). As I said in my review of \\"If This Is a Man\\", it is one of the few books that I regard as absolutely essential reading.Levi had been trained as an industrial chemist, and was scrounging out a living of sorts as a Jewish chemist in Fascist Italy before he decided to join a ragtag, amateurish resistance group. He quickly was captured, but, ironically, he was spared from summary execution as an anti-Nazi guerilla because he was a Jew at a time when Hitler's Reich needed able-bodied Jews for forced labor in its concentration camps.In THE PERIODIC TABLE, Levi recounts tales of his life both before and after his descent into the Nazi maelstrom of the Holocaust. He also sprinkles in four short fictional stories or fables. All of the tales, whether non-fiction/memoir or fiction, are titled with one of the elements from the periodic table (for example, to name three of my favorites, \\"Iron,\\" \\"Gold,\\" and \\"Chromium\\"). Usually, one or more aspects of the element in question are prominent in the piece given its name. It all makes for a nice conceit. And a very appropriate one, too, inasmuch as the tales all relate in some way to chemistry, Levi's career as a chemist, or the profession of applied chemistry. Indeed, at one point Levi characterizes the book as \\"the history of a trade and its defeats, victories, and miseries, such as everyone wants to tell when he feels close to concluding the arc of his career.\\"The book is written exceedingly well and in a quite charming fashion. It can easily be read as a stand-alone work, though it should be of particular interest to those who already have read \\"If This Is a Man\\", inasmuch as it does contain a few anecdotes from Levi's concentration camp days as well as an account of his later crossing paths with Doktar Lothar Mller, the German who for a brief time and as a civilian had bossed him around in his work when he was at Auschwitz. The Everyman's Library edition of THE PERIODIC TABLE is distinguished and desirable not only for the usual high qualities of Everyman's book production, but also for the fine and useful introduction by Neal Ascherson."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"This is the first book by Primo Levi that I've read. The man was a brilliant author.\\"The Periodic Table\\" cleverly takes the elements that are part of our everyday lives and uses each to illustrate a story, most of which are his view point of 1940s Italy, before or after he was sent to Auschwitz. (Very little of this book has to do with the actual death camp, though its impressions are evident.) Levi, a chemist, tells autobiographical tales of his desire to make people see in the logical way that chemists see the world.The way that Levi weaves words might be more expected from a poet than from a scientist. Above all, however, Levi was an observer of both elements and of human nature. I'm only sorry that I discovered him after he died; I might have written to tell him how much I enjoyed his book. My mother, a scientist, is emotionally unable to read any more books about the Holocaust; but as this book doesn't talk about the horrors of the camps but about the era, why, I think I'll lend it to her.(amazon.com wishlist purchase)"},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"I chose this for my book club to read and I was seriously disappointed that only a few people actually read it, because I think it's the best book we've done so far. Levi's prose is exquisite while remaining amazingly unsentimental. This is not primarily a novel about chemistry, or the Holocaust -- it's about humanity. The book can easily be enjoyed on several different levels -- if for some reason the exemplary writing doesn't grab you, the stories will.A tremendous work of art."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"This is not a breazy read. The writing style is often deceptively simple, but the thoughts are deep and require slow, deliberate attention. This is a book worth repeated readings. I feel like I've only mined about 10% of what I could from it so far.We read this as the subject of a monthly book circle at our church recently and it was very rewarding.Many of the previous 31 reviews are very good, and I won't reherse their insights. Just a few more random observations:* 21 chapters (correspondng to 21 of the elements) and the middle one is gold.* Levi does not convey the horrors of the Holocaust with the same pathos as others (Weisel; Corrie Ten Boom; Mark Rigg; etc.). His account of Aushwitz has the feel of an ordinary prison camp more than the hell it was.* \\"tales of militant chemistry\\" p. 78.* His account of purity and impurity -- personal and chemical -- is fascinating. p. 35.* The translation seems wonderful. I wonder if those who has read it in both Italian and English would regard the English as faithful to the original.* I bet if we were to look up more about the properties of each element, we'd find a lot of more subtle hidden insight Levi has imbended in his stories.Anyway, a truly wonderful book. I hope to read it again very soon."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"This book tells parts of the life story of Primo Levi, author, chemist, and Auschwitz survivor. Levi came of age in Fascist Italy and graduated university with a degree in chemistry just as World War II started tearing apart his world. Caught by German soldiers in a Partisan camp, he was shipped off to the Auschwitz death camp as a Jew. He survived the camp thanks to his chemistry skills, which secured him a job in a rubber factory near the camp. When he returned to Italy following liberation, he resumed work as a chemist, but he also took up writing as a means to communicate the experiences he had been through. Over the years, he published a number of books about Auschwitz, as well as books of poetry and stories. In this book, he records his memoirs as a chemist, with each chapter dedicated to an individual element.The chapters are quite varied in topic and approach. At least two of the chapters are fanciful works of fiction, short stories that he wrote as a young man. The book begins with a chapter on the Noble gases, in which he compares his ancestors, now just memories, to inert gases such as argon. Other chapters early in the book are also based on comparisons between character traits of favorite people and chemical elements. The later chapters, however, are centered around stories or episodes in his life that featured substantive examples of one of the chemical elements. Some of the stories are quite amusing, others interesting in the historical perspective they provide of conditions of post-war Italy, and some, those describing the Nazi occupation and the concentration camp are disturbing. The stories are written as stand-alone entities, rather than fitting smoothly together as a coherent whole. Nevertheless, they are they are organized in strictly chronological order so that the reader can piece together the main events of Levi's life."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"Like many people, I have a prejudice against translations, believing that they cannot match the language of the original. However, with Primo Levi as with Jorge Luis Borges, the beauty of the translation of The Periodic Table is such that I want learn Italian (as I wanted to learn Spanish) just so that I can reread this book in its original language to appreciate it all the more. The tales are magical and practical at the same time, with, to paraphrase the cover, not a single wasted word, and they betray the author's keen eye for the myriad interesting things about the everyday lives of the people around him."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"A rather laid back style of writing in a very conversational approach. The aspect of his holocast experience is very fleeting and somehow I would have wished for a bit more insight. From a scientific aspect, one has to appreciate his ability to solve problems, sometimes with minimal equipment. He clearly is a survivor, not just from his Auschwitz experience, but his ability to forge an existence when others were losing theirs. The first chapter put me off, wondering where this would all lead. Then, it took hold and was delightful to read. The periodic table relates to how he labels each chapter. The chemistry involved is really that of problem solving and insights and the ability to dig deeper. One will not need to fear learning a lot about chemistry per se, but will learn about an approach. It is a light read of a fascinating person. In many ways, it shows the importance of connections; one cannot exist without others. There are many lessons to be learned in this book. It also tells how science was taught and practiced in the 1930's through the post war period. I would hope that people would not leave the book thinking that is how is is still done, although the ability to solve problems still remains in the forefront."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"Chemistry was never my favorite subject. Nor was the Holocaust. Yet Levi manages to bring these two seemingly unrelated topics together in a novel that I can only begin to hope I fully understand some day.The title \\"The Periodic Table'\\" is both a misnomer, and extremely appropriate for the book. Divided into chapters, each of which are titled as the name of a different element, Levi uses the Periodic table as a grounding point for his essays, and each element as a grounding point within the chapter. The coldness of iron, the smell of sulfur, and the journey that a molecule of carbon takes. Levi, whose formal training was as a chemist, relates these simple atoms to a much more complicated--and tragic picture.This book knocked my socks off. The strength of this work lies not within his description of the Holocaust; he acknowledges that he already dealt with that in his work, \\"Survival in Auschwitz\\"; but in the simplicity by which he portrays such a complicated time."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"Primo Levi, a chemist and a young Italian Jew, grew up during WWII in Mussolini's Italy. The Periodic Table relates his story. Part autobiography, part poetry, part history and science textbook, Levi fuses these together in a \\"life-thesis\\" filled by both comedy and drama. This unique and unforgettable memoir is organized by the periodic table of the elements.The chapter titles range from Argon to Zinc and, like the elements themselves, each with its own distinctive characteristics. The element denoted in each chapter heading is often literally represented in the particular chronicle. And yet, if the reader delves further in interpretation, the element often relates metaphorically to the human experience depicted within the text. While the majority of the novel's chapters orbit various important biographical events in Levi's intriguing existence, three of the book's chapters are fictional: Carbon, Lead and Mercury.Often deceptively simple, Periodic Table is hardly an elementary read -- Levi's concepts, philosophies and frequent use of veiled symbolism, require and deserve lengthy deliberation to digest their hidden depths. Beautiful in its precision, it is the story of a life touched by the experience of science, war and love.Curious, unconventional, poignant and memorable, The Periodic Table is the magnum opus of memoirs.Read it."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"I found this book on the shelf of a famous bookstore. It was the only copy they had. The title is intriguing, at least to me, because I am a student of chemistry. This book is very profound and entertaining at the same time. I have never heard of Levi before, nevertheless, the first impression he gave me through his &quot;Periodic Table&quot; was remarkable. Somehow he understands one's passion for matter, for chemistry in particular. I guess 'understand' is an understatement. His vast knowledge of chemistry came alive with his real life experiences."},{"Title":"The Periodic Table","review":"Levi weaves the characteristics of the chemical elements through his life both metaphorically and literally. The author's boyhood fascination with chemistry leads to his adult occupation. During World War II, the young Italian Jew is taken away by the Nazis to Auschwitz. Ironically, his chemical knowledge keeps him alive at the death camp. This true story has a mystery in it; wherein Levi's German supervisor at Auschwitz Buna synthetic rubber, slave labor factory contacts him many years later [not long after writing this book, Levi suffered a fate similar to the German]. The book is refreshingly unsentimental, gripping, and even educational from both historical and scientific perspectives. Reading it is all at once stimulating, frightening, and enlightening.Readers will enjoy and also be improved by Levi's book."},{"Title":"Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander","review":"Thomas Merton (1915-1968) was a Trappist monk of the Abbey of Gethsemani, Kentucky, as well as a best-selling writer, poet, social activist, and student of comparative religion. Tragically, he was accidentally electrocuted while in Thailand at a conference of Christian and non-Christian monks. He wrote in the Preface to this 1965 book, \\"This is not a sequel toThe Sign of Jonas... The book does, indeed, consist of personal reflections, insights, metaphors, observations, judgements on readings and events. The material is taken from notebooks which I have kept since 1956... these entries are not the intimate and introspective kind that go to make up a spiritual journal. There is certainly nothing private or confidential here.\\"He suggests, \\"Technology is not in itself opposed to spirituality and to religion. But it represents a great temptation.\\" (Pg. 25) He observes that \\"(Teilhard de Chardin) has enabled thousands of Christians to become reconciled WITH THEMSELVES. In doing this, of course, he has accomplished a providential task, essential for genuine contemporary renewal of religion.\\" (Pg. 51)He observes, \\"If I affirm myself as a Catholic merely by denying all that is Muslim, Jewish, Protestant, Hindu, Buddhist, etc., in the end I will find that there is not much left for me to affirm as a Catholic; and certainly no breath of the Spirit with which to affirm it.\\" (Pg. 144) But later he adds, \\"Certainly I find in myself not the slightest inclination to 'be' anything but 'Catholic'... I believe in the Church. I am in the place where Christ has put me.\\" (Pg. 250)He confides, \\"I am less and less aware of myself simply as this individual who is a monk and a writer... It is my task to see and speak for many, even when I seem to be speaking only for myself.\\" (Pg. 245) He adds, \\"I think the Church is generous enough to tolerate me even though I am not leading a movement---or even following one.\\" (Pg. 249)Merton's wide-ranging observations are fascinating reading for anyone who is interested in Merton (particularly of his \\"later\\" period)."},{"Title":"One Two Three An Animal Counting Book","review":"The text follows a simple pattern of a number followed by a plural animal name.For Asian students, practice in plural nouns is especially important."},{"Title":"Timestruck","review":"Set partially in 792 during the days of Charlemagne, this time travel romance places a twentieth-century heroine in the past to interact with a cast of fictional and historical characters.

While adjusting the date, she falls into a time warp and joins Dominick, a gentle Medieval hero, in a world with none of the conveniences she takes for granted. Trapped in a vortex of passion and a plot against the king, Her very life is in jeopardy as she supports her lover with loyalty and desire to see justice prevail. Taken from the pages of history, this story is an elaborate, painstaking portrayal of real events mixed with a beautiful couples romance and their need to overcome the barrier of time.

OK so the plot isn't very complex, what does set it apart is the focus on the court of King Charles and his spoiled wife. The first part of the book wasn't as I expected as Gina struggles to figure out what has happened, how to live in this time period and for her growing feelings for Dominick. I was surprised at the \\"ease\\" with which it all happened, I really expected more drama and tension but Dominick is so perfect, he has no flaws, nothing to have tension with and she quickly abandons her lifelong hatred of men to fall for him. On his side he suspects her of complicity but doesn't really do much about it which seemed a bit unrealistic.However once she finally succumbs to him and they start feeling like a pair of lovers, the story then abruptly shifts to palace intrigue with a attempt on King Charles' life. Interestingly this seem to consume most of the rest of the book and their love is moved to the side, they get together for a fierce quick 2 page passion every chapter but the rest of the book is about the intrigue. There are lots of twists and turns and it has a great ending! One which you could probably see coming but nevertheless had me grinning like an idiot.So all in all its a fun book with a strong historical focus without pages and pages of drippy syrupy google-eyed lovers, but I think it could have used more love and romance and I think a chance was missed to do more of the differences between now and then, for example having her be more agressive in bed than was the norm back then or open mouth kissing or whatever would fit with the story.I enjoyed it and I'm glad I read it."},{"Title":"Timestruck","review":"The heroine goes into an office to correct a computer for Y2K and by typing the wrong date she's transported to the hero's time.

The characters were painted as real people, and each of them had flaws, and most of them had an admirable quality. The dialogue, the descriptions of New York (Brooklyn) post-war struck up my own memories of that period, when people struggled with the changes of the past decade, when changes occurred in everyday things (like milk in cartons rather than in bottles) and when neighborhoods started to change, in some cases to something approaching the sinister.The story's protagonist just couldn't get a break, and is a personification of the maxim that luck favors the well-prepared. His wife was a classic example of those who see dark things everywhere, and expect them only to get worse, essentially reveling in self-fulfilling prophecy. As a counter to her parents, perhaps the daughter was too trusting, too optimistic. The dark hero of the story shows that many men are neither good nor bad, but are a mixture of the two, ruled by conscience and a universal humanity which transcends background, intent, and associations."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"Frank came from out West, now looking for a new life in New York. But unfortunately at first he has no luck so he must steal from a local grocer. However, no one would expect that Frank would help run the grocery store and eventually become like a son to the grocer he steals from.The Assistant is a book about a man named Frank alpine who helps out an immigrant, Morris Bober, run his grocery store. Frank often takes over managing the store while Bober us away and at the end he eventually does take full responsibility after Morris dies. All the while, Frank falls in love with Helen Bober, daughter of Morris and he sturggles to change from his criminal ways into a good person.The Assistant is a very descriptive book. It is also filled with many captivating events that keep the reader intrigued. Another good thing was the important themes included which made the book even more meaningful. As a result, I would reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys elaborate, event-filled, and significant books.The book was very elaborate, with its detail making you picture what was going on at all times. For example, one time this happened was when the author described how the gas was leaking out of Morris' radiator, even describing the manner that it was trickling out.In addition, it was very eventful, with numerous things happening to keep the story flowing. For example, som of the events are: when Morris slips and falls unconscious while bringing in milk crates, when Morris radiator is leaking in his apartment room, and when the grocery store gets burned down.Another reason I liked the book is because it had many important themes. For example, the characters Morris and Frank depict the importance of a father-son relationship with the way Morris takes Frank under his wing. Another example is the struggle for an immigrant to suceed in America when opening their own business.In conclusion, The Assistant is an descriptive, meaningful, and action-filled book. All of these features combined contribute to making The Assistant a very entertaining read."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"'The Assistant' might be a bit dated in depicting the struggling Jewish shopkeeper as universal sufferer, since time and place and circumstance change social and ethical foundations and hierachies. Some people might see the book as too allegorical/parabolic and symbolic as well. But is that a fault of the book or of the benign neglect of many thoughtful people toward suffering and raw expression? The characters make it above the level of stereotype, albeit not by much, and the New York of the early 1950's is not the one of today (even the Brooklyn of the 50's isn't). Nevertheless, in creating a modern parable of suffering and redemption within a circumscribed world of a few blocks of a Brooklyn neighborhood inhabited by the local Jews, Italians, and Irish, Malamud has created a book that is accessible to anyone with a heart and interesting enough for anyone with a literary bent. It can also give pause (to anyone who is wanting to give pause) to those caught up in the hypermaterialist world today. John Lennon said \\"life if what happens what you're doing other things.\\" This book can help bring you down to earth in between reading brochures on M.B.A. programs."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"As an author with my debut novel in its initial release, I hope my work endures as well as the work of Bernard Malamud.

He takes a job at a Mom and Pop grocery store to privately atone for a crime against that store (as well as other crimes elsewhere). He agrees to work for room-and-board. There is ethnic tension between the Jewish grocery store owners and the Italian criminal. These tensions grow more severe when a romance develops between Frank and the grocer's daughter. This novel comes as close to being perfect as any I've read in recent years."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"As I recall, this was a pretty good book. It is not the most readable novel featuring a pretty ordinary story filled with pretty unextraordinary characters. However, I liked the way it was delivered - tough, realistic, rarely embellished. It tells the story of a Jewish grocer's relationship with an Italian thug in Brooklyn. I read with the same feeling I might have of my own daily life. Every inflatable theme is curbed by sober reality - friendship, love, sex, marriage, crime, duty, &quot;redemption.&quot; A recommended read."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"'The Assistant' is clearly an interesting read.

Certainly 'The Assistant' is rich in dialog, characterizations and in capturing anti-semetic feelings during that era. However the author seemed to have overreached in making the ending to the story to be something profound, almost of biblical proportions. For me it was too contrived. But this was only a slight distraction from an otherwise pleasant reading experience.Bottom line: an interesting and moving drama that teeters on melodrama. Strongly recommended nonetheless."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"As an author with my debut novel in its initial release, I hope my work endures as well as the work of Bernard Malamud.

He takes a job at a Mom and Pop grocery store to privately atone for a crime against that store (as well as other crimes elsewhere). He agrees to work for room-and-board. There is ethnic tension between the Jewish grocery store owners and the Italian criminal. These tensions grow more severe when a romance develops between Frank and the grocer's daughter. This novel comes as close to being perfect as any I've read in recent years."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"Absolutely wonderful-a literary classic. Rich, real characters that come to life on the page. Funny, human, moving. You won't forget this story and you'll be so glad you read it. Mink has told all her friends to read it and most have. Those who refuse have been warned."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"Thank goodness this is not an abridged version of this masterpiece. It takes time to build the complex characters and the moral universe they are living within. Which is not to say the story is not dramatic - it is that, and the reader/hearer is grateful for every riveting detail. Most of all the performance of George Guidall is a masterpiece in itself. Every character has a distinctive and compelling voice. A great experience!"},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"I enjoyed this story. It never felt dated even though the book was first published in the 1950's. The story takes place in New York around 1925 and focuses on one family, a poor Jewish grocer and his wife and adult daughter. The economy is bad, so times are tough, and the grocer has never been a particularly inspired businessman. Under strange circumstances he takes on an assistant he really can't afford. The relationships that develop between this assistant and the grocer's family is intense, in both positive and negative ways, and transformative for all involved. I liked the way the story ended also. Elements of the story include the religious biases of the time between Jew and non-Jew, the economic struggles in the poor economy, the disappointments borne by the daughter who is in her twenties but without prospects, the disappointments of the grocer who has struggled all his life with nothing to show for it, and the internal struggles of the assistant with himself regarding the kind of person he is and how he always manages to ruin his luck. The character development is impressive. There's a great deal going on in this tale."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"A Jewish immigrant grocer , Bober, struggling to survive as the world around him changes suddenly takes in an Italian-American vagrant to work in his store following Bober being injured in a hold-up. This simple transaction sets in motion a series of events that causes havoc in both of their lives and in the lives of Bober's wife and daughter. Frank Alpine , the Italian mentioned above, while seemingly a malevolent force in the lives of the Bober's is the character in this novel who goes through the most transformation. In the end The Assistant is a redemption story. In Malamud's hands, these characters suffer both physically and psychically and yet their humanity and the basic characteristics that drive them in the end render them all as sympathetic characters despite the overall tragic circumstances of their existence. Masterfully written , The Assistant , is a book that brings the reader into contact with a period and a lifestyle that resonates powerfully and universally. Great Book."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"I purchased this book for a college class. Normally I'm not much of a reader. I was dreading reading this but it turned out to really be a great story! I would recommend it if you want an easy and interesting read. :)"},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"great read, great character development. Got me started reading the rest of his books. I would definitely recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"This is my favorite work by Bernard Malamud, a moving, beautifully-written fully realized tale of redemption. The author charts Jewish folk ethics and their place in human morality as no one else does. The perfectly-named Frank Alpine goes through an ascent that is always fascinating."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"The sender was very quick and the book looked very new although it was used book. I really enjoy reading the book. I Know there is a movie based on this Novel I hope someday I can watch it."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"This novel is a somber glimpse at the life of Frank Alpine, an Italian who is haunted by guilt and seeks only redemption for crimes for which he can't but help to committ. This brilliant work examines the obsession that drives the protagonist to his eventual salvation in the hands of compassion and forgivness. This is a truly remarkable and oddly reminiscent of real life as it captures all the conflicting emotions that often hinder humanity."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"Frank Alpine ends the novel as Morris began it, serving mankind. Frank has become Morris, and in that, he has found his redemption as well as a place in life. The question remains...is Frank a hero at the end of the book or a martyr?"},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"Malamud paints a dismal picture of life in Brooklyn as a struggling Jewish grocer works with a dark, troubled Italian. The conflicts they face are very real and the mistakes they make all have painful consequences. At times the story moves slowly, perhaps to enhance the dreary life in the dreary store, but there are enough tragedies (such as a robbery, rape and worse) to keep the reader on edge and nervous. Ultimately this tale works on an internal level, where the reader must look within and question the basis and nature of morality. There are no easy answers in this story, but plenty of pain and heartbreak. A solid story, well worth the few short evenings it will take you to finish."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"Malamud comes up with a gritty look at surviving with the times and how age can trap you into a life of heartache. The small 2-story grocery store is his prison and Frank is his ray of hope but it does'nt shine bright for long. Malamud seems to chastize gentiles as self centered and makes judism the only basis of a true life which works in this book but has ruined other books for him. A gritty story though that will make you think about your future."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"I've read this book 50 years after it was published, but unlike some novels, it's not dated at all. Not only does it work well as a period piece, but its portrayal of people, of the body blows dealt by life, and of the way this country doesn't live up to what immigrants think they are going to find is relevant today. I felt the publisher's blurb on the edition I had and some other reviews may have oversimplified or misstated some of the characters. Frank is not some remorseless sociopath who walks in to rob, rape and pillage. Frank is a complex person who for much of the book is caught in a vicious circle of doing wrong, experiencing tremendous pain of conscience, determining to make right what he has done, getting into difficulties, and doing wrong again to get out of a jam. At one point, he is described as a man of morality, and there is hope for him. He's not a thug; that would be Ward, the police officer's son who returns to the neighborhood to commit crimes. Helen takes a long time to realize that she isn't entirely blameless in her involvement with Frank. Whether a rape takes place is somewhat ambiguous, but Helen believes this is what happened. Helen is caught in the trap of waiting for nothing, in her own words. Frank looks better and better given the other choices she has. Morris, Helen's father, looks at his mom and pop grocery store as a prison. Morris is a victim, yet if he had made a little effort to help himself, things may have turned out better for him. He is a terrible businessman, he makes foolish decisions about his health, and he is taken advantage of by everyone. The whole family is caught in a trap by the failing store and grinding poverty that has them in a downward spiral. Morris and Ida are Russian Jews who came to America with the hope of finding something better. It appears the only thing that is better is the absence of pogroms. The people in this book are Italians, Germans, Poles, Norwegians. Today the immigrants come from different countries, but I'm willing to bet that quite a few have the same experience in this country that Morris's family did. Today it may even be worse. Aside from the characters, the author gives a wonderful description of a 1950s Brooklyn neighborhood. The reader can picture everything in such detail it's like watching a DVD in one's head. A book like this will always hold up, and I'm anxious to read more of the author's work. Finally, this novel made TIME magazine's Top 100 novels last year, which is why I picked it up."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"The word \\"Assistant\\" includes the letters S.A.I.N.T And, the person who is the assistant herein well reflects Christianity's concepts of sainthood or someone who is \\"born again.\\"A simple ground floor grocery man, Morris Bober, lives in a simple second story flat with his wife, Ida, and beautiful 23-year old daughter, Helen. Business is worsening, and while it falls, he meets Frank Alpine - an Italian goyim.Frank works for peanuts for Morris and manages to raise the business from its ashes. Things begin to look good - but Ida's fears of a goyim living so close to her very Jewish daughter are well deserved.Frank is not a saint by birth. Frank is an orphan who lived an abusive childhood, and he merely wants to be loved. He practically enslaves himself for Morris - partly to be loved and partly for penance. But, whatever his evil ways were, he is almost devoid of the same after meeting Morris. Malamud probably intentionally chose Frank to be Italian - and incorporates what the Roman Catholic Church associates as \\"being born again\\": baptism. Working in the grocery for Morris is Frank's baptism.What makes this book so fascinating is the concept of rebirth after criminality. Really, criminality's born again Christianity became vogue a decade or decades after publication of this novel (1957) with the 1976 book written by Charles Colson of Watergate fame.This insightful work on Christianity becomes even more fascinating when one considers the source - a young Jewish writer who grew up in a delicatessen with an impoverished father who is much like Morris. And, the greatest part of the rebirth arises in the end when Italian Frank - learning about Judaism - converts. He is a born again Jew.The grocery is commonly referred to as a prison which confined Morris and later confines Frank. But, from that prison others benefit. And, most particularly we learn of the goodness of those imprisoned in poverty - something espoused by Saint Francis who is mentioned numerous times in this book.This is a great story. This is a great book with many layers. And, this book could be assigned to religion students as well as the obvious English or literature students."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"If ever there was a verbally-tight book, it is this. Every page is interesting, every word, and there is never a dull page. In true Melamud style, the stories are short but powerful. The superb writing of the plot moves consistently. However, I did get the feeling toward the end that a number of dramatic sequences seemed crammed at the end, and without the minute attention paid to the earlier part of the story.The plot evolves in post-war, a neighborhood in New York among an aging Jewish grocer whose deli/food store business struggles amidst modernism and greedy competition. The main characters, Morris, his stoic wife Ida and a grown daughter Helen live above the store and work long hours to keep it alive. Daughter Helen yearns to have a loving man and an education.Enter Frank Alpine, a young Italian man who after a criminal act upon Morris, and unbeknown to Morris, Frank lands a job in the store to pay his debt. Here, he continuously fends off his demons while attempting to follow a morally correct life and in his command, the store goes through economic and physical changes that fluctuate greatly, not always good or bad. And, as expected, he falls in love with the daughter and their relationship takes turns and twists too.Immediately, Melamud gives us a distinct picture of the desperation the family endures. You can grasp with ease the images and separation of personalities. This is done with precision applied by the finest authors. We get more than we anticipate, when Melamud provides extensive insight into his character descriptions, and most important, to their thoughts. Above that, he provides us with questions and answers we might need to further develop the characters thoughts and actions.After absorption into the story, I still had questions and I'm sure you will too and maybe it takes another read. Overall, the short classic is excellent. ........MzRizz"},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"It's sad to me that Bernard Malamud's novels seem to be falling by the wayside lately. After reading The Assistant recently, I've been reminded of just how excellent Malamud's writing is. In particular, Malamud is excellent in The Assistant, his best novel. This is definitely one of the must-read novels of the twentieth century.The novel centers around the characters affected by Morris Bober's grocery in a poor neighborhood in Brooklyn. The middle-aged Morris has lost his life working in the unsuccessful store. Because of the economic/spiritual struggles caused by the store, each member of the family has been scarred. Morris's wife Ida has become bitter and cynical. His daughter Helen searches longingly for love and laments the failed realization of her dreams. Then, into their lives comes Frank Alpine, a troubled, depressed man who will become the assistant at the store. The four struggle with one another, attempting constantly to overcome their harsh fate and to obtain some sort of fulfillment together.It's a fairly simple story that reads really well, and remarkably quickly, in my opinion. Despite the simplicity of the story, however, meaning, almost archetypal meaning, ebbs at every moment. It's a beautifully conceived and constructed work touching on themes of morality, justice, redemption, and love. It's very much about what it means to be human. The Assistant is definitely one of those novels that serious readers should catch."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"As a teacher of literature for 23 years, I have watched students from age 16 to 80 become fully engaged with The Assistant. After they finish, they feel fulfilled, uplifted, enlightened, and even (God forbid!) more knowledgeable. The main characters -- Morris, a modest Jewish grocery store owner in New York, and Frank, a young Italian hoodlum trying to change into a mensch--steal your heart away. Of course, Malamud is never sentimental. He uses your mind to reach into your heart. It's not just Frank who changes for the better in this book; it's all who read it well."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"It seems impossible, yet somehow Malamud made magic. Here is retold the story of St. Francis of Assisi through the life of a failing Jewish grocer. Allow me to rephrase: the story is not retold, it is taken apart, reapplied and subtly explicated. The life of a Catholic saint applied to the interaction of frustratingly flawed characters leads to a perfect conclusion and examination of, surprisingly, what it means to be Jewish and what it means to be good."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"This is Bernard Malamud's best book. It is written with a kind of understated beauty . The story of Frankie Alpine the assistant who works in the grocery of Morris Bober , and connects himself in suffering with Jewish identity contains the heart of Malamud's 'universalization of his own Jewishness'. The book is a moving story, including the love story between Alpine and the elderly grocer's daughter. Malamud's tender and humane ironic tone informs his warm relation to his characters.One of those rare books which seems to fully make concrete an abstract ideal of human goodness."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"The store of Morris Bober, in twenty-one years, had moved from being a delicatessen to a poor grocery. Bober's wife hoped he would sell the store. Morris had lost many of his customers to a new store in the neighborhood.The harder Morris Bober worked, the less he seemed to have. On the day Bober took in ten dollars he was robbed. The robbers thought he was holding out on them. Afterward he was in bed with a thick bandaged head and his wife tended the store.Frank Alpine appeared in the neighborhood. Frank Alpine worked at Morris's store when Morris was sick. A salesman told Frank that the store was a death tomb and that if he stayed for six months he would be there forever. Storekeepers knew when times were better.With Frank in the store business was better. There were, however, other reasons for the uptick in business and Frank was not all he seemed. He had a history and his motives were mixed. Later the characters underwent various changes of fortune, but Frank's adhesion to Morris's family and enterprise was remarkable.It is not so much the plot, which is serviceable, but the setting of the small failing grocery store that gives the novel its pathos. Furthermore, the means the author uses are strictly realistic touches, culled, it seems, from the facts of his upbringing. Ending on a wave of hope, the novel, at the close, pictures a harmonious world for the characters, briefly. The storytelling is elegant, and the intensity is nearly Russian."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"Morris Bober struggles to keep his independent grocery store open, as new competition drains what little business comes from his run down neighborhood. His troubles are relieved by the arrival of Frank Alpine, a down-and-outer who decides to make good by working for nothing at his store. The blessing of Frank's presence is complicated by his past and by his interest in Morris' daughter, Helen Bober.That would summarize the basic plot of the novel. Yet to say that this is what the book is about would miss most of this book's underlying meaning.To the extent that I can explain it, Bernard Malamud has given Morris some Christ-like qualities. The rest of the characters, in turn, demonstrate some of the responses that people make to the life of Christ.I say \\"to the extent that I can explain it,\\" because I am not a professor, or even a student of theology. I think this is one of those books that would reveal a lot through a second reading, or through the guidance of a professor. My guess is that Frank Alpine, in the context of the New Testament, could be seen as one of the Pharisees. He is always trying to do the right thing -- trying achieve salvation through austere living and devoted work.I feel less certain who Helen represents. I hesitate to speculate here. Nevertheless, I hope that anyone reading this would not take that for a sign that this is not a stimulating novel. I found that the plot compelled me to pick it up. My sense of its meaning, in turn, grew when the book reached its resolution.I suppose many already realize that Bernard Malamud is Jewish. I think that makes the symbolism of this novel even more interesting. Malamud's writing is careful, in the best tradition of realism.I think this book would be incredible for book clubs."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"This book was one of the few I have read that seem to just flow. Trying to pay attention never was a problem and the story continued as necessary. The character development was incredible, as this was an emotionally endearing novel. The reader feels the pain of the Bober family and the anguish of Frank Alpine when he is humiliated time after time. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"back and forth and back and forth. im happy. im sad. happy. sad. love him. dont love him. love him. dont blah. blah blah. we're poor. we're not poor. we're poor.a series of a series of a series of deus ex machinas.malamud's writing style is easy to slip into, and the story is addictive yet annoying (any pulp novel can be addictive).spoilerhe rapes her and and spies on her undressing and it's ok! (no, don't try to sell me any of that oh the author's not giving this his approval, no no no. when there is nothing to contradict something, it's the same as saying it's ok. the same as if someone writes a book where everyone is racist and there is nothing in the book to say that being racist is bad. in this book there is nothing to say that raping someone is bad and that irks me.)"},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"This book was required reading in one of my college lit courses, and I vividly remember turning the pages, eager to see what would happen. I admired the economy of Malamud's writing style, especially since I had to read two very long novels by Saul Bellow for the same class. I thought all the characters in this book were sympathetic: the grocer, the thief/assistant, the daughter, the wife. Each had their own hopes, dreams, fears, desires, all of which crashed against one another in a tiny grocery store in Brooklyn.One thing about this book bothered me: that Malamud had Frank keep repeating the same mistakes over and over, and at times it seemed as if the author didn't know when and where the novel should end. Too many mini climaxes of action aren't as interesting as one major one. I was also bothered by the religious ending: It didn't seem to flow naturally from what came before."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"I read this book in high school. It was my introduction to real modern fiction. Images from this story remain in my mind today. Too bad there isn't a Kindle version of this book.

Malamud traces the immigrant's experience so well that you hate to leave the world he illuminates."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"These are some of the Positive and negative aspects of this book. The Assistant by Bernard Malamud.A positive aspect of the book is that it shows the true life in this novel. Many people who read this book can relate to the events that occured in this book, whether you own a store,or you've been heartbroken because of one's actions.Another positive aspect about the book is that it has detail of every event that occured in this novel. I understood everything entirely as the description of the characters, and the plot was very nicely written.A negative aspect about the book is that Frank can't be trusted at anytime. He just makes wrong and right decisions. Making right decisions as in saving many people in the book and poor decisions as in the actions he made towards Helen.Another negative aspect about the book is it's ending. I liked the book entirely but i was expecting a better ending. It's an interesting novel but i was expecting something more at the end but the book concluded nicely.I feel that many people should read and enjoy this book and get their own thoughts and ideas about it."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"I found this book in a used book store and bought it not knowing anything about the book or its author.

I was also required to read it, so anyone who is reading this review and is also required is probably already thinking that the book is going to be bad, but believe me, once you get into the middle, you want to read more"},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"I learned of Malamud's work when I read a short story of his in a vintage paperpack. Seeking out something more, I found this novel, and, after reading several 'stellar' reviews, bought a copy. Well, I felt initially that the opening of the book was very different from the 'voice' of the short story that compelled me to begin with, but chalked it up to being an entirely different genre and storyline. Long story short [no pun], I found myself treading water to keep afloat within this tale of endless woe, self-pity, indifference, greed, envy, and martyrdom...Yes, that is a mouthfull but I wanted to get it all in there for a comprehensive feel.It astounds me that this novel is spoken of with such praise for being so heartfelt and 'real'. Gritty is one thing, perennial misery, longing and regret is something else. After a while I'll tellya, I got to feeling a bit like a voyeur with a front row seat of characters' thoughts and action s I'd just as soon not know, given the stifling dreariness of it all. And please know that I appreciate a story with all its edginess and mood and needn't be walked through the 'yellow brick road' experience [ie: read A Gesture Life by Chang-Rae Lee--a story that takes you many places that you might not want to go but it is necessary to the whole..] But The Assistant seems to be on a nightmarish wheel that left me glad/grateful/relieved to get off. Even for a vintage urban tale this seems too far flung in one direction, leaving little in the way of balance from a reader perspective.Have never read a book that left me feeling that 'dismal' is underrated...until now."},{"Title":"The assistant","review":"Halfway through &quot;The Assistant&quot; I felt confident enough to make a prediction about its ending. The prediction turned out to be only partly correct, but that is beyond the point. That prediction is at all possible is a sure indication that the author failed to engage me as a reader. Once the prediction is made the book is trapped: if it comes true, then the book is predictable; if it doesn't, then one has the full right to complain about contrived plot twists.Why did I feel confident enough to guess the ending? Because the story is painfully obvious. The story - and the outcome - are evident immediately after the first few pages. A struggling Jewish grocer is robbed, but one of the robbers has a conscience and clandestinely comes back to the store to work off the damage. We aren't told this in these exact words until page fifty or so, but it's obvious as soon as we see the character of Frank Alpine. Here is a character that is engaged in Deep Moral Struggle. Since this is a predictable book, all that is necessary to find out the remainder of the plot is to ask a few questions: Will Frank gather enough self-control to become a decent person (Y/N)? Will the store do better with him around (Y/N)? Will he fall in love with the grocer's daughter (Y/N)? And so on, and so forth. It was with a sinking heart that I guessed the beginnng and the ending, and then beheld the two hundred pages in between. What else could possibly happen? Read on.In those two hundren-odd pages, the book turns into the absolutely sappiest melodrama ever written. To be sure, &quot;The Assistant&quot; lacks a main conflict. Yes, the store is a shambles; yes, these people have been slaving away for nothing; yes, they live in poverty; yes, they're Jews. Those themes almost never surface. Instead, Malamud fills space with the most contrived, cliche mini-conflicts imaginable. I'll leave it up to you to find out what they are, but each of those conflicts is written like it is the end of the world. Of course, it can't be, since there's still 2/3 of the book to go, but the characters gnash and lament like there's no tomorrow anyway. Malamud frantically stitches viewpoint characters, often three times in a single page, to illustrate their grief from all perspectives. Rule #1: the author can only cry &quot;wolf&quot; so many times before it loses punch. It took us four &quot;Scream&quot; movies to get this down. Of course, Malamud predates &quot;Scream&quot;. The book reminds me of a scene from a Simpsons Halloween special, where Homer purchases a birthday present from an occult curio store (shades of Matheson's short story &quot;Prey&quot;). The toy is evil. &quot;That's bad&quot;, Homer replies. But it comes with a free frozen yogurt! &quot;That's good!&quot; The yogurt is also evil. &quot;That's bad.&quot; But it comes with your choice of toppings! &quot;That's good!&quot; The toppings contain potassium benzoate. Homer stares stupidly. &quot;That's bad,&quot; the clerk helps him out.The book wouldn't have been as bad if the characters were more solid. The grocer and his wife are stereotypes: Morris is gruff but forgiving, while Ida is the precursor of every strict Jewish mother that ever was. Frank, on the other hand, is a walking collection of human traits that are only loosely connected. He's street-smart and ruthless, both patient and impatient, a gentleman and an animal, frigid and lustful, caring and obscene, both with and without a conscience. He's so diffuse that the reader cannot identify with him.&quot;The Assistant&quot; cannot choose one of its numerous running themes to center on. It tugs the reader this way and that. Characters fall in love, and break up, and fall in love again. Malamud throws so many things at the reader, that after a while the only effect of reading the book is a dull heartache."},{"Title":"The Physics of Music","review":"I was looking for a book that explained how we got to a 12-tone scale, mostly, world-wide. I'm not sure that question was answered, but it contains a wealth of information, with solid theory, on elements of the musical scale that we take for granted."},{"Title":"Eat, Drink and Sleep Smoke-Free (Headway Books)","review":"My wife and purchased this book as a guide to our March, 2000 trip to England. Many of the listings are out of date due to the rapid changes in restaurant and accomodations businesses. (The book was published in 1995 so the information is about 6 years old.)The listings in the book are almost exclusively vegetarian restaurants so if you have a hankering for something that had a face (as my son's vegan ex-girlfriend put it) you'd do better to call ahead and reserve a table &quot;as far from the smoking area as possible&quot;Thankfully many Londoners and the folks we met on our tours of the countryside have cut back on smoking. There are places where you can expect to get a blast of the nasty (Underground exits, storefronts, and in milling crowds at rush hour). Some of the places really are disappointing (Vendors at the National Home and Garden Show smoked on the arena floor.) The book is silent on these important points.Happily all of the larger hotels I contacted had nonsmoking accomodations. Their numbers can be secured from a website such as www.lastminute.com or other broker.While our trips to the countryside were too few to give a realistic trial of the merits of the book it did seem the author's information might be more accurate once well outside London because things don't change as fast in these areas.In sum, significant decreases in the practice of smoking in public and enclosed places have rendered this 1995 guide well out of date."},{"Title":"Cruise: Identity, Design and Culture","review":"This is an affectionate look at the cruise business, concept and history. I have seen the old stories such as 'An Affair to Remember,' but I had no idea that the idea of cruising went back as far as the 1890's. Nor did I have any idea about the size of the business today. These huge ships remind me of nothing so much as Las Vegas casinos or some of the modern resort hotels. The cruise, like life itself, becomes a journey, not a destination.This book is profusely illustrated with pictures of cruising that cover the whole range of time since the beginning. They start with a reproduction of a poster advertising a pleasure cruise to the West Indies. It was a sixty day cruise. The latest picture which is on the back cover is a 2003 view of the 'Diamond Princess' a ship of 116,000 tons that can carry 2670 passengers.This is a book that I would recommend to anyone thinking of taking a cruise."},{"Title":"The lake people","review":"I enjoyed this book tremendously when I was young, and would recommend it especially for young readers just beginning on chapter books. The simple story of a Danish family spending a summer by a lake is elevated by Berliner's warm prose, and his book maturely addresses subjects not often encountered in childrens' literature- viz., one chapter revolves around how a four-year-old learns about death when she discovers a dead mouse, and another derives a great deal of amusement from a parson's consternation when his young charge asks him how, exactly, Noah fit all of the millions of insects on the Ark. Berliner never talks down to his audience and the characters are uniformly well developed. This book is particularly well-suited for \\"bedtime story\\"-style reading, as there is no grand plot arch, just a common setting and shared characters in each story."},{"Title":"S.O.S: Step With Our Suggestions on Recovery from Addiction and Alcoholism","review":"Why is it called S.O.S. when there is an AA/NA, 12-step alternative fellowship called SOS (Save Our Selves or Secular Organizations for Sobriety) when it is not a subject of the book?

The importance of Cold Warriors, both for scholars of Cold War texts and those of more contemporary texts, lies in its close reading of history and historical literary texts to help the reader understand the link between politics and literature. However, the book's problem lies in its inability to move beyond the rhetoric it exposes.Written by an academic for an academic audience, Clark's book is an attempt to rewrite the history of gender so that readings of other marginalized writers are heard. Clark's book is to be applauded for looking at a source of the problem behind the oppression of women and minority writers and not settling for the seemingly easy answer that the males in this society were not open to these other writers. Her more radical thesis that it was the government and the academic institutions who worked to place the white male as the national subject, the &quot;cold warrior&quot; who was to be the &quot;hyper-male: reasonable, penetrating, vigorous, and healthy,&quot; (25) takes the control away from the males and places it on the bureaucracy. This helps explain how even some men who were writing, such as Hemingway, fell out of favor during this period as well. This careful look at politics and literature is only the beginning of a discussion that could be continued with texts of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century as well.The first couple of chapters do a good job of outlining the background history that will set up her reading of the texts in the later chapters. Chapter one, &quot;The Un-American and the Unreal: Modern Bodies and New Frontiers,&quot; provides an analysis relating to the oversimplified social logic of the postwar era and the gendering of ideologies. Especially of interest is her discussion of the resistance by the wide public concerning the conformity promoted by the Cold War rhetoric that led to a break that still exists today between the public and the intellectual sphere. Clark argues that the efforts of the &quot;Cold War consensus&quot; critics led to the &quot;recolonizing of American cultural history in the name of freedom&quot; (36). Chapter two, &quot;Cold War Modernism and the Crisis of Story,&quot; takes this history and applies to the academics of the time. The literary canon is shown to be defined by Cold War rhetoric that used fear of the Other and the myth of gendered national identity. Women, minority, and revolutionary writers became subversive to academia simply because of the structures of the times.The last four chapters deal with the texts specifically in the context of the times. The in-depth and close attention that she gives to each of these writers is valuable in helping the reader understand some of the issues of the writers during this time period. However, a problem with Clark's book emerges at this point: It participates in the same system it wants to critique without any apologies. Clark choose four authors, a white male, two white women, and one white Jewish man in a study that proposes to answer the questions: &quot;What produced the invisibility of ethnic and racial identities?&quot; and &quot;What accounts for the Cold War silencing of women and nonwhite peoples?&quot; (6) The same question can be turned back onto Clark's book: Where are the nonwhite authors? This is a serious gap in a book that tries to fill in some of America's missing or suppressed history. As a critique there is so much more that Clark could have said, but instead she became too caught up in her own theorizing of authors that best promoted what her writing of history concerned.Another telling problem lies within her continuing use of the warrior construct. The conclusion finds that the &quot;logic of projection and a linearity of historical narrative imposed a rigid framework that put manhood into crisis,&quot; (207) yet Clark then continues to use a key symbol of this logic, the warrior: &quot;The reiterative structures of mixed, recovered, and translated stories may help us to relocate the warrior-within. A return to Theodore Roosevelt or Ernest Hemingway or John Wayne does not necessarily portend a renewal of the old Cold War fables of manliness, I hope I have shown, but rather acknowledgment and recognition.&quot; (207) This reviewer feels that by acknowledging and recognizing the warrior, the rhetoric surrounding the warrior is promoted rather than destroyed. Clark's intent of writing a multicultural study to define how Identity is constructed through politics and literature is hurt by her inability to move beyond the constructed Identity of the warrior from this time period. A renewal of the myth of manliness she may avoid in this book, but she falls short of moving completely away from the rhetoric. So while Clark's latest book succeeds as an in-depth critique of four specific authors during the Cold War, it falls short of being a wide-ranging multicultural critique of the effect government and academic rhetoric has had on the reading of texts that don't conform to the bureaucratic constraints of the times."},{"Title":"Passage of Arms","review":"A humble but enterprising Indian clerk with the dream of owning a bus company accidentally finds out about an abandoned terrorist weapons cache. He carefully and painstakingly sets up their sale through a businessman in Singapore. In the sale process, an American couple on vacation get drawn into the affair, and end up on the firing line between Sumatran factions.Ambler's characters are all beautifully drawn. They are presented, too, with a finely honed sense of humor, and deep understanding of human nature. The carefully constructed plot never ceases to turn, and each new episode is a fresh surprize and delight.I particularly enjoyed the character of Girija Krishnan, who so loved the buses. And General Iskaq, with his pondering of just how to best shock and annoy the British and American consuls. And the Tan family politics. Etc., etc., etc.This book was great fun, and beautifully well written."},{"Title":"Passage of Arms","review":"Eric Ambler made his reputation writing thrillers set in the years immediately before and after the Second World War. He understood the true nature of facism and communism and Ambler placed his stories right in the center of the struggle between good and evil. Fortunately for us, Eric Ambler was able to move beyond the Second World War. During the 1950's, Ambler turned his gaze and considerable talents to the topic of decolonization. Through his stories, Ambler was able to keep current with the big stories and issues of the day.A Passage of Arms was first published in 1959. Southesast Asia was going through difficult times. The French had been kicked out of Indochina and the Americans were just coming in. In Indonesia, tensions were growing between the Communists and Muslem nationalists. The English had just beaten back a Communist insurgency in Malaysia. This is the turbulent world encountered by two would-be American arms dealers who take a break from their cruise around the world.At its essence, 'A Passage of Arms' is a business tale. We follow the passage of a cache of weapons as they travel from the jungles of Malaysia to the port city of Singapore. There are numerous side trips to Hong Kong, Manila and Indonesia. This novel offers great insights into the murky world of arms dealing.Although, while not as sexy as some of his World War Two thrillers, in a 'Passage to Arms', Eric Ambler is at the top of his game. There is a reason why a novel written in 1959 is being reissued in 2004."},{"Title":"Passage of Arms","review":"And by opposing end them.In many respects, Eric Ambler was to the modern British suspense novel what Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett were to the American detective novel. Ambler transformed the suspense novel from a simplistic black and white world of perfect good guys versus nefarious bad guys into a far more realistic world where sometimes the difference between good and evil is not all that great. In a series of books written before World War II Ambler would typically take an unassuming, unsuspecting civilian and immerse him in a world of mystery and intrigue in pre-war Europe. In those books the \`hero' would find himself facing danger at the hands of the German or Italian villains.Once the war ended Ambler's plots reflected a change in the world's political situation. The typical Ambler protagonist now found themselves at odd with other totalitarian forces such as the Soviet bloc such as in his \\"Judgment at Deltchev\\". In addition, Ambler broadened his geographic horizons and set some of his books in post-war Asia. In these instances the plot usually found itself centered on the intrigue that settled around the newly emerging nations of Asia as the old Europe ended its lingering colonial presence. \\"Passage at Arms\\" takes the reader on a \\"mystery tour\\" of Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. Written in 1959, \\"Passage at Arms\\" is a fine example of Ambler's work.The unassuming naif in this case is Greg Nilsen. Greg is a quintessential American tourist circa 1960. He is a solidly middle class businessman, the owner of a small manufacturing concern, who has managed to save up enough time and money to go on a lengthy cruise (on a cargo ship) with his wife Dorothy. Through a curious series of events, set up admirably by Ambler, Greg volunteers to act as a front man for the transportation and sale of a shipment of arms from Malaysia to Indonesia via the free trade zone of Singapore. As one expects in any Ambler book things do not quite go according to plan.The book can be broken down into three distinct parts. In the opening third of the book, Ambler sets the scene. He introduces us to most of the characters (apart from the Nilsen's), introduces the reader to the book's locales, and traces the provenance of the arms that form the basis of the plot. In the second third, we see how Greg Nilsen is baited into taking part in the transaction. Finally, the last third of the book takes Nilsen to a rebel camp in Indonesia where he hopes to receive his payment. It is here that the plot boils over and events race to a typically (for Ambler) provocative conclusion.Two of Ambler's strong points are his ability to set a scene and the strength of his characterizations. For example, Ambler's portrayal of the Indian plantation clerk, Girija Krishnan, living in Malaysia is excellent. Krishnan is the person who \`finds' the arms in question. For Krishnan, the ability to sell the arms will facilitate his dream of buying a bus and starting a transport company. Ambler's character portrayals all \`rang true' to me.I have now read and reviewed ten (10) of Ambler's books so it was no surprise to me that I enjoyed Passage at Arms. Ambler's work has held up remarkably well in my opinion and the story lines still seem fresh even though these books were all written between 50 and 70 years ago. I have very much enjoyed reading Ambler and have no hesitation in recommending Passage at Arms to any reader. Fans of Deighton, Furst, or LeCarre would, I think, be delighted with his books. L. Fleisig"},{"Title":"Passage of Arms","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Passage of Arms. This is the fifth novel that I have read by Eric Ambler and I now understand why Len Deighton, Graham Greene, and John LeCarre give so much credit to Ambler for creating the modern espionage novel.Passage of Arms begins in the port city Kuala Pangkalan in Malaya, moves to Singapore, and then to Sumatra. It is the late 1950s and arms smuggling is a dangerous, high risk business, especially when amateurs become involved. The plot is both interesting and unpredictable. The exotic setting, Southeast Asia in the 1950s, is more threatening than inviting. But perhaps what I actually recall most about Passage of Arms is a unique, intriguing character, Girija Krishnana, a delightfully clever and ambitious clerk of Indian heritage.Girija Krishnan is not the lead character, but he is nonetheless absolutely essential to the storyline in Passage to Arms. His obsessive desire to purchase a passenger bus results in unpredictable, explosive events. I will long remember the entrepreneurial Girija Krishnan.Passage of Arms is a great way to become acquainted with this master of espionage and suspense.Some other Ambler recommendations: Journey into Fear is the story of a Mr. Graham, a highly capable naval ordnance engineer, that becomes unexpectedly the target for assassination by German agents. Graham is no James Bond, and his desperate efforts to escape prove largely ineffective and amateurish.Arthur Abdel Simpson, as the protagonist in The Light of Day, is disagreeable, dishonest, and disreputable. He blames others for his failings, he cheats his clients, and he has served a short sentence for distributing pornographic material. Somehow, as Arthur becomes ensnared in one of his own schemes, I found myself increasingly concerned and sympathetic for his plight.Possibly Eric Ambler's most complex character is Michael Howell in The Levanter. He is a wily businessman intent on sheltering his family's third generation business in Syria from ongoing nationalization efforts by the Baathist Party. Much of the story is told in a first person narrative by Howell. The reader must decide how much of Howell's account is trustworthy."},{"Title":"Passage of Arms","review":"Most Eric Ambler books feature an unlikely protagonist caught up in a danger laden international situation. Passage of Arms can lay claim to two such protagonists.The first is Girija Krishnan, a humble Bengali clerk on a Malayan rubber plantation. Through luck and cunning, he comes into sole possession of a hidden cache of mint condition weapons smuggled into the country from Communist China.The second unlikely protagonist is Greg Nilsen, an American tourist traveling in the Far East with his wife. A victim of his own guilelessness, Greg finds himself functioning as a middleman in the arms trade as the aforementioned weapons cache wends its way into the hands of Indonesian Islamic insurgents.Passage of Arms is a darkly funny novel of international intrigue. Ambler does a wonderful job of describing various Far Eastern locales and the interesting people inhabiting them. Moreover, the ambiguous, byzantine nature of the region's geopolitics circa 1959 comes through loud and clear.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Passage of Arms","review":"More than other thrillers by the master Eric Ambler, PASSAGE OF ARMS shows how deeply we misunderstand other cultures. Here are an Indian clerk in Malay, a international family of Chinese crooks, a Communist warlord, and a reasonably-successful American everyman and his wife on vacation, all acting each according to his very-small partial view of the situation without having any idea of the others' motives, let alone the big picture.One of the other reviewers complained of the story's \\"simplicity\\". In what way is it simpler than say A COFFIN FOR DIMITRIOS? What it has is INEVITABILITY. Like many of Ambler's novels. The characters, and the vivid narration, are always more important than the plots anyway in Ambler, especially now that it's history. Like, well, Hitchcock. Or the movies made from Ramond Chandler's novels."},{"Title":"Passage of Arms","review":"Ambler can take a reasonably banal situation and get us totally ensnared in the complex webs he weaves, and we are living it like we are totally involved. Great."},{"Title":"Passage of Arms","review":"I've read almost all of Eric Ambler's novels, and this is my favorite. The plotting is deft and intricate, with a three-level nested storyline showing how one smuggled shipment of arms affects a variety of people with no other connection to one other. The characters in each -- the enterprising Indian foreman who discovers and sells the weapons, the Chinese brothers who arrange their shipment, and the American couple used as straw buyers -- are drawn so distinctly that you almost forget about the other parts of the book when reading a particular section. The only criticism I can think of is that the finale is a bit drawn out and doesn't provide any particularly interesting resolution; the best parts of the book are the characters and the intricate scheming they engage in. Ambler has some good secondary characters here too -- the dissolute Chinese brother, the apparently lesbian ship's passenger who tags along with the Americans, and the Singaporean police superintendent."},{"Title":"Passage of Arms","review":"Came to know Ambler through reviews on this site. I enjoyed this book and plan on buying more. I'm always pleased to find a new writer who works well in this genre, and although I have spent a lot of time in South East Asia, which may prejudice me somewhat, I have to disagree with the previous reviewer--I was hooked on the story and satisfied at the end. Sure, Ambler is no LeCarre, but then again, who is? Recommended."},{"Title":"Passage of Arms","review":"This is set in post-war colonial Malaysia. A band of terrorists were ambushed and killed near a rubber plantation. The tin mine nearby was long closed. The clerk Krishnan is looking to go into business as a bus owner; but he will need thousands of pounds in capital. Could he find a hidden treasure and profit from this experience? Chapter I tells what happened. Chapter II introduces Mr. Tan, owner of a shipping company, trucks and boats. He knows people and has connections. We meet the American front man in Chapter III, and his wife. Chapter IV tells how to securely handle a business deal: give a postdated check and a receipt for the goods, and receive a promissory note for the amount of the check. This should prevent a double-cross.Chapter V describes tourist life in Singapore. A journalist wants to interview Greg Nilsen, and takes him to lunch. Chapter VI tells of the trip to Indonesia oil country, and a secret meeting. A problem arises. Greg & Dorothy interface with the Indonesian Government in Chapter VII. A raid on the prison occurs in Chapter VIII; Greg and Dorothy are freed as hostages are exchanged. Greg asks advice from Colonel Soames in Chapter IX, and Greg's deal is finalized. Chapter X has a somewhat happy ending for the principals. A new public transport company is started, and Krishnan is the partner-manager.This novel weaves historical facts into an amusing and entertaining story. The moral is that tourists on vacation should not meddle in another country's business or politics."},{"Title":"Internet Communications Using SIP: Delivering VoIP and Multimedia Services with Session Initiation Protocol (Networking Council Series)","review":"I am new to the SIP protocol and thisi book gave me exactly what i was seeking: a comprehensive explanation of the SIP architecture and the uses of SIP.

Even the SIP protocol is not presented fully. Only the major messages are listed with a short description of their use.I was also disappointed by the book organization. The SIP Overview chapter which explains how SIP works is chapter 5. All the preceeding chapters mention SIP before we even know what SIP is. This is most confusing unless you have already some SIP knowledge.The book tries to cover too much. We get a whirlwind tour of many topics, none of them explained appropriately.

It's impossible to give more than a token survey to search, KR, back/forward chaining, fuzzy systems and neural networks in the allocated 200 pages. I feel this was a wasted effort best left to other books (like Russell and Norvig).In contrast to the 200 page intro to AI, there is no primer on Java contained within this book. I feel this is OK since there are also many excellent books on Java. I only mention this to be complete in my review.The real meat of this book is only ~165 pages (chapter 6 through 10). The agent examples are light, but adequate and I feel the concepts come across. Overall, I'm not sure I got my money's worth. I would have liked more discussion of various frameworks and maybe some examples of these. Implementations are lumped together in a hurried review in the last chapter.If you already have some exposure to AI, you might consider a more advanced book.

The UML package diagrams are worthless, and I wish the space had been used for something else -- maybe more background info or a summary of the agents in the chapter. But that is a minor complaint.

The second half of the book is where the author presents his own design and implementation of a Java framework for constructing intelligent agents along with several applications. The author does a good job of showing algorithms in numbered steps, presenting mathematics clearly when applicable - such as in the section on neural networks, and having numerous clear illustrations. There are exercises at the conclusion of each chapter that are unsolved because most of them are programming assignments.Although this book does a good job of describing what an intelligent agent is and then implementing simple examples, you might want to get a more academic text such as \\"Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach\\" for all of the individual algorithm details. These two book should complement each other well as this book is better at painting the big picture of intelligent agents and \\"AI a Modern Approach\\" is more thorough.

They are the prototype of today's special forces, acting as saboteurs behind enemy lines, destroying a Russian crane, as well as performing the less savory tasks of hunting down a band of renegade British army deserters and gathering evidence of a British general's corruption and incompetence. Towards the end of the novel they participate in the attack on Kertch Harbor, but this is the only \\"traditional\\" battle that they see.The author does an excellent job conveying the hopelessness and the futily of the Crimean War--the squalor, the mud, the entrenched lines which cannot be broken, the incompetence of the generals and the waste of lives, as well as descriptions of those Britons who went to Crimea as sightseers, along with servants, picnic baskets, wine, wives and mistresses, to witness the battles. I also like that Kilworth spends time describing the British class system and how it permeated the army (the younger sons of the aristocracy often went into the army as officers; their rank was purchased rather than awarded according to merit), thus keeping the officers forever separated from the men in the ranks and causing a great deal of anomisity on both sides.I also like that the author has taken the time to develop his characters thoroughly. Readers have a good sense of exactly who Fancy Jack is, his strengths and weaknesses both as a soldier and as a human being, his strained relationship with his father, his love and admiration for his half-brother, his complicated relationship with Lavinia Durham (told with plenty of humor), an old flame now married to an officer, his uncertain feelings about his cousin (he comes across as a bit of a nerd), his good relationships with his superior officers (except Pirce-Smith) and with his peloton. The other characters are also fully developed, from the insecure whiner Wynter to the boastful (been everywhere, seen everything, done everything) Gwilliams to Peterson, the woman sharpshooter. They rag on eachother, pick on eachother, squabble just like siblings, yet when they have to operate as a unit, they do so. This unusual blend of war and personal relationships makes this an interesting change from the usual war novels, which tend to focus much more upon the fighting than the soldiers. I shall look for the earlier novels, and look forward to the further adventures of Fancy Jack and his peloton. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Winter Soldiers (Fancy Jack Crossman 4)","review":"Have only read through Chapter Two, but astounded by detail, clarity of plot.historical accuracy, and knowledge obtained from this book i.e. knew thearea of the Balaclava headgear name, but not how it was invented via necessityby a British Soldier from items never intended for the purpose.

Bede has been called \\"the Teacher of the whole Middle Ages,\\" and for good reason (not, incidentally, because of this book in particular; it was not one of his most popular, acclaimed, or copied works, of which the venerable fellow had quite a few. His theological, chronological, and scientific works were among the more popular texts passed around in the century after his death, although quite a few copies of Historia Ecclesiastica do exist as well, which is the one of most interest to modern readers); Bede brought a methodology of documentation, sifting through sources, and synthesizing that served the writing of history well. For a fellow who spent his entire life within the monastic walls, he had quite a grip on what was going on in the world around him."},{"Title":"A History of the English Church and People (Classics)","review":"Fantasic work on Orthodox Christianity in the British Isles! Though Bede himself isn't a huge fan of the Celtic Christians, he does record a number of stories yet fails to every mention Saint Patrick of Ireland! He is a meticulous historian, though, far more than Eusebius of Ceasarea and that is why I trust Bede highly. It is unforunate that he died before completing more work than he did (aside from this, he only did a few works, each one is excellent, though). Throughout the work, Saint Bede constantly reinterates the lessons of the Gospel; kindness to everyone whom you meet, almsgivng, caring for the poor and oppressed, selflessness, poverty, and obedience to God.A must read for anyone who is a serious student of Christian History, or even just Western Europe.I also recommend this for Orthodox Christians. It is all too often that we forget Western Europe was once Orthodox Christian before the Papacy broke away.

It can be sad at parts but in a another way it is a great book!"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"E.B. White has written a wonderful children's book that is very entertaining and equally educational. The length and level of comprehension needed makes it appropriate for ages seven to nine. There are several life lessons the reader can learn throughout the story, which also reflect lessons that the Bible teaches, such as humility and servanthood. While children are being greatly amuzed at this humorous storyline, they are also learning valuable lessons about life, which is why it is unforgettable. The use of personification of the barn animals is the most effective source of humor: the goose cheers for &quot;Wilbur&quot;, who is the pig trying to escape from the barn; the sheep talk as if the farmers are &quot;plotting a murder&quot; to kill &quot;Wilbur&quot;; &quot;Wilbur&quot; does a back twist in the air; and &quot;Charlotte&quot;, who is the talking spider, states that, &quot;People are not as smart as bugs!&quot; It is hillarious! The barn animals are also experiencing human emotions, which help children to relate to them, such as loneliness, anger, satisfaction, joy, and love. It is a roller coaster storyline that keeps children very attentive! Also, equally impressing are the life lessons that White implements throughout the animals' lives. &quot;Wilbur&quot; realizes that what is truly important in life is not that he is the most popular, talented, or best looking, it is the satisfaction of having one true friend to share his life with, who is &quot;Charlotte&quot;. &quot;Wilbur&quot; and &quot;Charlotte's&quot; humility and servanthood create a wonderful friendship. This definitely will teach children to be humble and to treat others as they would want to be treated, while not being too proud or self-seeking like &quot;Templeton&quot;, who is the selfish rat. This is also taught in the Bible, when Jesus states, &quot;For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted&quot; (Luke 14:11). Through &quot;Wilbur&quot; not viewing himself as &quot;terrific&quot;, but still becoming famous and &quot;Charlotte&quot; saving &quot;Wilbur's&quot; life without due recognition, children will learn that being humble and serving others is not always the way the world desires us to act, but it is the most rewarding way to live. White is also very informative about spiders: the seven sections of their legs and how they spin a web, which is very educational. It is very interesting when &quot;Dr. Dorian&quot; states that just a spider's web, even without words inscribed in it, is a miracle. God created every animal and insect, which are true miracles, and it is great that E.B. White points that out. I found no weaknesses throughout this story. This is a book I highly recommend for young children. Through the use of much humor and implementation of valuable character traits that reflect who God wants His children to be, this story is one that children will treasure forever."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"One of my favorites.

Charlotte sets out on a mission to save Wilbur from the fate of many little piggies - the fateful slaughterhouse. In the process a beautiful tale of love, devotion and friendship is spun. The book is not without sadness. To this day, I still wipe away a tear at the end of the book, but when I come across the book on my youngest, grown daughter's bookshelf, there is something about it that keeps bringing me back to read it...just one more time. Even my daughter, who is long past childhood, cannot part with this treasured book and, needless to say, it was read many times over to her children when they were young. Reading it is one of those recaptured, treasured moments of youth that keep us forever young at heart. It is a book most children will forever love and cherish throughout the years."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Charlotte's Web is such a great book. The five reasons why are these.

Third, because I think it is cute how Fern treats Wilbur like a litttle baby.Fourth,I think it's hillarious when the rat gets really fat.Lastly, because Wilbur didn't die as a runt. The five reasons why I dislike this book is because wilbur got taken to Fern's uncles house.Alsop when Charlette died. When the rat started acting like a smarty pants or when when Fern's Dad tried to kill it.I especiaaly hate it when the animals tell Wilbur he's goimg to be dinner.Thoe are all the reasons I like and dislike this book."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"I watched the movie over and over, read and reread the book, and got more out of it each time.

Even though I know each time that I will cry, I can't stop going back to this story again and again. Anthropomorphism can be extremely difficult to pull off, but I enjoy the fact that although the animals experience &quot;human&quot; emotions, they never truly stop acting like the animals they are. The friendship between Charlotte and Wilbur helps to remind us that no matter how differrent we appear on the outside, we all can relate to ne another from what we hold inside.

The characters alone are worth the read. The story envelops the reader and there is a warmth and tenderness about the story that affects all of us, no matter what age we are.The point of Charlotte's Web was avoiding death, or the acting of nature upon the human (or animal). While Charlotte did not escape the ravages of nature - Wilbur did for the length of the story. Wilbur learned a lot about life and children through the adventures he had. Charlotte went through an entire life cycle in the story and perpetuated her existence by having a zillion babies. (round character) Wilbur seemed relatively stable in the story but his presence in the story drove the story as well. (foil?)I hesitate to identify Wilbur as a \\"flat character\\" but maybe I am missing something. The conflicts and actions of the story take place because of him, but he seems to be a innocent bystander and just \\"witness\\" things - not necessarily take part in them largely.Templeton If it was for his own interest, Templeton would help Charlotte or Wilbur, but \\"The rat had no morals, no conscience, no scruples, no consideration, no decency, no milk of rodent kindness, no compunction, no higher feeling, no friendliness, no anything\\" (White, 1952, p.46).

When Wilber realizes he is going to be slaughtered for Christmas dinner, Charlotte says that she is going to save him, and she does.

My 4th grade teacher would read a 1/2 hour to us after lunch every other day, and she chose both E.B.

Felt like a celebrity when I returned to school w/ that book in hand-like George Kennedy's character in Cool Hand Luke with Newman's picture w/ some ladies. I had something everyone else in class wanted. Even got some chocolate milk offers to borrow it! All in all, this book evokes some great memories, not just of the story told, but how such books can form one's life, in this case my desire to read more.

Rather than say what has already been said, I would like to put down here that one of my very favorite parents in all of children's literature is right here in this book: Mr. Arable. In spite of years of hard work (presumably farming,though we are never really told), he had a mind full of magic enough, and a heart full of love enough, that he actually listened to his young daughter; and, in another chapter, repeatedly states that perhaps the animals WERE talking, perhaps Fern WAS telling the truth. In short, though an adult, he had never stopped believing in magic. I love him."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"I read Charlotte's Web as a child, and loved it. Recently I had the pleasure of rereading it with my daughter, taking on a chapter a day. The descriptive phrases E.B. White uses while helping us to fall in love with the characters and their world are wonderful.I will admit I was concerned reading some parts of the story to a 4 year old, whether it be the \\"circle of life\\" comments by Charlotte or the fear of Wilbur being killed. However, I took it slow, answered questions when needed and had no problems. Like myself years ago, my daughter had a tear in her eye at the end.I would definitely recommend this book to others, including adults.

I don't say that lightly: I am a critical reviewer and frequently give two stars to \\"classics.\\" But E.B. White's story about a caring spider and a young pig speaks about humanity as well as any other work of children's fiction.Over the whole book hangs the terrible specter of Wilbur the pig's death. In a remarkable plot shift, Charlotte the spider ends up dying. Her death is surprising and beautiful. We are humbled and emptied by this wonderful creature's passing. But with Charlotte's end comes the ultimate lesson about death: while some die others are born, and they live a life partly assembled by the dead. For a book to tell tiny children such things so well and so compassionately is a real feat. E.B. White, who himself has died, has indeed left behind great life in his wake."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Having a dual form of dyslexia I did not learn to read until later in life.

The easy language (and spattering of pictures in many editions) makes for unintimidating reading for kids just branching out into larger volumes."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"This is the story about the famous pig Wilbur, who was born tiny, but was saved by a little girl, Fern, and later saved by a spider named Charlotte.Fern convinces her dad to let her take care of the tiny baby pig until he is big enough to go back into the barn. After he goes back into the barn, he still needs to be saved from being made into ham and bacon and sausage.I loved the cozy barn life and the animals, and the relationship of Wilbur, Charlotte, Fern, Templeton, the sheep, and the geese.I also loved the fair. I love fairs, so naturally, I loved this part of the book.The first time I read this book was when I was thirteen. Back then, I really loved the book so much, and felt it was perfect and flawless. Since then, I saw bits and pieces of the movie when it came on tv (I'm not a tv or movie watcher).I always knew I would eventually read the book again. I finally did. However, this time, I did not find it perfect and flawless. Although the storyline was still perfect and sweet, there were gross things in this book that did not bother me when I was thirteen. The older I get, the more sensitive I get. It's hard to believe I grew up in a farm/ranch situation and around \\"gross\\" things, but they didn't bother me back then; now I know I could never live on a farm again. That's why one star is missing; while I was reading this book, I couldn't eat or even think about eating - I'm that sensitive to \\"gross\\" things."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"This book was very good it kept me going and I never wanted to stop reading! I was very happy that I picked this book to read. A lot of my friends read this book and they said it was great so then I wanted to go find it and read it and they were right it is a great book! It can be sad at parts but in a another way it is a great book!"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"I liked this because it was exciting. You never knew what would happen next. You had no idea how Charlotte the spider was going to save Wilbur the Pig. I thought it was funny when Wilbur tried to make a web because he was a pig! The author was good at describing things, especially how the air felt when you were on the swing in the barn. You should read this book because it is a love book. Wilbur and Charlotte really stood up for one another. Charlotte saved Wilbur and he saved her egg sac."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"This is a beautiful story which I read when I was about 11 and I have never forgotten the story and it's a book that I never get tired of. It's a story about friendship, hope and love. I strongly recommend it: for children who will learn about friendship, love and hope as well as for adults: who needs a little reminder of what is still present in the world."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"I liked this book very much. I just finished reading it the other day. The book wasn't like most books. I liked it since the very beginning.One day on the Arables farm, some pigs were born. Fern's dad went outside to shoot one of them. Fern begged him not to. So he didn't. Fern told him that she could take care of the runt. She named the runt Wilbur. After a couple of weeks Fern sold the runt to her uncle, Mr. Zuckerman. Charlotte is a spider that comes to the barn cellar. Wilbur was afraid of dying so Charlotte saved him. She wrote one day in her web &quot;Some pig&quot;. Wilbur always fit the words she wrote. In the end one of the characters died. My favorite part was went Wilbur tryed to escape the barn cellar. Lurvy and Mr. Zuckerman caught him though."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"I thought this book was a wonderful book from start. I enjoyed all the characters. This book is jammed full of laughter, sadness, and adventure. This book is about a girl named Fern and a pig named Wilbur, which her father wanted to kill. This pig turns out to be a prize winning pig. My favorite part is when Charlotte puts all of those good things in her web about Wilbur and surprises all of those people. I especially enjoyed the ending mainly when Joy, Aranea, and Nellie, 3 of Charlotte's children, stayed at the barn with Wilbur."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"I don't see why the other review writers didn't like this book.It's great,fantastic,and a must read.I would give the maximum number of stars,no matter how many stars allowed.But there is only 5.It deserves more than 100.More than 1,000.More than 1,000,000! Unlimited! But the endings for these E.B White books are a little sad (especially the one for Stuart Little,see my review on it.)But the good drowns out the sadness.Better than Stuart Little.In fact,I have to say that this is the best of all three books.I also wish there was a fourth book,like there is to Harry Potter,C.S Lewis,and Roald Dahl.The E.B White books rock the world of books!"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"My mother first read this book to me when I was 5 years old. I read it to myself when I was 6. I think that the guidelines suggesting &quot;Charlotte's Web&quot; be for 9-12 year olds should be taken with a hearty grain of salt. The reading level of this book is not at all difficult. The only reason some people might hesitate to give it to a younger child is because Charlotte, the lovely spider, dies near the end of the story. However, death is presented in a beautiful and macrocosmic fashion that allows children to understand it as a part of a greater circle of life."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Charlotte's Web by E.B. White is a wonderful book for a child to read. It emphazizes how a child can also be a care taker just like their own parents. It also stresses the issue of loyalty and honesty, which children should endure at an early age. It also points out that if you are different you can accomplish anything you want. This book is for the reading level of around third graders and is also sure to keep their attention. I recommend this book to children and their families to keep in your book shelf at home."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"As a child Charlotte's Web was read to me. I liked it then and I still like it now, although now I have picked up much more meaning. This touching story of Wilbur the pig not only teaches some important lessons to children (about friendship and love) but it is also a delightful story. I could relate to many of the characters because of the distinct personalities that White gave to each of them. This classic story should be read to or by all children of the world."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"This book was so great.

It is about the unusual friendship between a girl named Fern, a pig, and a spider that takes place on a farm. At the beginning of the story, Fern's dad got a pig and decided to kill it because it is a runt. But Fern requested her dad not to kill the pig and gave it to her, so she could raise it up. She named it, Wilbur. After Fern sold Wilbur to her uncle's farm, Wilbur became alone, he wanted a friend to play with. He is worried that he will become the next slaughter and will be turned into bacon when a sheep told him that he would be killed in the next Christmas. When he almost got killed, he met a spider named Charlotte who saved his life. After they knew each other, Wilbur formed a bond with Charlotte, he followed all the things that Charlotte wanted him to do. Few days later, Charlotte decided to spin a number of different webs that spell out words to describe the pig. These words eventually helped Wilbur to stay alive. In the end, Charlotte became the savior of a barnyard and died happily in the fair. Her friendship with Wilbur is continued through her children, three little spiders. I like how Wilbur and Charlotte met because there had a sentence that really touching my heart. It is said by Charlotte, &quot;I'll be your friend. When you wake up you'll see me.&quot; Also I like how the story ended with Wilbur and the three spiders because it made me feel that friendship is forever."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"wilber a runt who was to be killed for his size is saved by a girl named fern they have a special bond until oneday wilber gets to big and is sent to Mr.Zuckermanns barn with the goose, sheep,etc. but there is somthing there special that is special charlotte the spider the sheep tell wibur the facts of life for a pig that al pigs die (or are in other words killed) at so chalotte (the spider)decides to save wilbers life so Charlotte makes a web that show attractive words such as &quot;radiant&quot;and &quot;some pig&quot; and &quot;Terrific&quot;this attracts alot of excitment and publicity so mr z taked wilber to the county fair."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"If you have just read a deep and serious book and you want to cool down a bit from it than you should read this.

Once you start reading it is is hard to put down. I love animals so I really loved how the story was narrated by animals. This book should have won the Newberry Award, if you ask me."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"While we all know \\"Charlotte's Web\\" to be the all-time best selling children's paperback, it is quite enjoyable to reread as an adult. Most great children's books also seem to appeal to adults. In fact, I believe we all still have a place inside of us filled with child-like wonder, a love for life, and the need to discover something new each day.E.B. White appeals to the playful, mischievous side of our natures. He also takes the side of the children and farm animals, making the story irresistible to children. Fern, the little farm girl in the story, knows all the animals and even tells her mother what they say. Every animal has a unique and interesting personality. You may know some of these personalities in real life: the encourager, the pessimist, the optimist, and even the depressed.The setting is a beautiful farm situated near the woods. One day a litter of piglets brings happiness and anger to Fern's life. When she realizes her father's intention to kill the runt pig, she is horrified. After physically trying to take the ax away from her father, she finally convinces him to allow her to raise the pig.Fern affectionately calls him Wilbur and soon he is quite spoiled. He is not exactly overjoyed when he sold to Fern's uncle, Mr. Homer L. Zuckerman. While living in his new home, he sees Fern less. Lonely and tearful, he turns to the other animals for friendship.One day he meets a goose, she encourages him to break free and nurture his playful side. After being out of the pen for just a short time, everyone on the farm is rushing about trying to get him back into the pen. The illustrations on these pages are quite amusing.Since Wilbur is too young to know the difference, he chooses to go back to the pen, even though the goose encourages him to run for the woods.On his return, the other animals are rather mean to him. Even the old sheep tells him he will be dead by Christmas. Fortunately, he has already made his acquaintance with a delicate voiced spider named Charlotte. She vows to save him from his terrible fate.What happens next is nothing short of a miracle. You will see what a good friend even a spider can be. This is a story about love, friendship and how to enjoy the simple things in life. The end of the story also shows how Wilbur repays Charlotte's friendship.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"This is the story of Fern, a young girl who befriends the animals on her uncles farm, Wilbur, her adorable talking pig, and Charlotte, a talented spider who wants to save Wilbur from becoming the main course at a dinner. The animals in the story all can talk to each other. Fern is the only one who can understand what they are saying. Fern spends all her time at the farm and her parents begin to worry. The book is also about growing up. Fern changes from a little girl who talks to animals to a young women who undertands more. The book is filled with humorous scenes and many memorable characters such the geese and Charlotte herself. Charlotte uses words she finds to spin in her web. The words all say something amazing or good about Wilbur and many people come to see him. Wilbur becomes so famous that he is saved and the story ends happily the way story books should.

That was a horrible ending, and way too obvious, couldn't be any more predictable. If she absolutely had to die, there shouldn't have been all those prior hints, it was just too much. I mean, is there anyone who didn't cry upon her death when they read this book as a child? You can't not cry. It's heartbreaking to the little kid reading the book that their favorite character is dead. Charlotte symbolizes that adult in everyone's life that they unconditionally love, and NO, this is not a good way to introduce death to children, it's traumatic.But um...other than that random rant, great book.

She names him Wilbur. She plays with him and feeds him from a bottle, but after about six months, Wilbur is to big for Fern to care for him, so she has to give Wilbur away to her uncle, Mr. Zuckerman, who lives on a farm. Wilbur is very lonely until a spider named Charlotte befriends him. One day, a sheep tells Wilbur that Mr. Zuckerman will eventually kill him for the holidays to eat.

Her father agrees and lets her raise it. She names him Wilbur. Once Wilbur is bigger he moves to Mr. Zuckerman's barn where Fern sometimes visits him. Wilbur is lonely in the new barn until Charlotte, a friendly spider, introduces herself. They become true friends. When an old sheep tells Wilbur the farmer is going to butcher him, Charlotte promises to save Wilbur.

Templeton, the rat, is greedy, and grumpy. The geese are funny and they love to repeat themselves. The old sheep is very wise. Charlotte is good at making speeches and kind-hearted. And Wilbur is humble and emotional. But the book isn't just about the animals, it's about Fern and the other children too. All of the characters are interesting to read about.This book was perfect for reading while I was studying cycles in school because it has so many different cycles in it.

Last week, when I tried to organize my books. I accidentally found &quot;Charlotte's Web&quot;. I began reading this book again and quickly finish within 2 days. The relationship between Wilber and Charlotte would be a good lesson for children. Without the help from Charlotte, WIlber would definitely be killed and even finally it was a little bit sad, but it is the way of life. I wouldn't go for the detail of the story, you should read it yourself. This book is beautifully written and easy to understand. Other animals in the farm also made the story sometimes funny. It will give a lot of imagination for children. By the way I'm now 27 but still enjoy this such wonderful story."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Charlotte's Web was checked out of my grade school library many times by a classmate of mine that I considered &quot;dumb&quot;. I thought &quot;If SHE likes it, then I surely wouldn't. So I never checked it out. When my own child brought it home as a part of a third grade assignment, I decided to read it. The surprise of my life! It turned out to be the most wonderful book! The subtle nuances of humor are missed by children,even though they love the book, too. The way the author transforms everyday farm-life into interesting tidbits of information (including the actual contents of Wilbur's feeding trough) is nothing short of ingenius. The way he makes you feel for the lovable Wilbur--I love the way Wilbur asks Charlotte, &quot;How is your plan coming? (for saving his life) I'd be happy to help with the plan in any way that I can.&quot; Naturally, he would like to see the plan move along, for saving his life, but the way in which he offers his help is adorable! The emotions, the characters of the animals (goose, sheep, and of course, Templeton) all combine to make Charlotte's Web a one-of-a-kind masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"I'm sharing this review with the intention of being particularly helpful to parents of toddlers and preschoolers. I found that having a very young child with the attention span to sit through chapters of a novel left me scrambling a bit to find novels that were appropriate in theme and content for her age. I am reviewing each novel we have read or tried in the hopes of being helpful to other parents in the same situation.Charlotte's Web by EB White was the second novel we read, and we selected it for two reasons. First, it was already on our bookshelf, and second, an area park was planning to host the live-action movie, projected outside for a picnic-under-the-stars movie experience. I thought the second sounded really fun, and having seen the live action version, I thought my daughter would really enjoy it.It was a bit of a gamble starting this one primarily because it tackles the concept of death, and a young three year old might not handle that well. But, knowing her as I do, I decided to try it on, and see how she responded. I decided that I'm not opposed to altering the story if I felt it necessary. Though I'm generally opposed to censorship, I feel this is fine, as I do not intend to keep ideas from her, merely gauge when she is ready for them. Regarding death, I felt that to some extent she had already been exposed to insect death, and that animal death is a natural extension of that idea. So, after noting the possible red-flags this novel brought with it, we began reading.My daughter fell in love with this story. She considers it Fern's story, which I find interesting. The novel begins with Fern, and she is Wilbur's first advocate. I think she liked the idea of a pig all wrapped up in a baby blanket, in a doll's carriage, drinking milk from a bottle. I think she liked to experience being a caregiver vicariously through Fern. I saw confusion and shock flash across her face during the early scene when Fern rescued Wilbur from an early death. I think to some extent, Fern won my daughter's devotion in that early scene. Like Fern, the idea that this baby pig should be killed because it was small, was not only foreign but definitely wrong. It was neat to see her draw that conclusion, and empathize with a character on the basis of emotion and moral righteousness. In that passage, I knew we'd done right to select this book, and that it gave her the gift of literature in a way that previous reading hadn't. It gave her books as a vehicle for examining ideas and drawing conclusions, as a means of experiencing difficult situations without actually having to live them.She very much enjoyed the antics of Charlotte, Wilbur, and Templeton. She was a quiet listener, so that often times I wondered if she was fully engaged, and was surprised to find upon questioning that she was definitely fully with me. I was surprised by how well she kept with the story, not growing bored when we covered long passages about the wind blowing through the trees and the seasons changing on the the farm. I'd have predicted that she would need the clever antics to keep her interest up, but she was a rapt audience for the entirety of the book.In the end, we took Charlotte's death on headlong, not editing or softening the blow. I felt the whole book had prepared for it, and to leave it out or soften it in the end would have made the preparation excessive. White was very wise in his handling of the story. It is very much an introduction to the idea of death, and he puts out early the idea that Wilbur may die, an idea his audience is not equipped to handle. Still, he prepares the audience for it, never lying. Never promising that it won't become a reality, presenting hope alongside the reality of death, and leaving the reader to know that those are what we have: the certainty of ultimate death, and hope in the face of it. And I love that he didn't chicken out. He didn't give us Wilbur, the victor over death and a means to avoid dealing with death as a certainty. He gave us Wilbur, saved from the slaughterhouse and free to live as full a life as any of us. And he gave us Charlotte, whose complete life came to it's natural end in this book. In doing so, he asks the reader to explore the idea of death and of the life-cycle, without giving them a free-pass. He is honest about it, and I respect that. He recognized that children weren't ready to say good-bye to Wilbur, and most especially not at the hand of humans and not by choice, but that he had prepared them for the idea of death and a natural death could be more easily accepted and understood. And so, Charlotte dies, and Wilbur lives to die another day, and my daughter begins to explore this idea and to decide for herself what it means to have a life.Lots of questions accompanied this book, and followed it. Why do the people want to kill Wilbur? Why do we eat animals? Why does Charlotte not want Wilbur to die? Why did the farmer decide not to kill Wilbur? Why did Charlotte die? Do people also die? Will I die? Will you die when I die? What will happen after I die? When will I die? When will you die? Are Charlotte's babies sad because they don't have a mommy? And so on. And they are all important questions and I thank EB White for giving them to my daughter in such a gentle and loving way and allowing us to experience them together."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Charlotte's web is a great story to read! I enjoy reading it! I think the author named it Charlotte's web because Charlotte saved Wilbur's life by using her web. If I was Wilbur, I would be happy to have a friend like Charlotte because she was a true friend. I think Wilbur is a lucky pig!"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"The book is called Charlotte\`s Web. It\`s about a pig name Wilber who almost died at birth, but was saved. Now Wilbur lives in the Zuckerman\`s barn and he made some new animal friends and a spider, named Charlotte. Charlotte helps him in anyway she can so that he can be safe and happy.What I enjoyed about the book was that some parts of the book were sad and happy. It was happy when he became friend with Charlotte and she helped him. It was sad was when Charlotte had eggs and a few days later she died; and did not get to see her baby spiders.Other people should read this book because it\`s a good book about a pig and a spider who help and care for each other along the way."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Summary: Wilber, the runt of the pig liter, is saved from death by a little girl named Fern. Fern convinces her father to let her raise the pig herself with a bottle. She feels that even though he is a runt, he still deserves a chance to live like everyone else. Fern is successful in her attempts, and when Wilber is big and strong enough, she sells him to her Uncle. On her Uncle's farm, Wilbur will be properly fed and Fern will also have the opportunity to visit regularly. After Wilber is sent to his new home, he misses Fern and is lonely. This is when Wilber befriends Charlotte, a large grey spider who lives in the rafters of Wilber's barn. Throughout the story, Charlotte and Wilber build a strong friendship together. Wilber becomes devastated and frightened when he finds out his ultimate fate as a pig on a farm; to be killed and eaten in the fall. He turns to Charlotte for help, who promises to save him from being killed. Charlotte decides in order to save Wilbur, she will spin a web that reads \\"Some Pig\\". Charlotte's plan works, her web is seen as a miracle and everyone believes that Wilber is no ordinary pig. People travel from all over to see Wilber. With help from Templeton, a rat who also lives in the barn, Charlotte is able to think of more words to spin into her web to convince everyone of Wilber's greatness so that he will not be killed. She spins the word \\"Terrific\\", \\"Radiant\\", and finally the word \\"Humble\\". Wilber ends up winning a prize at the fair because everyone has been convinced that Wilber is an extraordinary pig. Charlotte was successful in saving Wilber's life. At the end Charlotte passes away from old age. Wilber is able to take her pouch of eggs back to the barn, and carefully watch until all of her babies hatch, continuing on his best friend's legacy.Evaluation: This classic children's novel received a Newberry Honor in 1953. Charlotte's Web teaches children many different important lessons through its ingenious well-rounded characters and superbly composed fast-moving plot. It is amusing, somber, and touching all at the same time. It is a transitional level book, with shorter chapters, therefore it is appropriate for beginning readers to read on their own. It is also suitable for a teacher to read aloud to his or her class.A child is able to take away many lessons from reading Charlotte's Web. The most obvious lesson that children can learn from the book is the importance of friendship. Charlotte teaches Wilbur what it is like to have a friend. Before Charlotte, Wilbur was lonely and had no one to talk to. The book also teaches children about loyalty. Charlotte is loyal to Wilbur until the end when she dies. Even though she knows she must lay her eggs, she still accompanies Wilbur to the fair to support him and give him confidence. She wants to keep the promise she originally gave to Wilbur; that she would save him from being killed. Finally, the story contains many examples of farm life, animals, seasons, and growing up.There are minimal illustrations within the book. These simple black and white drawings help the reader to create more elaborate images within their own head while they continue to read.One of the most interesting aspects of this book is the sophisticated vocabulary used by Charlotte throughout the story. Throughout the book, Charlotte uses complex words that Wilbur does not understand. He then asks her to define the word, which she does, helping him to comprehend the meaning. This offers children a creative opportunity to learn many new words that they may have never encountered before."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Charlotte's Web is a terrific book to use when your child is ready for read-aloud novels.

The first time I read this book I was in first grade and I liked it, but it was only when I just recently read it again that I realized how good it really is. This book, through its simple plot, reminded me a lot about how selfless some people are and also about growing up.

Wilbur later is put into the fair and wins many rewards and he lives a happy life.The two main settings of this book are located on a farm and at the fair. These settings teach children about life somewhere other than the city. Also, the book teaches us about love and friendship, and the importance of having a relationship like the one between Wilbur and Charlotte. This is an excellent book and directs people while young into a loving and caring life."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"I remember when I was in the fourth grade, my teacher would read to us when we would come in from recess. She would read us chapter books. One of the books that she read to us was Charlotte's Web. I loved that book in the fourth grade. So, imagine my excitement when my children's lit teacher(in college) told the class that one of the books we were going to discuss would be Charlotte's Web. It was a great pleasure to read this book again. I feel the same about it now as I did in the fourth grade. I think the thing that pulls you in is that Wilbur is the &quot;runt&quot; and you just can't help but fall head over heels for the little guy. This is the kind of book that you don't want to put down. I really felt like I was right there on the farm with the family.

Please order Charlotte's Web."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"For many a literary child, \\"Charlotte's Web\\" is the first sad book they read. It is an early reader story that looks death straight in the eye without blinking or making up wild stories. It is honest and pure and the best kind of book for adults or children and I love it very much.The plot begins with the best possible opening sentence:\\"Where's Papa going with that ax?\\", said Fern to her mother as they were setting the table for breakfast.Papa is, of course, going out to kill Wilbur the runt piglet. Saving him from this fate, Fern takes a personal interest in the pig, raising him by hand until he is bought by her uncle. On the farm, Wilbur makes the acquaintance of Charlotte A. Cavatica, a beautiful kind spider. The two grow to become good friends, and it is through Charlotte's cunning that she finds a way to ultimately save Wilbur from becoming bacon for breakfast The book not only gives sympathy to pigs as adorable little creatures (as back-flipping Wilbur, helped by Garth Williams's illustrations, most certainly is) but also to spiders as well. Charlotte is beautifully written. A perfect lady with an amazing vocabulary, she is the height of poise and good manners. The grand dame of the barnyard. E.B. White brilliantly captures emotions that all children can identify with. Loneliness, fear, friendship, and love. The story is simple, but undoubtedly White's best.Disney approached White about animating \\"Charlotte's Web\\", an offer White adamantly refused. Years later the film was animated instead by a studio that was not Disney, making a truly terrible movie out of a pretty spectacular book. This is for the best, though. Had Disney succeeded in getting the rights, we would probably be remembering the movie and not the book (much as when we think of Mary Poppins we forget it was once a story). Hence, \\"Charlotte's Web\\" remains a masterpiece. A quiet lovable masterpiece."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Charlotte's Web by E.B. White is a fascinating book. The story takes place in a barn. There is a gentle and kind girl named Fern who meets a pig named Wilbur, who is sensitive and tries to help everyone out.

White's career brought him much fame. Before he started writing books he became a writer for the New Yorker Magazine. In 1945 White published his stories into books.

It taught us that life has hard times, but don't worry about all the bad things in life, focus and live your life to the fullest, and never let anything bring you down. The story of \\"Charlotte's Web\\", was about a little pig, that was born a runt. The girl, Fern, would not allow her father to kill the little pig, and she promised to care and love for the pig. She named him Wilbur. Then once the pig was old enough, her father said that he must be given away, so they decided to give it to her uncle, who lived just down the road. She visited him every day, and she also became friends with all of the other animals on the farm. On this farm there was a spider, named Charlotte. She became Wilbur's best friend. Later in the story, Fern's uncle decided to enter Wilbur in the state fair, and he won second place. At the fair, Charlotte made an egg sack, but then, after it was done, she passed away, and from then on Wilbur watched over her eggs, until one summer day, they hatched. There was about 300 hundred spiders, but all of them started to float away.

What therapy!Filled with wonderful lessons on life and a fragile yet potent sense of hope, Charlotte's Web is one of the real literary gifts of the last century.

The book takes you away and puts you in the shoes of a young pig named Wilbur who is trying to survive without being made into bacon. With a little help from his friends, Wilbur is able to become &quot;some pig&quot; and surely impress all those who came to see him. I would definately reccomend this book to any young child who is starting to read well and loves animals! It is a great book for a person to read at any age."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Charlotte and Wilbur are two of the best characters in Children's books. E.B. White is so good at making memorable characters and these 2 are probably his best. The story is mainly about the friendship between the pig and the spider as well as other friendships.

White, this book tells the tale of a young pig named Wilbur who befriends a spider named Charlotte and their many adventures together. It's a story that children will love due to its timeless, but engaging subject matter.There's a lot of fun to be had in this book. I constantly found myself smiling at the wonderful light-hearted humor throughout the book. The prose is as crisp as any book I've ever read and paints a very vivid image of a rural Mid-western American setting. Although not as epic as The Wizard of Oz, Charlotte's Web is a masterpiece of storytelling in its own right. The ending to this book is downright unforgettable and utterly moving.I would recommend this book to any child, if not for its sheer entertainment value, then at least for its strong moral message. Truly, they don't write books like this anymore. It's a good thing we have Charlotte's Web to remind us of the good ol' days when entertainment for children was void of blood, sex, and mindless violence. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the children's books being produced today."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"This is a timeless coming of age story and an all time classic good read. Farmgirl Fern saves the pig Wilbur, the runt of the litter. She raises him like one of the family as much as possible. Wilbur is horrified, afraid and lonely when he's sold to Fern's uncle. To help him through this difficult time, Charlotte the spider becomes his friend and undertakes the writing challenges of her life when she spins words into her web to help save Wilbur's life. Meanwhile, Fern is growing up, becoming interested in boys and spending less time with Wilbur. Wilbur is taken to compete at the county fair and Charlotte goes along, even though it's the twilight of her life. She gives her all for Wilbur at the fair and in return, Wilbur saves her egg sac and takes it back to the farm with him upon her death. The next spring the little spiders hatch and begin to leave and Wilbur, who desperately misses Charlotte, believes he's destined to be alone. However, three of Charlotte's offspring decide to stay at the farm with Wilbur, insuring that he will have friends in the future. Wilbur welcomes them to the farm and tells the baby spiders about their mother and her legacy.Along with the main characters, there's a cast of additional farm animals that help move the story along.

I found it almost unbearably sad, yet I have often returned to it and read it again and again. I think it is one of the wisest and most imaginative children's books I have ever come across, and it teaches us all some of the most enduring and universal human lessons. And yet, it is amusing, filled with animated characters, human and animal, who exist in a simple yet fanciful world.

I must say that I was not disappointed. Charlotte a spider, befriends Wilbur, a pig, and so begins a tragic, touching, and entertaining story. Charlotte takes on the role of a mother figure to Wilbur. This is demonstrated by the writer for instance when Charlotte explains long and difficult words to Wilbur, reinforcing her mother image while at the same time enlightening the reader. The animals are anthropomorphic, and White puts a lot of effort into describing the personalities of the main characters. We are encouraged to feel like they are our closest friends, which makes the tragedy of the ending all the greater. Charlotte reminds me of my best friend when I was a child, and I could compare all of the other characters to someone I have known at some time. This is a tool which the writers of soap operas use to draw you in, as is the cliff-hanger which we find at the end of a chapter. Don't take this the wrong way however, the writing in this book is far superior to that of Sunset Beach, and you can quote me on that. I heard it said recently, I wish I could remember by whom, that when you read a good book, it becomes a part of who you are. The words on the Charlotte's web, Some Pig, will always remain a part of me."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"This recording is not to be missed (not to mention the book itself).

As co-author (with William Strunk, Jr.) of the best known grammar text in English, The Elements of Style, Elwyn Brooks White knew a thing or two about writing. With apologies to Stuart Little and Strunk & White, Charlotte's Web is not only E.B. White's masterpiece, it is one of the World's Great Works. Winner of the Laura Ingolls Wilder Medal and a Newbery Honor Book, it deserves a place on the shelf beside Tom Sawyer and Treasure Island and Little Women. Eudora Welty wrote \\"As a piece of work it is just about perfect, and just about magical in the way it is done.\\"White, indeed, shows us. He shows us Fern, a pre-adolescent girl living on a farm, full of youthful idealism, intervening just before her father sends a newborn pig to the great beyond because he is a runt. He shows us that Wilbur the Pig was worth saving, because he is a kind-hearted soul, a friend to all. He shows us selfishness in the rat Templeton. Best of all, he shows us Charlotte, one of the most noble characters ever written, who decides to dedicate her life to the saving of Wilbur, because after the runt pig is spared from his near execution, he goes to Uncle Homer Zuckerman's farm and learns the *reason* pigs are kept. The method Charlotte uses to spare Wilbur from slaughter is wondrous.Zuckerman's farm is populated with other memorable characters - cows and horses and gabbing geese and the rat, Templeton.The story is full of wonder and several times we feel real peril. The ending is both a triumph and bittersweet at a level that feels intense. Let's just say my first real lesson about loss came from Charlotte's Web, and the paragraph where that happens never fails to bring real tears to my eyes.My wife and I are both readers and whilst still in the full bloom of love agreed that one of our activities would be reading books to one another. \\"What book should we start with?\\" we pondered aloud, then simultaneously we both blurted out \\"Charlotte's Web!\\"This isn't just a good book.

New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 1980.Rollin, Lucy. \\"The Reproduction of Mothering in Charlotte's Web.\\" Children's Literature. 18 (1990): 42-52.In Charlotte's Web, the author reflects on a little runt pig who would lose his life but for the intervention of a little girl. Although the little girl, Fern, saves the runt, Wilbur, he later faces the death of Charlotte. Fern raises Wilbur, but she later sells him to her Uncle Homer. While at Uncle Homer's farm, Wilbur meets Templeton, Charlotte, and a lot of others. Wilbur finds out that he is to be killed and made into ham and bacon. With the help of Charlotte and Templeton, he will not become anyone's meal.Charlotte's Web defines what mothering should be and what one needs to become a successful mother. Garth Williams, the illustrator of Charlotte's Web, uses detailed illustrations and imagery to convey messages about mothering in this novel. According to Lucy Rollin in her article, \\"The Reproduction of Mothering in Charlotte's Web,\\" \\"Mothering in our culture is part of an economic system that contributes to sexual inequality and that relies above all on internalized gender distinctions\\" (Rollin 42). Throughout this novel, White uses Wilbur to suggest that males are as capable of mothering as females are.The first example of mothering appears at the beginning of the book. When Fern finds out that her father is about to kill the little runt pig, she pleads for Wilbur's life. Fern cries, \\"But it's unfair. The pig could not help being small, could it?\\" (White 3). The illustration shows Fern tussling, with her father trying to keep him from killing the runt. Fern takes the responsibility of raising the runt, which she names Wilbur. Fern takes care of Wilbur every day. She feeds him in the mornings, goes to school, and comes back home to care for him. One illustration shows Fern cradling Wilbur in her arms and feeding him like an infant. Rollin states, \\"Feeding and touch are the utmost importance in mothering\\" (Rollin 43).Later when the Arables send Wilbur to Uncle Homer's farm, Wilbur feels sad because of Fern's absence. In Chapter 3, the narrator says, \\"He didn't feel like going to sleep, he didn't feel like digging, he was tired of standing still, tired of laying down\\" (White 16). Fern visits Wilbur, but as time goes by, she begins to visit him less frequently. After a time, Wilbur meets Charlotte, who displays a form of mothering, although not in the same form as Fern. Rollin states, \\"She accomplishes her mothering solely through language\\" (44). Charlotte's mothering differs from Fern's because Charlotte's impact on Wilbur is more of a hands-off approach. For example, when Wilbur feels lonely and sad, Charlotte touches him with her words of encouragement. This relates to Rollin's quote about touch being important in mothering. When Charlotte finds out that Wilbur is going to be killed, she gives advice, encouragement, and promises to find a way to save his life. She uses her web to weave complimentary words about Wilbur. Templeton helps by finding papers with words on them to assist Charlotte in carrying out her plans. Charlotte describes Wilbur as \\"some pig,\\" \\"terrific,\\" \\"radiant,\\" and \\"humble.\\" This makes everyone think about Wilbur's greatness. Charlotte's plan saves Wilbur's life.Finally, at the book's end, Wilbur finds out that he is going to the fair to win the prize, to which he promptly asks Charlotte to accompany him. Charlotte tells Wilbur that she might not be able to go because it is nearly time for her to make her egg sac. In Chapter 16, Wilbur goes to the fair with his companions, Charlotte and Templeton. At the fair, Templeton goes out and finds a word, and then Charlotte weaves a web. Afterwards, she lays her eggs. Charlotte tells Wilbur that she is going to die soon. Wilbur is sad, but he takes the responsibility of taking care of Charlotte's eggs. He asks Templeton to climb up and retrieve the egg sac. Templeton refuses to do so until he gets something in return. Wilbur sacrifices his food for Templeton to get the egg sac. Templeton gives Wilbur the egg sac, and then Wilbur carries the egg sac back to the farm in his mouth. The mothering role shifts gender because Charlotte charges Wilbur with the responsibility of mothering her eggs through the winter. Wilbur monitors the eggs every day until they hatch. After they hatch, he takes the responsibility of caring for them. \\"Wilbur's mothering differs from the females. He does name the spiders as Fern named him, and he mothers with words as Charlotte did,\\" states Rollin (46). Wilbur's mothering differs from Fern's because she wants the responsibility of loving and raising Wilbur. In contrast, Wilbur only takes responsibility for Charlotte's eggs because of her death. Wilbur's mothering differs from Charlotte because she reproduces the eggs, while Wilbur only takes part in watching over the eggs. Despite Wilbur's differences in mothering and gender distinction, mothering was the only role he played in this book."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"I like this book because its petty funny and charming. It tells a story about a young girl and her compassion for a little baby pig. She ends up falling in love with the pig and no matter what, she wont give the pig up. I think that is pretty cool and that why I choose this book to read. I would reccomend this book to other children especially if their younger.The best part about this book is when Charlotte makes the words in her web. She saves the pig because everyone thinks the pig is amazing. Then he satrts getting alot of attention and the towns people want the pig to go to the fair and show off its extrodinary talent. The worst part about the book is when Charlotte dies. I never thought she would and it was all for Wibur.I really like the setting because its a country setting and I can imagine a pig and a girl and a spider all on a farm sittig around and talking about how their going to help the pig. I think that the setting is the perfect place for the book. The it switches to the fair setting and I can get a really good picture of a country fair in mind. I also enjoyed the conflict and the resolution. I mean, I thinks it cool that a little girl wants a pig as a pet and that she dont want Wibur to die because her heart is so big. The resolutioin of the story was also very good because the spider gave up her life to save Wilbur from dying and I thought that was pretty cool too."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS GREAT .

However, just yesterday I finally obtained a fair secondhand copy at a garage sale, and now I can present to you a new favourite from our shelves.Just because a book is made into a movie doesn't mean that the book is made redundant. How many times have you come away from a film saying, \\"The book was better\\"?Charlotte's Web is one of those books. Don't spoil it by showing the movie to your kids. Read them the book instead, and then let them read the book too.In reading this to my girls, there were several specific things that reminded me why Charlotte's Web is exceptional. The novel contains a nice range of characters with different personalities and voices. This makes it a lot of fun to read aloud (if you like \\"doing\\" voices), and there weren't too many to complicate things.I found it helpful to read the dialogue in which Charlotte would explain real words to Wilbur the pig. This saved me the trouble of explaining the new vocabulary to the girls. These little lessons were woven into the story so neatly.I also liked the educational aspect of the book. The kids heard about how a farm works, learned about the life cycle of a spider and the truth about what happens to those cute animals on the farm.This book introduces some dark themes without going overboard -- death, grief, loss -- as well as the more positive themes of maturity (Fern growing interested in boys), friendship and loyalty. We don't eat pork much, so I'm not sure if Charlotte's Web would put your children off their meat, but mine weren't affected.We got this book out of the library. Our version contained a bit of colour in the original illustrations, which added to its charm. Charlotte's Web is a good introduction to chapter books for children aged five and over. (I managed to keep Brioni at my side, but only just!)There's a reason it's a classic, and that reason is why you should have it on your shelves too.Read the full review (with illustrations) on Sparkling Adventures: [...]"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"A classic story of friends helping friends.The shy pig Wilbur befriends the smart and wise spider Charlotte.

White's classic novel was always one of my favorite books growing up. And today it remains one of my all-time favorites! I still can identify with Wilbur the charismatic pig, since I have been privileged enough to have many spiders as roommates. This book is probably especially meaningful to me, as an animal communicator, because it involves so many different animals trying to live and survive together on the farm.This is a wonderful book for young children, growing up, because it teaches them about their own self-worth in a busy world. It also teaches us about the value of lives, how short they can be, and how much we can make of them. Charlotte saves Wilbur by spinning words in her webs, using her short life to benefit his life and the lives of others.Harmony,Janet Roper"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"We bought these two books for our daughter's fourth grade class.

It reminds us that we live in a world more fascinating than it seems on the surface. And it shows students the power that a simple story can have. My students learn that you don't need demolition and highway chase scenes to be moved by a book. For years, they have always been amused when I tell them before we get through this book, we'll be crying. Often it's me. Sometimes it's by page three. But it never fails to happen. Several years ago, NPR ran a story about the recording sessions that led to this CD. &quot;Andy&quot; White sat in his barn in Maine to read his own book. He himself could not get through the last few chapters without breaking down. The sound crew offered to come back and try it some other time, but White insisted in stating in the barn, and trying until he could do it. So I'm vindicated in the eyes of my students.

Wilbur was the runt of the pigs and ferns father wanted to shoot him. Fern was not going to let that happen. She raised Wilbur and fell in love with him. Wilbur was extremely talented and got along very well with all the animals. I loved how in the book it shows the relationship Wilbur has with all of the animals. It teaches children to adore animals. Not many chapter books have illustrations in them and this one does! It gives the children something to picture as well as something to keep their attention at! 5 stars for this book for sure!"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"I used this as a read aloud in my classroom & it was great for the author to be reading the story to the children."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"I'm so glad to purchase this book for a great price.

Sometimes, when I go back and read a \\"classic\\" I'm left scratching my head as to why anyone, let alone nearly everyone, thought it was so great. Not this time. The writing was wonderful and funny and adorable and perfect. I can't say the same for all the details of the story, but a perfect story isn't much of a story after all. And because it's a children's story, I can see the lessons and character flaws are necessary. The best children's books are those that adults can read time after time without wanting to bash their heads in.

Charlotte's Web is a fun and enjoying way to read about the love one girl has and how this love can save one little pigs life. E.B. White has a setup of characters that come from reality but have a fantasy twist about them. All the farm animals can speak, giving the story a humorous format. The story shows how growth and maturity can come from ones actions throughout life. A strong sense of giving and community can be seen in the actions of all those involved. Selflessness is actually a very reoccurring theme as well as love and caring. The idea of the life cycle can be identified as well and the grade level is an appropriate one to cover various life cycle routines. Various illustrations throughout the story enhance the understanding of the reader.The simple plot of farm life is a great set up for the story and gives students a look into a lifestyle they may not be familiar with. While many aspects of the plot may seem humorous, White does seem knowledgeable about farm life therefore making the overall plot seem believable if the student can simply look past some of the humorous fantasy.While animals do not realistically talk, the voices and personality given to the various farm animals do add to the value of the story. Through their voices the animals have a number of conversations with each other and the main human character, Fern. These conversations show true feelings and can provide students with a reference point into their daily lives. While the story is mainly fantasy, the characters do provide a very basic understanding of their real world lives. White does a tremendous job of bring the story to life for her readers and anyone who enjoys a heartfelt story based on friendship will love Charlotte's Web.Charlotte's Web is a great story to use for comparison and contrast in the classroom. A movie is based on the story as well and after viewing the movie, students can use their skills to both compare and contrast the two. A fun classroom activity that would bring the story truly to life would be a class play. The students could create the setting and portray various characters. Your class could then move on to perform the play for a younger grade. Charlotte's Web should be a fun book to read and therefore fun activities should be used to enhance the students learning."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"I read this book when I was 7 or 8, and was loving it - until the extremely sad penultimate chapter, which reduced me to tears and I was unable to complete the book.

This was my first re-read since my original reading as a child and it struck me again as being a wonderful book so full of feeling, even though I'd seen the cartoon movie year after year as a child. I was surprised that Fern wasn't really that big a part of the story as I had expected her to be and Templeton was all Paul Lynde to me. I heard his voice every time he spoke!This was my son's first exposure to Charlotte's Web. I've kept him away from the new version of the movie purposely until we'd read the book and the animated version just doesn't show up on TV like it used to. I wouldn't say say he absolutely loved it. He didn't cry are feel bad at the end, at all. It was very much \\"c'est la vie\\" for him. But he did laugh at all the funny parts and enjoyed Wilbur as a character the most. Oh, and the geese, he loved their double talk! So he enjoyed the book and we've got a hold on the animated movie version at the library to watch and will watch the newer real life version if he's interested afterwards for comparison.

This last section marks the book out as a bit more mature than many children's books, dealing with concepts that some children can't handle until they get older. That aside, this is a wonderfully written children's story, taking place primarily in a farm yard and barn, telling of the characters with whom Wilbur, a pig, shares his home. The animals are all written so well, they seem like real people, and coupled with Garth Williams's excellent illustrations make for an enjoyable read for the 8-15 age bracket.This story was recently turned into a film, and the book isn't that different from the film, however it does give nuances that only the printed page can bring, so is well worth reading even if you already know the story.The story is so well-written it has won awards, and this small sample of prose shows just how good E.B. White is: \\"The Autumn days will shorten and grow cold. The leaves will shake loose from the trees and fall. Christmas will come, then the snows of winter. You will live to enjoy the beauty of the frozen world\\". It's just a beautiful piece of writing, showing that you don't have to talk down to children for them to enjoy books."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Wilbur is a white, runty pig who lives in Homer Zuckerman's barn. He is childish, innocent, and amiably piggy, and has two good friends: Fern, the girl who rescued him at birth, and an intelligent spider named Charlotte, who spins her web above his pen. One day the old sheep in the barn informs Wilbur of his future as bacon and ham, and Charlotte promises to rescue him from this dreadful fate. How she intends to keep her promise remains to be seen, and her plan unfolds in chapter after delightful chapter. The story closes soon after the natural end of her life, and Wilbur, mourning her loss, welcomes her children into his life.White's writing is masterful, with a gentle touch and careful observation of human nature. This memorable story provides an example of genuine, loving friendship, which blooms among the hard realities of farm life: in the natural course of things, Charlotte does trap and eat insects, and the people do kill the animals they care for. In fact, without Fern's intervention Wilbur's life would have met an early end as the runt of his litter. But even given their pork-eating inclinations, the people on this farm are goodwilled and faithfully care for their livestock. The geese are hilariously goosey, and the old sheep provides several instances of savvy wisdom. Templeton the rat is memorable in his odious self-centeredness. Because the general tone of the book is warm, Charlotte's death stands out as an event of profound sadness. But it is the contrasts that have made this story such an enduring classic -- the reality of death and sadness make the joy and sweetness all the better where they exist.This is a chapter book with occasional illustrations, and should appeal best to ages 5-10. Because its story quality appeals to a wide age range, I recommend it as a first chapter book, although parents ought to be aware that Charlotte's death may come as a shock to sensitive listeners."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"As part of my campaign to get the little darlings to read something decent, I got a spanking new copy of Charlotte's Web and was pleased to discover that kids will read old books as long as they look new.

The prose is as crisp as any book I've ever read and paints a very vivid image of a rural Mid-western American setting. Although not as epic as The Wizard of Oz, Charlotte's Web is a masterpiece of storytelling in its own right. The ending to this book is downright unforgettable and utterly moving.I would recommend this book to any child, if not for its sheer entertainment value, then at least for its strong moral message. Truly, they don't write books like this anymore. It's a good thing we have Charlotte's Web to remind us of the good ol' days"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"This is one of the best books for children. I think every child should have it. I love giving it as a gift to new parents."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Have you ever saved an animal's life? Charlotte's Web by E.B. White was a fun, fictional story about a pig named Wilbur who was saved lots of times from the threat of death. Because Wilbur was the runt, his owner was going to kill him. Fern the farmer's daughter, cleverly stopped her dad and took care of Wilbur. Later, Wilbur moved to her Uncle's house where he met a spider named Charlotte. Charlotte also saved him when the Uncle was going to kill him to eat.My favorite part happened when Fern's family went to the fair, because the kids explored by themselves and all the people adored Wilbur. All Wilbur's animal friends worked together to help him become the prize pig at the fair, which would save his life.The theme of this book is never giving up. When the Uncle was going to kill him, Charlotte never gave up. She kept looking for ways to save him.I used the Paces PAidiea study guide for Charlotte's Web as I studied this book. The study guide includes elements like vocabulary, homework items and journal entries. The homework items showed that even though this is a fictional book, it is full of facts on spiders. I especially liked drawing a comic strip of the spider's process of catching a fly. Using the Paces study guide for Charlotte's Web enhanced my understanding and made it more enjoyable. I recommend reading Charlotte's Web along with the Paces study guide."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite children's books. It is a heartwarming story about the relationship between a lovable pig and a spider. It is a wonderful book that will teach children about the meaning of love while, at the same time, helping them to develop empathy for some of God's other creatures. It is also a wonderful book with which to prepare children for the death of a loved one.The author imbues Wilbur, the pig, and Charlotte, the spider, with delightfully human characteristics. It is a wonderful fantasy. Yet it is really a love story. It is also a book that demonstrates the ongoing circle of life. For these reasons, the book has a spiritual dimension. [...], I am always looking for books that enhance my spirit. For anyone who is on this quest, be you a child or an adult, this is the book for you!Davis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\""},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"A farm girl named Fern adopts Wilbur the pig and nurses him, but her father doesn't want to keep a runt, so he farms the pig out to his brother-in-law. Nonetheless Fern goes every day to visit Wilbur, where she sits on a stool and listens in on all the barnyard conversations. Charlotte, the wisest of the barnyard animals, tells Wilbur that his days are numbered, causing him no small distress. The spider finds a way to save him from turning into bacon by spinning words into her web. Wilbur's fame spreads until the day of the county fair, where he wins a prize. By that time Fern, however, would rather be off riding the Ferris wheel with Henry Fussy. In the end, well, as we all know, pigs live longer than spiders, but Charlotte has left her mark not only on Wilbur but on all who read this touching little story.This is one of the strangest stories I have ever read. It's a bit like Puff the Magic Dragon, when little Jackie Paper comes around no more, but Wilbur was never attached to Fern in the first place. His one true friend was Charlotte. Of course the entire cast of barnyard characters, the rat, the geese, the sheep, the hired hand, all add to the color of the story, but it is the wisdom of the spider that spins the plot of this 1950s classic. E.B. White's style is simple and direct. The illustrations by Garth Williams bring out the earthiness of the story. I'll give it five stars for style."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Do you think spiders are gross? If you answered, \\"YES!\\", you are not alone.

I liked this book and it's the best book I read this year that I understand the most. The story was good and interesting and you just want to keep reading until a new chapter. It all starded when a lot of pigs were born in their farm and dad said that he will kill the smallest one, but Fern stoped him and that pig became hers. She named him Wilbur. After 6 monyhs Wilbur was big, so Fern had to give him away to her aunt, Mr. Zuckerman. Wilbur was bored and alone until he meets Charllote, the spider, and they became good friends. They play and teach each other different things. Then Wilbur got to meet all the animals on a farm and some animal tells him that Mr. Zuckerman will kill him when winter comes. Wilbur asked Charllote if thats true and Charllote said that it's true, so know they were thinking how to save Wilburs life.All long days passed and it seems impossible to save Willbur, but soon there will be a Country Fair. Wilbur talks to Charllote that if he can do tricks on the fair then maybe Mr.Zuckerman will keep him. Next morning when Wilbur was practicing his tricks Mr. Zuckerman came and saw them and thought maybe I'll win prizes if I go to the fair with him.Then he took Wilbur to the Fair. After the fair Wilbur came home proudly with a metal and a ribbon saying, Zuckerman's famous pig. Then Mr. Zucherman talked to his wife about taking good care of Wilbur and keeping him, so they did. Everyone was happy even the animals. Wilbur and Charllote lived there for long time and had a lot og fun together."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Charlotte's WebCharlotte's Web, a novel by E.B. White, is an incredibly written story that is one of my all-time favorites. To begin with, this book shows how two opposites can be such wonderful friends. For example, Wilbur, the pig, and Charlotte, the spider, are completely different. But in the end that's a different story! These friends become extremely close. Another reason is how these friends benefit each other. For one, Charlotte is making webs that spell enchanting words that describe Wilbur. Then Charlotte passes away after she has children. Now Wilbur is helping Charlotte in return by watching over them. Last but not least, this book shows the creativity and brightness of Charlotte. She uses gargantuan words, and she is also very graceful. Finally, I encourage you to read the beautifully written novel by E.B. White, Charlotte's Web."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"I just read this book to my 4-year-old, and loved every page. When I was a child, I avoided reading this because I thought it would be too heartbreaking. Maybe as a sensitive child, it would have broken my heart, but from my perspective now, I think that the events are handled in the best possible manner. Life is a natural cycle, and we must cherish our time and our true friendships.

The warm hearted spider befriends the pig and sets about to save his life by spinning webs that promote Wilbur. &quot;Terrific&quot;, &quot;Radiant&quot;, and &quot;Some Pig&quot; are among the slogans she uses to transform opinions about Wilbur. Helping in her in her task are the barnyard residents chiefly the local rat Templeton.This is an unlikely pair of friends (as so many are), with Wilbur never quite able to overcome his distaste for the way in which Charlotte gains her sustenance. But it is a genuine friendship and all the more touching for the differences that the pair have to overcome. In the end both Charlotte and Wilbur make heavy sacrifices in the name of that friendship.This book is funny and touching and captivating from the first page to the last. No childhood should be without it."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Our class liked this book for many reasons. Wilbur made lots of friends within the story. The story was very funny and interesting. It was nice that Wilbur won a gold medal for being being the best pig at the fair.

Wilbur (the pig) meets a kind spider (Charlotte) who endeavors to save him from the fate of most farm pigs. We see Wilbur grow up and deal with fear, loneliness, and even the passing of a friend, all with the soft, easy prose of E.B. White (who, after all, wrote THE BOOK on writing - Strunk & White's Elements of Style). I look forward to reading this to my children."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Somehow I was asked, or was volunteered by my wife, to read to my second grade daughter's class. I thought it would be fun so I said sure.Her teacher picked this book for me to read, which I hadn't read before but I had seen the movie. I have to say, I was great fun! It's an easy book to read and the kids really enjoyed the voices that I did, especially Templeton's (who ended up being the voice I'd used for Snape while reading Harry Potter to my daughters).The animated movie that was made a few years back followed very closely this book. Which was good and bad -- bad because many of the children had seen the movie and so anticipated things that were coming, but I think also good because it might be nice for the children to see it portrayed so closely after reading or listening to the book themselves.Now I'm going to look into more E.B White books to see if the others are as good."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Charlotte\`s Web is a cool book because at the beginning Fern came downstairs and asked where her dad was.

This touching tale teaches about the importance and values of friendship, as well as the pain of losing a loved one. The reality behind the events that occur allow the audience to relate to the plot. The sense of loneliness and being without friends and even the event of losing someone that is close to you are all very real events that can occur in any person's life.

The book is a good lesson on friendship, loss, that we have to work for what we want sometimes, and how things don't always go the way we want them to. I would definitely consider reading more books by this author, seeing how much I enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"The reason I really enjoyed this book is that Fern is alot like me.

This did not stop him from creating characters that children (and their children and grandchildren) have loved so dearly. When I was a child, I wrote Mr. White, thanking him for writing the books. I received a reply, the gist of which was that he would rather be sailing his boat than writing that letter. It was only after i grew up that I understood the humor in that. And so it is with Charlotte's Web. The book should be read at least every 10 years to appreciate it as a child, an adult and an old-timer."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"The book, &quot;Charlotte's Web&quot; has been reviewed much more thoroughly than I ever could. What I would like to say is that my husband and I have, for the past few years, made it a point to listen to E. B. White's telling of the story on the anniversary of his birth, July 11(this year is his centennial). What I would also like to say is that he did such a wonderful job with all of the characters, especially Templeton and the garrulous geese! I will be forever grateful that he wrote this book and recorded it!"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"I'm not going to give any of the plot away. I have read this book five times. Once when I was in elementary school, three times to my son when he was much younger, and recently to my wife. Each time I have found this book funnier, more emotionally powerful, and more full of fundamental &quot;truths&quot; about what is truly important about living.E.B. White's writing style and use of English is masterful. To accomplish so much in a &quot;children's&quot; novel is nothing short of astonishing. Many fundamental themes of life are touched upon, but the most compelling, emotionally powerful, and moving is the friendship that develops between the two main protagonists.If you are emotionally sensative, be well prepared with a box of tissues. I thought I might be alone in how deeply moving I find this book. Then one day I heard that the author, E.B. White, had worked on making a recording of his book. There is a section in this book that he attempted several times to read, but each time would become overwhelmed with emotion and couldn't continue. For a while there was a concern that the project could not be completed, that he would be unable to read this passage. Finally, on the 17th attempt he made it through. Just thinking about this part of the book has brought me to tears.Charlotte's Web is my favorite book of all time. I have read many great novels and children's books. None are more satisfying. I give this book my highest recommendation. Please read it!"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"I saw this \\"Charlotte's Web\\" back then (in the eighties), and the story is interesting because the final point to everything is about change. But don't worry about little Wilbur (the Pig), because the ending of the cartoon movie is very beautiful. Yes, this is about the loyalty friendship between the Mom spider and Wilbur but when the Mom Spider dies things change for little Wilbur.The story can relate to ones life because even though you may have your brother or sister and may have a great friendship with them, it does not mean that their kids will like you at any capacity. This is what happens to Wilbur, but on the frienship side as compared to family side. Even though i saw this in the 80's, i believe it was made in the 1970's. It feels like the 1970's; it is a nice energy that the movie has. Any way a Timeless a classic story that i recommend for little children, high school teens as well as for adults in this 2005. Times may change but things are still the same (socially).I recommend the book and the cartoon movie titled, \\"Charlotte's Web.\\""},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Charlottes WebDon't get caught in the webIn the book review I am writing about is Charlottes web it has good details. The author doesn't talk about the family; they talk about the pig more and about the pig show too.One reason that I like this movie is... It shows the girl loving and caring about the pig. Every night she would try to sneak the pig to her room but her dad would always catch her. She didn't like the idea to keep him outside because she was afraid someone steal him away from her.Second, shows good details on the family. It tells what the family looks like and it describes what they look like even though it's a movie. They say the family is nice, they are not mean they are very nice, and are very trustworthy. They never be mean to the kids, they show their appreciation to the kids and show there not rude.Third, has a very good reading skill for younger kids like 7-11. It doesn't have anything bad in the book like dirty pictures or bad language. It tells kids how to be responsible and its very funny for younger kids.Next, talks about Wilbert the pig winning his first medal at the pig show. Because he never won nothing before in his entire pig life. Then at the pig show he won his medal.Then, on my evaluation is out of the movie I watched this movie have been the best movie I have every watched in my life so far. So I think its a lot better to remember what you watch on TV because you never know you might have to write a story some say.Plus, on my recommendation on my age could be 7 or up. Because anyone under 7 might not get what the author is saying, and people over that age will understand what the author is saying.Finally, at the pig show the other pigs were all gross and all muddy.

It would be a good book for a 4th grader. The description level of the characters in the book is very low.

She's a spider that befriends wilbur when he gets upset because the sheep told him he was going to be killed after he got fat enough. The bond between Charlotte and wilbur grows stronger, and stronger as the book goes along. The girls name who rescued Wilbur from being killed because he was a runt is Fern. Her brother's name is Avery. Their last name is Arable. Once Wilbur is old enough he has to be sold to a farmer down the road. His name is Mr. Zuckerman. There is a rat that runs a round the farm, who's name is Templeton. Fern visits Wilbur every day until school starts. As their lives go on, she stops coming as often and that's when Charlotte comes.

Most initial readers of this gem are unaware of the legendary early career of its author, Mr White, who along with Robert Benchley, Dorothy Parker and Mischa Auer, helped create the sophisticated humor genre. Wonderful companions such as Charlotte, Wilbur and even Templeton(certainly an evocation of Fred Allen)are always delightful to come home to. The ending, while not the typical Alcott suger-sweet variety, rings true on many levels. Sometimes friends must leave us, regardless of how very valuable they have been, yet it is in our very reaction and more important, actions resulting from the loss, that true, unending friendship is cemented. Hence my choice of Charlotte's Web as a true friend"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"My teacher made our class write a report on your book. I actually enjoyed doing this assignment. Thanks for a great book"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Love this story. Use it for students who are in a reading group but have a hard time keeping up with the reading. Great for reading groups."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"This book was grand! One spring morning an 8 yr.old farm girl stopped her father from assassinating a runt piglet on a farm, and her name was Fern. The piglet's name of choice was Wilber, the main character. Once he got bigger he had to move out side to his new house. One day Fern sold Wilbur to Uncle Homer. One day he made a new friend, and her name was Charlotte, a spider that was warm hearted, caring, and loving. Everyday was great until a blabber-mouthed sheep said, \\"The Zuckerman's will slowly devour you at Christmas!\\" Wilbur was not only crying, but was bawling. Will this really happen? Charlotte made a web that said, \\"SOME PIG.\\" I recommend this book to all ages."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"I think Charlotte's Web is a fantastic book! Fern, an 8 year old girl, had just talked her father, Mr. Arable, into giving her a runt pig instead of killing him. She picked the name Wilbur for her new and adored pet pig. Wilbur, the main character, loved Fern, especially when she was feeding him a warm bottle of milk. For five weeks, he lived happily outside with Fern, and then she had to sell him to her Uncle Homer Zuckerman, who lived down the road. That spring in his new home, the Zuckerman's barn, Wilbur met the animals there which included sheep, geese, a rat, and a spider. Templeton, the rat, was not trusted by the other barn animals, Wilbur, too. Wilbur's best friend was a spider named Charlotte. During spring, Wilbur had lots of fun with his newly discovered friends. Then one day the eldest sheep let it slip that when Christmas came the Zuckermans and Arables would butcher him, the story problem, and Wilbur was instantly panicked and crying. Charlotte quickly said, \\"Wilbur, I will not let you die.\\" After days of thinking, a plan formed in her mind. With a twinkle in her eye, she started on her plan. Will her plan work and save Wilbur's life? I recommend this book, because it's suspenseful, heartwarming, and shows true friendship.

This story is about a girl who really loves her little animal. At first, Fern's little animal was always teased by other farm animals. Will the little animal still be teased by anybody? The little animal is a pig named Wilbur. He was a little pig who has no mother. Nobody but Fern takes care of him. Wilbur is very unfamous until.........I enjoy reading Charlotte's Web for a number of reasons. First is that the book is a very wonderful book for children ages seven and up. Also it is a great book that explains why the animal is sad or not. I think it'll be a great book for children to read. E.B. White also makes the animals talk in real life. This book tells why Wilbur is unhappy. I can't relate this book to any other books because the other books don't tell why that person or animal is sad. But this book does.My favorite part of the book is when Wilbur got a prize. I was also glad when Wilbur got a friend. (A \\"best \\" friend.) I like Wilbur's friend because she had always helped Wilbur with his problems. My other favorite part is when Wilbur was a baby because he looked so cute. One part I dislike is when Wilbur's best friend had died. That part was so sad. I thought that Wilburs friend (best) will not die but to my surprise, the friend did! I was so unhappy. If you're a fan of animal books, read this book!I had really sad feelings because nobody should die in this story, but it did. I should recommend this book for kids in second grade and up. You should also read E.B.White's other books such as Stuart Little and The Trumpet Of The Swan. They're great!

WhiteReviewed by: M.NaduvilekootPeriod 3This story is about a pig named Wilbur was being raised by a little girl called Fern. Fern raised Wilbur until Wilbur became a barn pig. Wilbur is sad and lonely. Later he meets a gray spider named Charlotte. Charlotte tries to help make Wilbur feel better. Charlotte had many ideas to use from.I liked this book because it had adventure in my mind. Some chapters I could visualize it. It's adventure to me in the spiders point of view. It's sad sometimes because Wilbur is crying and worried. \\"I don't want to die,\\" moaned Wilbur.My favorite part of the book was when Wilbur worries he's going to die and he keeps on saying he's going to die. Its kind Wilbur not going to die. Wilbur was questioned and wondered who will help him. Charlotte said that he will help Wilbur. I think it's funny for a little spider helps a big pig."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"It's a beautiful story that lets you be a child but walks you to the next level. I think shouldn't be missed in childhood and should be revisited in adulthood. There's love, loayalty and the joy of childhood fantasy (i.e. loquacious and literate animals) but so much else exists in this \\"children's novel.\\" Recognizing the value of a life no matter how small, agreeably dealing with personalities and temperaments other than your own, new vocabulary written right into the story, growing up and putting away childish things, savoring the fact that life goes on and can be richer than you imagined... I could go on but suffice it to say this book is a charachter builder you and your children will love.Fern is tenacious, Charlotte is wise, Wilbur is noble, Templeton is selfish, the geese are hilarious, the sheep can be snobbish and you love them all because they are real.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"once again, the book is a million times better than the movie. i get such a warm cozy feeling just seeing the front cover! i love the illustrations, i could just imagine holding little wilbur, the sweet little pig that the girl saved, and fed with a bottle - ahhhhhhh - so sweet.ok, i read it when i was a kid, long long ago, but i keep it on my book shelf, for the kids and grandkids.a CLASSIC. a must read. a book every youngster should read. if you didn't read it as a kid, read it NOW! it's not too late! read it out loud to a child, or anyone. just read it. and look at the pictures - adorable!the movie is just not the same. trust me."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Our 4th grade class read this book and all agreed it was a fantastic book. We learned about the importance of friendship. First, we learned that people, or in this case animals, can be different but that doesn't mean you can't be friends. For example, Charlotte, the spider, became best friends with a lonely pig named Wilbur. We also learned that friends help each other when in need, share problems, and care about each other. In addition, friends support and encourage each other, too. Charlotte went to the fair to make Wibur feel better even though she knew she would not be able to return to the barn. There were many other life lessons that we learned. These included working through problems, being a good parent, and dealing with a good friend's death. A bonus of the book was that we learned many scientific facts about spiders. So you can see, this book would be a perfect book for your class to read!"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"As we drove 500 miles in the car on our way to visit a relative, my 2 and 5 year-old sons and I listened to this tape. It was simply wonderful. They had not heard the book read aloud to them yet and they loved the story.The best part of this recording is that the author is the narrator. There is something special that happens when we are privileged to hear an author read his own work. There are slight nuances we may miss when reading the book to ourselves or aloud, the tone of the voice, the slightly different voices for each character and so on. E.B. White's Maine accent is wonderful to listen to.There are plenty of book summaries and reviews that discuss the content of the story so I won't repeat that. Suffice it to say this is a wonderful story about friendship, loneliness, empathy and teamwork. The mourning of a natural death of a friend is counterbalanced with the joy of birth and making new friendships.Do yourself and your children a favor and listen to this audio recording. It is wonderful for long trips in the car, for listening to before bed, or while working on an art project or with Lego's.A pure delight!"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"...It is a classic, well written children's book, free of modern slang, violence and bad attitude. The story revolves around a little girl, a pig and a spider (Charlotte). My only reservation is that the story is tinged with sadness at times - not to give the entire story away, the life-cycle of the spider is a key aspect of the story. I wonder if some children's stories sometimes go a little too far in exposing young children to really quite sad (and usually unrealistic) situations. Perhaps though this is a gentle introduction to a part of life which we all encounter sooner or later. They made an animated cartoon of this story some years ago which I hardly recall now; the book is probably a richer experience for a child (and parent) though. A good night time story book."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"+AH4-There is so much expression in the voice of the author as he reads this timeless classic.

When Charlotte and Wilbur become friends, Wilbur learns that he is special."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"I must confess that having just read \\"Animal Farm\\" shortly before reading this book, I was a little hesitant about excepting this as a pure children's story without any hidden political agenda. I kept expecting the talking animals to rise up behind the pig and take over the farm. Rest assured however there was none of that, as E.B. White does a good job of keeping the story at a purely kids level.Wilber is the runt in a litter of pigs, and Mr. Arable the farmer is going to take him out back and have him slaughtered since as he says, \\"He is small and weak and will never amount to anything.\\" His young daughter Fern who is eight, hears this and requests that her father give the pig to her to raise instead. The father wishing to prove a point to her, allows this so long as she promises to do all the work to take care of it. To Mr. Arable's surprise Fern does an excellent job of raising Wilber and he turns out to be \\"Some Pig\\", proving that even though he was very small he still could amount to something.As Wilber grows bigger the Arable's can no longer support feeding him, so Mr. Arable has Fern sell Wilber to her uncle Mr. Zuckerman who has a farm down the road. There she goes and visits Wilber every day. Being young I guess gives you the ability to sit and listen to the animals more intently than adults, and by doing so Fern is able to hear that the animals can actually talk and she understands them. (Being the father of two girls who are 7 and 5, I'd have to disagree somewhat with this logic as my girls never sit still, and certainly have a hard time listening at times, but for the sake of the story we'll just give them the benefit of the doubt.)Anywise Wilber meets all the other animals in the barn who are very nice, but none of them are really his close friend. He becomes lonely and wishes for a friend. A gray spider named Charlotte answers his prayers and after introducing herself, she becomes Wilber's best friend.When the other animals tell Wilber that Mr. Zuckerman is just fatting him up to eat him for Christmas, this makes him greatly disturbed. Charlotte being a great friend promises to do all she can to make Wilber so important to Mr. Zuckerman that he would change his mind. She sets a plan in action to weave messages into her web proclaiming how great the pig is, and by doing so she hopes to trick the adults into believing it as well. With the help of Templeton the rat she obtains some newspaper clippings and begins her work.Each new message in the web is looked upon as miracle, but rather than looking for any religious connection, the folks in the town just believe they have a very famous pig on their hands and accept it at face value.The suspense builds as Zuckerman takes Wilber to the Fair. If he can just win an award there, Charlotte knows his life will be saved. Charlotte and Templeton have to stow away in Wilber's crate just to accompany him to the Fair, and then when they get there the pig in the stall next to Wilber is twice as big and looks to be a shoe in for first prize.This book was obviously written at a much simpler time in history. At the Fair grounds the adults send the kids off on their own. Besides Fern who is 8, she has a little brother Avery who is only 5. After giving them all kinds of warnings such as not to eat too much, and to stay out of the sun, to not get dirty, and to be careful on the rides, the mother stops and says to the husband, \\"Do you think they'll be all right?\\" and he responds, \\"Well they have to grow up sometime.\\" (None of the warnings were about staying away from strangers.) Of course when the kids returned they hadn't stayed out of the sun and were hot, and completely dirty, but they had fun.Fern meets a boy at the Fair, and starts to grow up a bit as playing with him starts to seem like more fun than talking to bunch of animals.It is a great book about overcoming obstacles even though you are very small, growing up, and most of all friendship. My girls loved the book as well, and especially seemed to like the illustrations by Garth Williams."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Charlett's Web by E.B WhiteFern is the main character, see one day her papa, Mr. Araabel, is going outside to the hoghouse to kill Wilbur,the pig,Fern doesn't want him to and so then he doesn't.Fern loves animals.So then they sell Wilbur.

However, she had never saved a pig from an untimely injustice until the day she learned that her father planned on shooting a runt, just because he had been too small. Begging her father for a chance to save the little oinker, Fern wins the battle, and is given the opportunity to raise the wriggling piglet as her own. Promptly named Wilbur, Fern falls in love with her new charge, and can't get him off her mind, even while at school. But as he grows bigger and bigger each day, things begin to change. Soon, Mr. Arable refuses to allow Wilbur to sleep in the house, then her father reprimands her for taking Wilbur for walks in her doll carriage. Soon, Fern is forced to sell little Wilbur to her Uncle Homer, where Wilbur is quickly swept away, and forced to live. Fern doesn't mind the arrangement as long as she can still see her beloved friend. But when she learns that Uncle Homer plans to fatten the little piggy up and then kill him, she's devastated. As is Wilbur. Confiding in the other farm animals, Wilbur begs everyone for their help in saving his life. Sadly, none of the animals seem to know what to do to keep Wilbur from meeting his fate. No one, that is, except for an intelligent spider known as Charlotte. Charlotte lives right above Wilbur in his tiny alcove, where she spends her days and nights weaving beautiful webs. When she decides to help Wilbur by spelling words and phrases such as \\"Some Pig\\" and \\"Terrific\\" in her webs, the county becomes interested in visiting this amazing pig, leaving Uncle Homer in awe, and giving him the chance to spare little Wilbur's life.CHARLOTTE'S WEB has been one of my absolute favorite stories since I was 6-years-old, which is why this Signature Edition of the tale instantly caught my eye. Yes, it is the same tale that we all know and love from years ago, however, this particular edition features some exclusive content that is absolutely essential for CHARLOTTE'S WEB and E.B. White fans. Aside from the gorgeous, colored illustrations by Garth Williams; and the wonderful large font of the story, this lap-sized edition features an entire Afterword by Peter F. Neumeyer, which features black and white photographs of E.B. White himself, as well as a brief biography about the famed author, pictures of his home, information about his other books - such as STUART LITTLE and THE TRUMPET OF THE SWAN - and even has an exclusive area devoted to the illustrator, Garth Williams. Even more interesting are the illustrations of Zuckerman's Barn - which White modeled after his very own - and the various first drafts and changes to the tale that did not make it into the actual novel. Each and every one of these Afterword pages is an absolute marvelous addition to the tale, and gives the reader an even more in-depth into the man who created an array of lovable, unforgettable characters. Even if you already own a copy of CHARLOTTE'S WEB, the Signature Edition is a must-have item!Erika Sorocco"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"&quot;Charlotte's Web,&quot; by E.B. White, belongs to a special class of literature: a children's book which has much to offer to older teen and adult readers. White's wonderful story is superbly complemented by the charming illustrations of Garth Williams.As the story opens, eight year old farm girl Fern Arable stops her father from killing a piglet who has been labeled the runt of the litter. The little pig, whom Fern names Wilbur, becomes one of the central figures in the story. Eventually he will be befriended by Charlotte, the wise and loving spider mentioned in the book's title.White creates a sort of modern animal fable in which his barnyard characters can speak both with each other and with Fern. White's barn is populated with some truly marvelous characters. Special mention should be made of Templeton the rat. Gluttonous, sneaky, often nasty, but curiously sympathetic, Templeton is one of the great anti-heroes in modern literature.Part of this novel's brilliance is the fact that the author makes a heroine out of a spider: a creature that many people probably regard with fear. Unlike a cute piglet or other barnyard creatures, a spider is a creature vastly different from humans. White's Charlotte is a truly remarkable character. White's witty, compassionate prose style is an ideal vehicle for telling the story of Charlotte and her friends.&quot;Charlotte's Web&quot; is a masterful blend of whimsy, humor, gentle satire, and life-and-death drama. But above all, it is a powerful story of friendship. Deeply moving and superbly written, this is a book which, I believe, will endure as a treasured classic."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Can't imagine saying something about E.B. White's children's classic &quot;Charlotte's Web&quot; that 148 others here (more around the world) have not. But experiencing it twice (having it read to me in fifth grade nearly 30 years ago, and reading it to my daughter recently) has allowed me to greater appreciate the book's meaning and accomplishment.Many children will never experience life on a farm or visit a county fair (the two major book settings). White and his illustrators picture that life sensually and beautifully. The story of Wilbur (pig) and Charlotte's (spider's)friendship, what she does to save him, the toll it takes on her, and her eventual legacy, recalls the unconditional love mothers have for their children. (Fern, the Arables' daughter who saves Wilbur's life at the start, retreats from the storyline as her interest shifts from animals to boys.)All this is told amidst word backgrounds of warm summer days, dank cellars, midways filled with discarded food and paper, cellar barns filled by scents of straw, manure, and slops. (Who but White could've described the leftovers fed to Wilbur and actually make them sound delicious?)White's gift for character also shows most interestingly in the rat Templeton, who many may identify with. Tough, clever, self-serving, defensive, but valiant in the end, he adds much needed sour spike to essential scenes that may have otherwise been too sweet (his negotiation with Wilbur over Charlotte's egg sac is one example) Templeton's self-desciption at book's end of &quot;living for the pleasures of the feast,&quot; summarize in a way what makes life and what we do for each other in it worth the trouble. Essential reading for children and adults."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Natural HistoryThe spider, dropping down from twig,Unwinds a thread of her devising:A thin, premeditated rigTo use in rising.And all the journey down through space,In cool decent, and loyal-hearted,She builds a ladder to the placeFrom which she started.Thus I, gone forth, as spiders do,In spider's web a truth discerning,Attach one silken strand to youFor my returning.E. B. White, November 1929As the poem Natural History, written some 23 years before Charlotte's Web indicates, EB White had a long fascination with spiders and their webs and the truth to be discerned in them. In fact, he was enamored of the natural world in general and his desire to be closer to the land led him to move to a Maine farm in 1939. It was in the farm life and specifically in the comfort of the barn that the inspiration for this children's classic came to him :As for Charlotte's Web, I like animals and my barn is a very pleasant place to be, at all hours. Oneday when I was on my way to feed the pig, I began feeling sorry for the pig because, like mostpigs, he was doomed to die. This made me sad. So I started thinking of ways to save a pig's life. Ihad been watching a big grey spider at her work and was impressed by how clever she was atweaving. Gradually I worked the spider into the story that you know, a story of friendship andsalvation on a farm.From these humble beginnings he wove an enduring tale of love and loyalty, life and death, and, perhaps unnoticed by most of us until adulthood, of the comic ingenuousness of man, and of the value of knowledge and a big vocabulary.White, renowned as an essayist, wrote so clearly and fluidly that the pages whiz by. And if you get a chance to listen to the audio version that he reads himself, it is the performance of a master storyteller. Though a native New Yorker (Mt. Vernon anyway), White had by then picked up the rhythm and accents of a New Englander. In addition, he tells the story with apparent affection for his creations, love of the barnyard, and amusement at the goings on.I was trying to figure out what made it all so magical and then I found this quote in which he described his own work (What Am I Saying To My Readers He ?, May 14, 1961, NY Times) :What am I saying to my readers? Well, I never know. Writing to me is not an exercise in addressingreaders, it is more as though I were talking to myself while shaving. My foray into the field ofchildren's literature was an accident, and although I do not mean to suggest that I spun my twoyarns in perfect innocence and that I did not set about writing &quot;Charlotte's Web&quot; deliberately,nevertheless, the thing started innocently enough, and I kept on because I found it was fun. It alsobecame rewarding in other ways--and that was a surprise, as I am not essentially a storyteller andwas taking a holiday from my regular work.All that I ever hope to say in books is that I love the world. I guess you can find that in there, ifyou dig around. Animals are part of my world and I try to report them faithfully and with respect.He succeeded quite brilliantly in the task he set himself. I know of no work of literature by any author that better expresses respect for animals and love for the world.GRADE : A+"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"One of the best reasons for having children is having an excuse to read Charlotte's Web. I just finished reading it to my youngest child, and cried just as hard as a did when I first read it to her brother a decade ago.The story is about a spider who saves a pig from being turned into bacon and pork chops by weaving words to describe him into her web, convincing everyone that a miracle has occurred, and that there must be something very special about this pig.Charlotte, the spider, is kind, noble, and brave &#65533; a model of perfect friendship. Wilbur, the pig, is childlike and innocent at the beginning, but he grows wiser under Charlotte's influence throughout the book. The book is beautifully written in simple, graceful language. It's just a pleasure to read from beginning to end.There is one thing that anyone planning to read the book to a young child ought to know. At the end, after laying her eggs, Charlotte dies. I had actually forgotten about that when I started reading the book to my 6-year-old recently, and when, halfway through the book, I remembered, I was a little worried about what her reaction would be. But as I got closer and closer to Charlotte's death, I realized how skillfully E.B. White handled the scene. For a couple of chapters before, you see Charlotte growing weaker and weaker. My daughter kept moving closer to me, sensing, I'm sure, that something was wrong. Charlotte's death doesn't come as a shock. Even a kindergartner seemed to sense that it was coming. More important, in the scene after Charlotte dies, Wilbur guards her eggs until her babies are born, and while most of them fly away, three baby spiders stay behind and become his friends. He's able to guide them the way Charlotte guided him, which gives a wonderful sense of continuity.I don't think Charlotte's death is a reason not to read the book to a child, but I think if you're planning to read it to a child under 8 or so, you should read it to yourself first to be sure your child is ready for it."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"\\"The crickets felt it was their duty to warn everybody that summertime cannot last forever. Even on the most beautiful days of the whole year - the days when summer is changing into fall - the crickets spread the rumor of sadness and change.\\"There are powerful messages that every child longs to hear: life is special and worth cherishing at all costs - and against all odds. That is the backdrop for this tale. I read this book in the third grade and I'm now reading it aloud to my children at bedtime.On my daughter's level, the animals talk. Great fun. And on my sons' level, we struggle to survive and have to plan for the future (but how?). Oh yeah, spiders are cool too.So much of E.B.White's prose is visceral - looking across a pasture at dusk: the smell of horses, the slanted rays of the sun illuminating small vortices of insects, the nearby sounds of crops shaking in the breeze, the pink hues of the sky. This is the world of Charlotte's Web. Against this pastoral beauty, the main themes of this book center on mortality and friendship. Life is tragically ephemeral whether this is the life of a runt pig, or the fate of the same spring pig.My children marvel that in a great hour of need, desperately alone, a heroine comes in the most unlikely of forms. We learn that perhaps the greatest obstacle to salvation isn't the effort of a savior, but rather the assent of a trusting soul - \\"But Charlotte,\\" said Wilbur, \\"I'm not terrific.\\"Little minds (and big ones too) can wrestle with big ideas when reading this book. Just what is our purpose while we are in this \\"barnyard\\"? Is it to play the role of the rescuer or rescued. Or do we standby like the sheep and geese, and even self absorbed rats can be deliverers sometimes too.\\"It's not often that someone comes along who is a true friend . . .\\" maybe the most applicable truth in this tale. As I read this book at night, I look at my children, who are growing up before my very eyes. I hope we learn from this book to be rescuers, to have the humility to be rescued, and to treasure our true friends. I turn off the lights and in the distance I hear the crickets, warning me that summertime cannot last forever.DON'T EVEN THINK OF DEPRIVING YOUR CHILDREN OF THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"\\"It's not often that someone comes along who is a true friend . . .\\"Fern Arable, eight year old farm girl, stops her father from killing a piglet who has been labeled the runt of the litter. She names the piglet Wilbur and nurses him from the bottle, surrounding him with her love. When Wilbur is able to eat on his own, they sell him to Fern's uncle Mr. Zuckerman, who lives near by. Soon Wilbur finds himself in a barn full of animals and scents of straw, manure, and slops. The only thing missing - is a true friend.That's how a great bond of friendship begins between Wilbur and a spider named Charlotte, who lives in the rafters above his pen. With Christmas time approaching, Charlotte comes up with a plan to save Wilbur from the mean and cold-hearted slaughter of turning him into the bacon. To persuade Mr. & Mrs. Zuckerman that Wilbur is not an ordinary pig and needs to be spared, Chralotte devotes all her time and strength to weaving words into her web. One morning she presents the words \\"Some Pig\\" in her web in the top corner of the barn's doorway. A hurdle of people came to see this miracle, a sign from above, the miracle nobody can explain. That's how a Wilbur becomes an attraction of the state, a famous Zuckerman's pig.Wilbur is not in danger anymore, thanks to Charlotte. But the spider herself is not into loud celebrations - she grows weaker and weaker with each following day. On the day of the Fair, she gets her last strength to accompany her friend on his special trip. Among the cheer of the crowd on the Fair's Grounds, Charlotte quietly makes an egg sac and passes it onto Wilbur's care, quietly staying behind herself: \\"After all, what is a life, anyway? We're born, we live a little while , we die. A spider's life can't help being something of a mess, with all this trapping and eating flies. By helping you, perhaps I was trying to lift my life a trifle. Heaven knows anyone's life can stand a little of that.\\" Wilbur guards her eggs in the barn until her babies are born in the spring, and while most of them fly away, three baby spiders stay behind and become his friends. He's able to guide them the way Charlotte guided him, which brings a wonderful sense of continuity and satisfaction.In this tender story of friendship, hardship, and the passing on into time, E.B. White reminds us of the wonder and miracle found in the simplest of things. But above all, it is a powerful story of friendship - deeply moving and superbly written - a true, timeless classic.Julia ShpakAuthor of \\"Power of Plentiful Wisdom\\".

I am really happy with the high quality of this book."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Unlike many children's stories, Charlotte's Web is bittersweet. Most children will regard this as a welcome change. Some will refuse to eat pork. Others, like me, will develop a lifelong fondness for spiders. This story doesn't click along predictably like most do, yet it isn't full of melodrama either. I especially like the character of the little girl, Fern, who does some growing up along with her animal friends. The ending is a tearjerker but it does offer some hope."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Charlotte a kind hearted grey spider, befriends Wilbur, a lonely white farmyard pig.

White's level. For an author to be able to touch the lives of both children and adults through a passage of fifty years shows talent.The book covers wonderful ideas such as friendship, sad facts such as death, but even contains many touches of humor (Check out the chapter entitled, \\"The Miracle\\": Charlotte has just written \\"some pig\\" in her web. Mr. Zuckerman quickly believes that Wilbur is no ordinary pig. His wife responds to his quick belief in the unusualness of the pig, by stating,\\" 'It seems to me you're a little off. It seems to me we have no ordinary spider,'\\" to which Mr. Zuckerman responds, \\" 'Oh, no. It's the pig that's unusual. It says so, right there in the middle of the web.'\\").So, stop waiting for kids to show up in your life and just sit down and read the book.

This was the first \\"grown-up\\" book I ever read, and I remember crying my eyes out at the end. I'm now 22-years-old, and I decided to take the book off the shelf today, dust it off, and read it again, just for old time's sake. I cried just as much this time around as I did when I was eight and read this book for the first time.Wilbur was born a \\"runt,\\" an under-developed member of a large litter of pigs. Fern, the daughter of the farmer who owns the barn in which Wilbur was born, pleads with her father to spare his life, so he does. In order to ensure Wilbur's safety, Charlotte the barnyard spider writes messages in her web describing Wilbur to the farmer in an attempt to convince him to spare Wilbur's life.The real strength of this story is in the friendship between Charlotte and Wilbur. While she's just a spider, Charlotte acts as Wilbur's guardian angel. There are also quite a few comical episodes within the story, and other colorful supporting characters.While there's an incredible amount of joy and fun in this novel, the author also masterfully handles the tough issue of explaining the concept of death to a child. E.B. White finds a gentle way of explaining mortality and the circle of life.I'd recommend this book to any parents who is trying to explain these important concepts to their children.

Charlotte and Wilbur become extremely close friends and this book tells a tale of their companionship and faithfulness to one another.I would love to use this book in a classroom. I think that it teaches the students a good lesson while keeping them involved with a longer story. The audience finds themselves wanting to know more about the characters and what will happen to them. I think some books can drag on and on for chapters with no true meaning behind it, but this book will prove to be a very rewarding tale that makes you happy, sad, and confused as to why you fall so in love with animals on a farm. I would use this book for third or fourth grade. I think this is an appropriate age because they will need to start reading chapter book, but this one in particular is a very easy read. This will also keep the class interested in what they are reading and does not seem to be biased on which gender it appeals to.

Charlotte tries to save Wilber's life by doing all she can as a spider.As an elementary teacher I find this book to be a fantastic read aloud. Students always want to hear more about what is going to happen. The story does end on a happy note which is good for young readers, or listeners. If you decide to read this book for a read aloud, you might want to try some summarizing strategies. I like to give my students 3 post-it sticky notes and have them jot down notes on two sticky notes during the read aloud and return to their desks and write a complete sentence explaining either what was read, what they are thinking about, or what they think might happen next. Then I receive 1 sticky note from each student and I can quickly read where they are with their comprehension.

White's elegantly economical style and gifts for characterization, dialogue and carefully selected detail provide exactly the counterpoint necessary to ground his fantasy about Wilbur, a pig, and the little girl Fern and the literary spider Charlotte who become his friends and save his life. In \\"Charlotte's Web,\\" animals talk, an observant child hears them, a spider embarks on a marketing campaign so effective as to turn Madison Avenue green with envy, and the adults look on, bewildered but fascinated. Garth Williams' detailed, lively, but not over-fancy pen-and-ink drawings suit the story beautifully. The picture of Fern pushing Wilbur and her doll in her doll carriage is a stand-out.\\"Charlotte's Web\\" is about compassion, friendship, loyalty, problem-solving, growing up, letting go, and small miracles we might notice if we only took the time t0 look.Remember that Modern Library list of the best 100 novels of the 20th century that came out a few years back and caused such a stir?

One day in early summer, a sheep told Wilbur that the reason they are fattening him up is because of the hams or bacons they desire. When Wilbur heard this, he started to cry and become miserable than ever. Noticing her friend's misery, Charlotte decided to trick the humans to think the pig (Wilbur) is unusual and to leave him alone. As a result, Charlotte spun a Web initializing the words \\"Some Pig\\" and few others like \\"Terrific\\" or \\"Radiant\\".At the day of the fair, Charlotte's day drew near, and at Charlotte's Web, a word \\"Humble\\" was there. For the egg sac, Wilbur cheers, and with the word, humble, Wilbur wins the special price and lives till the end. Although Charlotte is gone, her children are with Wilbur, being friends.

But all good things must come to an end, and once he reaches the right size, they sell him to a neighbor, who, Fern learns, plans to take him to the fair to sell for slaughter. Fortunately, Wilbur befriends a wise spider named Charlotte, who devises a plan that, with the reluctant help of a rat, she hopes will save his life. Templeton, a gluttonous rat with an attitude, is bribed into tracking down appropriately intriguing words that Charlotte then weaves into a web in his pen. As hoped, once they arrive at the fair, folks show up in droves to admire Zuckerman's Famous Pig. Over the years, I've read the book, watched the movie and listened to author E.B. White read his story. The movie does justice to the story, but it's best experienced in its original form, as read by the author. Charlotte's Web is a fantastic, family-friendly (age 8 and up, for some sad stuff near the end) story about friendship. Also good: Essays by E.B. White, Emmy and the Incredible Shrinking Rat by Lynne Jonell and The Cricket of Times Square by George Selden."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Every year I read Charlotte's Web to the kindergarten class, I am amazed at how engaged they are (and how engaged I am) in the story. Much of it stems from the barnyard setting-a place where few of our children spend much time. It's just plain fascinating for them. Then there's the suspense of what will happen to Wilbur, the pig, what will Charlotte do with her web and, ultimately, what will happen to Charlotte herself. The novel teaches many life lessons in a charming, but practical way. To be cliche, E.B. White has spun a strong web that will hold its reader forever.Bernardette CostaAuthor, The Six Colorful Annies"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Hands down one of the best children's books ever written! My six-year-old daughter was so into this book that she read for four hours non-stop! She could not put it down. When she was done we rented the movie, and after watching it she said, \\"I'd much rather read the book again! It's soooooo good!!\\""},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Had I a slovenly mother--had she let my clothes cushion the floor and dirty plates decorate the computer desk--perhaps my copy of CHARLOTTE'S WEB would have been wrapped around in strong threads made so endearing in the book. Though I received this marvelous little story in my childhood, it was not until two days ago that I plucked it out of my brown bookcase and flipped through it. My expectations going into the book? An easy read with static characters and disappointing narration. True, many characters, major and minor, are static--but what an unforeseen thrill CHARLOTTE'S WEB was.It has been a few years since a story has made scenes from my mind's eye perspicuous; the drawings, as pleasing as they are, were unnecessary. The farm where Wilbur lives, in particular, was presented masterly. White's simple prose is clear and organized, but more important: it is precise. So easily the details are slipped into the mind and so easily the reader is able to see. The characters, too, are described and crafted wonderfully. Their personalities are distinct and, better yet, display virtues and defects.Some may criticize CHARLOTTE'S WEB for its lack of obvious edification; the hard working characters often go unrewarded, and, seemingly, the ones who whine the loudest receive rewards. But life--and I do feel that this can remain unsaid--is not known for being the wisest judge. To see such a concept illustrated in a children's book so naturally, well, I can only applaud and emphatically say: how laudable. A wonderful story, it is; a definite read, it is. You too, the grown-up, will appreciate this book. After all, is it not nice to feel like a child again?"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"I have an old recording of EB White reading \\"Charlotte's Web\\".

I can still picture clearly, it's exact location on the shelf in that library. This book made me cry and it was then that I realized the power of books. I saw the animated movie version of this story and thought it was just awful. Have your kids read the book and skip the movie."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"This is a book which should have ten stars, not just five.Faced with the impending slaughter of Wilbur, the runt piglet she has saved and nursed to health, Fern is appalled that she has fattened him for the axe, and commits herself passionately to save her beloved animal. So, too, is Charlotte, the spider who inhabits the barn with him, and woh turns her web into a sort of billboard/oracle which astonishes (and admonishes) the community by weaving words that inform them that this is no ordinary pig! She recruits Templeton the Rat and the rest of the animals in her battle for Wilbur's life...will they succeed? or will Wilbur be a nine-days' wonder? and what will be the ultimate cost?This is the best present I can imagine to inspire a young reader; it's a wonderful tale of courage against the odds; it's warm, sad, and delightfully funny, and 30 years after I read it in fourth grade, I still get a lump in my throat thinking about it. A special, special book. (With wonderful original illustrations!)"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"My mother read this book to me when I was 9 or 10 years old.

As a result, I was terrified of them, and still am scared of them. So imagine my grandmother's surprise when, one day when she picked me up from school, I came to the car with tears streaming down my cheeks, and, when she asked me what was wrong, I said \\"CHARLOTTE DIED!!\\". Feeling sorry for me, she said, \\"Oh, honey, I'm sorry. Was she one of your friends?\\". Imagine her surprise ( and, I suppose, amusement ) when I said,\\"NOOOOO!!She was a SPIIIIIDEEEERRRR!\\" Once she calmed me down, I was able to tell her about the book, and how brave Charlotte saved her friend, Wilbur. That Christmas, I got a copy of the book, and was delighted. This charming story remains one of my favorites, with it's themes of love, friendship, and the notion that even when they die, those we love are never really gone. All the characters, even Templeton the rat, are memorable. I can't think of a lovlier story for children that illustrates the values of loyalty and friendship. And to this day, Charlotte is still the only spider I ever liked! You'll love her,too."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"\\"Charlotte&#65533;s Web\\" was one of my favorite books growing up. My grandmother gave it to me when I was 9-years-old, and I read it so often after that, I would make tabulations on my bookmark of how many times I had read it per day.Not only did I become a bookworm, but part of my love for animals came from this book. I mean, it&#65533;s hard not to get attached to Wilbur, the runt pig 8-year-old Fern Arable \\"save[s] from an untimely death\\", or Charlotte A. Cavatica, the clever, imaginative gray spider who fools everybody into believing Wilbur is a special pig by spinning flattering words about him in her web so he&#65533;s not butchered, or even Templeton, the sarcastic, self-centered rat who is somewhat of a help later on.One year after it was published, \\"Charlotte&#65533;s Web\\" was named a Newbery Honor book. During the 70s, it won the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal and was later made into a movie. Although it&#65533;s been several years since I&#65533;ve seen the cartoon, I do remember that I really enjoyed it. Not more than the book, of course, but it&#65533;s worth checking out if you liked this story.Recommended for readers age 8+."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"It is interesting that the author chose to title the book Charlotte's Web. Instead of naming it after the main character, Wilbur, he named it after the miraculous web. The cover picture is interesting. All eyes are focused on Charlotte, the creator of the web.The basic theme of the story is friendship -- genuine friendship enveloped in love and trust. As time passes, many characters learn valuable life lessons, proof of the book's teaching capacity. The reader is compelled to bond with the main characters as the story progresses. The book also deals seriously with the subject of death without stirring up too much emotion.Briefly, Charlotte's Web is a story of a runt pig whose destiny is death and to be breakfast or dinner on the table. Its owner's daughter prevents her father from killing him. She is given the opportunity to nurse him for a few weeks, but when he is no longer a baby, she has to sell him to her uncle for only $6. There he makes friends, is saved from the slaughter house, grows up, and befriends children and grandchildren of a dear, one-of-a-kind friend.Wonderful story which should be read to every child early in life!"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"This book got me hooked on reading.I hated to read and this book made me stop dreading reading.Now I love reading so much I collect hard back books.So I LOVED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Soon Fern's father says that Wilbur must be sold to a friend of the families. Reluctantly Fern agrees but goes to see him every weekend. Wilbur is depressed in his new home until he makes a new friend Charlotte who is a spider. Wilbur soon discovers he is to be fattened up and eaten at Christmas. He is terrified but Charlotte devises a plan, she spins a web and the next morning Wilbur stands under and his owner discovers it. This isn't just any old web on the web it says:'Some Pig' people are astonished soon Wilbur is famous each week there is a new message . In the Summer his owner takes him to a pig show Wilbur wins best pig! That night though after making her sack and filling it with eggs Charlotte dies. Yet Wilbur had been saved he wasn't eaten! When Charlotte's children are born they all leave except for three who stay and keep Wilbur company. When they die their children stay and so on. I would recommend this book to absolutely anyone who enjoys reading!"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"This fiction book is very funny. An eight year old farm girl named Fern was going to check her dad from murdering a runt pig. She would take the pig named Wilbur for a walk, too Wilbur, the main character, was not sold to a total stranger. Wilbur got caught, and the next day, he went to live with Uncle Homer on his farm, the setting. When someone said a board was loose, he got loose. When it started raining, loneliness set in, and a tear came to his eye. A kind voice said I will be your friend. Wilbur couldn't sleep and had to find his friend as she disappeared. The goose laid her eggs and 7/8 hatched; the rat, Templeton, treasured the leftover rotten egg. As Wilbur was thinking about Charlotte, the oldest sheep said they were going to kill him at Christmas, Thanksgiving, or Easter, and he panicked, the story problem. As Fern was eating breakfast, she was telling her mother about what goes on in the barn; Mrs. Arable thought something was wrong with her daughter. As Wilbur asked, \\"Charlotte, how do you spin a web?\\", he uselessly tried and Charlotte comforted him to sleep. After Avery and Fern played in the barn, they went to see the pig; Avery cracked the rotten egg by trying to kill Charlotte. Charlotte started to mastermind a brilliant plan. Charlotte spun her web that said, \\"Radiant.\\" Charlotte's plan has worked so far. When they had their meeting, the new word chosen was \\"terrific.\\" Templton brought enough magazine clippings for Charlotte to get words from. Then Charlotte sang and told some stories to Wilbur. As Mrs. Arable was having a chit chat with the doctor, she was asking what could be wrong with Fern, but she was perfectly fine. Do you think Wilbur will live through the winter? I recommend that you read this book because it is funny and sad."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"I just reread it recently as an adult. I had this boxed set of three hardcover E.B. White books when I was a kid - Charlotte's Web, The Trumpet of the Swan (which I remember as my favorite of the three, though I hardly remember it today), and Stuart Little.I was so happy when the cheap paperback they ordered here was the same printing - same illustrations and everything. Anyway, coming back to it as an adult (or sort of adult) was surprising - it was so beautifully laid out, the tone, the story, the dark deep themes - as a short novel, it stands with the best of literature. I know there's no such thing as a \\"perfect\\" novel, but as far as any literary criteria can be applied, it is absolutely beautiful - symmetrical in all the right places, gentle as it deals with the harshness of life, all the dark undertones - the sheep in the background with their collective understated cruelty, Templeton the amoral hedonist, the cruelty of time that makes little girls grow up - and yet somehow tenderness persists.It's elegant and real and cosmic and full of quaint Americana. Certainly not only for children. A fine novel by any standards."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"(...)\`'Where's papa going with that ax?''

A simple pig, named Wilbur, won a very special award. While this award might have put $25.00 in Homer Zuckerman's pocket, and a bronze medal around Wilbur's neck, it also changed Zuckerman's family in some very important ways.According to Zuckerman, many people came to visit their farm once folks heard that words were mysteriously appearing in the web above Wilbur's pen. \\"This made us quite famous\\", said Zuckerman.\\"Since we bought Wilbur, from my wonderful niece Fern, our family has been closer than ever,\\" Zuckerman reported.According to Zuckerman, even though Wilbur may have been the runt of the litter, he turned out to be a big hero in the end. \\"He showed us that even small things can have a giant impact on the world,\\" Zuckerman said.It turns out that Fern played an important role in saving Wilbur's life. She was able to convince her father to spare Wilbur, even though he was the runt of the litter. However, Fern has some interesting things to say about how Wilbur changed her life.Fern said, \\"Sometimes the pig kept me from doing things I wanted to do...But in the end, it all paid off.\\"Fern explained that one way Wilbur changed her life was that he taught her how to be responsible. She learned how to feed him, play with him, and how to take care of a little creature. Fern also said that it was nice have such a great friend.When speaking to Fern about her role in saving Wilbur's life she said, \\"I did not think it was fair that my father was going to chop Wilbur into pieces, soI stood up for him.\\"\\"I guess I learned that if I stand up for what I believe in, I can make a difference in the world. Come to think of it, if I hadn't stood up to my father Wilbur would have gotten the ax and we never would have gone to the fair at all\\", Fern said.Every year dozens of animals come to the county fair, but rarely do we find an animal that has the power to change lives the way that Wilbur has. Not only has this amazing pig brought the Arable's and the Zuckerman's closer together, has taught nearly everyone that meets him to think big.Ben, Abbi, Jason, Robin, Jordan"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"I am reading this book to my pre-kindergarteners (4-5 years old).

WhitePublisher: HarperCollins 1952Pages: 192Genre: Children'sReading Level: 4.9Lexile: 680Synopsis of the Plot: \\"Charlotte's Web\\" is an endearing story about the friendship between animals and humans to save the life of a pig. Wilber was born to a litter as the runt; Fern, a young girl who had a great love for animals, immediately took him in. Fern was a child that had the gift of speaking to the animals. Wilber lived on a farm that belonged to Fern's uncle, so she could see him and the other farm animals a great deal. The other animals grew to be a large part of Wilber's life, especially Wilber's friend Charlotte.Wilber met his good friend Charlotte in the barn. Her first words to Wilber came at a time of need for Wilber. Charlotte was a calm and collected spider. She always had words of wisdom to Wilber, and had the ability to ease his always-tense self. Charlotte would later become a lifesaver for her great friend Wilber.When Wilber grew to know his surroundings a fear started that he was going to be slaughtered. Wilber was so worried and insecure about his life he would fall faint a great deal and always be in a tizzy. Wilber expressed his concern to everyone in the barn a great deal. His best friend Charlotte decided to take a stance for her friend and help him get through this time. Charlotte used her skill of weaving beautiful webs to show the family that owned the farm how great Wilber really was.Negative Aspects of the Book: As I have read this book many times I feel that the content now does not fit the reading level. My students in first grade really enjoyed this book being read to them. However, currently the sixth graders at my school are reading this book and I do not see them enjoying the book as much as my young students do.Personal Appraisal: This book was a joy to read with my students! It gave them a clean and deep meaning of friendship and helping out people that we care about. The language was very appropriate for any child to read.This book helps students realize how much friends can really help out each other. The relationship between Charlotte and Wilber is one that many children can relate to. My students in my class found the way Charlotte was so calm and endearing to be somewhat of a mom to Wilber. That was so interesting that they came away with it, I never thought of it that way, I always saw Charlotte as just a friend. This book shows that there are many interpretations that can be made through literature.The most worthwhile part of this book is the friendships that exist between Wilber and all his friends. His friends show him how great of a pig he really is. Fern's love for Wilber, even though he was the runt of the litter, shows students that no matter the size or makeup of someone they still are great!"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Tracy M GriffinMay 10, 2008Literature ReviewTitle: \\"Charlotte's Web\\"Author: E.B.

That was so interesting that they came away with it, I never thought of it that way, I always saw Charlotte as just a friend. This book shows that there are many interpretations that can be made through literature.The most worthwhile part of this book is the friendships that exist between Wilbur and all his friends. His friends show him how great of a pig he really is. Fern's love for Wilbur, even though he was the runt of the litter, shows students that no matter the size or makeup of someone they still are great!"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"This hardback edition is a fantastic value; grab this over the paperback edition. My four year-old daughter loved it. It was her first \\"real\\" chapter book. We'd read a series or two of the Rainbow Fairies and a Disney collection of princess stories, but this (along with Wind and the Willows, also superb) was the first classic. She balked at first (complaining that there weren't enough pictures), but soon she was begging for \\"just one more chapter, please!\\" The afterward is more geared towards adults, but is still a nice bonus. Good stuff."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"E.B. White's classic story for children provides them with many valuable lessons about life by endowing the animals on a farm with some very human attributes. The child in the story, Fern, strenuously objects to her farmer father's intentions to kill a newborn runt piglet.The story continues with the inclusion of several creature characters who illustrate some very human feelings for each other.There is Templeton, the rat, who never did anything for anybody without a selfish motive, and Charlotte, the spider who uses her web weaving skill to advertise Wilbur, the piglet's value to Mr. Zuckerman, the practical farmer who doubts Wilbur will be worth the trouble to raise. Many others, like Gander, the old sheep, and the people at the Fair, add color and life to this wonderful story.Our children today can still learn valuable lessons from this suspenseful, yet delightful tale of the value of life, and just how \\"terrific\\" and \\"radiant\\" any of us may be with enough encouragement.A truly great story from an author who also gave us \\"Stuart Little,\\" \\"Trumpets of the Swan,\\" and a priceless gift to writers, \\"The Elements of Style.\\"Long may this story be available to our children. It is a fable with lasting impact on the formation of their character and sensitivity to others."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"With the birth of my daughter right around the corner my wife and I have been doing a lot of thinking about the books we want to read to her. Now, despite the fact that \`Charlottes Web' may not necessarily be a book she'll be read right out of the womb; it was the first book that came to my mind. The greatest thing about this literary classic is that it's approachable to all ages, boys and girls, and it serves up some of the most memorable scenes in children's literature. I can still remember reading this book as a class when I was in Grade School and I loved every minute of it.The story, as some have already explained, revolves around Fern, a young girl who is devastated when Wilbur, the runt pig of the litter, is going to be killed. After pleading with her father to spare him she's again devastated when her father forces her to sell Wilbur to her Uncle only to have him plan to fatten Wilbur up in mind to slaughter him. But then Charlotte comes up with a plan to save Wilbur's life, and well, the rest is classic!To anyone familiar with the story of Wilbur the pig and the girl who loved him, this edition will be a must have for the family. Filled with wonderful illustrations that bring this tale to life, this is sure to be a favorite of everyone in the house, the children as well as their parents. My wife and I are always talking about how we want our daughter to watch cartoons that we can enjoy and read books that we can stand, and let me tell you, I have yet to meet someone who doesn't absolutely love \`Charlottes Web'.One wonderful aspect of this book is that it's not just about a pig, for, like a lot of children's book destined to teach morals and goals and principles, \`Charlottes Web' succeeds with flying colors to teach children the power of love, acceptance and being yourself. \`Charlottes Web' shows children that they can be anything, do anything if they put their minds to it. E.B. White hand wrote a masterpiece here, a beautiful piece of children literature that's loved by all and worth every penny."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Charlotte's WebCharlotte's Web is a fabulous book!

It would be a charming book to read aloud to children as young as age five or six. It would be adorable to hear their laughter at certain parts or their reaction to the end of the novel. Children who are at the fourth grade level would be able to read and appreciate this on their own. I would definitely recommend reading this and other books by E.B.

It is hard to put into words why I really like E.B. White's narration so much, but I would strongly urge anyone considering this purchase to go for it.

(Englsih as a Second Language)The vast majority of my adult students are literate in their first language. Still, one of the most difficult subjects to bridge is English language literature. I began this semester with American literature and purposely selected Charlotte's Web as our starting point. By the end of the first week of reading, there wasn't a student in the class who didn't cherish this book and story. Although E.B. White has written a simple story directed at 9-12 year olds, the themes, metaphors, and literary devices used, are not that simplistic. This story is brimming with universal ideas, needs, and the emotions that all human beings share and it is deeply embedded with American culturalisms. I would highly recommend this book to any ESL teacher at the intermediate-high or above level, adult and grade school, because it is such a personally rewarding story within a managable text for the \\"limited cultural-content\\" reader. It also offers the teacher many different approaches for teaching; from the cultural/humanistic approach to the literary tools for writing approach."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Charlotte's Web - the first time I laid my eyes on this book was on an old dusty bookshelf in an old long forgotten lane of Bombay and I did not intend picking it up - till the book called out to me and demanded to be read. It demanded that I pick it up and I did.Having said that, I have no regrets reading this one - though meant for kids and pre-teens who said a twenty-three year old cannot discover the child in him? Reading Charlotte's Web was discovering the child in me. The child I thought had long disappeared from my life...What is Charlotte's Web all about? To put it plainly...its only about a Spider and a Pig. Or is it? There is more to it. It is about Wilbur - a pig who is saved by Fern - a little girl living on the farm in Pennsylvania - with her parents and brother. Till one fine day Wilbur has to be kept at her uncle's farm - due to the obvious reason - Space Constraints. Everything is going fine - till Wilbur realizes that he will soon become meat on the Christmas Table.Enter: Charlotte : The friendly neighbourhood Spider - who cares for Wilbur like no one else has ever...A true friend and how she saves him from his death...What I liked about this story: The way it was written - the simplicity that evolves throughout the book...and all that it asks us to be is humane - which is so difficult for humans...Eventually Fern also gives up on Wilbur - here E.B. White brings forth the point - humans do not care for animals as soon as they mature, and eventually move on...Read this one...to find out how Charlotte saves Wilbur's life...and the end..."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Charlotte's Web, written by, E.B. White, a 200-page, black and white paperback starts at Wilbur's birth and continues through with the reader wondering if Wilbur is going to live or die. Because Wilbur is born small, he is to be slaughtered but Fern, an eight-year old little girl, begs and pleads with her dad not to kill him. The dad agrees, only if she takes him under her care. Wilbur grows up under Fern's care but she reluctantly sells him to the Zuckerman's, at two months of age. The Zuckerman's owns a small farm with friendly farm animals, including Wilbur as the only pig. The farm animals are nice to Wilbur yet don't want to play with him because Wilbur is going to get slaughtered soon anyway. Charlotte, who Wilbur meets last on the farm, is an intelligent female spider that can spell words on her web, treats Wilbur differently from the other farm animals. She quickly becomes Wilbur's best and only friend who spends the rest of her life thinking of clever ways, saving him from his death. Does Wilbur finally get slaughtered in the end? You'll need to read the book to find out.The author of the book implies, a great theme that all of us should consider, that true friends are those who are willing to think of plans that will protect you from death. All of the farm animals view Wilbur's slaughter as the norm so they do nothing to try to stop Wilbur's death, except for Charlotte, who spends night after night trying to think of plans to save him. Charlotte cares enough about him to take up her own valuable time, such as preparing for her off-spring while spinning words in her web, that read, \\"some pig\\", to buy more time for Wilbur's life (78). If more people had true friends such as Charlotte, we would all be worry free; therefore love each other more and have less violence around us.Though a great theme, the author had trouble relating and making relevant to the theme, some chapters and characters in the book, for example, the chapter, \\"Dr. Dorain\\", is about Fern's mother going to see a Doctor with concerns that Fern may be having a mental problem (107). It was odd for her to believe that it is possible for Fern to hear the farm animal's conversations. This chapter and character doesn't match how the story displays because Charlotte, the spider, was able to spell words with her web without people questioning, how is it possible for a spider to spell? Even though there were irrelevant chapters and characters in the story, it is to a minimum. The theme is what makes the book fascinating for the story illustrates the meaning of a true friendship through a pig, Wilbur, and a spider, Charlotte. In our lives we need to realize the values of true friendships and give appreciation to those around us for being true friends.You never know, a true friend may save you from death some day."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Charlotte's Web is a magnificent story of a pig named Wilbur who befriends a spider named Charlotte on the farm where he lives.

E.B. White doesn't talk down to children, just as Charlotte would never talk down to Wilbur the pig. White knows that children are capable of deep thoughts and deep emotion, and he touches those thoughts and emotions as well as weaving a charming and often comical plot.

Nobody gave it less than and eight (out of ten) and I gave it a 9 1/2 because in my mind it is an almost perfect book that succeeds on many levels. It is amusing, instructive and also makes you think about how important values are in a life well lived. I hate spiders, but was almost in tears when Charlotte died.

It's such a classic story, not to mention a beautiful one. E.B. White creates such memorable characters and describes them very well. When a little girl named Fern hears that some baby pigs have been born in the barn, she is terrified to hear that her father plans to kill the littlest one, the useless \\"runt.\\" Fern talks her father into letting her adopt the pig. She names it Wilbur and treats it as her own. Then the time comes for the pig to be more on its own, so Fern is forced to sell him to her uncle, who owns a farm. Wilbur feels lonely and out of place until he meets Charlotte, a kind spider who befriends him and, eventually, saves his life. Beautiful, beautiful story of friendship and courage. It contains characters and a fun plot that any child can enjoy. I read this book for the first time when I was in fourth grade, and I recently helped a little second-grader that I baby-sit for with her \\"Charlotte's Web\\" comprehension questions. It brought memories back. This is one of those books that you remember for the rest of your life once you've read it.

You'll recall that he's saved by his brilliant spider friend Charlotte, who weaves words into her web, in a way advertising Wilbur's uniqueness to the farmer and his daughter. You might also remember the goose, the rat and other friends who rally.Read this again as an adult, and you may find there's more to the story. When I read this story to my oldest child some 25 years ago, I was amazed at his tears at end. In fact, I'd forgotten that the wonderful Charlotte dies after laying hundreds and hundreds of spidery eggs.Wilbur (and my son) grieved over the 'unfairness' of this, although Charlotte in her wisdom knew that she (like all living beings) was are going to die. She left her heritage - not just her baby spiders (who 'know' Wilbur, since they were as one with their mother), but Wilbur, whose life she saved.A wonderful story, to be appreciated on many levels as you wish, from the most superficial to a deeper more spiritual one.Hardcover edition has been on our shelves for over 30 years!"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"I read this book for a class, but enjoyed it non-the-less.

Every child growing up should be allowed to experience this book. A book that any reader can relate to, this book definitely deserves medals it did not win.Charlotte's Web is a simple story about survival and love. Wilbur has struggled to survive from day one. He was born a runt, but grows big and strong due to the love of a girl. I think runts everywhere appreciate this book becuase they can relate to being small. Then there is the theme of love, no one can live a complete life unless they have loved. Wilbur finds love first in Fern and then in Charlotte.Even though this book was written almost fiftly years ago, readers still enjoy the story today. Good fantasies never age and this is a perfect example of one. The fantasy parts of the book are the fact that animals talk but the setting is so realistic that it makes you wonder what animals really are saying."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Charlotte's Web, By: E.B.

We take turns, he reads 3 paragraphs, then it's my turn to read 3 paragraphs.There are many valuable lessons that can be learned from this book. It is about real-life issues such as life, love, boredom, and death. It even provides a lesson in vocabulary, as Wilbur is always asking Charlotte what the big words that she uses mean.This is a perfect book for children ages 6-12.

Fern's infant pig, Wilbur, is growing up way too fast; he will have to be sold to Fern's Uncle Homer! Wilbur one day gets out. He chooses food over freedom. Wilbur woke up and saw it was raining; his plans for the day were destructed. He was extremely gloomy and unhappy all day until he heard a quiet, nice, and sweet voice. When morning finally came with little rest, he went frantically looking for his new buddy, Charlotte; when he found her and learned about her, he was disappointed. After that, Wilbur liked her. After Wilbur failed to spin a web, he worried that when it gets cold, the snow falls, and Christmas comes he will die. Will Wilbur die? After Charlotte spun a web that said \\"some pig\\", people from all around came to look at her web; Charlotte's plan for Wilbur to be saved is working so far. After numerous visitors and webs that said \\"some pig, terrific, and radiant\\", Mr. Homer Zuckerman decided to enter Wilbur into the fair. Well, that is another good step for the plan. Charlotte and Templeton, the rat, went along to the fair, and eyed the chubby pig next door named Uncle. The next morning they saw a reward on his door. Will Wilbur get killed?

Wilbur, the antagonist creates a lot of conflicts for himself. When Wilbur was born his size affected the way people thought about him.I think this book is good for readers of any age.

I have done both and I have noticed that Charlotte's Web the movie and Charlotte's Web the book are different in some interesting ways. One way was when Fern found out that her dad was going to kill the spring pig because in the movie she saw her father with the axe going to the barn at night and she followed him to the barn but, in the book she asks her mom where her dad is going with the axe in the morning.I think the differences the book and the movie don't really matter that much. I think that because, in general, the same problems and events happend in the book and in the movie. I enjoyed both of them a lot. They both were very funny and sad at the same time, which I loved.

IT'S A GOOD BOOK TO READ IF YOUR LONELY OR JUST WANT TO READ A PLEASANT STORY WITH NO SUPERFICIALITY. ALSO IT HAS LIKABLE CHARACTERS, THAT REALLY MAKE YOU CARE. I WILL NOT GIVE THE ENDIND AWAY BUT IT IS VERY SATISYING. THIS IS A MUST READ FOR THE YOUNG AND OLD."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Charlotte's Web by E.B. White is an awesome book to read no matter what age you are. This Newberry Honor Book tells us about two extraordinary friendships. These friendships are Wilbur and Fern's and Wilbur and Charlotte's. The first friendship White writes for us is of Fern and Wilbur's love for each other. Fern saved Wilbur from being killed because he was a runt and because of that, the two became best friends and inseparable. As life goes on and Fern grows older, Wilbur finds him a new best friend in the barn of which he lives. Her name is Charlotte and she, like Fern, also saved Wilbur's life.This was one of my favorite books in elementary school and it is still one of my favorites to this day. Children are able to read this book and feel connections through this book with the relationships of the characters. Not only the best friends of Fern, Wilbur, and Charlotte, but also the other relationships such as Templeton helping Charlotte save Wilbur's life. Without Templeton, Charlotte wouldn't have had the lettering to weave into her web. This teaches children that you may not always want to do something, but if it's for the better of someone else, you probably should. Templeton was greedy with his food and life but he put aside (grumpily) his greed for a few moments to find these words for Charlotte and Wilbur.When I become a teacher, I thought about reading this book to my classes so they can listen to such a wonderful book. I started thinking about some lessons to tie in with reading the book aloud and I thought of a social studies lesson with the types of occupations when the book takes place. Farming was a big occupation in these days and I want my students to know that all the jobs available now were not available during the setting of the book. I also thought of reviewing different farm animals and letting students pick a farm animal to do a mini project on. I think students would have so much fun researching this stuff on the computer, and while they do not know it, they will be learning how to use the internet to search their topics. When we are finished reading the book, I will have my students write a story about their favorite farm animal in the book or write a story about how they would save their best friends life."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Having a dual form of dyslexia I did not learn to read until later in life. Thus I never read children's books while a child. Maybe that is why I read so many still today. I read this as part of a children's literature course in university.It is an interesting book, about friendship, commitment, compassion, change and death. As such it deals with a lot of the big questions of life in ways a child can grasp.For me the most moving part was when Wilber confessed to Charlotte that he did not like the thought of her as a blood sucker, towards the end of her life. Only true friends can be that open and honest.The book is a powerful tale of true friendship and how our close friends can transform not only us but those around us."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Charlotte's Web is a mood changing, 5 star book by E.B.

After having listened to it over twenty times (my sons school is quite a distance from our house)I'm amazed at how well its remained \\"listenable.\\" The book is read by the author E.B.White and his voice gives great character to the writing. We purchased the movie version after having listened to this CD and were quite disappointed. E.B.White has so much wit and wisdom in this original Charlotte's Web that's missing in the movie. There's no annoying background music on this CD and it doesn't need it--E.B. White could've had a second career as a narrator of children's books! The 50th anniversary edition that we purchased has an interesting biography of the author read by George Plimpton which follows the narration by E.B. White. We also own the unabridged CD version of Stuart Little which is nice too--but Charlotte's Web is the stronger work."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"E.B. White's tender classic remains a favorite for those of us who grew up in the fifties-for friendship and self-sacrifice are timeless virtues. Eight-year-old Fern Arable begs her father to spare the life of the runt of a litter of pigs, whom she lovingly names Wilbur and treats as a baby. Finally being sold to relatives on another farm, Wilbur has an easy time at first in the lower section of the Zuckerman's barn, but he gradually decides that his life is still empty, for he needs a special true friend. He fears he will die of heartbreak over his loneliness-not realizing that his destiny as a pig is to be fattened for a Christmas butchering.This delightful tale chronicles the special friendship which is extended to him by a talented gray spider named Charlotte, who undertakes as her personal mission to save the life of the gentle young pig. Obviously she has to deceive the Zuckermans into believing that their pig is too remarkable to kill. Because she is such an excellent writer, she uses her web to advertise Wilbur's best features-which is considered a miracle. Meanwhile Fern sits quietly in the barn and listens to all the animals' conversation, though she does not participate. Naturally her mother is worried about this tendency to prefer animals to her peers. Revealing many human characteristics, the animals work together (or not), boys will be boys, until the final farewell. Wilbur is not the only one to shed tears at the spider's brief life cycle, but hope is renewed each spring. This is a wonderful read-aloud story, for children of all ages."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Charlotte's Web was an okay book. The part that made me very sad was when the girl's parents made the pig go to the the uncle's house because they really liked the pig and they begged the parents not to let the pig go but the parents didn't want the pig to stay because it was getting too big to stay on the farm. The parents told them that if the pig was not that big that they would have let it stay but the whole problem was that it got too big right away. When the pig was at the uncle's house the pig made a friend with a spider and the spider really liked the pig and the spider made really nice webs on the pigs door.The uncle took the pig to a fair to sign him up for a contest to win the contest the pig took first place and got a prize. And when the pig got home he was trying to find his friend the spider to tell him the good news but when he found the spider the spider was about to die.Come to find out the spider was having some babies and had them in a little crate. So the spider had its babies and raised them in the little crate. The pig was very happy but he didn't know what was wrong with the spider when he came back from the compition. But than he found out the good news about the babies.Than she couldn't go back home with him he took the babies back to his home and the spider stood home and died slowly and before the pig knew the babie spiders hatched all of them left excepted for three and the pig cared for them as much as he cared for the spider and they lived happily ever after.I did like the book . I would recommend somebody to read this book"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Charlotte's Web is perhaps the best piece of children's literature that I have read to date. I won't rehash the plot here, as many reviewers have done that already (and most of us know it, anyway). Instead, I will say that Charlotte's Web has what most children's books lack now, and that is a true literary quality. Most of what is marketed to children is dumbed-down, non-thematic, twaddle. Charlotte's Web avoid's all of those pitfalls. Instead, the prose is lyrical in it's simplicity. It has strong themes that deal with death in the real world, and growing up and beyond childish things. None of the characters are 'bad', but rather it is fate that is fought, the fate of a pig destined for Christmas dinner.For parents who are seeking something meaningful in their child's literature, and especially for parents who are looking to accustom their children to good, wholesome literature (instead of twaddle), Charlotte's Web will fit the bill perfectly. Homeschooling parents, and all who enjoy expanding their children's vocabularies, will also appreciate the many words that are used and defined throughout the story.And, lest I forget the most important issue of a review, my five year old boy LOVED this book. He's still talking about it some time after we finished reading it. Parents concerned about the death of Charlotte should give some thought to whether or not their child is ready to have that included in the story. My five year old wasn't particularly disturbed by it. My feeling is that most wouldn't be, however, very sensitive children might do better to wait a year or two more."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"My favorite part was when Fern got to keep wilbur.

White, is an incredibly written story that is one of my all-time favorites. To begin with, this book shows how two opposites can be such wonderful friends. For example, Wilbur, the pig, and Charlotte, the spider, are completely different. But in the end that's a different story! These friends become extremely close. Another reason is how these friends benefit each other. For one, Charlotte is making webs that spell enchanting words that describe Wilbur. Then Charlotte passes away after she has children. Now Wilbur is helping Charlotte in return by watching over them. Last but not least, this book shows the creativity and brightness of Charlotte. She uses gargantuan words, and she is also very graceful. Finally, I encourage you to read the beautifully written novel by E.B.

It is really nice to know that someone cares that much about a animal.Thats what I found most interesting."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"After watching the &quot;Charlotte's Web&quot; movie I am glad I also read the book. Some people have only seen the film, but have not read the story. I suggest they do!&quot;Charlotte's Web&quot; is an easy read for most youngsters. The chapters are short and will keep a child's attention. I think kids will have fun watching the movie and also reading the book to see the similarities and differences.Books are a great gift for young readers, particularly when many kids have too much television in their lives. Child readers usually do better in school and their adult lives.Most people have talents they don't know they have. My exposure to literature caused me to discover a talent in writing I didn't know I had. My talent in writing for children gives me hours of fun and a great feeling of accomplishment. Do you have a talent you don't know you have? YOU probably do!As a children's book author, I highly recommend &quot;Charlotte's Web&quot; to kids and grown-ups.Richard W.

I strongly advise people to read this magnificent book."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"I recently bought Charlotte's Web because I'm planning to write a children's book and wanted to get an idea of what sort of language would be acceptable at this level. Well, all I can say is that the writing is pure, brisk, fast-moving and beautiful, and that it carries the story of Wilbur, Fern and Charlotte with the effortless brilliance that simply cannot be taught. The innocence of the story, with its bucolic farm setting and old-time values, is a marvelous vehicle for a story that deals with friendship, death, loss, and change in a manner more interesting than in many of the adult books that purport to take them as their object. I was not only touched and gratified by the writing, but also by the story itself, which was honest and brave in presenting the things that are the stuff of life, but without any of the preaching, lecturing or patronizing PC nonsense that so horribly afflicts children's writing today. White's book is for people who want their children to read chldren's literature, not some throw-away lecture about &quot;tolerance,&quot; and I recommend it without reservation. I'm amazed that I never read it as a child, but it was one of the best reads I've had in some time, even as I approach 40."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Children's books are big, dry sticks poking around the nearly dead fire of adult imagination: They can ignite us.

One day one of the other animals in the barn told Wilbur that when winter came he was going to be butchered, but Charlotte promised Wilbur that she wouldn't let them butcher him. If you want to know what happens, you will have to read the book. I enjoyed reading this book, it described the characters very well and I could see them in my mind. This story is sad, so if you don't like sad stories then I don't recommend that you read this book.

My favorite part was when Wilbur lived with three of the baby spiders."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"I like it .It was funny. It was a good book. My favorite part was when Wilbur tried to spin a web."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"In the beginning of Charlotte's Web by E. B. White, the reader learns about how Fern's father's pigs just gave birth to a litter of piglets with a runt in the bunch. Fern who then realizes that her father is going to kill the runt, pleads her case on why that pig should stay alive. That pig then becomes the main character, Wilbur. Wilbur meets Charlotte, a spider that then became friends with Wilbur. To lift Wilbur spirits charlotte begins to spin words in her web. From Charlotte's spinning, the words in the web gave Wilbur the reputation of brilliant, radiant, and clever. Both girls and boys should read this book from the age group of 8-14. The theme of the book is \\"don't hurt something just for being little.\\"One thing I liked about this book was how Fern was speaking her mind to her dad about not killing the little pig. Also, I liked when Fern took care of the pig and fed her. I did not like when Fern's brother came out with the shotgun and was eating breakfast. Another part I did not like was when Charlotte died.Overall, I thought this book was a great book because it teaches you that just because something's small doesn't mean you have to kill it. I recommend this book to other people. It is a sad and funny book at the same time.I-Asia K."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Someone summed it up perfectly as that. I just enjoyedreading this book with my 1rst grade son. The book engagedhim as well as challenged him. A full analysis is needed on all the levels and how....well i'm sure someone did that somewhere in these reviews."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"I'm 31 and still can't get over this book. I read it in my twenties (although I saw the movie as a kid) and still pick it up every year to read. Why? Because it's one of the best books--ever.E.B. White knows how to tell a story. Wilbur and Charlotte are two of the most memorable characters in all of literature. Put them in the same boat as Dorthy and Toto, Ma and Tom Joad, and Holden and Phoebe. Mr. White has written a beautiful book about friendship and redemption, and I found the Christian imagery to be facinating.There are lots of books out there, and if one had to choose the top 50 books in the history of the world, this would be one of them. I've read quite a few novels, but nothing in recent memory was as simple or profound as this little book. It's not just for kids, it's for all people.Also recommended: How to Lose Your Faith in Divinity School"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"My 4 yr old daughter absolutely adored this book. It began as a story read at bedtime, but after the second chapter my daughter begged to have it read at breakfast, in the afternoon and after dinner! It was a fast and easy read with plenty of opportunity to discuss the principle themes of friendship, love, loyalty, and the 'circle of life'. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"A Timeless, Heart-warming Classic, this book was first published, more than a half century ago! Although written in a more innocent time, and for a different audience (pre-\\"Computer- Age\\" generation), it still maintains its' Charming, Coming-of-Age, Friendship Theme!This story was first read to me, by my third/fourth grade teacher(1960's)! I am now a grandmother, with a six year old grandson, and this Wonderful book has been added to his library!For those few people who disliked this book, they either lack imagination or heart (or both)! Perhaps a book such as \\"Animal Farm\\" would be more to their liking, but then too, they would still need imagination!Also, I found the movie (Charlotte's Web)Delightful!
