I like this book and think that it is a book worthy of checking and and owning.First of all I want to say that the illustrations are beautiful! I read somewhere that they where done using watercolors... whatever Tomie Arai did and worked worked. She certainly captured brilliant jewel tone colors, Asian people that looked well drawn with pretty almond eyes and not slits like some illustrators do. The pages come alive for me.The story itself starts with an Emperor asking his pipa musician to sing an \\"old song\\" for him. And so the pipa player chooses and begins to sing the song of the legend of young Hua Mu Lan. So this story is read in rhyme because it's a song.What is different about this Mu Lan and Disney's Mulan is that Mulan has a younger sister and her parents know that Mulan is going to go and take her father's place in the army. Mulan gathers the things she needs for her journey but does so in a way no one would track her purchases by traveling in the 4 directions and in different towns: a horse, saddle and a whip. Mulan goes off and wins 100 battles in 10 years and she becomes a general. On her way home she asks for a strong camel to go home and travels to the south to home with her friend. She is never wounded and it is not revealed that she is a woman until Mulan dresses in a yellow dress and meets her friend.This version is only in English and on the left hand side of each page as an area that is the story in Chinese characters. There is no pinyin for you to read so unless you know Chinese characters I can't see a vast majority of people being able to read this.... so maybe the other reviewers have a different version of this book under a different ISBN. And as far as the story being lost in translation.... I bet this is and is like any book that was written in a foreign language, much is lost in translation due to lack or words that perfectly describe it in the original text that it was written in.Also you must remember that this ancient story has been told many times by many people, Hua Mu Lan was and is loved by the Chinese People. This is not the Disney Mulan, please understand.... I love Disney, but I also know how Disney's company can take a story and add their own little twist, like Mulan, Mary Poppins and Little Mermaid to name a few of the books that have been made into very popular movies and there by becoming favorite and sometimes the only known version unless you really dig deep and find the original version of the book.So, what I am saying is that this is a terrific and very beautiful version of the story of Hua Mu Lan. One definite worth having in your collection."},{"Title":"Commentary on Galatians (Kregel reprint)","review":"Martin Luther's &quot;Commentary on Galatians&quot; remains, after almost half a millennium, perhaps the most vigorous and profound manifesto for the Protestant and evangelical doctrine of justification by faith alone. Within Lutheranism, it was recommended by the later compilers of the Book of Concord (also on amazon.com) as a powerfully inspired treatment of justification by faith, while in British Protestant circles, both John Bunyan (author of The Pilgrim's Progress) and Charles Wesley found their whole lives transformed by this book.Following St. Paul, Luther sees a life and death (literally) opposition between law and faith. Under law, we believe that God approaches us as an angry judge, and we try to win this angry judge over by doing good works for him. Since we are sinners by nature, we cannot fulfill the demands of God who by nature must demand perfection, to remain under the law is to remain under sin, its death, and the devil. As Luther reads Paul, the man under law lives by works, always striving to please this angry God, yet in his heart of hearts he blasphemes Him for demanding the perfect works man cannot give. Yet in Christ God shows that He demands nothing of us but loves us and is heartily willing to forgive us, a promise He sealed in blood on the cross. When we see Christ crucified and have faith that now God is now no angry judge but a tender father eager only to give us all good things, then we are no longer under law but under grace, which brings us freedom, hope, and the desire to do good works, not of a bitter and despairing heart, but freely.As Luther notes, church fathers like Jerome felt profoundly uncomfortable with Paul's violent denunciation of the law, and in their commentaries tried to tone it down. They insisted that by &quot;law&quot; Paul meant only the Jewish law with its out-dated ceremonies and sacrifices, and at several points treated Paul's categorical statements as almost scandalous exaggeration (see, for example, Luther's citations of Jerome's commentary on Gal. 3:13). Luther, however, insists that law here, as in Paul's other epistles, means exactly the moral law and his statements about the moral law for a sinner leading only to death and the curse of God must be read seriously, not dismissed as hyperbole.I read this work in the 19th century translation published by Kregel which uses the King James Bible text and a somewhat archaic language to match. To me it seemed both powerful and suitable to the Luther's pithy and picturesque language, but others may find it somewhat off-putting and prefer the &quot;Modern Language Version&quot; published by Fleming H. Revell."},{"Title":"Commentary on Galatians (Kregel reprint)","review":"Martin Luther (1483-1546 AD) became an Augustinian, Roman Catholic monk where he studied the Word of God diligently while still in the monastery. His study convinced him to post his 95 theses, statements he wanted to debate within the context of the Church to restore it. The rest is history as Martin Luther was excommunicated from the Roman Catholic church and became the first \\"Lutheran.\\"Luther was convinced that: God justifies a person (declares him righteous and acquits him) by faith alone and not by works, each believer has access to God directly apart from any human intermediaries, and the Scriptures are the true source of authority for both faith and life. Many of his doctrines, especially on justification, he covered brilliantly in his commentary on Galatians. And rightly so, for Galatians was his favorite book, his \\"Katherine,&quot; and it was central to his understanding of the gospel.Luther's Commentary on Galatians in the history of the Christian Church is very remarkable. It presents like no other of the central thought of Christianity: the justification of the sinner for the sake of Christ's merits alone. Luther also delineates the difference between Law (what God demands from us) and Gospel (what God has done and does for us); in this text, we understand his \\"simul justus et peccator,\\" that is, a Christian is simultaneously 100 % saint and 100 % sinner.To understand Christian theology and justification by faith, reading this commentary is proper, right, for our eternal good--for Luther explains the doctrines of the Scriptures in forthright boldness and clarity."},{"Title":"Commentary on Galatians (Kregel reprint)","review":"Not too long ago I wrapped up a year-long study of Galatians. In the process, the Spirit used the book to bring the definition and perils of legalism to bear on my life. Just as in Galatians 3:1, seeing Christ clearly portrayed as crucified for my sins, how could I foolishly even presume to think that there was something that I could add to this salvation?! God used the book to literally change my life: making me fall deeper in love with Christ, shoving me to my knees at the foot of the cross, and revealing and removing many of my personal legalistic hopes of justification other than Christ.That is what I love about Luther's commentary. Luther was learning this stuff and loving it as he was teaching it. He was not a theologian who had the benefit of walking in the steps of bible-loving, grace-espousing mentors. He was pierced by the word and the Spirit changed his heart by it. This is what you see in Galatians. During my study I read many great commentaries, but my favorite was Luthers. Luther acts in this commentary as both an exegete and a pastor. This is a commentary that you may just want to curl up with on the couch after you finish studying a section and read and read again. His passion is contagious.(By the way, my other favorite Galatians commentaries were MacArthur's and Hendriksen's. Calvin's and Stott's came in a close #4 and #5). I hope this helps."},{"Title":"Commentary on Galatians (Kregel reprint)","review":"This is, in my estimation, the greatest non-canonical book ever written. Luther expounds Paul's epistle to the Galatians with an insight, power and depth of emotion which is sorely lacking in modern commentaries. He is not concerned with the various potential interpretations of \\"problematic passages\\" that fill the pages of other commentaries. From the very first page Luther cuts to the heart of the epistle-the doctrine of justification-in the way that only he can. His bold words and plain-sense interpretations result in a work filled with much of the same force and passion that characterized the epistle itself. The grace of God and the love of Jesus Christ cling to every word like the scent of a precious perfume. I cannot recommend this work highly enough. This is the very essence of the gospel as understood by the one who \\"rediscovered\\" the doctrines of faith and grace as he teaches us from the words of the one to whom God first revealed those doctrines. If you are looking for an up-to-date critical commentary or a greek-focused exegetical work then you will not find it here, but if you would hear a plain declaration of the power and wisdom of God then you will not find a better treatise apart from the Bible."},{"Title":"Commentary on Galatians (Kregel reprint)","review":"Martin Luthers work on the Book of Galations surpasses most in that this is the book that lead Martin Luther to understand Grace, so he naturaly pours out in it in his great gift of understanding the teachings of God's word.

It nearly always brings me to tears of joy as Luther expounds on the love of the Lord Jesus for me a sinner. If Christians of today would make this book a constant book of study, second of course to their Bible we as a church would be able to say along with the apostle Peter,&quot;silver and gold we have none,but such as I have give thee...&quot; Its time for revival in America. Luther's Commentary on Galatians was good enough for the Wesley's amd Bunyan as one other reviewer stated. May I say its good enough for us today. Let's reclaim the power of the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ and learn the old truth of being justified by faith alone through His grace alone."},{"Title":"Commentary on Galatians (Kregel reprint)","review":"This review covers the Flemming H. Revell Commentary on St. Paul's Epistle to The Galations. This version is based upon Luther's lectures at the University of Wittenberg in 1531 and the translation is based upon the \\"Middleton\\" edition of 1575. This is the best version to my knowledge, but it is written in King James english. On the positive side, it reads very poetic, but on the negative, it is harder to follow. I personally like this writing as it is closer to the language of the 16th Century. This book was considered by Luther to be his favorite, and history rates it highly. To summarize, it has a number of messages, (1) Galations shows that a person who is in true faith can fall away if they are negatively influenced by false teaching - a real problem in today's world. (2) That Biblical teaching must be solely based upon Bible scripture, and anyone who teaches man's doctrines using random Bible passages to support his/her sermons is most likely not a trustworthy preacher. (3) That even faith is a gift of God, and not a decision that a person makes. (4) That \\"Justification\\" is based upon \\"faith alone. (5) That Mose's OT law condemns mankind, and that anything a person tries to add to God's grace in the way of works or self rightiousness, denies what Jesus Christ did for mankind on the cross - Galatians 5:4. (6) That good works result from heart felt faith, and that good works do not preceed or contribute to salvation when it comes to \\"Justification.\\"The world needs this teaching to be more prevalent; however, the world does not like to hear it; therefore, it is almost lost in today's religious teachings. This work is a masterpiece with few peers if any, and is highly recommended to a person familiar with the Bible who desires to grow in their faith and understanding."},{"Title":"Commentary on Galatians (Kregel reprint)","review":"I am thankful to Kregel Publications for giving me the opportunity to have such a landmark commentary in my library among the other weighty books that line my shelves. I knew this was not going to be an easy read, for much of what Luther staked his hope on is still on the forefront of debates today, the justification by faith alone. This topic weaves its way in and out of this masterfully written commentary, straightforward in some areas and lingering just behind the scenes in other. Luther makes his defense of justification most clear to me when he says, \\"Paul by these words, 'Abraham believed', maketh of faith in God the chiefest worship, the chiefest duty, the chiefest obedience, the chiefest sacrifice. Let him that is a rhetorician amplify this place, and he shall see that faith is an almighty thing, and that the owner thereof is infinite and inestimable; for it giveth glory unto God, which is the highest service that can be given unto Him\\".Luther expounds on this doctrine over and again many times throughout this text which is helpful for students of the word to remember such a demanding theme as this is worth repeating. Though I enjoy much of what Luther has presented I do not completely agree with everything he has to say, especially regarding the Holy Spirit. Luther speaks openly about the cessation of the gifts that were manifested to the early church, as many do today, which I think may be a dangerous position to lay claim to. However, Luther does go on to say some very powerful things regarding the work of the Spirit, \\"Although it appear not before the world, that we have been renewed in spirit, and have the Holy Ghost, yet our judgement, our speech, and our confession do declare sufficiently, that the Holy Ghost, with His gifts, is in us\\".I do not pretend to understand much of what Luther writes here regarding the deeper talk of doctrine and theology but I am able to pick up and apply a fair amount of theology from this commentary. For those seeking a more complete understanding of justification I would highly recommend taking up this weighty text and diving in with an attitude of serious study and prayer. My prayer is that as I dive into this text more and more I would begin to see God in all his glory as revealed in his Word. May you see this book, not as a Lutheran foundation of theology, but as a tool that can be used to glean a deeper understanding of the righteousness by which we are saved.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free from Kregel Publications in the hope that I would mention it on my blog.

Additionally, his voice as a theologian is drastically enhanced by his voice as a pastor. By that I mean, one can genuinely feel the love he has toward those whom he is writing.The Kindle version does somewhat distract from the content with no Table of Contents, grammatical errors, and incorrect bible passage references. Take the later for instance. In Galatians ch3v6 [p79], the translator tells the reader to go to Gen.16v6. When in actuality the correct bible citation is Gen15.6.Now if you are one who always have the time to check content references, then this may not pose much of a problem.

Bloom\`s book details into great practicalities about meeting/sensing fairies, your guardian angel and other subliminal beings. Really nice! Aivanhovs book is more of a detailed study of angels and their orders from a mystical cabbalistic/christian tradition.Burnhams, and most other books on angels, easily get somewhat &quot;dualistic&quot; in style. &quot;Powers of good&quot; and &quot;dark powers&quot;..this might be exciting or depressing , depending on the reader.

This book changed my mind and opened whole new doors and avenues for exploration.

However, I can without doubt state that this is one of the top five. I read it for the first time over twenty years ago, yet recognized it after the first two pages. Even though I remembered the basic plot, I still found it riveting, before I completed it I would put it down and my mind would repeatedly wander back to it when I was doing other things.Perry Mason and Della Street are eating at a restaurant when there is a commotion over a waitress that bolts out the back door. She is in such a hurry that she leaves her mink coat behind and that coat comes into the possession of Mason and Street. This is the first step in a wild story that is traced all the way back to a cop killing several years earlier. At first Mason is unsure as to whether he is representing the woman or not, he becomes even more personally involved in the case than usual, even to the point of being placed on the witness stand. The story moves rapidly, Lieutenant Tragg is aggressive, but not oppressively so and it is clear he wants to learn who executed the police officer. There is a dramatic and unexpected ending that was so good that I went back and read it two more times. It is one of the best examples of Gardner's dramatic writing and Tragg shows his humanity.Given that the Perry Mason stories are generally formulaic, there is some predictability to what will happen. However, in this case Gardner does a superb job of creating intensity within the bounds of that formula."},{"Title":"The Case of the Moth-Eaten Mink (Perry Mason Mysteries)","review":"The Case of the Moth-Eaten MinkThe 'Foreword' is dedicated to Russell S. Fisher, M.D. the Chief Medical Examiner of the State of Maryland. The author talks of 'reading character' from a man's manner, bearing, tone of voice, and carefully observing these. Some examples are given. Dr. Fisher was an instructor at the seminars given by the Harvard Medical School. Captain Frances G. Lee was asked to recommend an outstanding candidate to the State, and Dr. Fisher was her choice. Gardner gives one example of Dr. Fisher's skill at detection (p.ix). [Didn't Gardner use this in one of his stories?] It also shows the unreliability of eye-witnesses who see what they expect to see.At the end of a hard, grueling day Perry Mason and Della Street go to a restaurant. The owner tells them of a waitress who just ran out without her paycheck, and left her old mink coat that was moth-eaten. They speculate about the causes. Then the police come in because the waitress was hit by a car. The police question the last table that Dixie Dayton served. Perry notices something about one customer, and asks Della to follow him out. Perry follows a clue found in the mink coat (Chapter 2). Chapter 3 tells how Perry tries to identify a mystery visitor. Then he learns that Dixie has left the hospital secretly. In Chapter 5 Paul Drake tells of further developments in this case. The police, in looking into this case, found out about the mink coat. Mae Nolan, a waitress at Alburg's restaurant, visits to tell Perry and Paul what she knows. Perry gets more information from Mae Nolan. Lt. Tragg visits to question Perry about the coat. Tragg tells a story about a murdered police officer; his missing pistol was found and it was linked to Dixie Dayton! This have become a very serious case.In Chapter 6 Perry gets the call from Morris Alburg, and is called to Alburg's apartment. Morris is not there, but Dixie Dayton arrives and tells him more. Then Lt. Tragg shows up, someone heard a shot, and the police found a body (Chapter 7). Perry and Paul answer questions from the police (Chapter 8). The police ask Drake's operative to identify the picture of a woman (Chapter 9). Paul tells Perry about the latest gadgets used to record conversations surreptitiously. Lt. Tragg tells Perry what will be in the newspapers (Chapter 10). Perry explains why he doubts the identification of that woman. Della finds the name of the detective who was hired by Alburg (Chapter 11). Art Fulda explains what he did (Chapter 12). We learn about Paul Drake's operation, and Perry gets a call from Alburg - he's in jail (Chapter 13). Alburg was arrested for killing George Fayette, and he tells perry about Dixie Dayton (Chapter 14). Next Perry talks to Dixie Dayton in the women's ward (Chapter 15). Her story isn't believable.Perry's clients have told his stories that account for everything yet sound improbable to a jury. Can Perry find the girl who impersonated Dixie Dayton (Chapter 16)? The trial starts in Chapter 17. Morris Alburg and Dixie Dayton are charged with murdering George Fayette. Perry was subpoenaed as a prosecution witness, and there is a personality clash with Hamilton Burger. Burger calls Perry to the stand and questions him about the conversation in the hotel room! Perry draws important information from one of the prosecution's witness with a shot-in-the-dark question. Perry then asks for a recess, and gets previously withheld information from Dixie and Morris (Chapter 18). In the last chapter Lt. Tragg visits Perry to wrap up this story with a shocking conclusion.

But in return, they're less believable. The murderer's plot is too elaborate to work as well as it does, and the murderer's hidden authority would, in the real world, have been known to the police months or years before.I don't mind. The ending is exciting and, as always, the story flows with magical smoothness. Very well done."},{"Title":"The Case of the Moth-Eaten Mink (Perry Mason Mysteries)","review":"This is certainly a typical Perry Mason story - no surprises - but enjoyable as usual. I'd recommend it to anyone who is a Perry Mason fan."},{"Title":"From Anzio to the Alps: An American Soldier's Story","review":"Lloyd M. Wells' wartime memoirs, \\"From Anzio to the Alps: An American Soldier's Story\\" is a fascinating slice of personal history. First, it is worth mentioning that this is NOT a broad perspective history or even one giving a wealth of big-picture information about the action the author was personally involved in (the Italian Campaign). While Wells tries (with some success) to place action within some context, \\"From Anzio to the Alps\\" is ONE soldier's story - as the subtitle states. The prose presented is based upon Wells' personal diaries that had lane dormant for decades before he decided to tell his story. The historical viewpoint presented by Wells, with exceptions for context, is largely from wherever Wells was at the moment he originally jotted down his feelings of the period. The reader is taken on an amazing journey with Wells from his entry into the Italian campaign (he actually started, not on the coast near Anzio as the title suggests, but near Cassino - his armored infantry unit was moved to the Anzio sector after just days before engaging the enemy) to the heady days post V-E day and Wells' 'lusts/loves' of Italy and Paris.The personal view of war, not just combat but reflection on how the war changes men, was the most compelling and recurrent theme of this book. Wells does an excellent job pouring his heart into the story while at the same time restraining himself from being self aggrandizing (as others from the Greatest Generation have fallen victim to) or sappy. Thus the reader feels many emotions as if he/she was there with Wells and his comrades in arms. One will undoubtedly walk away from this book with a greater appreciation for how very young boys left their homes (many, if not most, for the first time) for war on foreign soils as nave and uncultured, full of honest optimism, and through the period of a few months to a couple of years grew into cynical men with more human experience than most would have desired who were older than their years and much more appreciative of their lives. Readers can't help but empathize with veterans of foreign wars for all they go through emotionally leaving and then readjusting to civilian life.Wells' prose is solid as they come and a reader can get through this book (251 pp.) quite fast because its text construction is so well done and the story so compelling. Anyone interested in a personal story of war told with literary zeal and engaging emotion should pick up \\"From Anzio to the Alps\\". 5 star read!!!"},{"Title":"From Anzio to the Alps: An American Soldier's Story","review":"I bought this book because my father served in North Africa and Italy and I wanted some history on those theatres of the war, which my father had not shared with me.Instead of another historical account, filled with facts and figures, I found a very personal story of one man's experiences.A few pages into the book, the author offers a translation of commonly used army expletives of the time. It let me know right away that this was going to be a candid and sometimes humorous memoir.For anyone who would like to see the war through one soldier's eyes, I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"From Anzio to the Alps: An American Soldier's Story","review":"In contrast to George Howe's \\"Battle History of the First Armored Division,\\" this book has a lot of the human element, but little history. The author was an academic (political science), but he chose to emphasize what he felt as a participant.A member of the 6th Armored Infantry Regiment of the 1AD, the action he saw starts near Cassino and ends in the Po Valley. But, most of the book is about non-action: two hospitalizations, flings, and shenanigans.Wells and Howe both emphasize that the 1AD rarely was committed as a unit in North Africa and Italy. Rather, units were attached to other divisions."},{"Title":"From Anzio to the Alps: An American Soldier's Story","review":"This is not a bad book at all. I honestly enjoyed it for a number of reasons. First, there are not a lot of books dealing with the Italian Campaign in WWII. This book covers one man's journey from Anzio to the Italian Alps. Second it mentions a number of military units not commonly written about, such as the joint Canadian and American 1st Special Services division and the South African 6th Armored Division.On another note, I get the feeling that while the author was very young at the time of the war, he grew up very quickly, but still had some adolescent tendencies that he struggled with. I suppose this is part of his growing up in a twisted world. The book ends abruptly, and I won't spoil it for you. But I did enjoy the fact he admitted he came back from the war, troubled, angry, addicted to cigarettes and alcohol. Probably, because I have found myself in the same shoes."},{"Title":"From Anzio to the Alps: An American Soldier's Story","review":"At the age of 21, Loyd M. Wells was drafted into the army and commissioned a second lieutenant after attended O.C.S. He was later promoted to first lieutenant with the First Armored Division and saw action in North Africa, Italy, and Germany, winning the Combat Infantry Badge, the Purple Heart, and the Bronze Start. In From Anzio To The Alps: An American Soldier's Story, the late Lloyd Wells (1919-2000) leaves contemporary readers with a vividly written story about the night of February 21, 1944 when American troops came up to the caves at Anzio and what happened during the last offensive in Italy when armored infantry troops found themselves on the perimeter of a major attack. But more than just an accounting of battles and front line conditions, From Anzio To The Alps is a personal story of how young soldiers found themselves transformed by one of the most widespread and lethal wars in recorded human history. Here revealed is the humor, the sadness, the terror, and the tender moments of a war which is now remembered first hand by fewer and fewer participants more than a half-century later. A terrific read, From Anzio To The Alps is a welcome addition to the growing library of World War II biographical accounts and strongly recommended for personal and community library collections."},{"Title":"The Place Of The Lion","review":"Working through Williams's seven novels I come to \\"Place of the Lion\\" fourth (after \\"Shadows of Ecstasy\\", \\"War in Heaven\\", and \\"Many Dimensions\\"). \\"...Lion\\" is in some ways the most simple to read of these four, with the most cohesive narrative and fewest extraneous characters. Conceptually, it may be the most difficult of the four, but a simple, definitional understanding of Platonic Ideals is all that is required to open it up to everyone. With that caveat, I find \\"Place of the Lion\\" the best of the four novels mentioned. True to Williams's norm, the fantastical pops into the book within the first half-dozen pages and never retreats. Also of the four, \\"...Lion\\" is most clearly applicable to life, with particularly valuable insights into the transcendence of love - most overtly of eros and friendship, but of charity and affection as well (see CS Lewis - \\"The Four Loves\\" for an excellent non-fiction treatment of the same topics). All-in-all...very good and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Place Of The Lion","review":"Living manifestations of Platonic archtypes invade the earth (a lion embodies courage, a butterfly beauty, etc.) in this supernatural thriller. The destiny of an uncharitable young woman, neurotically absorbed in her doctoral dissertation, hangs in the balance. This is a great read for anyone, but especially for those who struggle with balancing their intellectual pursuits and &quot;the real world.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Place Of The Lion","review":"This is the fourth Williams book I have read. For me, it's been the most difficult to understand, so far. One needs to be schooled (and schooled fairly thoroughly) in philosophy to fully appreciate what is going on here in The Place Of The Lion.I am not, and don't.A reader of this book also needs to know a bit about Williams himself. As a neo-Platonist he did not see God acting alone to create the universe, but as the creator also of sub-creators, which are traditionally known as the angelic hierarchies. For Williams, these were ever-present realities, ruling not only the great principles of creation, but also having the ability to burst in and effect the lives and destinies of men, whether on a group or individual basis. Here in The Place Of The Lion these universal powers are inadvertently stumbled upon by a Platonic meditation group led by a Mr. Berringer. Now, according to Platonic theory, behind the visible world lies the invisible world of Ideas. That is, behind every chair we observe, whether it is a King's throne or a leprechaun's toadstool, lies the Idea of &quot;chairness&quot;. There is, so to speak, an eternal Chair from which all chairs proceed. This applies to everything in our world; a table is an instance of the Idea of tables, or of the Table; a man and a woman are cases in point of Maleness and Femaleness. In other words, if there is anything that may be called &quot;unreal&quot; says the Platonist, it is this transitory world of mere appearances which we live in.The picture which Williams chose for The Place Of The Lion is this Platonic one. It so happens that on one occasion, Mr. Berringer's meditation is deep enough to cause a rupture in the divide between the outer and inner worlds. He is out walking in a condition almost of trance, deep in meditation upon the Platonic idea of strength and kingship, using the archetypal image of a lion. In this state, it so happens that his path is crossed by a real lioness which has escaped from a local circus or zoo. The animal attacks him but the remarkable result is that the lioness vanishes into thin air, and Berringer falls into a cataleptic trance, while the mighty figure of a maned lion is seen walking away - the very archetypal image on which he had been meditating.Bizarre huh? It's only beginning. He now lies in a coma, and his home and the surrounding area become the place of severe archetypal activity. At one point, the archetypal enormous butterfly appears and all the normal butterflys of the world fly back into it. Totally wild.I cannot begin to scratch the surface of all the very strange happenings that take place in the book, but I think overall it is meaning to say that man ought to be able to rule all of these forces. There is one man in the book that does, and the story ends with him as a second Adam &quot;naming the beasts&quot; and establishing dominion over them.To &quot;get it&quot; and maintain interest in this book a reader should have a pre-familiarity with Platonic theory. It is by no means an easy read."},{"Title":"The Place Of The Lion","review":"I was so glad to find this book in print and available on Amazon; it's been 20 years since I read it as part of a C.S. Lewis Literature class at Cal State Fullerton, and the themes have stayed with me ever since. Reading this book put me into an almost dreamlike state, living the characters' experiences. The idea that archetypal Ideas could enter our world, consuming their physical shadows (our reality) and threatening humanity's existence, is depicted in the setting of a simple English village. Restoration of balance and order are the salvation of the world -- and keeping balance in my own life became a goal after I read this book."},{"Title":"The Place Of The Lion","review":"Once again, Mr. Williams fantasizes the eruption of eschatological events into the ordinary life of the provincial British bourgeoisie. The result is something like the literary offspring of the mating of P.G. Wodehouse with the Book of Revelations. One thing that is rarely discussed, though, is the strange brand of comedy that ensues. For example, picture a young woman sitting at her breakfast table and pondering the remarkable events of the previous evening: A giant pterodactyl, which seems to incarnate the essence of her own self-centeredness and bears something of a resemblance to Peter Abelard, has attempted to assault her by smashing through her bedroom window, ultimately destroying the upper stories of her house while virtually obliterating her father in the process. In the nick of time, she is saved from complete physical and spiritual annihilation by the arrival of her boyfriend riding a unicorn and with an enormous eagle resting on his shoulder. Little wonder she seems distracted as she butters her toast!I'd agree with my fellow reviewer who notes that a passing familiarity with Plato's Ideals is really all the philosophical preparation a reader needs to jump into this novel. However, a little extra reading regarding Abelard's take on \\"universals\\" might add a little extra spice - since Abelard is the subject of the heroine's (the pterodactyl girl) doctoral dissertation. I'd suggest the article \\"The Medieval Problem of Universals\\" in the online Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy."},{"Title":"The Place Of The Lion","review":"This is a book I have reread countless times, and it is always fresh. It renews my appreciation for reality, for the simple material world, and reminds me of the mystical potential lying beneath the surface we see. I especially enjoy the heroine's journey from self-absorption to concern and compassion, and the hero who rises to the occasion to rescue his friends and incidentally the world. One of my favorite books."},{"Title":"The Place Of The Lion","review":"Williams has a narrative gift that reminds you of Chesterton, and when he's telling the story and unfolding events, it's an exciting read. But in his intellectual zeal, the old principle about \\"show, don't tell\\" is cast aside--much of the time is taken up in raptured abstraction and grandly obscure history and philosophizing that quickly become tedious (because unclear) and repetitive. He is given to sudden visionary scene shifts that make heavy picture-drawing demands of the reader's mind, made all the harder going by his breathless clauses upon clauses, which as a technique are supposed to gather the soul up into heights undreamed of, but actually read as purple and overwrought.Williams has an odd way of both under- and over-explaining, taking for granted he's defined his historical or philosophical terms in a precise and usable way for the purposes of the narrative while loudly \\"tour-guiding\\" symbols the reader can easily recognize (such as that, for random example, the burning house is the burning bush). His characters are forever stopping the action for a bit of postgrad seminar instead of letting the action unfold the message, perhaps due to lack of trust in the reader.This is a difficult book, but it's not because Williams ideas are difficult to grasp--they aren't--or rather, they wouldn't be if he expressed them better. It's difficult because the author won't stick to his last and tell a story. The characters are undeveloped except in the most unfair deus ex machina way; the action stops and starts like a lurching bus, always having to slam on the brakes as some verbiage crosses the road; the plot is almost an afterthought, with loose ends everywhere untied. The ideas that animate this book are interesting, and there's certainly nothing wrong with Williams' mind or erudition; but as a novelist, Williams has a hard time moving from the Idea to the Thing and staying with it.I would recommend this book as a group read, because there's plenty to talk about, but it's nowhere near Lewis, Tolkien, or Chesterton when it comes to throwing a rope around the archetypal and numinous and bringing it home to modern man."},{"Title":"The Place Of The Lion","review":"I bought this wonderful book as a gift. I had to return it because of the abominable quality of the LIKELY PIRATED vanity-press edition from \\"Inter-American Publishing.\\" I even returned the one I bought for myself.Why is this title out of print from Eerdmans? Inquiring minds want to know."},{"Title":"The Place Of The Lion","review":"In The Place of the Lion Williams writes an elaborate Revelations kind of prophecy, blending realism with the supernatural and symbolic. The place of the lion is earth; the lion is both a Form for the supernatural beings medievalists called Intelligences, and the symbol for man, as the lion in the story is a hybrid of both. This is the opposite of what Williams' friend, C.S. Lewis, made of the lion in The Chronicles of Narnia, where it symbolized God. In Williams' book this is the eagle. The eagle is also the Form the protagonist, Anthony, identifies with, if not interchanges with. Other animals represent multiple meanings too, such as the snake is a literal threat to Anthony, as well as a Form, such as Aristotle called it, for the supernatural force to come into our world, and the symbol for Satan or evil.The mixture of meanings reflects the theme of the other world opening up into, and destroying, this world. Williams portrays the chaos and confusion this could cause, and the various kinds of reactions by characters. The most substantial characters - Anthony, Damaris, his beloved, and his friend Quentin - all have some knowledge of the supernatural world as depicted in literature and the Bible, but they don't necessarily believe it until it impinges on their world. For instance, Damaris studies and writes her thesis on medieval literature, specifically Abelard. She is aware of the religious beliefs of the period, but she does not share them. They are only of academic interest. It is only after an encounter in which Abelard comes alive, and becomes death, that she realizes the truth - that Abelard was real, not just an historical figure or concept.Williams integrates his interest in philosophy and literature without becoming overbearing or too obscure (a criticism made by friends of other works of his). Christianity is the true account to which the story conforms, but it also incorporates Plato's Ideas, Aristotle's Forms, and the argument between universals and specifics that Abelard became noted for, at least in his own autobiography."},{"Title":"The Place Of The Lion","review":"Catagorized as science fiction/fantasy, this book is really about the forces of good and evil juxtiposed with Christianity. Incredibily written to challenge the scholar, it dances with the imagination and takes the reader to nearly horrific heights of dark evil. The book is short and that is good, as the imagery and narative make you ready to be done reading it. Don't take that comment as a negative, take it as a nod to the power of the book. One tip, the action is complicated and it is far better to read it in one or two sittings than reading chapters here and there, time permitting. Once you get in the cadence of it, it's hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Place Of The Lion","review":"I have only recently become acquainted with Charles Williams, a contemporary and friend af J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, whose books I have been reading for decades. This is a wonderful book, in the sense that it is full of wonder. It is not for everyone, but if you are one who contemplates the greater meaning of things, or enjoy reading about the interaction of the natural with the supernatural, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Place Of The Lion","review":"This was the book that introduced C.S.Lewis to C.Williams and also influenced Lewis' &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot;.

The format is concept =&gt; example =&gt; hands on exercise. Concepts are introduced in a logical fashion. Terms are not used before they are defined.The book does a great job weeding through all the .NET possibilities and highlighting what's useful. As an example, to paraphraze page 446: there are 150 XML classes but at least know these 2; and, this XML class has 27 Write methods but at least know these 6.Anne Prince writes good tight VB.NET code that serves as good examples for developers new to VB.NET.The book may also be good for someone brand new to Visual Basic.

Hands-on practice is the only way to really learn and this book provides plenty of it.This book is very thoughtful and well laid out. Rather than use a lot of color and razzle-dazzle (which both distracts attention from the content as well as adds to the cost of other books), the author gets right to the point with the subjects you need to learn to obtain the minimum knowledge to start coding in VB.NET at a professional (that is, salaried) level.Feel free to buy additional books for reference purposes.

Sample code, 18 complete applications, detailed instructions, and a wealth of &quot;user friendly&quot;, easy-to-understand tips, trick, and techniques make Murach's Beginning Visual Basic .NET an excellent and highly recommended resource for the novice VB.NET programmer."},{"Title":"Murach's Beginning Visual Basic .NET","review":"The aim of this book is to explain VB.NET to newcomers and developers that have used other programming languages.The first two chapters cover the absolute basics of .NET and VB.NET. The next five chapters explain VB.NET programming using lots of screenshots of the new Microsoft IDE. In a few cases the author repeated the same text on different pages but this may be intentional to reinforce the concepts.The author explains all the steps to get your first application developed and running. We liked the way the pages are organised with lots of screenshots to explain the necessary tasks. Learning to program can be a daunting task for any newcomer; hence this book is an excellent learning resource. There are 18 example applications and even the first application is not just a simple Hello World program, so the reader will learn a great deal whilst they progress through the book.The database section of the book is very good and covers most of the database related tasks that would be required in real life projects. The last section briefly covers web forms and web services. This moves more into the realm of ASP.NET but it provides a good insight.As an educational tool for readers new to programming, it is very good but programming veterans will find this book slow in places. If you are a VB developer and want to learn VB.NET, this book may be too basic for you, however it is excellent for starters. We can see how this book would be useful to college/university students learning programming for the first time.We would thoroughly recommend this book to people interested in learning to program."},{"Title":"Murach's Beginning Visual Basic .NET","review":"Wow! What a great book. Thanks Anne for writing it. I have been dabbling around windows and OOP for the last few year thinking it was needlessly complicated. Now, I finally get it. Visual Studio .net really gives necessary productivity gains to make the programming productive and worthwhile. I finally get OOP concepts like &quot;protected members&quot;. Great book. Note: The sections on ASP.NET and ADO.NET are introductory -- Anne Price and Doug Lowe cover them in detail in seperate Murach books."},{"Title":"Murach's Beginning Visual Basic .NET","review":"I just re-read this book. Much better than I initially thought. I think it is better if you have a little knowledge of VB.Net beforehand."},{"Title":"Murach's Beginning Visual Basic .NET","review":"This is a good book for learning aspects of VB.NET but it is not in the same class pedagogically as several others (particularly Schneider and Burrows). The strengths of the book are that the environment is explained fairly exhaustively and every second page has a piece of code illustrating something or other. The downside of the book is that there really isn't enough by way of projects and exercises for the average CS student.My main concern is that you could read this book, play around with the code (which has to be downloaded - no CD) and delude yourself into thinking you had now learnt VB. There just isn't enough in the book for my money to recommend it as a good comprehensive student text. Other books give more bang for your money.For its price, one could expect colour screen shots and colour coding, but that isn't there. In addition the layout as you move through the book is irritating (my opinion). For instance, a page introducing a construct lays out its stall in text (leaving on average the bottom third blank). The opposite page then has the chunk of code (often you need to look up the downloaded files to get the full context)in a box, underneath which is a bullet point synopsis of the opposite page. Too repetitive and formulaic for my liking.If you want a very gentle introduction to VB then this may suit you well. However, if you want a sound foundation in programming then there are other books to consider. There is only so much simplification you can bring to any discipline, and avoid cutting out its heart."},{"Title":"Murach's Beginning Visual Basic .NET","review":"Purchased as a complete newcomer to object oriented and contemporary programming.Found this book to be a great guide to VB.NET (using VS2005 as the IDE). Was able to understand the content and work my way through the problems in the etxt without additonal guidance."},{"Title":"Murach's Beginning Visual Basic .NET","review":"I purchased this book because it claims to be easy to learn VB. Although this book does make certain tasks involved in writing VB code seem easy, they certainly are not. I think the major problem with this book is the fact that they use a \\"two page\\" approach to teaching. This means the explanation is on the left page and some \\"examples\\" on the right page. This is OK, except that some, if not most, tasks in VB require more than one page to explain. Therefore, the reader is left to try to guess and search for the concept the authors are trying to convey in the one-page explanation.I was forced to put this book aside and purchase another book that has more detailed explanations on what I'm trying to learn. This book IS NOT for the beginner!"},{"Title":"Murach's Beginning Visual Basic .NET","review":"This author is TERRIBLE at trying to teach VB.NET. I don't know about his other books, but I will NEVER buy one of them again! He makes too many assumptions that you already know a lot about VB.NET. His \\"example\\" coding is horrible. I have some programming experience (although it is somewhat dated) but he gives about a paragraph or two to the topic, then writes a little piece of code, then sums it all up and expects you to be an expert at it. I need a sample of the code and how it works, not just the line it goes in. I would highly recommend you keep looking and NOT buy this terrible book!"},{"Title":"Murach's Beginning Visual Basic .NET","review":"Not bad for beginners. But it's a far cry from being \\"the best book you can find on the subject\\". I suggest Mike Murach gets a bit humbler with those statements. The content is good, and if the author hadn't managed it to fill pages artificially with reformulating what she had just said, this book would have come out with less than 300 pages. Now take out the ridiculous two-page format and you could write this one on 150 pages."},{"Title":"Murach's Beginning Visual Basic .NET","review":"Mike Murach has been publishing tutorials for IT professionals since the mid-1980s. Many mainframe developers learned their COBOL, DB2, VSAM and CICS skills from Mike Murach publications. These books owe their great following to Murach's model of devoting a single book to specific topic and focusing on making it the best introductory book possible on that topic, rather than publishing a confusing array of books on the same topic with much overlap among books. Murach has continued this model with books that cover topics for today's developers: SQLServer 2000, Java 2, Java Servlets & JSP and Visual Basic.NET.Murach's Beginning Visual Basic.NET is an excellent choice for teaching oneself VB.NET. If you complete all 18 chapters and do the exercises, then you will have mastered enough to go out and get a job as a beginning VB.NET developer. The topics are ordered in a sequence that is very conducive to learning. The book uses Murach's successful \\"paired page\\" format with each subtopic presented in 2-page chunks; text on the left hand page with examples and summaries on the right hand page.One of the strengths of this book is the fact that there are plenty of exercises and projects to do. In order to keep the price of the book down, rather than put all the projects and sample code onto a CD, the sample code as well as 80% of the projects are made available on their website requiring a 2 minute download (20 seconds if you have DSL or cable internet access). Just reading a book or copying sample code from a book is not going to help you remember what you learned. This book gives you projects to do as well as many exercises. This makes you learn the topics covered.By the end of Chapter 6 you will have covered all of the basics of VB.NET syntax, using the VS.NET IDE and the basics of coding OO applications (advanced OO topics are covered in a later chapter). Since OO is such a cornerstone of .NET development, the fact that it is introduced so early in the book is a plus! By the end of the 18 chapters you will have developed multiple non-trivial VB.NET projects. These are not trivial coding exercises but serious business applications. Each chapter has several hands-on projects. Additional projects are available for download from the publisher's website.The focus of this book is on coding. Other than covering .NET classes, the book does not cover the details of .NET Framework development such as deployment, assemblies, interoperability with legacy COM components, conversion from VB6, threading, .NET architecture (CLR, CTS, and MSIL) and managed code. Once the reader has used this book to master the basics of designing, coding and debugging VB.NET programs, then he or she can move on to the clinical details of what goes on under the hood as well as thinking about the issues of enterprise development and application deployment. There are plenty of books that cover those topics. You have to learn to walk before you run. This book will have you walking in no time at all.Developers who put in the effort to master the topics in this book can move onto the next book from Murach, VB.NET Programming with ADO.NET (co-authored by Anne Prince along with veteran Mike Murach & Associates author, Doug Lowe).The 18 chapters are broken down into five sections:1. The \\"essence\\" of VB.NET, including language essentials, data validation, exception handling, using the IDE, OO development (1 of 2 chapters on this topic) and debugging.2. Windows forms, controls and multi-document interfaces.3. NET classes, XML, advanced OO development, arrays and collections.4. Database Access and ADO.5. Web programming, ASP.NET and web services.If you cannot get to a class or you just want a very well organized hands-on tutorial that is comprehensive, yet completely understandable, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Murach's Beginning Visual Basic .NET","review":"This introductory text doesn't cover every single thing there is to know about VB.NET and the .NET Framework -- and that is where its strength is.You can go out and buy one of the more comprehensive books (for example: Programming Microsoft Visual Basic .NET (Core Reference) by Francesco Balena). While such a book would be very important to an established VB.NET developer, other than as supplementary reference, these comprehensive books are of limited use to someone who does not know the language yet and wants to learn it.If, on the other hand, you are looking to teach yourself VB.NET and do not have the time or the cash to take a formal class, then the Murach book is the one for you -- whether you are new to programming or you are someone who is familiar with a legacy language like C, Perl or VB6. This book doesn't ask you to bite off more than you can chew. Once you complete the material in this book you will have a very strong foundation for learning the more advanced topics of VB.NET.The author put a great deal of thought into the organization of this book. She selected the right topics, put them in the right order, and explained each topic well (with good examples).Another strength is the availability of programming exercises. It's not enough to just follow along with the code in a book (especially if you are beginner). You need to write some original code on your own. Hands-on practice is the only way to really learn and this book provides plenty of it.This book is very thoughtful and well laid out. Rather than use a lot of color and razzle-dazzle (which both distracts attention from the content as well as adds to the cost of other books), the author gets right to the point with the subjects you need to learn to obtain the minimum knowledge to start coding in VB.NET at a professional (that is, salaried) level.Feel free to buy additional books for reference purposes. But if you want to LEARN VB.NET on your own, this book provides sufficiently comprehensive introduction. It's the best introductory tutorial for the price."},{"Title":"Murach's Beginning Visual Basic .NET","review":"Murach's Beginning Visual Basic.NET by Anne Prince is by far the best book on the market for us beginners! Had I bought this book first, I would have saved myself lots of dollars and several months time. This is a job well done!Anne has selected a terrific range of material and presented it in a sequence and method that is perfectly suited for beginners. Starting with the basics of the Visual Studio development environment right on thru the coding of windows and web-based database applications, you'll learn how to produce real-world solutions.She starts each topic from the beginning, with code samples and their clear and concise explanations written on the same, or facing page. Thus this book is easier to learn from than any other programming book I have worked with.Each new topic requires only previous topics to understand. You don't have to jump chapters ahead to search for references on the current topic. Such a logical progression builds the reader's confidence, avoids frustration, and saves time.Solutions to the end-of-chapter exercises require both a review of the topic lessons and some user creativity; just the right mixture of confidence building and mental challenge. And the additional downloadable problems offer more mental workout.Whenever I emailed Anne for help, she quickly responded with articulate solutions to my inquiries.I've read plenty of programming books..............cursed at, and wondered why I bought many of them! This is the only one that I feel so good about that I'm willing to take the time to write a signed review."},{"Title":"Murach's Beginning Visual Basic .NET","review":"I'm a software developer with several years of experience developing applications for the web. However, to my surprise, I've recently been instructed to develop a non-web, desktop application. Once I got the deer in the headlights look out of my eyes, I headed straight to the bookstore to find a book to help me make the transition. This book saved me.Murach's Beginning Visual Basic.NET not only does a great job introducing the reader to creating Windows desktop forms and learning the VB.NET language, but it also provides thorough exposure to Visual Studio, commonly used .NET classes and the most commonly used properties and methods associated with these classes. This book also provides a great introduction to object oriented programming and how to create your own business classes. The information and exercises provide exposure to real world scenarios in bite-sized chunks that anybody can comprehend.I know this review includes terminology that beginners might not be familiar with yet, but don't worry, this book's author doesn't expect you to have any previous experience. My experience with this book has definitely wet my appetite to check out some of Murach's other information technology publications."},{"Title":"Murach's Beginning Visual Basic .NET","review":"This book is very well written, and the facing page style of instruction is a great method.I found no errors; there was no evidence of \\"author fatigue\\" towards the mid-end of the book; and Ms. Prince is able to anticipate and address the logical questions that come next in the student's mind.Beginning with the basics, this book then progresses (very logically) to more difficult concepts such as multi-dimensional arrays, structures and collections, and parsing and reading/writing data to/from files; including xml. The final six chapters deal with databases and web projects.I highly recommend this book... but be ready to work because the chapter exercises, though sometimes difficult, really drive home the concepts."},{"Title":"Murach's Beginning Visual Basic .NET","review":"I was in several Oracle's training classes. In most classes, each takes approximately from two to five days. If you were in the class, you would get a handout book printing from Instructor's PowerPoint slide. The handout, in bullet format, covers only the closed-to-a-real application examples. It is concise. Instructor covers the slide for 30 mins. Then, he gave you many lab exercises to follow. With this method, I think you can understand the context in the short time. This book is using the same method. By pursuing this book, you do not need the real instructor. All instructor suggestions are already in the book.At the end of each chapter, you will have a chance to modify the project that you already did in the chapter. For example, if the author shows you how to write IF statements, you will have a chance to enhance those statements to be more complex. You are also able to do extra projects that the author has not taught in the text. As a result, you can apply those skills to develop your own projects.Another good thing about this book is that the screen captures are very clear. You can see what the points of the author. In many books, they fail to do so because readers cannot read words on those screens.Before you decide to buy Object-Oriented Text Book, I suggest that you check the example that the book explains to you. You should buy the book that shows you examples like real world examples such as Invoice Class, or DataValidation Class. You should not buy the book that presents only Mammal class, Engine Class, or Dog Class.However, for the price, it seems to me that this book is a little pricy. You can buy a similar book with 1,000+ pages more for 50 dollars. You may need to trade off between the price and the presentation method of the book."},{"Title":"Murach's Beginning Visual Basic .NET","review":"Great primer for VB.NET. Fun to learn and easy to apply concepts to business models. Complex ideas developed clearly. I would suggest reading Sybex Mastering VB.NET for a deeper understanding of .NET concepts, though, as it goes into depths not covered in the Murach book. It's always good to have more than one angle on a subject.I am not a professional programmer. I run a business that has alot of information running through it. Learning VB has given me the tools to create what I need when I need it. That saves money and allows me to be creative. I love that!"},{"Title":"Murach's Beginning Visual Basic .NET","review":"I rarely write reviews of books. I am a novice programmer but not a novice to technical texts with a Masters in Chemistry and DDS degrees and post doctoral fellowships and board certifications behind me. I felt compelled here.What I needed was a data driven large website. So I started learning VB.NET and I had a block understanding variables and flow of syntax etc. I felt like an idiot. I took home over a dozen books and still couldn't break the shell. Until I read Anne Prince's book beginning VB.NET and Eureka!You could make the case that I had built a base and this book was the camel-back-breaker but why wasn't title #9,#10 or #11 the one? Any of these was sufficiently downstream on the queue. Actually, the more books I read the more I felt like a retard. Yet another title and I am still not getting it. After finishing her book I catapulted right into advanced topics with no problem. But out of the process I wound up unwillingly doing a sweeping survey of all beginner material out there.I think it is Anne Prince's school teacher style presentation. What all the rest miss over and over is that she completely respects the rule to not to introduce previously undefined new terms. You cannot define a &quot;cat&quot; to a five year old as a &quot;quadruped domesticated mammal&quot;. Yet this is so frequently abused, probably because the tech books are often written by people without pedagogical background. The average age of the tech authoring community has some to do with it whether just not enough teaching experience or the overall tendency of younger people to break norms of all sorts. Probably commercial influences also force texts to appeal to broader reader base - some for reference seekers, some with prior skills, some converting from a different technology etc.A good beginning book cannot be all things to all people. The last thing a beginner needs is labyrinths of choices. Remember how back in school they made you jump through hoops and councilors when you sought &quot;choices&quot;. Beginners need a heavy handed structured and uniform approach. The author not only defines &quot;cat&quot; properly but she expects you to know that one and only definition in all future feline discussions! Kudos to Anne Prince!I also like the format of presenting figures on the opposite page which saves you from flipping pages to see figures - one of the most tiring aspects of all technical texts but taken to new nauseating heights in programming books. Even the non glossy parer made a difference - about 10-20% more reading time before your eyes conk out.The book binding is horrible - it fell apart but that little beef dwarfs before the rest of the cons.I went out and bought Murach's VB.NET Database Programming with ADO.NET only because she was one of the authors. The title wasn't even exactly what I needed - a lot of emphasis on winforms and not the web. I was surprised to see that her name was omitted by amazon.com. However small role she may have in that book she was the sole reason for my buying it."},{"Title":"Murach's Beginning Visual Basic .NET","review":"If you are new to Visual Basic .NET this is a wonderful book to start with. It is also a great book to keep handy on your bookshelf as a reference when you begin developing .NET applications. The book is thorough with screen shots, clean coding techniques, and useful examples. Language essentials are covered well along with the basics of Object Oriented Programming. The book includes a full chapter on XML along with several chapters for database devlopers. If you are a web developer you will find the final two chapters on web forms and web services resourceful.If you are a fluent programmer of traditional Visual Basic the book will act as a great resource to quickly learn the differences of VB 6.0 and VB.NET."},{"Title":"Murach's Beginning Visual Basic .NET","review":"I have been working with vb.net casually for several years but had alot of areas I was still weak in.

In truth, this book and its author bear more resemblance to Ted Kaczynski and his anti-technology &quot;Manifesto.&quot;The difference is that Orwell never became part of world he described. Exploring the world of the lower classes, he was constantly betrayed by his &quot;lower-upper-middle-class&quot; mannerisms and tastes. Timothy Donohue is all too much a part of the world he describes--namely, the nightmarish world of the late-stage alcoholic.On the surface, &quot;In the Open&quot; is about a man who freely admits he's trapped in alcohol's clutches but is somehow able to string together a carefully reasoned argument in favor of food stamp reform, typing his manuscript at public libraries whenever he's sober and has the opportunity.His thesis proceeds with fits and starts, however, as Donohue--who sees himself as an unappreciated visionary--struggles with simple tasks made monumentally difficult by his disease. Obtaining money, finding and keeping a menial job, avoiding the police and bullies, keeping his few possessions intact--all these things demand increasing expenses of time and energy as the author tries unsuccessfully to moderate his drinking.It's not unusual for an alcoholic to reason that the problem isn't with himself but with the rest of the world. What's unusual is for an alcoholic to go to the lengths to which Donohue has gone to persuade the world that he's right and it's wrong. There may be some sense to Donohue's economic proposals, but then there may be some sense to the musings of a teenager who talks metaphysics while smoking pot. His ideas are nothing if not grandiose--and grandiosity is one of the hallmarks of alcoholism. There's something about Donohue's economic plan that rings false; perhaps it's our awareness that what Donohue's really trying to reconstruct is not the American welfare system but his own shattered Self. If he can prove (to himself at least) that the system's broken, then who can blame him for checking out?Donohue is at his best when he's describing the landscape and his immediate surroundings, which are by turns enchanting and menacing. There's no denying he has a gift for descriptive prose. Seeing this gift in the service of such a wayward project, however, is somewhat depressing. If he can hit patches of brilliance while drunk and living on the street, where's the limit to what he could do if he got his life turned around? (On the other hand, if Donohue were leading a &quot;normal&quot; life, he might not feel compelled to write at all.)Oddly, this book is presented with no commentary apart from what's on the dust jacket. There's no Introduction or Forword to put the author and his plight in perspective. There's no Afterword; the narrative ends abruptly, and the reader is left with many questions. Did Donohue ever get his drinking &quot;under control&quot;? Did he ever realize that he wasn't that much different from other alcoholics after all? Did he ever find a spiritual solution to his torment? Is he even still alive?Because the publisher, the University of Chicago Press, offers such scant explanation, we're also left wondering why the book was published in the first place. Did the editors find merit in Donohue's economic proposals, or is the book intended as an example of the lengths to which a damaged psyche will go to justify itself? The reader is left to draw his or her own conclusions."},{"Title":"In the open: Diary of a homeless alcoholic","review":"In this autobiography, Donohue chronicles his peregrinations across the USA while drinking himself silly. He gets a few lucky breaks, some money here and there, a little success, but he drinks it all away. In the end, the book snaps shut abruptly with no conclusion, no climax, no denouement, nothing. Just snaps shut in a very odd way. But then it is just a peek into one man's life, the life of an alcoholic. I definitely had more sympathy for homeless people, even alcoholic homeless people, after reading this book. The potential reader should be warned that it contains a lot of economic theory that Donohue, who actually graduated from college with a business degree, develops. So that stuff is a bit dry and you can safely skip over most of it."},{"Title":"In the open: Diary of a homeless alcoholic","review":"I loved this book because it gave an insight into the mind of a type of person who does not often reveal his or her inner thoughts, namely an unusually intelligent person who has hit bottom because of alcoholism. Although at least one reviewer talked about the author's rationalizations, I thought the author was incredibly insightful and suspect he had some analysis as a teenager. It's true that he had rationalizations, but he is aware of them, which lends a wry sense of irony to the book. I liked the book, too, because Donahue doesn't feel sorry for himself and is able to provide us with humor at his expense. I know of no other book like this, but if I had to choose, I might pick Knut Hamsun's \\"Hunger.\\""},{"Title":"In the open: Diary of a homeless alcoholic","review":"This is not a coherent, well-structured narrative. It's a first-person account of an intelligent person disabled by alcoholism. He's an individual. He doesn't represent everyone in his category. Its value is in the intimate look inside the mind of an addict and how he makes decisions. I was especially interested in the lies he tells himself to get different effects. For example, he says, to stop drinking for two days he must *decide* to stop for a month. His description of the pain that drives him to drink is vivid and heartbreaking."},{"Title":"Zanna's Gift: A Life in Christmases","review":"First off, this book is NOT long!

Read it today and start thinking of how you can leave a gift like Zanna's for the world to love."},{"Title":"Zanna's Gift: A Life in Christmases","review":"Oscar Scott Card, under a pseudonym, Scott Richards, made a small novelette called Zanna's Gift, a Christmas story told from the view of the late 1930s and spans through present day.It's the story of the Pullman family who have a family of three teenage boys and one four year old girl. The girl, Zanna, loves to draw and it seems her big brother Ernie is the only one who can decipher her scribblings.The story starts off in a shocking way, when the boy, who is built up by the author to have so much promise and life, dies in his sleep! Wasn't expecting that!The little girl had just drawn a picture for Ernie for Christmas, and when she finds out he has died, she's devastated. No one will know what her picture means! Even her parents can't tell what she drew.The years roll on, little Zanna deals with her grief, and eventually it is revealed she is a twin of another girl who died at birth.The author keeps up these shocks, one after another, until you're just torn apart by the grief. Gets pretty heavy.Scott Richards though then loses his way a bit. The development of secondary characters, such as Zanna's nephew, doesn't really go along with the rest of the theme of grief and redemption. He's just sort of \\"bad\\" and somehow that plays out.The whole book shows Zanna growing up, having kids of her own, her own dealings with her brothers and her painting that she drew at four. It's faded now, and framed, but becomes part of a family tradition for Christmas, and out-lives her.The story picks up again with her niece Betty, who suffers from debilitating polio. My goodness, how much grief and despair can this family take??The story is somewhat unrealistic, but the themes of grief, despair and conquering it will nurturing love is throughout the book.Makes a great little story for anyone suffering from these things and gives some hope, and does fit into the full meaning of Christmas.Not bad, Scott!For Oscar Scott Card's science fiction books:Xenocide T3The Ender Quartet Box Set: Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, Children of the MindAnd one of my fav alternate history stories:Pastwatch: The Redemption of Christopher Columbus"},{"Title":"Zanna's Gift: A Life in Christmases","review":"ZANNA'S GIFT: A Life In Christmases, by Scott Richards (148 pgs., 2008).

The best feature of this book is that it mirrors the layout and content of the actual exam better than any other resource I encountered. The 120 questions are broken into six categories, and each question has solutions A to D. The first section includes 20 general problems that all civil engineering examinees will face in the morning half of the test. The five other sections cover the afternoon half of the exam with specific questions for the environmental, geotechnical, structural, transportation and water resources subgenres. Sample answer sheets appear in an appendix. Many of the problems include enough blank space for computations, making the completed problems useful for a final review a few days before the exam. The solutions in the back are complete and clear.The cover price is high but hopefully transferable to an expense account. This book complements the Lindeburg Civil Engineering Reference Manual package and is strongly recommended for all civil engineering PE candidates. Mine is labeled \`Revision 1' and was published in 2000, so I'm not sure if the PE exam has changed significantly since then.

While it is handy it is reach enough of important facts and comments on the evolution and decline of the Great Empire. It embraces the best of the both worlds giving us a very careful and well balanced epic picture based on some of the most important soarces as well as on the academic literature. Fortunately the book is free of ideological bias so typical for russian studies of almost any origin.Neatly structured, supported by detailed notes, chronology, index, and extreamly useful &quot;Tables and Statisics&quot; the book serves as an almost perfect key to 300 years of The Great but Fragile Empire and at the same time offers its own unprejudised analysis of primary problems of Russian and comparative history. The only dissapointment i have is that the author stops short of writing about the modern Russia."},{"Title":"Fragile Empire: A History of Imperial Russia","review":"The book was shipped quickly after payment.

It is not meant to be a comprehensive study of Bible prophecy. The book presents several themes related to prophecy, with an evangelistic aim throughout. It is meant to help those who have an interest in bible prophecy but have not yet been truly regenerated. I hope it meets that need for many, and that they will experience real conversion while reading it. I also hope that it will encourage true Christians, and especially pastors, to be more zealous in winning the lost in the closing days of this dispensation."},{"Title":"Methodism and the Shaping of American Culture","review":"In this collected work on the history of Methodism in America, a strong group of scholars seeks to overturn the long-held but erroneous view that the Second Great Awakening was largely a Puritan/Calvinist phenomenon and to assert the importance of Methodist participation. They trace the rise of Methodism from a nascent evangelical movement into the largest religious body and most extensive national organization in this country other than the Federal government."},{"Title":"Methodism and the Shaping of American Culture","review":"This collection of essays provides the reader with some of the growing insights being generated by the current generation of historians of religion in America. This book continues the effort to move consideration of the Methodist movement into the broader context of American history.Some of the essays are shorter versions of arguments made in longer works by the same author (as with John Wigger's piece). But there is value in having these more condensed treatments of a subject.Some of the stronger essays are provided by Hatch, Wigger, Hempton, Shiels, and Carwardine. But a couple of the essays are somewhat lacking. This is not unusual in a collection of essays, really. Still, there is some measure of disappointment, and the reader should know this. Having sounded a note of caution, I still give this collection five stars for the overall quality of the better essays.Those interested in American history, or in American religious history, would do well to have this book in their libraries. Very useful."},{"Title":"The Horse Family","review":"Here is an amazing account, using evolution, of the horse family starting with horses as we know them today, going back in time to when horses were first mentioned in history.

This is the kind of book that I'll end up reading over and over as a Zen practitioner to remind me how we humans tend to think and what we need to do if we are going to live life at a deeper, more meaningful level.

As a Western Zen master who lives in Western society, Beck understands how difficult it can be to keep up with a busy life at the same time as attempting to maintain a spiritual practice. The language is simple and goes straight to the heart of the matter.I didn't feel judged but I did feel as if she knew me well. A wonderful tool."},{"Title":"Nothing Special: Living Zen","review":"Whatever religious/philosophical background you have, I think you will find this book very helpful and pragmatic.

To be absolutely honest, I was incredibly impressed that a woman would or could have a coherent philosophy let alone such an impressive one. If you just read one book about Zen, this has to be the one."},{"Title":"Nothing Special: Living Zen","review":"I loved the opening of the first chapter, and the metaphor about what we call ourselves being nothing more than a whirlpool in the river of life. Great metaphor. Love it.The rest of the book seemed to me to be teaching (and Zen specifically has no teaching and is the destroyer of teachings) and emotions. Beck's slant on Zen seems to me to be getting people to meditated for years (according to her it takes years) and work work work at it. But Zen is not about that, it is about \\"nothing to attain and no one to attain it\\" period. All this working at it that she recommends fosters a subtle sense of egoism, a belief that there is some goal to reach, something to gain.Perhaps Beck is working with people whose lives are disasters and she is having to keep them busy in the hope that they will someday finally get it???"},{"Title":"Nothing Special: Living Zen","review":"I am a buddhist.I have read a single talk out of this book every night for over a year. These are concise dharma talks. Zen is pretty new to the US, and many of the traditional Zen stories have to do with monks having exotic experiences. It is easy to get caught in these dreams of 13th century Japan. Joko brings us back from our dreams of a far away practice to doing our dishes while the kids yell in our house in Denver. She offers a sober message of being just here. You wont find a heartwarming Hallmark message here. Joko is as direct and harsh as reality. It is no fun to follow the teachings back to our drab old smelly life, so don't look for the book to be a fun escape. It is the opposite -- which is why it is so good.The book is comprised of a series of talks from Joko and some questions from her students. Joko is an American and so the message couched in the familiar language of our culture. IT is not like reading Dogen, and is more accessible. I would recommend this work to anyone who is serious about---well words escape me. It is not quie accurate to say that it is for those who are serious about taking the Zen path. But for anyone who wants to learn to be present with their real life, this offers solid guidance as much as words can."},{"Title":"Nothing Special: Living Zen","review":"For years I was obsessed with Zen books. However, it wasn't until I came across Joko's books that I encountered the radical suggestion: OUR LIFE IS OUR PRACTICE!!! It was a real eye opener. I reread \\"Everyday Zen\\" three or four time in a row. My teachers in Rochester were pretty unimpressed; they thought that Joko was for people \\"who weren't ready for Zen.\\" (One of them really did say that!) I thought otherwise; her work addressed the disconnect between a practice created for those in monasteries and the \\"self-centered dream\\" of our lives. It baffled me that people would be having \\"openings\\" in the Zendo and then treat their family like dirt after a retreat. She taught that working with our family \\"issues\\" (noticing our thoughts and resting in our physical experience) was not something separate from our practice on the cushions in the meditation hall. No duality.I ended up working with Joko for about five years. She was (and is) every bit as remarkable in real life as she was in her book. There isn't a lot of drama in this practice. Our life becomes less of a soap opera and becomes more mundane. From that ordinariness emerge joy, compassion, love and all of the other aspects of our true nature. You might have fewer of the kind of lightening bolts of a traditional practice. Instead, you will have a grounded life that brings peace rather than pain into this world."},{"Title":"Nothing Special: Living Zen","review":"This is the best book on zen practice that I have ever read . . . and I've read many books on this subject! Beck demystifies the process of living a compassionate life. Other books on this subject have left me feeling baffled and inadequate. Beck's approach helped me find some clarity. I HIGHLY recommend it."},{"Title":"Nothing Special: Living Zen","review":"&quot;Nothing Special&quot; is indeed something very special. You don't have to be a student of Zen or Buddhism of any sort to enjoy and learn from this book. Beck, with her pleasant style that feels like she wrote the book just for you, has much to teach. And yet at the same time, very little to teach, as it is all so simple in the end.This book will give you lots to think about. The stories, the experiences, the questions and answers. They get your mind going, and they will open your eyes if you take Beck's words to heart. &quot;Nothing Special&quot; is all about living a full life. Not an easy life, not a 100% happy and pain-free life, but a full life.Much of what you may get from this book, you'll find you already knew. But along the way you may discover that you've learned something beyond the mere words and ideas on the pages - that there is perhaps a better way of living, one that embraces the good and the bad. Living for the sake of living. &quot;Living Zen&quot;."},{"Title":"Nothing Special: Living Zen","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read, and I have the thoughtful people who recommended it to thank. Joko Beck's straightforward, no nonsense approach makes Zen practice a day-to-day, moment-to-moment experience that truly changes the way you see yourself and the world, but ONLY if you work diligently. I love the way she refuses to promise a blissful, enlightened life, yet engages you to strive for pure joy, whether happy OR sad. I am now looking forward to reading Everyday Zen!"},{"Title":"Nothing Special: Living Zen","review":"A while ago somebody mentioned a quote by Joko Beck, and I felt that the quote was quite wrong. This started a discussion thread, in which I've tried to defend my assertion that her views are unfair. Eventually, and because the participants were defending her fiercely, I was forced to read, and re-read her books. So you can imagine how biased I was. &quot;I'll show them how wrong this lady is...&quot; was my primary intention.Miraculously, and much to my surprise, I was transformed by her prose into a huge supporter. This kind of thing never happened to me before!So, from the mouth of a disbeliever: read this book! It is excellent, one of the best ever.This book should be read in conjunction with &quot;Living Zen&quot;. I don't know which book is actually better. When you get to the end of both of these books, you wish that there is more, although she kindly said much more than needs to be said.I bow deeply to Joko Beck."},{"Title":"Nothing Special: Living Zen","review":"&quot;Nothing Special&quot; is paradoxically something very special. It is a simple and enjoyable read and yet gives much insight into the essence of Zen. I have read many Zen related books and this one stands out as one of the best. It would be valuable to those familiar with Zen and Buddhism, as a reminder that the very root of Zen is &quot;nothing special&quot; and is most often best kept uncomplicated. Even more, this is an excellent book for readers who are unfamiliar but curious about Zen practice and ideas, as the author has a gift for relating the concepts simply and without unnecessary dogma. The question and answer portion at the end of each chapter is also helpful, as her students ask many questions which the reader may have as well. Based upon my reading of her books, it is my opinion that Ms. Beck is one of the true Western Zen Masters. She is one of the few here in America who has managed to keep the Zen in Zen and still make it pallatable, practical, and practicable.Parenthetically, her other books, &quot;Everyday Zen&quot;, and &quot;Now Zen&quot; are equally worthwhile. &quot;Now Zen&quot; is a little compilation book and an absolute gem. It is the first book I would give to anyone who was interested in Zen or what is so special about Nothing."},{"Title":"Nothing Special: Living Zen","review":"Iread this book amongst a flurry of readings pouring over all I could find to give me direction and uncloud the densest of Zen writings. Joko Beck's books are like opening the Farmer's Almanac or biting into a Toll House cookie. Just delightful common sense stuff. The impact her books has had in my life has been similar to finding a compass when lost in a deep dark forest. I simply use them to light my way daily.

I was interested in Zen, but most things I'd read that were American Zen seemed kind of loopy and new-agey. As I continued reading, I was completely engrossed by Ms. Beck's ability to express the compassion and tolerance inherent in her school of Zen Buddhism. Her teachings are the no-nonsense wisdom I have been looking for; they are all about my everyday life and totally relevant. Without a doubt, this book has allowed me to change my life and start to be happy. I recommend this book ZEALOUSLY, which I never do for any other book..."},{"Title":"Nothing Special: Living Zen","review":"An Ok read - nothing special. There are no answers for life in this book, just guidance for sitting."},{"Title":"Nothing Special: Living Zen","review":"What I really like about Charlotte Joko Beck's books is that at one point she did live a \\"normal\\" life. That is, she was married had a child, and worked regular jobs before she became a Buddhist. I often find that Buddhism books can be hard to relate to, because the people writing them grew up in a completely different lifestyle than I did. Many people were born and raised into Buddhism, but Joko changed her life once she discovered it. Not to say that other books on Buddhism are not good, but this one for me was just easier to relate to.I recommend just reading one of her teachings a night as there is so much wisdom in these pages, its just easier to digest at a slower pace. I would love to read this book again, but I saw an interview with Beck somewhere whee she told the interviewer not to read her books twice, and instead practice! Either way, this book is great, easy to read, and contains page after page of interesting teachings."},{"Title":"Nothing Special: Living Zen","review":"Like &quot;Everyday Zen&quot; This is one of the most simplistic, practical and meaningful books I have read.

All the libraries in the world put together fall short in the accumulation of knowledge versus what there is, yet to be discovered. Most of what has been discovered and cataloged is superfluous to the average persons' lives, and at the same time is lacking in specifics regarding the unspoken and ever present subconscious question; \`what is mankind all about ?'We read for pleasure, to educate ourselves, for the suspense of finding out ,\`who done it', to learn how to build things instead of buying things ready made, and we choose our books to start with, by their title or cover art.What can we expect from a book called \\"Nothing Special \\" ?! whose cover art looks like a faded water color picture of a really nondescript flowering weed or something? Answer: Everything!Joko Beck takes us to school and leaves us a lifelong legacy of homework, that for most people will go unfinished. Her message is simply this; pay attention to your thoughts. The recurrent, noncreative, loops of thoughts, that you'll get to know as such, are hijackers of useful time and will weed themselves out of your life after you \`number' them enough times. What this does is clear your mind of useless garbage.\\" We are always connected to inspiration but we do not perceive it because our minds are filled with all kinds of haphazard thoughts. If you have a dominant purpose in life, your mind looks for and collects information related to fulfilling your purpose.

Very gentle presentation. Each chapter is apparently a separate lesson, most of which are similar to a number of psychology tracts I've read. The ideas it presents are nicely compartmentalized for periodic one-subject-at-a-time reading. It did not read very well when I tried to just plow through it from cover to cover like I usually do for most books. It has been sort of organized on specific themes in each section, but sometimes it's hard to tell why some chapters were grouped together. Good use of analogy for the most part, but the analogies in some chapters are a bit strained, impairing understand more than helping."},{"Title":"Nothing Special: Living Zen","review":"When I bought this book, I was depressed, my mind was confused.

I keep it on hand daily, and turn to it when I find myself getting carried away with the \\"pressures\\" of life in modern America. Joko's words keep me grounded and remind me that none of the problems I experience are real - what is real is the experience of the moment. It's a lot easier to understand this than to do it on a regular basis, but at least there's a guide when the way seems lost.This was my first (and favorite) book on Zen Buddhism and I can recommend it to anyone who wants to better understand what is really going on in our heads. It can be hard to accept if you're not ready, but following Joko's teachings has gotten me out of the Rat Race for good.Lastly, I could not disagree more with the reviewer who gave it one star and only liked the first story. This book is full of great metaphors for understanding what Living Zen (real life) is all about."},{"Title":"Nothing Special: Living Zen","review":"Zen practice can take a long time to penetrate an individual; Charlotte Joko Beck tells this story to demonstrate just that point, practice takes commitment and humility. Being a teacher at the Zen Center of San Diego and also heir to the late Taizan Maezumi Roshi, Beck has placed herself in the realm of a select few who have a clear-cut voice in concern to Zen and it's practice. This book is like a companion to Everyday Zen, by the same author.In this particular work Beck answers several questions from students with coolness and effortlessness. There are chapters in here on great effort, sacrifice, division and correlation, impermanence, attentiveness, autonomy, and of course \\"nothing special.\\" For if you make something special, you have something not special; meaning you have created the world of all opposites. Don't worry about special or not special, as Zen master Seung Sahn would say, \\"Only go straight.\\"The primary focus present here is encouraging people in their spiritual growing, something we all urgently need in our all too often hectic lives. \\"The whole lot\\" in our lives becomes part of the practice of awakening to things as they are.

It is masterfully written with simple prose for anyone just entering the world of Buddhism.

The first reading stirred up my mind and made me very uncomfortable. Its a whole different way to look at everyday living. Joko teaches you how to &quot;see&quot; things as they really are. Slowly and with persistence, you begin to see who you really are without all the drama. This book helped to set me free. My husband and I would read a chapter everynight to each other.

Its really worth reading. thank you."},{"Title":"Nothing Special: Living Zen","review":"This is the first book of Beck's that I read; it was excellent, perhaps the best I have read about Zen. Beck is one tough old lady with a no nonsense approach to Zen practice. I highly recommend this book to anyone--veteran or beginner. What I especially like about Beck's approach is how she demystifies Zen. Zen isn't about some lofty bliss state; it's about being right here right now. Her practice forces us to confront and then accept the hardest koans of all--life koans from our everyday experiences. Anger, frustration, grief, these are materials of Beck's Ordinary Mind Zen. I loved it!--Andre Doshim Halaw"},{"Title":"Nothing Special: Living Zen","review":"When I purchased this book online about a year ago, I had no idea what a gift it would be. I was curious about Zen, but hadn't incorporated it into my life quite yet. I read pieces of the book here and there, and I soon realized there was something really incredible about it. It seemed like no matter what I was going through in life, reading only a few pages would \\"speak\\" to me incredibly. It feels like this book was written just for me, and I believe that chances are you will feel the same way when you read it for yourself. The book is so excellent that I decided to purchase it for my friend. Finally today I have finished this book, and I can't wait to read it again.This book is very down to earth. Compassionate, but brutally honest. If you will open your mind and heart, this book will guide you in transforming your \\"small mind\\" into \\"big mind.\\" I would say this book is equivalent to a Christian devotional. Definitely won't hurt to read one short chapter everyday. This book will continue giving, and perhaps you will too. :)"},{"Title":"Nothing Special: Living Zen","review":"This book really changed my view of why I'm meditating and where I'm going with it. I have a completely different visual analogy now, one in which I'm peeling away layers and layers of mental junk I've built over the years. And then nothing special happens. You just peel away as much of it as you can, and the rest takes care of itself. In other words, I'm not trying to achieve any particular outcome, other than the peeling away. There is nothing special at the end of this path, and there is no end in this path. What will happen will unfold on its own naturally. This is a difficult fact to face sometimes but the sooner you face it the better and Joko Beck's book really helps you understand this. The message is universal and simple. I'm Turkish and yet I doubt the book is less accessible to me or anyone from my culture as it is to any American. That shows how successful the author was.I've been meditating on and off, completely on my own (no teacher, no Zen center, etc.), with very strong resistance. I do not have a broad exposure to Eastern philosophy or Buddhism (I don't consider myself a Buddhist). While reading this book, I've broken through a good deal of that resistance because of this \\"better\\" understanding of what meditation is about. After a few years, I've finally been able to meditate daily again; and this shows again how successful the author was. As a result of my increased insight, I'm compelled to meditate and thus, the resistance has been naturally weakened; it's not a struggle anymore. I wish all of our actions were backed up by this kind of compelling insight.One caveat: I'm not sure if certain paradoxes or contradictions in Zen were explained as deeply as they could have been, and I'm not sure if they ever could be... But this also leaves room for you to do your own thinking.

Her husband, Gundren was killed accidentally by a horse, and her 14 year-old daughter, Echo ran away from home after the funeral. Grasping at straws for ways to get her daughter back, she signs up for a single parenting class at the local community college.The members of the class become like a family to one another, sharing not only Mary Lou's problems, but also their own, including abuse, estranged children, cancer and AIDS. Anne Hamilton, the teacher and creator of the class, finds she too is taken by this odd assortment of people, and is drawn into their lives.Gundren's family are gypsies, and they float in and out of the story like butterflies on the wind. Aunt Labelle, who keeps a bright green and blue parrot, is especially adept at offering accurate visions of where Echo might be found. True to her name though, no one can catch the ethereal Echo. And there's no bringing her home before she is ready.Roseborough is about the bonds of friendship and family; it's about finding inner strength and taking control of one's life. It's the story of what can happen when people open their hearts. Sit back and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Roseborough","review":"Ms. Woods has again captured the essence of small town life. While this takes place in Texas, it could be any small town throughout the southern US. The interaction of Mary Lou, her teacher Anne and the members of the singles continuing education class will leave you with the feeling that friends can help you overcome almost anything. And, when you learn where the title of the book comes from, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Everything from life behind the counter at Dairy Queen to a gypsy gathering are in this book. If you like Jan Karon's Mitford books or Billie Letts' Where the Heart Is, I think you'll also enjoy spending time with Roseborough."},{"Title":"Roseborough","review":"Loving, tender hopeful, and deeply spiritual.It's beyond words.Soothing, wise, this novel talks about the sounds of God, the miracles of life, the divinity of nature and destiny.It talks about letting your life unfold.

After all she was &quot;given to him&quot; by his friend whom found her hiding in the carriage that was attacked by another tribe. His punishments to her when she tried to escape or free prisoners would make anyone learn to hate him. However, once they found their feelings for each other (or should I say Katy realized her own feelings toward Iron Wing since he already claimed her), they ended up with constant struggles to stay together. At times Katy seemed spoiled and selfish, escpecially when she returned home and you wanted to shake her for this thoughtlessness really hard. But I was surprised when she changed her tune in favor of Iron Wing. I consider any book that can get you to react to it emotionally, whether it is good or bad emotions, is well written, I did finish this book in only 1 1/2 days."},{"Title":"Love in the Wind","review":"Love in the Wind was the very first romance novel that I ever read and it remains my favorite even now, years later! I found it very well written, and very emotionally provoking.Love in the Wind is an old western historical romance. Katy is the woman at the center of the story. She was once an heiress to her parents' farm, but decided to become a nun when her fiance was killed by Indians. On her way to the convent, her coach is attacked by rebel Indians and she is the only one left alive, only to be found by a group of Cheyenne. She is taken back to their tribe and is given as a gift to their greatest warrior, Iron Wing, and thus the romance begins. It's true that Katy surely should have learned to hate Iron Wing as she many times proclaimed, but love never knows what it is SHOULD do anyway. Against all odds the two fall in love, and then must fight beyond what they had ever imagined to stay together.Love and romance, humor and fun, horrifying and tear jerking, this book has everything. It is a truly good read."},{"Title":"Love in the Wind","review":"I loved this book. I like Iron Wing and Katy. Such wonderful characters. I didn't like Iron Wing at first but as the book progressed I found his unwavering loyality to Katy a remarkable thing. Katy was a somewhat spoiled girl that found true love with the proud but kind hearted(after a time)Iron Wing. I did have a problem with Iron Wing whipping Katy in the begining of the book but after that the book was truly wonderful.(though if some one whipped me i would hate them not fall in love with them.)"},{"Title":"Love in the Wind","review":"Oh! I am just in love with this book. I could not put it down. My favorite words were when Katy asked Iron Wing to leave the lodge so that she could put on her clothes and he said, \\"this is my home, you leave.\\" I loved the river description, the sensuality, even (yes, I know weird) the stabbing of Iron Wing. The sex abrupted like a volcano. Also, when Iron Wing saw his ex-girlfriend and stared at her nudity. I loved this part because if he had walked away, he would have been weakened as a man. All men stare and are curious at naked women. I hated when Katy was taken to the brothel, but life in those days was horrific for everyone. What I enjoy more than anything about Native American romance novels is all the manly men. They were not wimps. I enjoyed the courage, stamina and most of all the serious expressions which covered convincingly all emotions. I own many of Madeline Baker's novels and enjoy every one of them. This is by far my favorite."},{"Title":"CONTESTED TRUTHS: Keywords in American Politics Since Independence","review":"Rodgers'Contested Truths: Keywords in American Politics Since Independenceis an interesting exploration between political rhetoric and political norms.

It is a great resource, but at times you'll be reminded how much technology, networking, and business have changed since it was written. But don't let that get you down. It may help to remember how many times you've heard that Twitter and Facebook can quadruple your business, but you are left wondering \\"how?\\".Throughout the book the ideas listed got me thinking creatively. I have been using 7 of the \\"starter\\" tools to help clients figure out where they are on their branding/identity. I think it's refreshing to find a resource that gets us thinking of something outside of the latest and greatest, and that addresses today's economic reality for small businesses.

It is the type of marketing approach I used for years and I was pleasantly surprised when I found the Guerilla Marketing website. That gave me the chance to find other marketing techniques that I could use in my promotional work. In these tough economic times - it is more important than ever to find inexpensive and effective ways to market our businesses.First - you may be wondering: What is Guerilla Marketing?The concept of guerrilla marketing was invented as an unconventional system of promotions that relies on time, energy and imagination rather than a big marketing budget. Typically, guerrilla marketing campaigns are unexpected and unconventional; potentially interactive; and consumers are targeted in unexpected places. The objective of guerrilla marketing is to create a unique, engaging and thought-provoking concept to generate buzz, and consequently turn viral. The term was coined and defined by Jay Conrad Levinson in his book Guerrilla Marketing. The term has since entered the popular vocabulary and marketing textbooks.Guerrilla marketing involves unusual approaches such as intercept encounters in public places, street giveaways of products, PR stunts, any unconventional marketing intended to get maximum results from minimal resources. More innovative approaches to Guerrilla marketing now utilize cutting edge mobile digital technologies to really engage the consumer and create a memorable brand experience. -[...].As a business manager, business owner and promoter - I'm always on the lookout for inexpensive ways to promote - for my clients and myself. Let's take a look at the table of contents:Chapter 1 - The More Weapons You Use, The More Profit You MakeChapter 2 - Weapons for the Outset - (The Building Blocks to Get You Started)Chapter 3 - Weapons Not Recognized as Marketing - (Misc Items that Will Represent Your Business to the Public)Chapter 4 - Weapons That Begin With Attitude - (Elements of Business When You Interact With Customers)Chapter 5 - Weapons Overlooked By Non Guerillas - (Creative Ways to Get Promotional Exposure for Business)Chapter 6 - Weapons That Make You Easy to Buy From - (Ways to Make It Easy For People to Buy From You)Chapter7 - Weapons That Are Frequently Misused - (Tried and True Ways to Promote - That Many People Use Wrong)Chapter 8 - Weapons That Produce Instant Results - (Many Ways to Interact With Your Potential Customers)Chapter 9 - Weapons That Have Extra Fire Power - (Weapons That Cost More About Can Generate More Results)Chapter 10 - A Strategy For Using the Weapons - (Details On The Most Effective Way to Use These Tools)Those 10 chapters contain an arsenal of promotional weapons for your business. The book lists 100 weapons that you can use - and on page 12 - there is a list of 50 FREE promotional tools. Any and every business person should review that list before completing their business plan - these weapons are THAT important. Each and every weapon is explained throughout the pages of this book.If you want to use unique, creative and inexpensive marketing for your business - this is a book that needs to be in your office. I've had my copy for some time and it is dog eared - like all great books. It is a very easy read, easy to understand and even though it has been on the market for years -- the information is invaluable. It will also give you some great insights into the sorts of things that are Guerilla Marketing tools. I would bet you have used many of these weapons in your business - and you may not have considered many of these to be promotional weapons. Realizing that they are part of your promotion could help you to use them more effectively."},{"Title":"Guerrilla Marketing Weapons: 100 Affordable Marketing Methods (Plume)","review":"Anyone engaged in or considering starting a small business would do well to read both this book and Levinson's other writings on the subject.

There really is nothing new or groundbreaking in this book.

The concepts in this book were so basic, they were almost insulting. Maybe if you are 14 years old and have no prior entrepreneurial experience this is the book for you. I felt ripped off.

His historian's determination to separate fact from his mother's \\"storytelling\\" embellishments or lacunae follow the usual patterns of such explorations into the clash of contrasts. The Irish mom-meets-Jewish American dad that gave birth to White appealed to me, but reading the pages of life in Chicago in the 30s vs. his father's military stint made this book little different than a self-penned history of one's family by the designated genealogist in the clan. White does write considerably better than such amateurs, but what he writes about does not rise above the mundane or the all-too-familiar tales of peasant agitation, the old IRA, and the leaving of the village for the big city.His eye occasionally gleans the telling detail, regardless. A petition for citizenship reveals that the husband does not know his wife's birthday, and his guess is off three years. His mother is asked as a 16-year-old at entrance to the country if she was a polygamist. The legend of St Rita, patron of the Chicago parish his family lived in tells in its own moral that God shapes you up only then to kill you off. Jack Benny and Father Coughlan were the radio shows one never missed on Sunday.One detail shows an error on White's part: on pg. 23 he claims that his relatives had their baptismal names \\"Gaelicized\\" by the priest as Helen-Hellena and William-Guilielmo, but surely this is the customary Latinization found on many Catholic documents rather than a return to the Irish which would make Eileen and Liam?This book reminds me of a few others that have recently delved into the Irish-meets-American immigrant encounter. Thomas Lynch's \\"Booking Passage,\\" looking at White's North Kerry from across in West Clare, would complement White's book. His style in its spareness yet its eloquence reminds me of Henry Glassie, the folklorist who compiled \\"Irish Folktales\\" and chronicled a Fermanagh community in \\"Passing the Time at Ballymenone.\\" Finally, books like David Monagan's \\"Jaywalking with the Irish\\" and Steve Fallon's \\"Home with Alice\\" similarly compare Irish American memories with extended Irish residences."},{"Title":"Remembering Ahanagran: A History of Stories","review":"this was recently read on our WPRadio Chapter - A story that a son rediscovers the journey of his mother, a most naive Irish girl who lands in Chicago, about all those she lives with and then later of his father - who she only met 2 times before he proposed and she accepted - he tells it so tenderly. the father's family is Jewish and hers, Irish Catholic- and in that era, a forbidden match. but his mother Sarah finds her way in life overcoming many losses of relations with their disapproval- on both sides - he discovers who they were and writes it with a way of seeing then and now and all the weaving of the many characters that we all find in our family history.

From what I can tell, the entire series is based around world war 2, and there are many good transitions in the series from history to story.

I thought that this book met that expectation quite well."},{"Title":"The Defenders","review":"The fifth Helmsman book finds Wilf Brim as commander of the space port over the capital planet Avalon. As in the past book, Brim finds many adventures to get into with the help of his friends, the Emperor Onrad, and his enemies in the 'League'.As part of the continuing series, I felt this one was the weakest. As a thinly plotted remake of &quot;the Battle for Britan&quot; the rescues and adventures are somewhat tired and predictable. As an author, Baldwin has succumbed to the hazards of writting a series. However, that does not mean that it fails to carry the plot to a conclusion that leaves room for the next book in the series.This book is predicatable to anyone who has read the series. But it does carry the story of the Helmsman on to the next with Baldwin's usual mix of technical and piloting skills. Perhaps more interface with politics and the Emperor could have spiced the story line up a bit"},{"Title":"The Defenders","review":"I HAVE READ THE OTHER BOOKS IN THE HELMSMAN SERIES AND FOUND THE DEFENDERS TO BE AS FINE A READ AS THE PRECEEDING BOOKS.

Brim was a great character to start with but goes down hill after book 1 I guess Baldwin turns him into what Baldwin secretly wants too be, a Lothario who gets all the beautiful, big breasted women including wives plus the action becomes very predictable and unvaried. Brim flies, fights, takes a lot of damage, kills a lot of bad guys and a lot of his crews.Very uneven, poor continuity, terrible morals. I will not be buying the new book coming out this year."},{"Title":"The Defenders","review":"Baldwin takes the battle of Britain and rehashes it in space with &quot;Starfuries&quot; replacing Spitfires.

I am impressed with Egger's ability to cover personal intrigue in this case as well as the inner workings of law enforcement, and the pain of tormented love without being sappy. The story IS fascinating, a real whodunit! The book held my attention. I wanted to find out if Paul Dunn, a New Mexico police officer is an innocent man. Read it and decide! Was Monica Dunn's death a suicide or a murder? Great ballistics and forensics info! If you think you have heard it all with ballistics tests, you HAVEN'T! You will not be dissapointed with this book if you like true crime stories. I look forward to reading more of her work."},{"Title":"Grave Accusations","review":"A husband, seperated from his wife, confronts her at their home regarding abuse charges she threatened to file. The wife is found dead from a shogun blast coming from a weapon owned by the husband. An open and shut case? Think again.This book reviews the facts in the case from a criminal defense standpoint. Although it appears to favor the defense team's position, this is hardly surprising considering that the defendant was a collaborator in writing the book. Regardless, this is a classic presentation of a defense investigatioin. Despite the &quot;Psychic Detective&quot; nonsense alleged in the book, the author does an excellent job detailing the defense investigator's efforts in uncovering crucial bits of evidence for trial.This book provides a refreshing change of pace to the standard true crime novel which leans heavily toward the police investigation and prosecution."},{"Title":"Grave Accusations","review":"The book held my interest and even after over a year from the time I read it, the details still stand out.It seems that Andrea stayed close to factual information in both presenting the characters and the incidences. I would highy recommend it to friends who like mysteries."},{"Title":"Grave Accusations","review":"It is sad to think that a man like Paul Dunn can be charged with and taken to court for a crime he did not commit. I am glad that the truth came out and that he is with his children and hopefully doing well after all the media attention and bad times that he went through. I would like to meet Dave Pfeffer, the private detective who gathered all the information that was brought before the jury who in the end, freed Paul Dunn. I think I have seen him on Forensic Files and A and E programs. If I ever get into any trouble, I'm sure going to call him to help me."},{"Title":"Grave Accusations","review":"Grave Accusations: A Suspicious Death, a Husband's Arrest, a Fight for Justice--A True StoryThe late Andrea Egger was hampered in her efforts to write this book by a defendant who didn't want to trash the mother of his children out of love for his children. The book left out crucial details about the political influence and press influence Monica's parents had, and details about Monica's history and private behaviors before, during, and after the marriage. The book doesn't address the custody fight that ensued after Paul Dunn was found not guilty. Due to the press that the case garnered before trial in Farmington, there are still a great number of people in that town that believe a murderer walks among them. Living in Farmington at the time, I know the extent to which people in the town reacted to this case. While this book may not be the most beautifully written, it is a book that is worthwhile to read because innocent people do find themselves charged with crimes they never committed and the state has unlimited resources to prosecute and a defendant may not have the financial resources to investigate what evidence proving innocence is being withheldd."},{"Title":"Grave Accusations","review":"This was a wonderfully written book that was hard to put down.

The author never misses a chance to slam this woman in an attempt to garner more sympathy for the husband. Anything the husband does is described in the most flattering terms possible. Such a single-minded account does not ring true and the simple minded writing is annoying."},{"Title":"Grave Accusations","review":"I was totally taken in by this book. It has alot of detail of what really happend in the death of a young women who lived in the same area that Im from.

I have already recomended this book to other people I work with and to family."},{"Title":"Grave Accusations","review":"Wow - I've read just the first few reviews and wonder if maybe I read a different book than the others. Yes, the story is compelling, and I truly wanted to love this book, but the author's writing style is rather amateur, in my opinion. She repeated some facts several times - was it to make a longer book? Plus, in one line, she mentions Amanda, the deceased woman's daughter, as being \\"step-sister\\" to her mother's two younger daughters. Hello, she is their half-sister because she shares a common parent. Am I being too persnickety? Perhaps, but if I had paid for this book, I would have been sadly disappointed in the overall. The editor missed typos as well as spelling and grammatical errors, which made it difficult to concentrate on the story at times. And in stories such as this, it's so helpful to include an index so one could cross-reference all the characters involved - or at least go back to where they were first introduced."},{"Title":"Grave Accusations","review":"I was gone from Farmington, New Mexico when the death of Monica Dunn happened. I was teenager when Paul Dunn was a motorcycle officer with FPD.

As co-author of this book, it is clear that he tried (and succeeded) in making himself look the part of the decorated officer and public servant. Grieving former spouse, heartbroken father. While he admits to having been a less than perfect husband and mildly flawed man, he hides the fact that he was not a well respected member of the FPD (though many would only later admit to their disdain of Paul). His public oath to \\"protect and to serve\\" became his personal oath \\"to taunt and to menace\\". Before his work with the FPD, he was employed by a local retailer and those he worked with recall him being unpleasant and condesending no matter what the circumstance. The sad facts of this case are that he walked away tagged as innocent, his girls are without their mother, and Monica is gone. I am simply a former Farmington resident who followed this case, and by no means am I a forensics expert. I only know of my own unpleasant encounters with Paul and being of similar size and build to Monica, I can say this...I PHYSICALLY couldn't shoot myself with the type of weapon that Monica supposedly did."},{"Title":"Grave Accusations","review":"Dave Feffer is someone who manipulates evidence and people in other cases and has let other criminals go free.

The book is written to give you the impression that there was no way the husband would be guilty. It seems to me that there were things left out to give that impression.

Let me tell you some facts about it first. The copy you download free from Amazon is #832 of 2000 which were sold by subscription in 1922. They included 10 woodcuts which were beautiful and edgy. These woodcuts have not been included in the Amazon edition, for the same reason I think that the U.S. government banned this book in the same year. The dedication alone is amazing. It is insulting to almost every recognizable religious group, business tycoon, expert, glitterati, protester, do gooder, religious person,famous person, nun, frigid woman and literati. He evidently takes aim at people who don't know who he is, as well as his enemies. Then tells all of these people that he has so roundly insulted that he hopes that they never lay eyes on the wonderful phrases and gorgeous drawings in his book. The dedication was so politically incorrect, it would give a Liberal a heart attack and to all those to whom I recommended this book, I apologize if it offended in any way, shape or form. That was not my intention.THE PLOT: The plot of the book on one level is very simple; it is the descent into madness of Fantazius Mallare. Of course, if you really look at the book, it is operating on many levels. It asks such questions such as: What is sanity? What is madness? How do they differ? Do they differ? Can one undo a fact by denying it with one's mind? Is man more than the chemistry set that drives him? Is sex all that drives man, deep down? Does the brain really rule? Is our next step in evolution to be Gods? Can we choose to turn madness on and off like a switch? Can we create whole world's in our minds with people populating them? What happens when these people we've created don't act like we've expected? His descent into madness begins immediately as he explains his disillusionment and ennui with the current world and man's egoism. He decides to leave behind the world and dive into the reality he creates in his brain instead. He has enough wherewithal when he's inside his head to be able to walk the streets of the town without getting lost, or running into people he says no longer exists and that he doesn't see. It's a fine trick if you can do it - avoiding one reality while seeing and interacting with a different one. This is not a plot that twists and turns, it more goes over one hill and back down, then around the corner then up a bigger dale, and then back down. At the top of each summit, you think the vista gives you a view of what's coming, but you'd be wrong. There are surprises here - especially to Mallare! You have to cogitate hard, but once you do, you'll find the plot gets at least an A+.THE CHARACTERIZATION : The characterization in this book is primarily about Mallare in all his flavors of madness. That had to be difficult to write. Is he human and fleshed out? Oh yes! Absolutely human and fully fleshed out. So human in fact that his journal seems to be a real journal - so real in fact it could be a part of a psychological study. Mallare could easily walk from the pages if this were the '20s and say something witty or obnoxious or politically incorrect. The other two characters Rita and Goliath are real, but Mallare thinks they are phantoms in his brain. Their characterization is not significant, as what we are dealing with is all types of Mallare's. In his madness, he is trying them on for size - a God, a weeper, a phallus on legs, a worshipper at woman's feet, a smug watcher, a creator, a destroyer, a thinker, an observer, Mallare always Mallare. For characterization this gets an A+++THE PACING: The pacing in a book like this doesn't really matter. This is not an adventure novel or a thriller where pacing can make or break a novel, this is an intellectual examination of one man's descent into madness written like poetry. Even saying that, the book flew past. All 200 and some pages seemed like a novella, as I was glued to everything Mallare. Maybe it was the quality of te prose, the antics of Mallare, the tragic events unfolding - I know not. All I know is A+ for pacing.THE ENDING: The ending is anticlimactic. We see Mallare at his worst, weeping, suffering, begging for a specific thing to happen - which won't. Has he truly descended at last or is this another hill he's going over? The author leaves it up to the reader, or to the second book The Kingdom of Evil. Due to the ambiguous quality of the ending, and the fact that it leaves you thinking about all types of unanswered questions, I give the ending an A.THE UPSHOT: If you don't get offended by the dedication, when, if taken in the spirit with which it was written, is absolutely hilarious and you include the excised woodcuts what you have here is a work of art. I must get my hands on a hardcopy immediately. With prose like poetry whose cadence is like music, everyone in the known world should read this. Why it is not a classic is befuddling. I found an old copy of the Kingdom of Evil in an old bookstore in a corner on the clearance table for 78. What a buy that was - woodcuts and all. Without that, I would have no idea about Ben Hecht and his fabulous books. My recommendation to everyone is read them. Read them now! They are free at major bookstores. Oh, but skip the dedication in book one."},{"Title":"Fantazius Mallare, a mysterious oath","review":"If you are looking for something new to add to your Decadent Reading List, Ben Hecht might be what you need...\\"Fantazius Mallare\\" and \\"The Kingdom of Evil.\\" They are about as decadent as you can get in American literature. This is the story of Fantazius, who is probably insane, and when your main character (and part-time narrator) is insane, anything goes when it comes to the prose.This 1922 novella starts with a very long dedication that is no doubt the most bizarre and bitter and sarcastic one ever printed. The subsequent prose is not as bejewelled as Huymans, not as perfumed as Flaubert, not as crisp and witty as Wilde, not as surreal as Lautreamont, but it is dazzlingly poetic at times. You get your frequent shocking metaphors, your stunningly original similes. This is prose as interior decoration.\\"Red carpets, red tapestries, tawny vases of brass inlaid with niello; crimsons and varying reds struck an insistent octave of color around her.\\" \\"Her teeth gleamed like little deaths.\\" \\"My madness dresses itself in logic like a fishwife hanging rhinestones in her hair.\\" Your turn, Mr. Wilde!The philosophy is rather arch and overbearing. Does it owe a small debt to the Marquis de Sade? There is a thick overlay of Poe (is Mallare insane? does Rita even exist?). Are we dealing with split personalities? We get a lot of shadows and hallucinations and dreams that might not be dreams...or reality that might not be reality. Luckily, it's a very short and quick read.Is the text riddled with typos or did Hecht actually use those words? Is his thought a \\"see\\" or a \\"sea\\"? ( p. 98) Is it a \\"lightning\\" change or a \\"lightening\\" change? (p. 100) Is his body going to \\"warn\\" her or \\"warm\\" her? (p. 113) I'm very jaded, but I was a little shocked to encounter the \\"n\\"-word twice.Just as Beardsley did the famous illustrations for Wilde's \\"Salome,\\" we have amazing black-and-white drawings by Wallace Smith, who--we are told--did jail time for illustrating this banned work. (It was 1922, remember.)After the short novella, we get a (very short) short story by Simon Arrow: \\"Count Fanny's Nuptials\\" (1907). The back cover blurb tries to suggest this story was actually written by Ronald Firbank, but it clearly was not. The prose is just not Firbankian. It's more likely it was written by some first-year Oxbridge scamp who thought it would be a \\"delicious lark\\" to pen a parody of Firbank and try to pass it off as a legitimate work by him.Yes, it is decadent...with lots of lists: jewels, fabrics, character types, rare book titles, perfume essences. Wilde's Salome and Flaubert's Salammbo only WISH they could have come up with the names of all those precious stones! I actually enjoyed reading \\"Count Fanny\\" because it seemed like a parody of Firbank's \\"Concerning the Eccentricities of Cardinal Pirelli,\\" what with all the silly forced failed fluff and floridity."},{"Title":"Almost Innocent (Random House Large Print)","review":"I usually enjoy Jane Feather's novels. But this one really disappointed. It was very long, but only because I found it tedious to get through. Magdalen just seemed like the worst spoiled brat. I just kept getting very upset with the way the character acted and the choices that Magdalen made. The plot was a little outrageous, too. What 11 year old even thinks of true and lasting love? The leading male characters aren't even memorable. The entire novel seemed to focus on Magdalen's wants and how she was bound and determined to get it at any cost. It was simply ridiculous. My reaction once FINALLY finishing the thing, was to throw it out."},{"Title":"Almost Innocent (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book is not worth the paper it was written on. I couldn't even finish it. It doesn't take a lot to please me when it come to romance novels, but I'm sorry but this one doesn't even come close. The only good thing I can say about &quot;Almost Innocent&quot; is that the cover art looks nice. The characters are shollow and hard to believe. If your looking for a good read try &quot;Beauty Like The Night&quot; by Liz Carlyle. Now that's a romance novel."},{"Title":"Almost Innocent (Random House Large Print)","review":"I have read three Jane Feather novels (the Bride trilogy) and enjoyed them immensely. However, this novel was not what I thought it would be. From the very beginning, I didn't buy into the love story between Magdalen and Guy. When they started having an affair, (she was still married, but her husband was asssumed dead), I was fairly disgusted by the whole thing and I quickly lost interest in the whole book. Of course, this is just my opinion...but I was very disappointed. I liked the character of Guy, but I think he could have been utilized in a better way with a different type of heroine."},{"Title":"Almost Innocent (Random House Large Print)","review":"Magdalen was born of an illicit affair between a powerful English prince and his French mistress. She is a pawn in the struggle between England and France from her first breath, but all she knows is that she longs for adventure. When the handsome knight Guy de Gervais comes to escort her to her betrothed, Magdalen sees the one and only love of her life. Guy sees his responsibility to keep her safe until she can wed his nephew and fulfill her political destiny. As Magdalen matures into a stunningly beautiful woman Guy must fight his love and desire for the one woman he cannot have.The love story is sweet, but Magdalen is so afraid of losing Guy's affection that she defers to him on even the most mundane matters, so it's hard to see her as a &quot;strong&quot; heroine. Even though she is married to a man who truly cares for her, she has an affair with Guy without feeling any guilt or remorse. I prefer my heroines to be more morally-minded.Jennifer Johnson"},{"Title":"Almost Innocent (Random House Large Print)","review":"I am a rabid fan of historical romances. The more historically accurate the better, to an extent. A grown man having sex with a 13 year old girl is way to factual for me. I KNOW it's accurate, and so does everyone else, but a little girl REALLY??? Hate to tell you this but modern day people, especially women, are not too keen on reading a romance that involves a really young girl and a man old enough to be her father, heck back then, maybe her grandfather.Here's a clue, it's a romance. We read romance because we know most of it is fantasy. That's right fantasy. If you want to be completely historically accurate in all your work, because I've read other books of yours and that seems to be the tone; then maybe you should be writing history books and not romances.I haven't read Jane Feather in a very long time. Maybe I should give her another try since I've noticed her recent work is getting better ratings. But rest assured, if her recent work still has this \\"gotta be historically accurate at all costs, even if it grosses people out\\" then I'm done with her and my scathing review will be posted."},{"Title":"Almost Innocent (Random House Large Print)","review":"I had this book for over 8 years. And it was much better than some of the other Jane Feather books. Yes , Magdalen was a little self-centered. But considering the way she was raised. It really shouldn't be that surprising. She was yearning for love, her biological father John of Gaunt, did not provide much. And neither did her guardian Lord Bellair. As for the people screaming about the adultery..Oh please! That is very common in noble and royal people, even up to the current nobility and most certainly the royals. She did not want to marry Edmund, but was used as a pawn to do so. Since ,she had no real choice in the matter, it's easy to why she chose the path she chose. Of course, Adultery is not right, but come on, we all know it is done. Whether we like it or not. So stop being so judgmental people, it was only a book. And it wasn't uncommon to make political and dynastic marriages in that time period. Love did not play into the equation and you all know that. I loved this book, it was a page turner. I hated the Diamond Slipper and the others book with Pippa and her sister. Those books sucked..big time!I feel this book was unfairly based on the fact of \\"Adultery\\", and not seeing the underlying characterisitics of Magdalen. This book rocks!"},{"Title":"Almost Innocent (Random House Large Print)","review":"I LOVED this book.The first I have read by Ms FeatherNo issues, just a wonderful historical romance with an intriguing plot.A page turner from start to finish!"},{"Title":"Almost Innocent (Random House Large Print)","review":"I had lots of problems with this book: a theme of adultery was the main one. Some of my other hang-ups in this purported romance has a femme fatale lead female character (I refuse to call such an arrogant, disagreeable, and selfish character a \\"heroine\\") whose presence only men seem to more than tolerate and the women of her social circle view as a threat (Ms. Feather, don't men write that way about us enough?), violence between the love interests, and historical irregularities between the mores of the era and the VERY serious implications of violating marital vows, both criminal and religious.Even if she starts off badly, I thought a romance novel was supposed to have a heroine with some admirable and redeeming qualities, otherwise, who cares? The development of Magdalen, the lead female character, got worse with every page. When I find that I am rolling my eyes, shaking my head, and muttering, 'Oh brother!' every time the central female character has interaction or dialogue in a novel, that is not a positive thing. I resented, too, the author's reason's for Magdalen's unpopularity amongst her female peers (aside from the fact that she's rather dishy to their menfolk) are that she possesses an \\"inability to engage in gossip,\\" and \\"there was a straightness to her, an honesty,\\" OUCH! One reviewer noted that Magdalen's husband, Edmund, was a far worse player than she was and deserved to be cheated on, and indeed, he was a worse type; but I don't see how one character's roll in the smut OKs the loss of integrity in another character that the reader is supposed to sympathize with? That big scarlet \\"A\\" seemed to degrade everyone involved.To anyone who has a nodding acquaintance of Western European history, the plot is easy enough to follow, Ms Feather has kept the plot twists of court intrigue to a very manageable minimum. Her writing, as ever, is clear and descriptive. It is not as one reviewer (with rave reviews for this book) says, that its \\"wordiness\\" and the political and historical content \\"might be hard to follow;\\" Oh, brother!"},{"Title":"Almost Innocent (Random House Large Print)","review":"I first fell in love with Jane Feather's work with WIDOW'S KISS and went on to read some previous works. I picked up this one and was intrigued by the story line. After reading some of these reviews, I still thought I'd give it a try for myself. I love historicals, especially medievals and am very familiar with that part of history. Knowing that in those days girls were betrothed as young as 8 or 9 years old, her young age didn't bother me. It was the adultery I couldn't get my mind around. Let's be real. In those days, if it were known, she'd have been hanged or tortured to death. Eloquent prose is one thing, having a \\"heroine\\" commit the unpardonable is another."},{"Title":"Almost Innocent (Random House Large Print)","review":"ALMOST INNOCENT is a tale about love that survives and triumphs despite indescribable suffering and tragedy.Lady Magdalen, our heroine, is oblivious to her pivotal role in the silent struggle between England and France. From the beginning, her life is marked with brutality, yet the determindeness of new life: she delivered by her father, a powerful English prince, from the body of his freshly poisoned French mistress, who lays dying in spasms on a cold stone floor while the baby Magladen fights her way into the world. Magdalen grows up for eleven years enclosed in a stronghold until her knight in shining armor, Guy de Gervais, takes her away to have her marry his nephew, Edmund de Bresse. Although Guy knew her only as a child before he left for the war in France, he is tormented by a fierce love and desire for her when he sees her again after so many years. He is tormented by the fact that he loves the woman married to his beloved nephew.This story is an amazing saga. I was disappointed to read that some of the reviewers thought this book was boring. I think the sheer beauty of Jane Feather's work is in her words, the beautifully lilting and lyrical way she describes love, passion, and raw emotion. These particular characters were exceptionally well written as well. This is not a book to read if you want to skim just the superficial plot off of the deep inner meaning of the story. If you read carefully, you will be rewarded with being there to see little Magdalen grow up into a stunning beauty, and to see her affection for Guy de Gervais develop from a budding infatuation into an all consuming love. You will see how human beings suffer from the injustices of fate and the cruel coldness of politics. And you will see how in the end, through the tragedy and bloodshed, love conquers all.Of course, every book has negative aspects, and I do not deny that there were some parts having to do with beatings and violence that disturbed me. Plus, some of the politics and historical implications between France and England might be hard to follow, but everything falls into place as the story moves along. But overall, the awesome love and the richness of the characters more than compensated for the book's sparse shortcomings.Those of you who do not have patience for &quot;wordiness&quot; that deeply describes every facet of the characters and the essence of the story, this probably isn't the book for you. But other readers who are curious, please pick this novel up. Absorb Feather's unique language and you will live as these characters lived. . .and you will also be moved beyond words."},{"Title":"Almost Innocent (Random House Large Print)","review":"I picked up this novel in an airport before an overnight flight. I have enjoyed Jane Feather before. My favorite was The Hostage Bride. I find that after that her female characters have increasingly disappointed me. Almost Innocent achieves a new level of disappointment when a character with whom we are supposed to sympathize willing commits adultery. I read romantic fiction for the happy endings that are often unparalleled in day to day life. Although such an ending is provided, I found it contrived. Not up to par, even the bedroom scenes were left wanting. Not a Jane Feather usual."},{"Title":"Almost Innocent (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is the second book that I have read from Jane Feather, the first I didn't enjoy too much, (ALmost Innocent) but this one had a bit more promise. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that Guy de Gervais, the hero, beat Magdalen once when she was a child and then hit her again after they became lovers. Come to think of it, her husband hit her too. I also didn't like the fact that their story started out when Magdalen was only eleven. I felt that it was no the most ideal situation for a budding romance. I mean an eleven year old declaring her love for an older man, all the while being betrothed to another. Othe than that I actually found this book intersting enough to finish and hopefully I will find another book of hers that I will enjoy. Both characters were of noble blood in this book, but I am not looking forward to reading a book where the hero is an alcoholic or the woman is a ...

I think that Jane Feather writes well and she could have done better with the story. I hated the relationship between Magdalen and Guy, it grosed me out that she would cheat on her husband even though she knew he was alive. I felt so bad for Edmund and how his life turned out. I did not like the ending because it was predictable and it was unfair. I think that this book was okay and that people should read it only if they are bored out of their minds with nothing to do."},{"Title":"Almost Innocent (Random House Large Print)","review":"With &quot;Almost Innocent&quot; Fane Feather has reached another plateau in fine writing. This tale unfolded subtly, yet breathtakingly. I was absolutely enchanted. All of the characters, Guy de Gervais especially, and the delightful Magdalen, have such depth that I was emotionally bound to them and experienced both the joy and sadness that was in this wonderfully told tale. I have read nearly all of Jane Feather's books. Some are 5 Star, others are 3 Stars. This one, although written nearly 12 years ago is one of the best.

You can feel the heat from Guy's hands when he touches her...your heart starts to race when he pulls her on his knee. I have read the other reviews, and its not that I disagree (opinion entitlement) although I do wish you could have felt the way I did. I have traveled all over this beautiful world, stationing myself in England for 2 years.. and never have I read a book with such absolute detail and feeling for the time. The reality of Magdalen is that she is arrogant, she is strong, she is not of high intelligence (many woman weren't permitted to be in the 1300's) and she was betrothed. It did not disgust me when she made love to Guy. Edmund was not her hearts choice. You can choose to marry whom you wish nowadays. She had no say in the matter. This was as real as they get. Intuitions, fornications, death, sickness, jealousy, arrogance, and most of all love. You don't have to like who she is, although I did... Most people read romance novels to escape and read about someone they'd like to be like...completely impossible to be perfection....there is no such woman.

So here's what we get:Magdalen is born amid a betrayal of her mother, who was French, to her father, who is English. Because of her illegitimacy, she is sent off and raised with supporters of her father. When she turns eleven, she is shuffled to the care of Guy de Gervais, a handsome and chivalrous knight. Guy explains she is destined to marry his nephew, Edmund and she accepts it as her duty. Though spirited, Magdalen knows her responsibilities and expectations leveled upon her. As she grows up in the Gervais household she becomes even more enamored with Guy. Guy is happily married and has a huge brood of nephews and nieces under his roof, and dismisses Magdalen's attachment to him as innocent. Which, honestly, it is. But Magdalen is an old soul, and she knows in her heart she loves him. On the night before her wedding to Edmund she professes her love for Guy and tells him her arrangement with her fiance is ill advised, but Guy dismisses her.Years later, Magalden is grown up and married several years to Edmund. When a conspiracy unfolds to remove Edmund and Magdalen from the picture, Magdalen is removed to her husband's land under Guy's escort. When Edmund is attacked along the road and presumed dead, a romance between Magdalen and Guy reluctantly unfolds. When Edmund turns up over a year later, both Magdalen and Guy are forced to face their actions and emotions.Lawd, I had a time of it getting through this one. It started off intriguing enough, but from moment one the plot was one predictable cliche after another. Magdalen is a hard heroine to like, and while try not to hold that against her, I had a heck of a time sympathizing with her. She's just...meh. Bland. In fact, most of the characters are. By the halfway point of the book I found myself skimming through the pages. In fact, the last quarter I didn't really \\"read\\" at all. It was the \\"epic\\" conclusion involving a kidnapping and rescue in which only one of her men will live.

My sister-in-law recommended Jane Feather books to me since I am an avid reader of historical romance novels and I am sorely disappointed. This is my first and last Jane Feather book. The story line was not only predicatable, but it revolved around a selfish female and weak, pathetic men. Moreover, the infidelity and childish lust killed the story for me. I found nothing positive about this work and can't wait get rid of this book. Atleast I learned a good lesson in this."},{"Title":"Almost Innocent (Random House Large Print)","review":"And this book pretty much exemplifies that. Like the others I've read from Feather, there's much more than fluff involved. The characters are clearly at home in the setting she's chosen for them and they act as one would act in the circumstances and time period and not how one would act today. And you have to love a romance novel that's more than just sexual tension and consummation. This one had a good story, and that's what more of Feather's contemporaries need to learn.I'm always impressed at how her heroes are less than the perfect ideal compared to the standard, and Guy is no exception. Though there are times you want to strangle him for not being typical ultimately it enriches the story. Magdelen is as what's to be expected for the genre, a woman vs her lot in life, but she doesn't have that selfish nature that's so exasperating in other heroines, like the modern 90s woman trapped in some nightmare. Like Guy she ultimately does what's right for herself, her child and her country, even with the personal sacrifice, and that's what makes this story believable and the culmination is better for it. Nobody's perfect, and Jane Feather doesn't try and pretend otherwise.The secondary characters, as always, are as interesting as the main characters, and no one writes a more wicked villan than Jane Feather.Add to all this the fact that Feather has clearly done her research in respect to the medieval world and you have a romance novel that's less romance and more escapist.I'll add my voice to the reviewers who have said that this is not for the reader who wants something generic with flawless characters, nor one who wants to read about a period past through the presentist's eyes. And I'll also add my voice to that of the reviewer who says that Jane Feather should break out of the genre for a little bit and try her hand at a more general fiction novel."},{"Title":"Almost Innocent (Random House Large Print)","review":"It is puzzling that a writer as talented as Ms. Feather would consciously choose to portray her heroine Magdalen as such a self absorbed, narcissistic, ignorant, rebellious character with zero sense of morality. This is a disservice to women, both now and then, and one has to remind oneself that this tale is set in a period of time that was equally barbaric and chivalrous, at least on the part of the knights charged with the safety of the realm and its peoples.Magdalen's lover and protector, Guy de Gervais, is a truly nurturing and loving man despite the fact that he has at &quot;un pointe non plus&quot; slapped her to remind her that her wilful disobedience gravely threatens Guy's task to keep her safe from harm that was placed upon him by her father, the Prince John of Gaunt. At issue is an uneasy truce between England and France that governs the political balance of power and she is a major player.She is utterly absorbed in her passions and physical neediness, rendering her extraordinarily unlikeable. Yet, this may reveal the realities of women in that era, who is to say? The tale is a fascinating slice of history which makes it worthwhile reading for this fact alone. I do hope that in the future Ms. Feather makes her heroines more sympathetic, because, in all fairness, she is nearly as gifted as Guy Gavriel Kay in her ability to evoke the reader's deepest involvement with her characters which makes the story unforgettable on many levels."},{"Title":"Almost Innocent (Random House Large Print)","review":"I will not repeat the synopsis since it's right here but I will say that I never found the story to be boring and I really enjoyed the author's writing style. This is not your typical romance novel. There aren't steamy love scenes on every other page and the characters do not always behave sympathetically.This IS a story about adultery, so if that bothers you, you will never like this book. HOWEVER, it is worth noting that Magdelen never had a choice about her marriage. It was decided when she was just a child, and she did try and prevent it.Finally, lets be honest about Edmund, who is Magdelen's husband. Everyone goes on and on about how great he was and how he did not deserve what Magdelen did to him. Come on, maybe he was great for his time, but not only did he cheat on Magdelen with prostitues, he raped a woman who's husband he had killed. So, in short, he got no sympathy from me.Read this if you are looking for something other than a mindless boddice ripper. Although judging from the reviews here, most people aren't."},{"Title":"Almost Innocent (Random House Large Print)","review":"Like Chase the Dawn (another of Jane Feather's novels), Almost Innocent portrays the female lead, in this case Magdalen in a bad light. Here Magdalen is portrayed as a selfish woman, a temptress who causes trouble for men. But if you really see past this, Magdalen hasn't done anything wrong - she loved a man and warned him of her intentions. As for her beauty - it is hardly her fault that men love her. She never knowingly flirted or used her power over them. That is why she is 'almost innocent'. Guy, the man she loved since she was a child is a widower and looked after Magdalen as a child to marry her off to his nephew. Since her marriage, Magdalen has made efforts to make her feelings known to Guy and he has been understandably shying away. His sense of honour would not allow him to do anything else. His continual denial of his feelings is frustrating whereupon he forces Magdalen to deny the true parentage of their child who was conceived when he believed that Magdalen's husband was dead. His sense of honour is a likeable trait but he isn't portrayed as someone romantically in love with Magdalen, which is she is seen as the one who is at fault. She pursues him and he is happy to go along with the ride (when he believed her husband was dead), and this is what is missing from the novel - the give and take between the two. Magdalen loves Guy more than he loves her. It is not until the end when he really declares his feelings but that is such a shortchange compared to his actions in the novel. Not a bad book, but not my cup of tea. It doesn't have the right balance to make a truly romantic novel."},{"Title":"Almost Innocent (Random House Large Print)","review":"This is the first Jane Feather novel I've read, and I enjoyed it. It was well-written and had a compelling plot. Overall, I did like the heroine, but the adultery thing DID bother me. It would've been one thing if she'd truly believed her husband was dead, like her lover did, but she DIDN'T.I didn't have the issues that some of the other readers did. You have to take a novel set in medieval times in historical context. Children were beaten back then. So were wives. Men raped women.All of those things were very, very common Magdalen's times. It's like the outrage over the scene in the first &quot;Outlander&quot; book when Jamie beats Claire. It's just how things WERE back then. And they're distasteful to us, and I'm sure they were no great shakes then, either, but if you're reading a historical novel, you need to be prepared for historical reality."},{"Title":"Almost Innocent (Random House Large Print)","review":"I am not a romance fan - I generally find them predictable and well, silly beyond bearing. I had a copy of Almost Innocent in a box for years, given to me by a well-meaning friend who thought that my obsession with medieval history would allow me to enjoy it. I recently ran into it, and resolved to try to at least read a few chapters: I am a professional writer and wanted to look at how she handled the setting of the time and place.I was not disappointed. Jane Feather should not be underestimated as a writer. Her narrative moves smoothly and quickly, and her use of descriptive detail in setting the atmosphere of the historical period is very well practiced. I read a few chapters, and then another and another.As an amateur medieval historian, I did have some issues with a few details, but as a writer, I understand how terribly difficult it is to research a time period relatively quickly and try to cover all the bases a historian would pick at upon reading it. So for all the many things she got right, my hat is off to Ms. Feather. The major thing that bothered me is her treatment of religion. Priests are pests or idiots, and when she allows the papacy to legitimize an obviously illegitimate offspring because, according to the author's logic, they were attracted by the financial reward, - I nearly fell off my chair! There were crooks in religion to be sure, but there were many who were intensely loyal to its tenets, and this is pretty disrespectful to medieval clergy. In addition, John of Gaunt had at least four children legitimized as adults, however that was after he - many years after their births - married the mother (his third wife)- and it was for that reason the Pope legitimized their births. Why does this matter? Because for me, it is impossible to respectfully recreate the world of the high Middle Ages without getting a realistic handle on the role religion played.That being said, I'm surprised and amused by the many reviews of the book - here and elsewhere - that complained about the heroine's adultery. In fact, nobility in the medieval period was nearly expected to cheat, since their marriages - often made as children - had nothing to do with romantic commitment; in many cases, as in that of our heroine, spouses were gone to war or on pilgrimage for years. To impose 21st century morals upon the characters would be wrong. Adultery was often tolerated - indescretion, or moving outside of social class, was not. Perhaps I am missing some unspoken traditional rule in the romance genre - but as an historian I really appreciated the way Ms. Feather handled marriage vs. romance in the book. Again, my hat is off to her.I liked the heroine. I thought that much of her adult character was formed during a difficult childhood, and I loved that. One thing I hate about romance novels is that the heroine is always the same person with a different hair color. (Not to mention the hero.) Ms. Feather made heroine and hero both nuanced and interesting and multi-dimensioned. I was surprised and pleased, and it motivated me to keep reading."},{"Title":"Almost Innocent (Random House Large Print)","review":"I LOVED this book. It reminded me of the stories of King Arthur, Sir Lancelot and Gwenivere; the love triangle between the three. This was one of the rare occasions I've read a novel purposely slow - wanting to savor the story and enjoy the images created rather than just reading quickly to find out what happens. I loved Guy, Magdalen and Edward. I felt for all 3 of these characters - wanting Magdalen to appreciate Edward's love, but knowing she had to stay true to her heart. I was not offended by the \\"immorality\\" of her cheating because her marriage was arranged. It was never her choice to marry Edward. Had she chosen him from the start, giving herself body AND soul to him and then decided to cheat, then I would have had a hard time liking her character. As it is, I found this one of Jane Feather's best novels - it was powerfully passionate and I felt myself torn between Edward and Guy, much as Magdalen did toward the end of the novel. A great read!"},{"Title":"Almost Innocent (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book was very well written. However, I found a lot lacking in the main character Magdalen. I thought she was self absorbed and immature. I felt like Edmund deserved more than he recieved. I read historical romance when I am in the mood for a happy ending and I didn't get that with this book.Jane Feather did do a wonderful job of taking me where I did not expect to go."},{"Title":"Almost Innocent (Random House Large Print)","review":"I picked up this book since summary at the back piqued my curiosity, plus the fact that I love historical romances. But do yourself a favour and DO NOT purchase this book.Firstly, the \\"heroine\\" was no heroine at all. She had NO appealing qualities at all. Her motto throughout the whole story was 'as long as he loves me everything else is fine'. She did not give a thought about any one else except herself and Guy de Gervais. Stubborn to the point of stupidity and too passionate about the wrong kind of things.True, Edmund had some issues here and there, i.e. visiting prostitues whilst he was married and raping a woman during the war. But he DID love Magdalen, he just couldn't find a way to make her happy because she had rejected him before giving him a chance to even try and because of her infactuation, not love (yes, it's like that in the book) with Guy.The adultery didn't bother me overmuch, but it was her attitude and selfish ways that grated on my nerves every page I turned.No romance here, just lust and infactuation. The author doesn't spend too much time on nuturing or making the love grow between them and then strengthening it- it just is because a headstong girl of 11 years believes it is so, and the cause for that is because he made a small excuse for her to save her from getting into trouble with her aunt; \\"Magdalen fell in love with the Lord de Gervais at that moment\\". Utterly shallow, and unbelievable too.A good storyline with horrible characters made the book a total mess. Not worth reading even."},{"Title":"Almost Innocent (Random House Large Print)","review":"There was nothing romantic about this book. The characters were dull. The heroine purposefully set out to commit adultery and did so, without a modicum of guilt. This is especially disturbing b/c her husband, Edmund, was not a bad character at all. The hero is somewhat, just there,he's not compelling at all. The only thing that was notable about him was the fact that he only committed adultery/cuckolded his nephew because he thought he, Edmund, was really dead. Meanwhile, the heroine \\"just knew he was alive\\" all along and didn't give a care. When the heroine supposedly \\"grows into a woman\\", I find myself rooting against her until the end. She is amoral and immature. This book is a huge waste of time/money."},{"Title":"Almost Innocent (Random House Large Print)","review":"I could not recommend this book, the characters were just not ones that I could give a hoot about. Adulterous, selfish heroine; this book could've easily been half the size and virtually nothing crucial to the story would've been harmed--namely, because there wasn't much of a plot. Even when the big, spoiled baby heroine, Magdalen, finally beds her man-- it's such a let down! I kept waiting for Magdalen to get her richly deserved comeuppance, but I waited in vain. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Almost Innocent (Random House Large Print)","review":"I usually find Jane Feather books enjoyable, but this one left me very disappointed!

I just want a simple historical romance with perhaps a little history to set the scene but too much of anything is no good. I don't speak french and I didn't study old english so it was quite unenjoyable to read this book.

Then I read the back cover of Bold Destiny and it also sounds like it has the same story line. Of course they all have their differences but it's basically the same.

The characters' behaviour was in accordance of what we know (or think we know!) of the medieval times...Actually it is much more than a romance. It is definitly not boring (unless what you're looking for in a book is endless descriptions of passionate encounters between the hero and heron with few scenes in between)It's well done and it definitly shows that Jane Feather could and should venture out of the confining romance genre.

I really wanted to like them, but the impression I have is of some brilliant imagery in otherwise meandering poems. Maybe I needed to understand Ukrainian culture to get more of the references, but I think most English-language readers are going to be disappointed.One strange thing about the book is the use of a double period (..) to form breaks. They occur in both the Ukrainian and English translations but are never explained in the introductory material.One of my favorite poems is \\"Song 551\\" that starts with the wonderful lines:Before it's too late -- knock your head against the ice.Before it's too lateBreak through, look..You will see a miraculous world..\\"Song 352\\" contains the delightful image of \\"the poor hut of the horseradish\\" in the farthest corner of the snow-bound garden.The Maiden in the play \\"Friend Li Po, Brother Tu Fu\\" sings a beautiful song:Come in, my love, Oh kiss me..Your kiss will change the world into heavens..Come in, my love, don't be afraid of anyone,Come in, my love, Oh kiss me..Outside of a few few delicious moments like these, reading this poetry is more a chore than a joy. In the Foreword, George Grabowicz says that \\"Lysheha's is an elusive kind of poetry -- which may partially explain the reluctance, or inability, of critics to engage it.\\" Elusive is a good word to describe this poetry. I can see why the critics are reluctant.On the back cover of the book, the publisher quotes James Carroll who says that the poem \\"Swan\\" alone makes the book a treasure. He goes on to say that \\"Lysheha speaks through indirection...\\" which to me makes the poems difficult and tedious. Here is the beginning of \\"Swan\\":My God, I'm vanishing..This road won't guide me anymore..I'm not so drunk..Moon, don't go..I appear from behind a pine -- you hide..I step into shadow -- you appear..I run -- already you are behind me..I stop -- you're gone..Only the dark pines..I hide behind a trunk -- again, you're alone..I am -- you are elsewhere..Absent..Absent..I am..Elsewhere..I am.. absent..The poem goes on in similar fashion with double periods and vague imagery for seven pages. After reading this for any length of time I find that I too want to be absent.. from this book.."},{"Title":"The wartime journals of Charles A. Lindbergh","review":"Every so often my reading leads me to another book of the past that is out of print. I almost always find the book on Amazon.com, and if I am lucky, the book will be a forgotten jewel. Wartime Journals of Charles A. Lindbergh is just such a book. This is a magnificent journal, 1000 pages of narrative, that takes the reader from March, 1938 to June, 1945. The journal immerses the reader in Lindbergh's daily life as well as the history of the time, yielding a facinating narrative of events leading to WWII as well as Lindbergh's combat experiences in the South Pacific during approximately 1 year in the course of WWII. Lindbergh writes well, and he frequently spends a substantial amount of time on a daily entry, explaining what he was doing on that day and what his thoughts were about the situation. He has a number of entries concerning his wife, Anne, and the 4 children that they had prior to the end of the book (Reeve was yet to be born). There is much discussion about the family's life prior to the war while living in England as well as France. I was particularly interested in his many entries with regard to his experiences at Ford Motor Company during 1942 and 1943. His work there is not universally known; however, it was quite interesting and chronicles his continued position of being on the cutting edge of aviation.I found this book facinating, well written, and a real contribution to my historical reading. This is not necessarily a book exclusively for scholors of this period of history. It is a very readable, real world journal. There are many photographs, and a substantial number of noteable, historical figues move through the daily entries.Normally in reviewing a book, I exclusively address my comments to my thoughts about the book. However,I will mention that I think the review posted from the previous reviewer is a disservice to potential readers of this outstanding document. I strongly suspect that this reviewer did not read the book. His gloss over lightly is inaccurate and essentially is a criticism of Lindbergh's America First position prior to December 7, 1941 as opposed to a review of the book. One of his major points was that Lindbergh became a man without a country after his activities as a speaker for America First. This is not close to the truth. I might point out that Lindbergh's most successful book, The Spirit of St. Lewis, published in 1955, was a Pulitizer Prize Winner as well as a No. 1 seller on the New York Times best seller list for a number of months. This is generally not how the work of a washed up has-been is treated."},{"Title":"The wartime journals of Charles A. Lindbergh","review":"As for purposes of enlightenment, as usual the mainstream history of WWII is mostly baloney. Lindbergh was a decent and civilized man whose side of the story is both fascinating and deserving of hearing. You can't do better for your entertainment dollar than this"},{"Title":"The wartime journals of Charles A. Lindbergh","review":"One thousand pages is a lot of pages. To attract a reader's interest a thousand-page diary must be that of a significant person, a good writer, and one who had first-hand access to other significant people and events. It would add to the interest if the diary could tell us something about the author that we did not already know. The wartime journals of Charles A. Lindbergh do all of that - and more.A diary provides a window into the past. It gives us a contemporaneous view of an observer to historic events. In the final analysis, a diary provides us with insight into both the events observed and the person who observed those events. This 1,000-page diary achieves those objectives.Charles A. Lindbergh is known to most of us as \\"Lucky Lindy,\\" a barnstorming pilot who made the first nonstop transatlantic airplane flight in 1927 and, later, was an outspoken opponent of American involvement in World War II. Lindbergh's wartime diary shows that he was much more. He was interested in the arts and literature. He was an excellent writer; in 1954 he won a Pulitzer Prize for \\"The Spirit of St. Louis.\\" He collaborated in the invention of a perfusion pump, a medical device that was an early step in the evolution of open heart surgery. And as might be expected, he was highly skilled in the engineering aspects of aviation.Lindbergh was uniquely suited to observe important events between 1938 and 1945. After the notorious kidnap-murder of his infant son, Lindbergh was hounded by the American news media to the extent that he moved his family to Europe where he was treated like visiting royalty. He was a depression-era cowboy, flying his private plane to high-level gatherings in England, France, Germany and Russia. Each country made it a point to showcase its development of aircraft. Germany was far and away ahead of the others in this regard.As war in Europe became more imminent, Lindbergh returned to the United States and consulted closely with Army Air Corps General \\"Hap\\" Arnold, taking the rank of colonel. As international tensions heightened, Lindbergh resigned his military commission and became a spokesman for an organization known as \\"America First,\\" which opposed American intervention in European wars, including the supply of arms and equipment to European countries.When the Empire of Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Lindbergh tried to rejoin the military but President Roosevelt rejected the attempt. Lindbergh then became a consultant for Ford Motor Company and, later, for United Aircraft Manufacturing. In 1944, he was sent to the Pacific Theater of Operations to evaluate the Corsair fighter plane and the P-38 Lockheed Lightning. He flew approximately 50 combat missions against the Japanese, shooting down at least one plane. In 1945, Lindbergh conducted a two month tour (May-June) of Germany.The organization of the diary is excellent. There are frequent newspaper headlines to keep the reader abreast of general developments in that time frame. Although I normally hate footnotes, the footnotes in this book are very helpful in identifying people and events of significance.Two aspects of Lindbergh's character linger with me after reading his journals.First, there is the inconsistency between a person who wants to influence the general public and, at the same time, dislikes the public generally and the public news media. Lindbergh recognizes this type of fault in other persons, but he cannot see it in himself.Second, Lindbergh seems to gloss over the holocaust. It begins with his non-detailed pre-war comments about a \\"Jewish issue,\\" and later Lindbergh details what he has been told are American atrocities against the Japanese soldiers in the Pacific Theater. There are also negative comments about American treatment of German civilians at the end of the war. We are left with the impression that all atrocities are alike, be they against armed combatants or part of a deliberate plan to exterminate unarmed members of the general public. One wonders who Lindbergh is trying to convince.One also wonders whether the two substantial gaps in Lindbergh's diary served to obscure his views on this subject."},{"Title":"The wartime journals of Charles A. Lindbergh","review":"By the time WWII began Charles Lindbergh was firmly entrenched in the Isolationist movement and no friend of FDR's. He was confident Germany would defeat all of her opponents and rule Europe. He didn't figure on the Japanese however and once the war began however he wanted to contribute but not in uniform (afraid of Roosevelt ordering him to a cubby hole somewhere) so he found jobs testing aircraft and giving flying advice to pilots in the South Pacific. A brilliant but also incredibly naive man, Lindbergh basically found himself a man without a country only two decades after his remarkable achievements."},{"Title":"What a Life!

Pryor gives life to Barton, exposing her touching little secrets (she liked to take a nip now and then, had a romance with a married man &amp; dyed her hair) as well as her less-than-saintly personality (she was fiercly competive with other reformers like Dorthea Dix and really like being in the spotlight). Her two major accomplishment -- her battlefield nursing and the founding of the American Red Cross -- came about through stubborn sacrifice and a real dedication. She got done what she did because she was relentless in achieving her purposes. Her pushiness knew no bounds: she called on neighbors and politicians, asked for favors, used emotional blackmail and wasn't always sweet as pie about it all. Pryor's admiration for her subject is evident and she reveals Clara as a modern woman who used any and every resource available at a time when no one was inclined to support such activity.

She was AMAZING. The first woman to represent the US internationally, responsible for persuading the US to sign the Treaty of Geneva. She came up with the idea of the Red Cross performing domestic disaster relief (instead of just aid during war). On the other hand, she was a deeply flawed woman. Too focused on details, not capable of running a national organization, mostly excelled at working in the field herself. Had trouble accounting for donations right from the start. To me, it was reminiscent of so many non-profit leaders today--great visionaries and great at their jobs in some ways, but not necessarily great at running organizations.

Church. This work was first conceived and published in 1908 and fortunately for us, has been reprinted many times since that date. It is one of those old ones that fortunately has stood the test of time and is still with us. The particular edition I am reviewing here in the 1962 printing by The Macmillan Company and it has been illustrated (15 beautifully line drawings) by Eugene Karlin.I was first introduced to this particular book as a young child by my mother who read it from cover to cover to us several times. I found the story captivating, exciting and almost hypnotic at the time. It was one of my favorite. Later of course I read the \\"real thing\\" in High School and in fact the original Virgil's Aeneid was an important part of our Latin Classes, both beginning and through all four years. Later, again this played a part in my life as it figured prominently in several courses I took in college. I mention this just so you know I am a big fan of this work, and have been since I was a little tyke.This work of course is an intended sequel to the Iliad and the Odyssey and follows the adventures of Aeneid after is departure; after the burning of Troy. Church has stayed quite true to the original but has told this wonderful tale in a way that the young, I would say around ten years old an up, can fully understand and appreciate. Now do not make the mistake that this is simply a dumbed-down version of this classical tale; my goodness no! It is merely a retelling in language, cadence and reference that make it more understandable, more readable for the young. Nothing has been left out, the adventure and main thrust of the story remains, he has simply retold the tale to make it a bit easier.I do not recommend an adult who has read and understands the original work should take particular effort in reading this one (although I must admit it is enjoyable), but I do recommend this one as sort of a starter kit for classical Greek Literature. Lets face it, during these days we live in, it is becoming more and more difficult to get young people interested in this sort of literature and if it takes something like this, then I say go for it.This particular edition I am reviewing was illustrated by Eugene Karlin who happens to be one of my favorite artists and illustrators. Perhaps this is one of the reasons I am so fond of this work and this edition. The 15 line drawings, very fine line drawings, are so simple and so complex that you tend to spend almost as much time studying them as you do reading the book. Church, the author or re-teller of this tale, is a fascinating piece of work himself. He published over fifty books in his life time, many in this particular genre. In many ways, he was rather odd. Certainly a product of Victorian England (actually, a major player in many ways), he was able to project his writing around overly, at times, burdensome quirks of the Victorian style which makes his writing rather timeless. It is well worth the reader's time to do a bit of digging and locate more of his work, both for young people and adult.This book, along with the many other old Macmillan Classic Series, is one that I am glad is still around and I do wish it were used more in our system today. Perhaps if we look back at such offerings, me might be able to dig ourselves out of the hole with our youth we seem to have created for ourselves.Do yourself and your child a favor and get a copy of this one, either through purchase or at your local library. I think you will be surprised at the results. As a side note; The Baldwin Project is a great place to purchase this one.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"3 Ways of Asian Wisdom","review":"Three Ways of Asian Wisdom is a classic that should have never gone out of print. I read it over the period of about a month, not at bedtime like a novel, but over morning coffee while my mind was at its most alert because I wanted to fully enjoy the fascinating interplay of ideas.This book is a perfect introduction to these great religions without oversimplifying them. Ross writes with clarity about the historical, philosophical and cultural influences that shaped Hinduism, Buddism, and Zen. Her impressive depth of research into each of the three subjects gives her the detail and anecdotes which keep the book from becoming dry, and undoubtedly her personal experience has given her an insight which gives the work its immediacy.The fact that she discusses these three &quot;ways&quot; under the same cover allows the author to explain their influences upon one another. She also touches upon the relationship of Confucianism and Taoism to Zen. Many photographs of Hindu, Buddist and Zen art are discussed at length and constitute an integral part of her explanation of these Three Ways of Asian Wisdom.A beautiful, eloquent and stimulating book."},{"Title":"Dangerous Journeys 1: Anubis Murders","review":"Gary Gygax weaves a very interesting and intricate plot of magick and intrigue.

Magister Setne Inhetep was badly in need of a vacation. That's why the great Egyptian wizard-priest was less than thrilled to see the three high mages before him telling him of the potent magic and heinous murders that were spreading like mad through the most elite circles of distant Avillonia. The only connection between these horrible acts of violent magic is a stauette of the ancient Egyptian god Anubis- known to all as the Master of Jackals. It is up to Setne and his beautiful bodyguard, Rachelle, to unmask the true killer behind these gruesome murders and clear the name of their revered god. As he wanders through an underground maze of secret Egyptian cults and double-crosses, Setne soon finds himself enmeshed in a diabolical web of international blackmail and trickery, fueled by a powerful, evil magic possibly more potent than his own. And when Rachelle is kidnapped and Setne is accused of treason, it will take every bit of sorcery and cunning the sardonic Egyptian has to save their lives... and to keep the world from plunging into a darkness beyond imagining..."},{"Title":"PC Magazine Programmer's Technical Reference: The Processor and Coprocessor","review":"I think this is the best book ever published about programming the Intel x86/x87 family processors up to 80486.

If you're a skeptic demanding scientific answers to everything in this world - then you'll probably love it, but if you're more of a spiritual nature with the attitude that there are things in this world (and beyond) that science cannot reach - then you'll hate it from the very first page to the last. Or at least the sections demystifying the mysterious. And those sections come in abundance, so things don't look very good for the spiritual reader.Not to wonder, though, since Malcolm McGrath, a political philosopher at Oxford University, is 100% focused on the fact that there is NOTHING that can be called paranormal, magical, or occult. EVERYTHING can be explained using the tools of science, and magic and religion and more are nothing but delusions that were only acceptable before the Western world and its science was able to reject everything related to the paranormal.Still, people refuse to stop believing. And why is that? McGrath offers an interesting theory. In short, he explains how people, who all have gone through a childhood, all experience a period in their lives when demons, ghosts, and other supernatural beings and phenomena are very real. This period is later replaced, with he aid of education and experience, with a notion that whatever bogeymen one believed in as a child simply do not exist in the real world. But, and on this he focuses throughout the book, since one HAS believed in the supernatural, the memories remain, and since the memories remain, sometimes - for instance during stress or demanding situations - one cannot help but to unconsciously suspect, and fear, that the demons from one's childhood perhaps are not illusions at all.By using this theory (and in this review the theory is, obviously, extremely shortened), McGrath explains, among other things, man's fascination with horror movies, the tragic witch hunts that caused the death of tens of thousands, different \\"satanic panics\\" that have hit America over the years, and even the contemporary notion of evil extraterrestrials that regularly abduct people and subject them to painful medical procedures.We all live in an era when science \\"should\\" have replaced faith and illusions, but as we all know, that's not the case. And even though McGrath fails to fully explain why people believe what they believe, and not believe in what they not believe in, his theory still manages to be very fascinating and definitely worth considering. I mean, even the most devoted of skeptics has perhaps sometime wondered what would happen \\"if...\\", and McGrath demonstrates that that's simply part of being human.Demons of the Modern World is a rare thing: it's a hardcore skeptic's book, yet at the same time it has lots of empathy and understanding, and that alone makes it worth buying.

Having a graduate degree in theology I have seen more lifes ruined and redirected to the therapist's chair then I would like to remember. Belief is a strange thing and can be hindered by popular thought, suspicions, and control. The book kindly reminds us that belief is personal and is scientific in nature. Sadly it can be a bit of a fairy tale as well. It is this fairy tale that is carried between generation to generation, family to family, church to church, religion to religion that causes problems and generates a perceived truth that is not truthful.Religion if there is such a thing, God if he does exist, must be based on known laws that apply to the supernatural as well as the phyiscal universe in which we live.

Moving into the wrong neighborhood can often be both dangerous and unproductive for many outsiders (and even natives) who want to move to due to reasons relating to crime, finances, or proximity to jobs.Well the New York Times has compiled a book of essays about the area's best communities to live in, which should make the job of choosing the right neighborhood much more easier. &quot;If You're Thinking...&quot; provides plenty of statistical and residential information that will prove helpful to anyone looking for new communities in the city. Although the book is very outdated when it comes to rents (a 2 bedroom in story has shot up to $1,200 in 1999) and the author doesn't really cover the recent changes in the ethnic compositions of some neighborhoods (Astoria, Queens is becoming heavily Brazilian, Colombian, and Mexican; Riverdale in the Bronx has seen a huge influx of Dominican immigrants; Inwood in Manhattan has also a huge Dominican population; etc..).Overall this is a good book to review your choices before moving to the area, however I feel that an updated version is needed in the market.

The author breaks the construction process down into some 260 small steps, which makes it difficult to get confused or frustrated. It's apparent that the author had taken many students through the building process before he wrote the book. Then, once the canoe is built, he goes into great detail on painting and varnishing, where I was surprised to see how little I already knew.

It isn't even close.I was so looking forward to it -- Berlin just after the war, the Potsdam meeting, a man looking for the woman he loved. In Le Carre's hands, this would have been epic passion. In Kanon's, it came across as total self-indulgence. Perhaps this is because, although he's a journalist, he pretty much ignores the Potsdam Conference and the beginning of the Nuremburg trials.We also meet a number of Germans who worked in various ways for the war effort and the Nazis, and Kanon tries to present them as people with real dilemmas -- there's even a woman who turned in Jews who did it to save her child. A real dilemma, a desperate situation -- and somehow in Kanon's hands they seem trite and self-justifying and hollow. See \\"A Small Death In Lisbon\\" for how to present an SS member's problems.All in all I'm glad I borrowed this and didn't buy it."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"It is hard to understand why some people panned this book.

While the author is no apologist for Nazism, this intelligent angle forces us to think about how we (and people we know) might react in similar circumstances (and feel after the event). The plot, which involves the usual murder scenario, isn't too interesting in itself, but it does provide a way for the author to focus on the motivation of his characters, although we learn much less about the main character - the American reporter - than we do about the Germans.

Not a perfect non-fiction but a novel. Very compelling. I wish it had been longer."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"Joseph Kanon, The Good German (Henry Holt, 2001)Josepah Kanon's third novel is a grimly humorous little tale of postwar intrigue. It focuses on Jake Geismar, a wartime correspondent sent back to Berlin to do a series of articles for Collier's. He also has a hidden agenda: find his wartime love, a native Berliner who's gone missing. Complications abound from the get-go, including a professional relationship dangerously close to turning personal, a blowhard Senator, and the head of the nascent war crimes division, all of whom are staying in the same house as Geismar. And they get even more complex from there.Perhaps &quot;little&quot; isn't the word I'm looking for to modify &quot;tale.&quot;It could have been, though. While Kanon is deft enough at weaving his subplots together, keeping things believable, and providing enough suspense to keep the reader turning page after page, the novel's major failing is a sporadic lack of pace; sections of it, including the interminable beginning, crawl along at the speed of a quaalude-addicted sloth. Pieces of the novel could have been edited far more than they were without bothering plot or characterization in any way. The upside of this is that none of the novel's other slow spots approach the length of Book I, so if you make it through the beginning, sailing should be clear for the majority of the remaining time spent following Jake and friends around postwar Berlin.Postwar Berlin is not a nice place to be, but we don't expect it to be. Kanon is excellent at adding those details that allow us to develop a feeling of creeping tension even if Geismar is doing nothing but walking down a street in midafternoon. When he's firing on all cylinders (and he is most of the time), Kanon keeps us riveted; it's possible to lose hours at a time in here, even whole afternoons. The plot twists and turns, and Kanon throws us enough curve balls so that, even if we can predict the ultimate resolution of the novel, the stuff between point A and point B is still well worth reading.Recommended, but be prepared for some slow going, especially at first. ***"},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"I This is my husband's reaction to his Xmas gift.

They all have VD or bad teeth."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"\\"The Good German' by Joseph Kanon comes so close to greatness, one almost hates to quibble, but quibble i must. I see on the back cover the reviewer from 'The New York Times\\" compares the author to LeCarre, Greene and Orwell: no, no and no. And I hasten to add, I do not blame Kanon so much as his editor.I'm beginning to really dislike when writers rely too heavily on coincidence and this one does to an extaordinary degree. The hero, Jake Geismar, begins the story on a plane with a man he later finds shot dead in a lake. Why put them on the same plane? Why have Jake find him? This same dead man has helped the escape of the hero's lover's husband from an American detention 'spa'. The hero, by the way, relocates his old flame not by spotting her, but by following a blue dress he had seen several years before on his lover, but now worn by another. Whew, what are the chances? But luck is on Jake's side and the coincidences mount up.This all takes place in the ruins of Berlin very shortly after its downfall during WWII. And Kanon successfully brings us back there, which is no small feat. He also shows us the utter despair of the Germans who are just managing to survive. One of the book's main themes is trying to expose the guilty. As Kanon explains, if everyone is a criminal, perhaps noone is. And just about everyone is guilty of something here: the Germans, the Russians, the Americans. Maybe just the children are free of the stain, but the sins of the parents are, of course, visited upon their children.There are a few clumsy passages, as when Jake's lover nonchalantly says she had killed the Russian who raped her. Where did that come from? And some moments where the melodrama almost drowns the plot. Also, at one point he writes that a character snubs out a cigarette as easily as he would have a bug. What does that mean? As i said, a good editor would have done wonders on this book. The riches here are worthy though of a read and I look forward to Kanon's next effort."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"This ironically titled novel will disappoint those suspense readers attracted to Ludlum and the like. This is not a hold-your-breath suspense novel; it's an exploration of character, motivation and history. The author, through the reporter Jake Geismar, explores how Germans came to do the things they did during the war. Not content with that, he also looks at American complicity before and after the war -- particularly in protecting Nazi scientists in order to advance our atomic research for our post-war confrontations with Russia.Ostensibly, The Good German is a murder mystery. Jake finds a murdered American soldier and when the official version doesn't fit the facts, he decides to solve the murder. Someone reading merely for the mystery will be frustrated by the twists and turns and meandering path to an anti-climactic solution. However, the anti-climax of the solution is very much to the point - Geismar realizes that all are tainted by the war. There is no outrage for the murder - only his own willingness to use his knowledge for his own purposes -- the solution to the mystery an exemplar of what he has learned about our own complicity in protecting Nazis, about the Germans he has known in the past participating in the war and the Holocaust and the entire moral morass that war inevitably becomes.Only two characters survive untainted by compromise and corruption - an American Jew who is gathering war crimes evidence for the Army and the father of one of the Nazi scientists. Everyone else, from his lover, his colleagues, the Russians, the Americans and the Germans he had known before the war and most of all, Jake, himself are tainted."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"&quot;The Good German&quot; is set in Berlin in the weeks between V-E and V-J day and is very accurate as to the chaos in Germany as this veteran recalls. The author does not alter historical facts, he simply uses his imagination to weave a story around events. Dr. Wernher von Braun is not a character in the novel but the story line is his attempt to locate and destroy the SS records that implicate him and his rocket team in war crimes. I won't give the story away but will say that Kamon has done excellent research for the book."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"The novel takes place at ground zero of the end of the European war-the gutted Reichstag building, Hitler's bunker and the Brandenburg Gate. This Berlin is a rubble-strewn wasteland riddled with drunken Russian and American occupations troops, many scavenging for souvenirs and female companionship. More destitute refugees pour in everyday. In the middle of this maelstrom, an American reporter for Collier's Magazine--Jewish--arrives. He lived (and loved) in Berlin before the war, leaving the city when he still could, and leaving behind the woman he loved. He returns determined to see if she has still survived.It is next to impossible to find anything sensible written about what Germans could have done once they learned about the Nazis' campaign to rid Europe of all Jews. Most authors on this subject have sharp ideological axes to grind, and hector the reader on how heroic they would have been in similar circumstances-failing only to mention that they would also be dead. Kanon takes many stabs at this volatile subject from the point of view of a number of the German and a few Jewish survivors. Unlike lofty modern moralists, the narratives of the inhabitants describe their individual situations which are as varied as their fallible characters. One wonder of this nuanced work is that-just as in real life-only one of Kanon's characters can make a solidly convincing case for innocence or guilt--an attractive Jewish Greifer (\\"nabber\\") who was forced by the Nazis to seek out and turn in Jews still hiding in the City.In this soot-laden atmosphere of besotted soldiers still firing randomly into skulking civilians, and where death from starvation is an ongoing routine, the reporter stumbles on a puzzling murder of an American corporal. It is a rare moment when the sins of the past surface too explicitly to prevent this fast-paced detective story from seizing the reader's imagination, and running with it to an imaginative and satisfying climax.As someone who lived in Berlin in 1945-46, the scenes of devastation, of the human misery and the brutal arrogance of the Soviet occupation ring as true as anything I've seen or read. The story is filled with a cast of interesting and some hateful characters, many well-developed. The story is never plot-dictated, although the cleverness and daring of the hero occasionally verges on the unlikely. Nevertheless, a rousing tale with a complicated but finally deeply satisfying love story."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"A thoroughly captivating read about a piece of history that has been largely swept under a convenient carpet. I confess that I had never actually thought what it must have been like in Berlin just after the war -most histories seem to end with April 1945 &amp; pick up again (with a strong US emphasis) at the Berlin Airlift. Here Kanon gives us a somewhat nightmarish answer to the old question &quot;Where do you go when the record is over&quot;. The strengths of the book are mainly the glimpses we get of the destroyed city and its inhabitants (both The Girl and The Father-in Law are well portrayed) and the moral ambiguousness of everyone involved, the weaknesses oddly enough are the hero -who is just TOO good to be true-and the actual murder mystery around which the plot turns. By about 2/3 of the way through I had given up caring about just &quot;whodunnit&quot; &amp; by the end I had to check back to the begiining to sort out just who was who, but this didn't really matter. I felt like I had been given new insight into the price of victory and new questions that begged further research. I strongly reccomend reading THE ROCKET AND THE REICH as a non-fiction companion to this novel, but even withoutmuch background, I doubt that you will find this book easy to put down or to forget. Finally, as a scientist I found that the book raised again important questions about the &quot;purity&quot; of science and the endless temptation of a moral vacumn. We got teh A4, von Braun and eventually the moon. What did we lose?"},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"I found this novel to be fascinating from the start. The rich detail of Canon's language captured the utter devastation of post-war Berlin and brought me immediately into the heart of the story. \\"The Good Geman,\\" as with most good novels, works on a variety of levels; this one has an amazing number of plots and characters: the mystery of who killed the soldier who washes up on the shore in the middle of the Potsdam Conference, at the very feet of the victors; the story of the American journalist and his married German lover, as well as her scientist husband (is he or is he not a Nazi?); the German Jew who turned her fellow Jews in to the SS to save her mother and her child; the myriad of personalities and stories, for better or worse, brought together because of war; the moral enigma involved in dividing the spoils of a devastated country whose defeat no one is sorry for; and the strange bedfellows which are formed and who are forced to deal with one another to effect the final victory. The roots of the Cold War are brought to the surface and revealed here, with Russians, Americans, British and Germans all playing a game of cat and mouse in an attempt to gain the upper hand. You get the sense that no one will win this one. From the desperate Germans who sell everything from their bodies to their dishes in order to survive, to the smug military men who have no qualms about buying whatever they want with their cigarettes, the people who populate this bleak landscape look with horror to the past and with trepidation to the future.I found the story sometimes confusing, so much detail and so many questions. But I stayed with it and was satisfied. An excellent effort. Asked many interesting questions that I am still thinking about. But I am fascinated by moral ambiguity and this novel is full of that."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"A very unsatisfying book with a very interesting setting. The portrait of the immediate aftermath of WW2 in Berlin is excellent but the story is drawn out much longer than necessary. The writing is OK but the characters are unappealing, especially the main character, whose joylessness is monotonic in the extreme. You don't expect a story set in war-devastated Berlin to be a boffo laff riot but you can expect some spirit, some elan and energy."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"This is a book in which the main character, Jake Geissmar, is so unsympathetic that one wishes he would get killed.There is a great sense of time and place -- the only worthwhile part of the book -- but you can get this from any good history book. The characters are wooden and unappealing, and the actions of Jake are really not believable. The drama is created by the time and the place, not the plot which is weak and drawn out excessively. This is more the stuff for a short story but I doubt if Kannon could write a good short story.Give this one a miss."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"I LOVED Joseph Kanon's first novel, &quot;Los Alamos,&quot; in which phyisicists who were communists helped us build the bomb, but not all were spies. There was irony, atmosphere and a great mystery.Ever since, however, Kanon has self consiously tried to slop on the irony with a trowel. His last book, &quot;The Prodigal Spy&quot; could have (maybe it was?) been written in 1975. It certainly hearkened back to the old anti-anticommunist thrillers written before Venona was declassified, or KGB documents saw the light of day.He continues this trend in &quot;The Good German,&quot; in which a war weary, hardened journalist is SHOCKED, SHOCKED, that we would use German rocket scientists, despite their war record. At first, you think Kanon is going to consider this action morally ambiguous, as he lays the foundation that underlings had little choice about what they did under Nazi tyranny.But once things get moving, they get silly, and so does our hero's outrage. Hey, we just spent four years as an ally of the OTHER cruelist regime of the period, but he's stunned we would use a few German scientists?Some readers have complained at the slow pace, but the stuff where Jake finds his long lost love in the ruins of Berlin is at least better than the silly action plot and simple minded preaching of the last third of the book.This book really wants to be a post war &quot;Casablanca,&quot; but it's not as moral there, either. The lovebirds get to have their caks and eat it to, as hubby turns into super-Nazi in the last act, and this works as sort of a justification for the fact she was cheating on him before the war-- even though he seemed a nice enough guy.Something tells me Kanon got a lot of flack at Manhattan cocktail parties for admitting the presence of Reds at Los Alamos, and has been doing penance ever since by making anticommunistm seem the illegitimate stance. The problem is, that argument has been settled over the last decade, and NO new scholarship is on his side."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"The Good German is another murder/suspense story by Joesph Kanon set during an interesting time in history. A suspected black marketeer is murdered during the Potsdam conference in the closing days of WWII. There are interesting descriptions and details of the state of Berlin and the uneasy alliance with the Russians at the onset of the Cold War. Although the plot is not exactly the same as \\"Los Alamos\\", similarities exist with characters involved in a love triangle with a technical back drop (rocket scientists this time). Given the title, I think the author was attempting to provide a Nuremburg-style analysis of German behavior during the war. Who really knew what the Nazis were doing, could the average citizen have done more to stop the genocide, etc.? If you have Werner Von Braun and his team on a pedestal, you might not like this book. Like other efforts by this author, it's too long by at least a 100 pages. He also has a writing style that frequently intermixes character dialog with inner voice commentary that I find difficult to follow at times."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"Kanon's description of post-war Germany was fascinating & he might make a good history writer, but his prose is hackneyed. This plot rambles & fails to engage. It is difficult to follow & doesn't motivate one to make the effort to do so. The \\"love\\" scenes read like technical writing & the protagonist, Jake, is constantly directing his lover's gaze towards his manly, reassuring words with his finger under her chin. If that happened to me that many times, I'd bite the directing digit right off!I ended up skimming the last quarter of the book just to get it over with."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"This book perhaps took on too much: a historically-rich setting, a huge cast of characters, and a plot that was so complicated that it lost me dozens of pages before the end. I really wanted to like this book, and at times I did, but overall, I just couldn't. This book read like a Hollywood thriller. Not at all surprising that it was made into a film. I am curious to see it, and think it might be one of those rare exceptions where the movie is better than the book. I hope so..."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"Four hundred and eighty one pages but The Good German seems much, much longer.Flat, unconvincing characters talk and talk and talk page after page, spouting dialogue as unconvincing as it is lengthy.This is movie of the week material. Berlin is NOT brought to life convincingly at all and in fact I grew tired of yet another description of the piles of brick which made up the city there in mid-1945.One problem I had is that the characters are so poorly rendered it was impossible to muster much enthusiasm for their travails. The Americans are indistinguishable from one another and Jake Geismar (the 'hero') himself is far too sketchily drawn (no small feat when he appears on each of the 481 pages) to be of any interest at all.Save your money (and save a big hunk of time) and buy the Alan Furst books. Infinitely better reads."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"AFTER READING THE NY TIMES REVIEW, I HAD TO READ THIS BOOK..AND I FOUND IT TO BE LESS EXCITING THAN I EXPECTED..THE COVERAGE OF THE POST-WAR SCENE IN BERLIN WAS GOOD ,BUT THE AUTHOR CIRCLED AROUND THE STORY FOR SUCH A LONG TIME THAT IT BECAME BORING.TOO MANY CHARACTERS THAT I DIDNT CARE FOR AND HAD LITTLE INTEREST IN..LENA AND JAKE WERE SYMPATHETIC CHARACTERS, BUT AS A PREVIOUS REVIEWER SAID, ONE COULD NOT CARE VERY MUCH FOR THE DEAD MAN PRESENTED IN THE START OF THE BOOK."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"\\"The Good German\\" by Joseph Kanon, Audio Tape read by Stanley Tucci.Simon & Schuster, New York, NY 2001.Although billed as murder mystery/thriller, this book is really an attempt at in-depth analysis of the actions of the United States at the end of the Second World War, when the seeds of Cold War were planted. Were Americans truly so set on reaping the dollars (marks) that they ignored the implications of a Communistic Russia? Set in the hot weather of the Potsdam Conference, July/August 1945, author J. Kanon uses his skills to develop a word picture of a bombed-out, destroyed Berlin. Kanon portrays the scenes as \\"you are there!\\" descriptions of the ruined capital city of the Third Reich, as the gun fights and car chases carry the chief character, Jake Geismar, in and out of harm's way.Jake Geismar is a realistic portrayal of the jaded correspondent, who came to Berlin during Hitler's Olympic Games. Geismar had stayed on to report the historical events, fell in love with Lena Brandt, and all this serves as the foundation for his return to a conquered Germany and the events of 1945.An over-riding theme is Geismar's continued attempt to understand how an educated and cultured Germany could have tolerated, no, more than tolerated, ...how the Germans could have joined in the crimes of the Nazis. This guilt-seeking theme slows the book, but is necessary for the final resolution when the murderer of Lt. Tully, the American Army officer, is identified.There are some logistical questions, such as how a person (Geismar) can operate an old-fashioned manual typewriter, when his arm is in a cast, and how the little German boy, Erik, (three years old) is able to understand not only his native German, but also English ... so much so that the boy is taken out of the hospital room to avoid hearing details.The reader of the audio version, Mr. Stanley Tucci, does a fine job with what we usually consider German accents, and he has fine characterization of both female and male personages, so you think you are really hearing dialogue between actors. I enjoyed this audio book as I drove Interstate 495 around Boston, in my daily commute."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"The setting is Berlin, 1945, summer. Bombs and the Russians have destroyed much of the city. Jacob Geismar, a member of the working press, is back in Germany. He had been one of Murrow's boys. Now Jake has an arrangement to produce articles for COLLIER'S. Truman, Stalin, and Churchill are scheduled to meet. Everywhere there is a bad smell. The forest of Tiergarten is gone, burned.Jake wonders about a friend, Lena. As Jake was leaving Berlin in 1941, Lena decided to remain and stay with her husband. Lena's full name is Helene Brandt and her husband, by 1944, joined the Nazis. The husband is a scientist.The military government for Germany seeks to achieve demilitarization, de-Nazification, decartelization, and democracy. People are starving. The official ration is fifteen hundred calories, but it is really closer to twelve hundred. There is no coal and winter is coming. Bernie Teitel is a DA. He is part of the war crimes prosecution group. His parents got him out of Germany to survive. At Potsdam Jake sees all three of the leaders.There is a mystery. Tully, an American, is dead in the Russian Sector with lots of cash on him. Jake is told that there is no Scotland Yard present to find out why the man was killed. (There is no functioning government since the Germans resisted to the end.) The Russians handed over marks equal to about five thousand dollars with the body of Patrick Tully of Natick, Massachusetts, an air force man. (The United States is actually paying for the Russian occupation.) It is learned that Tully came from Frankfurt to see someone in Special Branch.Jake finds someone to look for Lena, and later finds someone to look into the death of Patrick Tully, a former German policeman, Gunther Behn. When the occupying forces play football, Jake feels homesick.The book has all the elements of a good story. There is the background, it is very dark. The geography of Berlin is given is great detail. There are mysteries, complications. The characters are the sorts of people it would be fun to meet. The writing is smooth, accomplished. The set-up is very nearly elementary. A media specialist seeks to relive the days he spent abroad before the fighting really commenced. He is something of a saviour to the war-weary, but shocks everyone has experienced are bound to have impact.The plot is intricate and as such is a real page-turner. The context is fraught with moral and ethical possibilities. At some level, respect for the Holocaust, as an event, may be better shown in a posture of silence."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"Kanon is able to discuss the troubling ethical dimensions of post-war Germany. His picture of Berlin is gritty and compelling."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"\\"The Good German\\" is set in post-World War II Berlin, a place of espionage, dirty tricks, black market activities and human suffering. A murder takes place in 1945 as the Allied leaders are gathering for their Potsdam conference (an American officer's body is discovered floating in a lake in the Russian occupation zone, his pockets full of money.) But more than just a murder mystery, there are larger themes in the book, such as collective guilt, a society that succumbed to genocide, and the justice of the victors. The book's main character is an American who is involved in a love triangle, a situation somewhat reminiscent of \\"Casablanca.\\" Although I found the book to be a moving portrait of a city down on its heels and its luck, where corruption and violence are commonplace and where even the innocent may be compromised, overall it unravels. Conveniently, the hero always seems to be in the right place at the right time as well as bulletproof. And the car chase absolutely defies belief!"},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"The Good German is a great mystery/thriller. The action takes place in Berlin immediately after the end of WWII, at the time of the Potsdam conference between Russia, the US and Great Britain. The main character is drawn by a mysterious murder that nobody seems interested in solving. Along the way he finds his long lost love, who happens to be married to a German scientist.The mystery is engrossing. What is more valuable in the book, however, is the moral discussion of how normal people get involved in a monstrocity as the Third Reich and how these normal people deal with the guilt they feel afterwards. This is not an easy task, and the reason I give the book 5 stars is because I think Kannon is amazing at balancing both aspects of the book. He is not preaching to anybody while conveying a pretty complicated message-- everyone has their own share of guilt but the winners of the war, despite feeling morally superior and justified, were sometimes more immoral than the people they were trying to judge."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"Bernie Teitel reminds Jake Geismar that the Berlin he's returned to in the opening days of the post-war era is a risky place. Jake has taken advantage of his life as a war-time correspondent to return to Berlin on dual assignments - one by a magazine to cover the Potsdam Conference, the other a self-imposed one to seek out a former lover. His quests are impaired by Berlin's condition. Security hampers the first and the city's devastation challenges the second. He overcomes the obstacles to the first only to find the body of a murdered American soldier - a discovery made yet more mysterious by the amount of money the corpse was carrying. Pursuing the story behind this killing leads Geismar through the rubble of Berlin - both physical and moral. Berlin, former Nazi capital, shattered by bombs and shells, ruled by four invading nations, rife with black-markets, inhabited by people struggling to survive, is nearly a character in its own right.The rendition of Geismar's story is presented in so compelling a manner that you feel every nuance of his frustrations and shocks. Every character seems to offer issues you feel compelled to offer a personal response. He confronts us with many of the fundamental questions. What's right and what's wrong? What is the true cost of survival under totalitarian regimes? How much would you sacrifice for friends or neighbours? Clearly, Kanon will accept no absolutes on these questions. There are countless \\"gray areas\\" and just when you feel you can cope with the questions, \\"there's always something worse.\\" You are an outsider in the Berlin of 1946, but tomorrow it could be where you are now.The city's ruin is distressing to Jake as he hadn't seen the impact of \\"strategic bombing.\\" The physical ruins, however, prove as nothing compared to the impact of Nazi policies on the populace. Jake discovers Nazis where he least expects them. Even worse, he learns an old friend was compelled to become a \\"greifer,\\" a Jew who identifies other Jews for the Gestapo. Geismar is also confronted by the Allied wish to overlook the role of some Nazis in order to put them to use for scientific and commercial ends. Kanon leaves no stone unturned in his ambition to paint a vivid and accurate picture of post-war Berlin. He does a stunning job of it, without overwhelming the reader in irrelevant details.Jake finds his abandoned lover, perhaps the only implausible event in the book. It's a small matter, however, as Kanon flawlessly carries the reader along in his historical journey. Although the murder almost sinks from sight as Kanon develops his persona, it remains the key to many of Greismar's encounters. The solution to the murder brings all the elements together. Kanon does more than exhibit his abilities at historical research. He delves into human feelings in ways few \\"mystery\\" novels can achieve. As he leads Greismar through the tortured city he confronts new realities of life under the Nazis and Allied greed. Right and wrong are increasingly blurred. Kanon has achieved a new level in the \\"mystery\\" genre."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"The end of World War II and the convergence of beliefs and philosophies in occupied Berlin still fascinate history buffs. Enemies became friends, and friends became enemies as the pendulum of power swung from fanatic Nazis to conspiratorial allies on the verge of cold war.Joseph Kanon takes this setting and creates a murder mystery that gives new insight into the reality of history through the experience of ordinary people. Through the lambrinth of espionage emerges tough choices and cynical trade offs that bring new meaning to the phrase: \\"Let the end justify the means.\\" This story is a wake-up call to those blinded by naive patriotism. When do the vanguished become the victimizers? In today's war on terrorism, it is a question to be reconsidered through a historical perspective, and Kanon makes readers face the rhetoric."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"This book blew me away. Being a German and used to be depicted as the \\"bad buys\\" I was intrigued by the title and not disappointed.I found a lot of truths about the time after the WWII from what my parents and grandparents told me (from their experience) and for me it was a page turner.And, I was very impressed with the ending of the book, which is contrary to the movie they made, based on it."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"This book was hard to get into - lots of war-time political banter in the beginning. But after the first few chapters the plot takes form and the story takes off and hooks you..."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"Of the three novels Kanon has written, this is by far the best. He keeps getting better with every novel. The characters have depth, the settings are vivid, the dialogue is great, so natural. Mystery story aside, the real meat of the book lies in its who-to-blame frustration, its search for a moral code that makes sense. It would have been easy to make me either agree or disagree with the \\"Supposed Nazis\\", but I felt sorry for them at times. Knowing they had done horrible things to their fellow human beings, but pitying them at the same time, because they were forced to do as much. Or were they? Could they have made a choice? What would I have done in their situation? Wow, a hard thing to pull off but Kanon managed it well. if you like a good mystery and love the WWII genre, most definitely read this book."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"I've always loved Mr. Tucci as a reader but his range and characterizations are jawdropping on this audiobook. Never mind that Mr. Kanon provides a little-known or explored time and space in history with an eerie cast of international players. Good set up, strong plotline and the finish is a wowzer. Not many hero's or heroine's here. Post war Berlin is an ugly place in an ugly time with ugly people roaming around and motivations for anything are suspect and disingenuous. I was scripting the movie as I listened. Good audiobook stuff."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"I picked this up with some trepidation after reading &quot;The Prodigal Spy&quot; this summer. Mr. Kanon's new book is much more believable, much less contrived and broader in scope than his previous book. If one has seen pictures of post WWII Berlin, you can see that the author paints a truly believable landscape. The charactors are wondefully drawn out and as colorful as can be.Perhaps a little long winded but I suggest it."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"Joseph Kanon truly captures the horror of WWII as seen not only through American eyes but also through the eyes of Germans and Russians in the hell that was Berlin. The mystery genre is a mere prop for the morality play acted out by the characters who are well developed and all less than perfect. From the protagonist,a journalist who had an affair with a German scientist's wife to the &quot;greifer,&quot; a Jewish informant,there is an air of tragedy which somehow works to illuminate the terrible choices available. Nonetheless, there is redemption and order to this convoluted plot which, again, is less than perfect, but engaging and satisfying. I felt that the historical backdrop with all of the competing moral isssues made this a different and significant novel."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"I usually complain that too many books are &quot;told&quot; rather than dramatized in scenes and that far too few authors make good use of dialogue. To its credit, &quot;The Good German&quot; is dramatized in scenes but, if anything, dialogue is overused. (Some people might think there is no pleasing me, but that isn't the case.)&quot;The Good German&quot; is set entirely in Berlin at the very close of WWII. I found this setting to be intriguing and, even though I was born post-WWII, I have visited Berlin and Kanon's evocation felt so &quot;right&quot; to me. I feel he must have researched post-WWII Berlin very thoroughly and the book might be worth reading for its setting alone.Unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't find the plot convoluted or labyrinthine. I found it trite, hackneyed and a little silly. Even though it's simplistic, it's also somewhat confusing. Kanon is not one of those rare authors who's good at managing a large cast of characters. In fact, he's terribe at it. For the first half of the book, it was difficult remembering &quot;who was who&quot; and this is especially true of the peripheral &quot;members of the press&quot; characters.The dialogue and characterization in &quot;The Good German&quot; are simply awful. Some of the dialogue was so bad it actually made me wince. Characters say things no one would ever dream of saying and they're all stock, cardboard cutouts with no personality or life of their own. After reading 500 pages of the book, I didn't feel I knew the protagonist, Jake Geismar, at all. As another reviewer has already pointed out, this was quite a feat of (bad) writing since Jake appears on every single page.The &quot;love story&quot; (I hesitate to call it that) was totally unbelievable. Both characters, and Jake in particular, were so incredibly selfish and self-centered I found myself thinking that love really had very little to do with their relationship. And I'm another reader who couldn't buy the woman's &quot;quick recovery.&quot;Finally, &quot;The Good German&quot; is simply too long. I enjoy long books as long as they have something to say, but this book contained so many unnecessary, extraneous scenes that the flow of the story was often interrupted.I was going to award this book one star only. I hated it that much. But, on reflection, there are a lot of books out there that are worse and some that are truly unreadable. In the end, I decided to give &quot;The Good German&quot; two stars for its superb use of setting.I can't really recommend this book to anyone, but if you do decide to read it, please don't think it takes its theme (What, exactly, made one a &quot;good&quot; German during WWII) seriously. It doesn't. This is definitely beach or airplane reading and not even good beach or airplane reading at that.If you'd like to read a book that takes a very intelligent look at the German thought process, read Bloch's &quot;The Sleepwalkers&quot; instead."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"This is a wonderful novel that takes place in post World War II. The author does a wonderful job of maipulating many different plots into one excellent story. From the finding of an American soldier's body in Potsdam, to the romantic relationship between an American journalist with a married German women, the novel jumps from plot to plot and finally comes together in the end. The novel also does a marvelous job of describing the very troubled city of post war Berlin. The city has been carved up among the allied powers and there is friction between them. Women and children are raped by Russians and are forced to sell everything they have or trade cigerettes in order to just survive.Overall I was very pleased with this novel which kep me captivated and also taught me alot at the same time."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"Yes, this novel has its moments, and Kanon's sense of place and time is impressive. Unfortunately, his handling of character and story is made for TV. I never came to believe in our too-faithful-to-be-true American hero obsessed with recovering his love from before the war. The missing Lena turns up much too quickly and coincidentally, becoming a heavy piece of lost luggage that Jake drags with him from one plot point to the next. Kanon has a thing for lifeless characters who never stop chattering, as if pages of picayune dialogue punctuated by one coincidence after another could subsitute for meaningful action. The closing paragraphs suggest a much more powerful novel which might have been written, if Kanon had chosen really to follow up on his research: the conspiracy/cover-up that led to thousands of ex-Nazi scientists being spirited to America to serve in the CIA and on the boards of pharmaceutical companies which were set up after the war with the \\"re-structuring\\" of I.G. Farben. The author avoids following that potentially explosive trail, which might have made his book worth reading. Instead, he mimics the well-worn theme of American innocents abroad on a quick tour of Armageddon. \\"Isn't it shocking what those Germans did? God bless America for saving the world.\\" It's neither credible nor particularly moving, but it points in a direction that might be explored by a braver writer. No, Joseph Kanon is not the next LeCarre, Greene or Orwell -- he's yet another Hollywood mind unravelling the Holocaust."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"Joseph Kanon's The Good German is a well done, muliti-genred (if that's a word) piece which I found quite interesting. I don't normally read spy thrillers, but the New York Times' review was so glowing, I couldn't resist. I wasn't disappointed. The Good German is part spy thriller, part love story, part historical fiction. It is the story of Jack Geismar, a reporter, returning to post-WWII Berlin in search of the woman he loved before the war. He finds much more than that. An American soldier is murdered in the Russian controlled section of Berlin. Something strikes Jack as simply not right in the story and he tries to get solve the riddle of the murder. Kanon's exploration of Berlin focuses very well on the nuances and grey areas in war, and in particular WWII in Germany. There really aren't many &quot;good&quot; Germans in this novel, just people who were trying to survuve any way they could. Kanon is superb at bringing to light how the presence of the Nazi's clouded good and bad, so that good people did horrible things for seemingly &quot;good&quot; reasons. Or were these good people, were they good reasons? Kanon gives us no clear answer. The Good German is satisfyingly thought provoking in that respect. My few quibbles with the novel are the number of amazing coincidences (which may be standard in the spy thriller, I don't know) and at times the pacing gets a little bogged down. Other than that, The Good German is an enjoyable, well done novel."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"I read this book in two sittings and only because I'm too old to stay up ALL night and still be productive the next day. That is to say, this is one exciting read -- I even blocked out my fear of flying as I zoned in on the absorbing story during my recent flight. I enjoyed Los Alamos, but I'm happy to say that Kanon has continued to develop as a writer -- this book is by far his best yet. Kanon does a masterful job portraying post-war Berlin around the time of the Potsdam conference and all the intrigue, scientist-chasing and frenetic behavior during the last days of the Nazi regime. I don't know if Kanon meant to tip his hat to Hemingway's Jake Barnes, but I found his Jake to be an extremely well drawn portrait of our hero-journalist. The pacing is excellent, the dialogue credible and the plot absolutely mind bending. In terms of genre, I'd put this between Le Carre, Folliet, Clancy combining the best elements. Ultimately, Kanon outdoes them all for just plain good writing. My head is still spinning from the labyrintine plot -- read this one with a friend so you can compare notes. If I could even find a small quibble, I'd say the fortune telling scene was a bit over the top and perhaps Jake's original motivation to pursue a murder mystery once he found Lena, but I was very willing to suspend any disbelief. The Good German succeeds on every level (also a very touching love story) and is already one of my very favorites from this year. Superb reading from one of the best writers out there -- don't miss it."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"As others have said, The Good German is a blend of historical fiction, a spy-thriller and romance. When I began reading it, I worried that one of these elements would simply be used as a ploy to interest us in an otherwise unremarkable novel. It would be easy to cloak a run-of-the-mill love story or spy-thriller in such a dramatic historical setting. Kanon, however, never abuses this history. In fact, the moral dilemmas of WWII are at the center of this book, examined both in the broad context of the broken environment as well as the specific context of the character's relationships.Kanon refuses to provide simple answers to the atrocities of WWII. While the twists and turns of the plot had me turning the pages, threaded throughout is the question, \\"How could the Germans do it?\\" Kanon's exploration of this question, placed within such a vivid recreation of post-war Berlin, led me to set the book down on numerous occasions, lost sometimes in thought and sometimes in despair.The romance felt a little more forced than other scenes, sometimes being a little boring or even annoying. Kanon is tracing an important story with the romance, illustrating the distance we must go to understand the lives of Germans under the Nazis, but in the telling it fell flat. He certainly has moments, but often it seems the couple is just tracing the same ground with seemingly no development.But this is a minor gripe in what is a heavy novel. Kanon doesn't back away from the gritty details or the inch-by-inch compromises humans make with evil, and he doesn't leave the reader to point fingers either. In wrapping such unrelenting dilemmas in such weighted circumstances, Kanon has succeeded in writing a good story- an important story."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"I read a lot of books as I sure most who post on here do. I have never written a review before but felt compelled after seeing the number of 4 and 5 star ratings on this book. I was aghast to say the least and my faith in Amazon ratings took a big hit. I too had high hopes for this...the setting, the nice maps at the start, the undeniable moral and human dilemmas to be explored. To his credit Kanon does explore these issues in some depth. But it is wrapped in an absurdly convoluted plot, a love story with no conviction whatsoever and dialog that is mostly an aggravation. There is little if any reflection or thought by the characters it is just endless blah, blah, blah. I still have no idea why Jake loved this woman or why she him. Or why he cared about the fate of Tully so much. The book is way too long, the plot twists mostly lame, contrived or confusing. But in the end I just didn't care what happened to any of them. I was just so glad I got this at a yard sale for 25 cents...that was what it was worth in the end."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"Kanon's The Good German has a slow start - designed to immerse the reader in the atmosphere of the Berlin of the early post-war months. It is July 1945, the time of the Potsdam Conference. Kanon' s ability to take you virtually by the hand and to lead you through a place is exemplary. Here, it is particularly dramatic: ruins, bombed out houses, roads blocked by rubble, empty spaces where, before, Berliners had lived - and where the protagonist himself had lived as a journalist. Jake Geismar, supposedly reporting on the Conference, is really in Berlin fulfilling a promise, a quest. Kanon's portrayal of Berlin is accurate - based on visits to the modern Berlin and his in depth research of the Berlin at the end of WWII and the changes since then. You could easily use it as a tour guide of a different kind.But of course, Berlin of 1945 is not the story. The story of the returning US journalist and his German girlfriend leads the reader like a red thread through the book. Her family is mixed in with the plot. The description of day-to-day life in difficult times gives the story reality and perspective. People do a lot just for a package of cigarettes.Jake's search for his love of the happier pre-war days through the ruins, the alleyways, is becoming increasingly desperate. Is she still alive? Where would she be? Finding an individual in those early post-war months in Germany was almost impossible; no records were available, the houses where they had lived often destroyed and no forwarding address - unless you were really lucky.The story unfolds slowly at first, a hushed-up murder, and several dead-end leads. But things turn out to be a lot more complex as you go: more deaths and threats, intrigue and false allies. And the tension grows. It is a thriller after all: a thriller with political messages as well as interesting character developments. In addition to Jake, the protagonist, and Lena, his girlfriend, we meet intriguing characters, in particular among the Germans. While the Russians dismantled factories, taking home whatever technology they could find, a special team from the US's occupying forces were rounding up the scientists and experts who designed the technology in the first place. The Russians realized the problem and tried to get in on the act. Would it work? So, who is the Good German?The events around the Potsdam Conference provide a useful backdrop. It fits the story well to observe the increasing tension between US and Soviet soldiers who easily turn to an exchange of gunfire to mask more sinister intentions. The context is the beginnings of the next war (the Cold War), at least in the minds of some US officials and military.Kanon's book is in a category of its own. More than a thriller and more than a romantic story, it is a skillfully put together account of a complex situation in a difficult moment of time. It is successful as \\"a good read\\" and as a chronicle of events that gives the reader food for thought and reflection."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"Jospeh Kanon is rapidly establishing himself as the master of the historical thriller. &quot;The Good German&quot; is his 3rd entrant in that genre, following &quot;Los Alamos&quot; and &quot;The Prodigal Spy.&quot; Simply stated, Kanon's 3rd book is his 2nd best -- nearly as good as &quot;Los Alamos,&quot; but not quite. The book is set in Berlin, 1945, at the time of the Potsdam conference. At times the action seems a bit forced and in other places the plot drags a bit ... but not much; I quibble, suggesting only that it does not quite match &quot;Los Alamos,&quot; a truly superb book. &quot;The Good German&quot; still is riveting. You actually care what happens to the main players in the drama, focused on Jake Geismar, the protagonist, a war-weary correspondent seeking both (1) to solve a murder mystery involving a Russian general, a jaded old German cop, and some American occupiers of dubious morality, and (2) to resolve an old romantic triangle with Lena, his pre-war lover, and Emil, her mathematician husband who worked for the Nazis. What is true, what is moral, who is responsible for what ... big questions lurk under, or at, the surface throughout. This book captures the horror of war in general and of the Holocaust in particular. You see how regular people react to the unimaginable; the picture is often not pretty -- but you feel that the images of life, death, love, revenge, greed and more that you take away are real. Definitely read this book."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"This could have been a great novel. The setting is interesting and fresh. The execution, however, is so heavy-handed and cliched. All of the characters are stock, one-dimensional stereotypes. The dialog is particularly tedious, with every character sounding the same, speaking in tired old chestnuts and chattering about the plot. As well, much of the dialog is repetitive, with the characters saying the same thing multiple times.The book really begins to fall apart in the second half. Many of the scenes are nothing more than characters recapping the increasingly convoluted plot. And just to make sure you don't miss the point, the hypocrisy of certain characters is driven home over and over again.By the end of the book, the uninteresting plot has become so twisted and convoluted that the central character has to recap the twists and turns for another character in the penultimate chapter.The only interesting element of this book is &quot;the greifer&quot; subplot. That, however, seems almost entirely distilled from Peter Wyden's excellent biography &quot;Stella,&quot; about a real greifer, so that it's hardly original or noteworthy. Some of the &quot;catcher&quot; scenes in Kanon's novel come straight out of Wyden's book."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"This book takes place in Berlin 1945 and mostly is about the devastation, the beginning of the cold war, and the hero's bafflement that it could all have happened. A murder, which ultimately turns out to have political connections, is interspersed, and held my interest, but the murder is really subsidiary to the philosophical questions -- who, if anyone, is a &quot;good&quot; german? or for that matter, a &quot;good&quot; american or russian?I loved this book for its character development and thoughtfulness. If, however, you read mysteries primarily for action, this one is not for you."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"\\"The Good German\\", by Joseph Kanon can be categorized by placement in a variety of genres, Thriller, Mystery, Historical Fiction, Love Story, and more. The work is certainly all of these, however I believe much more important is the study of twelve years of human behavior, presented within the context of events primarily following the close of The European phase of World War Two. I don't know that any other conflict has generated more literature than the one symbolized by the swastika, the word Holocaust, and the unprecedented Crimes Against Humanity Trials at Nuremberg. Superficially, the evil of the war is routinely placed with great ease. Even at this level it is hard to take issue with placing the blame on a man, the party he created, and the nation that joined that party, served in the SS, and made the crimes that took place possible. What happened when the fighting stopped, when the shooting war with The Axis ended, and the Cold War with The Soviet Union began? The latter had really begun prior to the first one ending.The shades of gray that dominated the conduct of The Allies immediately following the end of hostilities, and the repercussions that would follow for decades, is brilliantly set side by side with conduct during the war. Mr. Kanon never minimizes any of the horror that took place; he questions none of the atrocities that were committed. He does bring post-war reality to his tale that cannot be said to match the actions of The Third Reich; he does however absolutely portray conduct on all sides, which traditional history would rather marginalize. Nothing is ever as simple as it seems, and while there were episodes of good versus evil, and events that were black and white, inconvenient shades of gray were everywhere.Without exception all of the players in this book are guilty of some form of aberrant behavior, which outside of the circumstance of war would never be questioned as wrong. However when placed within the context of World War Two, which was unique for the range and intensity of the evil it spread, do the judgments and answers remain so clear?A person is put on trial at war's end for collaborating with The Nazi SS; let us say the person facilitated the capture of Jews for transportation to death camps. The jury would probably not spend a great deal of time deliberating this example. Same example with a bit more detail, the person is a Jew who was given the option of pointing out other Jews in exchange for their life and the lives of their family. This offer comes after the ritual sadism of a SS interrogation. How many family members would choose death for themselves and their family? What would the readers of this book choose given the alternatives?It is true that Nuremberg placed on trial and executed or imprisoned what could be referred to as the, \\"Marquis Players\\", of The Third Reich. Nice and neat, black and white. At war's end there were brilliant scientists that lead the world in rocketry, aircraft design, and a host of other sciences. If they had been placed on trial persons like Werner Van Braun would not have been working for NASA, he very likely would have been dead, or would have been in Spandau Prison. The Scenario that was viewed with more trepidation was these truly gifted minds would spend years on Soviet soil advancing Soviet capabilities, and that was not viewed as a risk worth taking. The result was each country that could, rounded up as many of these scientists as possible, together with their papers and families, we gathered ours and brought them to the US. Viewed as a strictly pragmatic choice, the decision to utilize these people with disregard for their wartime activities can be defended with ease. The defense also requires that ethics, morality, humanity, call it what you will, must be tossed over the side like so much ballast on a sinking ship. The selective enforcement of justice and the contortions of logic that these decisions demand, are the core of this work. The presentation is little short of brilliant.Replace the word German in the title with person, and you are much closer to the core of this book. Right and wrong is defined on a case-by-case basis, and is infinitely fluid. What Mr. Kanon has done is brought this conduct to bear on every level. Twisted decisions are as much a part of personal relationships as they are at the conference table at Potsdam. Deception is as routine between family members as it is with Stalin and whomever he speaks with. Every decision is reduced to only having to be justified for the moment it is contemplated. Once made, the past is shunted aside, and the future is clean. This expediency is as flawed long-term as it is without justification when made. The love story aspect is riddled with deception, crime, and repugnance. Yet you will likely be hoping for a happy ending for two of the participants. Take the same event out of the context of post World War Two Berlin, and the sympathy dissolves.Joseph Kanon has written a remarkable book that deals with one of the darkest periods of human behavior. He does this without rancor, without preaching, without offering only two colors to place each decision in. To write such a work not only pays tribute to the mind of the author, but also the adroitness with which he presents very real moral labyrinths. I found myself at once wishing this was a pure scholarly history book, and at the same moments being pleased with the novel form the author chose. His format allows for more dispassionate reasoned contemplation because it is a novel, and not a heavily footnoted documentary. Either method would likely bring the reader to the same end, however Mr. Kanon's is much more user-friendly."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"I have a mixed reaction to this book. As an insight to post-WW II Germany, it is splendid. As a novel it is average. The main character, Jake, is inconsistent, his motives incredible and the dialogue in which he participates tedious. After just finishing Night Soldiers by Alan Furth (which is excellent), this novel simply didn't measure up."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"This novel plays like some of the great noir films.

The post WWII Berlin setting and the dynamics of looking back at what had been done during the war - It's a captivating subject: Wondering how Germany people had been able to watch and be involved with the atrocities; the jockeying of the US and Russia knowing they'd be adversaries after the war; the scrambling to acquire German technical secrets and experts.The history surrounding the book was what kept me reading. But the plot of this novel is convoluted, the relationships are not well realized, and there are some coincidences that are totally unbelievable. Honestly I should have stopped reading after the second blatantly unrealistic plot connection, but like an addict, I kept reading on. Wasn't worth it. Kanon is a capable writer and good at dialogue, but this book is way too long, a complicated mess and it feels like it was unsuccessfully pared down from many more pages."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"As an avid reader I found this story outstanding, far more beautifully crafted and edited than most currently available. The characters are so well developed and the dialog so well defined that it is easy to discern who is speaking when the speaker is not noted.

I've met people who were in Berlin shortly after WWII and read history years past; this book brings it alive and makes everything relevant.I've read it twice so far, because it is so intriguing that I was not sure I picked up on everything as I sped through the story.

The descriptions of Berlin, the people, Jake's yearning for Lena... But after he finds her (all too easily) it all goes downhill. Why does he care so much about the \\"mystery\\" ? Why is he prepared to put his own life, and hers, at risk ? I lost interest in the twists and turns so much that when eventually the \\"villians\\" were revealed I'd forgotten who they were. A much better book would have simply been about Jake's search for Lena and her struggle to come to terms with what happened to her and her country. The \\"mystery\\" was unnecessary. And one other thing really bothered me (spoiler alert !) - when he first finds her she can't even bear his touch after her horrors at the hands of the Russians.

So, \\"who\\" were they, the \\"good Germans\\", \\"where\\" were they when it all happened, and \\"how\\" did they help when they helped, or did they?Taking place from July through August 1945 with the Potsdam conference as the general political background, the American reporter Jakob Geismar returns to Berlin searching for Lena, a married woman with whom he had an affair before the war broke out. As he does so, he discovers the dead body of a 23 year old American soldier from Natick, MA and begins an investigation into his death. This not only almost cost him his life, but also uncovers both the tragic complexities into which life threw all German citizens under Nazi dictatorship, and the calculatingly cynical way in which the allied forces used a destroyed Germany to their own advantage.This action-packed, sensitively written autobiographical thriller-romance places the question \\"Who is the 'good German'\\"? on the reader's mind beginning with page one.

The best parts of the book were the beginning and end. The plot takes off in the beginning and grips one's attention, as does the elegant descriptions of the surroundings and mood of Berlin at the time. The characters were well-developed and realistic. The historical setting and details were obviously well-researched. However, there were several stretches in the middle of the book that distracted from the story--such as long unnecessary descriptions of the prostitution ring in Berlin and prostitutes themselves, the repeatedly revisted melodramatic arguments between the main male and female characters, and some characters brought into the story that didn't add anything and only lead to a feeling of 'loose ends' at the end of the book. The end of the book had satisfying unexpected twists and a compelling conclusion.

The story may drag at points, but his vivid descriptive passages are well worth a read."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"I read this book in anticipation of watching the George Clooney/Cate Blanchett movie - I'm not certain I'll watch the movie now. I can't say I enjoyed it, yet I can't say I didn't. It wasn't one of those books that left you so conflicted or so deep and resonating that it stayed with you. Rather, it was a book that tried very hard.There were moral conflicts that tried to dig deeper into the human psyche and the times than it actually did. Jake Geismar, returned to Germany for a story on the post-war world. Yet he spends the majority of the book looking either for his wartime (married) mistress, or after her, or following the death of a Tully, very insignificant American officer with no story whatsoever. The two never quite intersected, but I was left with the feeling that they were supposed to on a grander scale than they brushed.In a truly convoluted plot, filled with only one extremely interesting secondary character, Gunter, we travel across Berlin. And back. And over it again. While all this is appealing in the history of the city, the postwar scenery, the hopelessness and helplessness of the people, and the arrogance of the conquering heroes (American, British, and Russian alike), it's all randomness.Victorious, the Allies are once more at a standoff with the Communist Russians and in a race to acquire all the German Scientists they could. We want Lena's husband, the Russians now have him, Jake wants the husband out of the way, Lena's barely a blip on the plot-radar, and there's still Tully to consider. The plot is a thinly disguised reason to expound on the history of Berlin (which really is well done, I can't say that enough), and the affair between Jake and Lena.And there's still no story for Jake."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"I enjoyed this in spite of the plot getting out of control.

This book does an incredible job of conveying Berelin physically at that time, as well as the ambiguous moral climate that existed then.If everyone was doing what they were compelled to do, then was no one to blame? Should the German's be punished for their atrocities or enlisted to fight the next war against the Russians? These are the two key moral questions explored in this book.The murder and it's solution I thought were incidental to the &quot;bigger&quot; themes. Mr. Kanon writes well and does an excellent job of putting you in Berlin at the time of the novel. It's not a page turner, but well worth your time. I'd really like to give it 4 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"Like in his other books (Los Alamos in the best, In my opinion), Kanon uses the mystery genre to ask difficult questions and to try to answer them.An American journalist returns to Berlin immediately after WWII. He reunited with his lost love and, through her and through his work, meets a series of Germans and non Germans, whose lives have been twisted and torn apart by the war.The main theme of the book, namely, who is a good German, or, more accurately, who is a good person, is presented in a series of subtle onion skins, which get peeled as the book progresses. The real greatness of Kanon is that the answer to the question is ultimately a matter of the reader's personal choice.I love Kanon's writing and think that this is a truly brilliant book, but I must admit to one area of discomfort. This book is one of a wave of recent publications that seeks to portray the German suffering in the Second World War. Kanon is very fair in this regard, because he presents the German suffering suffering in its context and because his protrayel of the Jewish victims of the Holocaust is both powerful and touching. But the fact still stands that lately there have been quite a few books that have focused on the poor Germans and their trials during the war. As a Jew whose life was hugely influenced by the tragedies of the holocaust, I feel uncomfortable with the new trend. I understand that many Germans suffered horribly, but despite this touching book, I am hard pressed to feel pity for any of them. The voices of my many relations who died in the camps are simply too loud for me to hear these statements.This not withstanding, The Good German is a brilliant book and an excellent topic for a book club or any reader with a heart."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"Nice try, and decent as a light read - but the plot is absurdly convoluted."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. The setting, with all its complex moral dilemmas, really drew me in, and I found the plot well-paced and not that difficult to follow. However, now that I have finished it and taken it all in, I am a bit less impressed. It is surprising that, in a book exploring the nuances of morality, almost every major character is either black or white. The greifer is the one notable exception, but otherwise the moral of the story seems to be that those who do truly evil things are evil people (just look at the scientist, or the congressman, or any given russian) while good people (like the love interest, or the doctor) are good and pure. I really don't think that this was what the author intended: after all, there is the greifer, and some of the minor characters seem a bit more morally ambiguous. Perhaps it's just that he wanted to keep the main characters true and pure, and so he had to demonize all their enemies. I feel like that weakens the book.Oh, and I was really jarred by the sex scene, since it demonstrated such an implausibly quick recovery from rape. With simultaneous orgasms, too.

I think it's unfortunate that it is so poorly done, because the essential story could have had merit if the author wasn't so overburdened in his love of detail and too many names.

The author uses an intelligent mystery, the death of a young and very heartily disliked American Army officer, as a sort of frame on which to hang a fictional rendering of Berlin in the summer of 1945, just after the Soviets captured it. It's a pile of rubble with Germans hiding in the ruins, none of them (of course) having had anything to do with the Nazis or the Holocaust. The protagonist is a journalist who lived in Berlin before the war, not as popular or famous as Shirer but familiar with the city. When he returns he's looking for a woman with whom he had an affair, and of course her husband turns out to have been a mathemetician, but also a Party member (naturally, becuse he was forced) and because of the scientific work he was doing he's highly sought-after by both the US and Soviet authorities. There's a second murder, and the title itself has a cynical twist to it once you've read the book. It's quite fun, and thought-provoking also."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"I just finished \\"The Good German\\" and am now in total awe of Kanon, whose work I never read before. This book is put together like a complicated but very well made German clock: lots of little pieces, all fitting together with precision.HOW anyone can criticize him for spending \\"too much time\\" describing the rubble that used to be Berlin is beyond me. The word-pictures he paints not only set the overall, post-war tone, but they also help to explain the otherwise-indescribable emotional mess inside the heads of countless innocent German people after the war. I love the USA but there's no denying that not all citizens (much less soldiers) of Allied countries were saints in white hats, and not all those of Axis countries were black-hatted evil. Life, in short, was complicated.Kanon's success in portraying the confusion of post-war Berlin is enough to make reading the book worthwhile, but on top of that, his spy-thriller plot is superb. As someone who can frequently solve the mystery before reaching the end, I was amazed at how unpredictable the ending of this book really is--never, ever would've guessed whodunnit!If there's anything to criticize, I'd suggest that a lot of the dialogue is a tad too clever. So much of the dry banter between Jake and Liz, Jake and Lena, Brian, Bernie, et al, is more quick-witted than even the sharpest real people can possibly produce on a daily basis. And at the risk of sounding like a complete prude, I'd suggest that That Oh-So-Detailed Sex Scene is totally unnecessary, and feels like it was thrown in there as a kind of \\"requirement,\\" rather like films whose directors want to avoid meriting a \\"G\\" rating. If it makes you uncomfortable once you reach it, just skip a couple of pages--you won't miss anything intrinsic to the plot."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"This is an excellent book, and much better than the movie, which distorted the story so badly that the only thing I recognized was the names of the characters!"},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"This novel is an excellent portrayal of the aftereffects of war as it takes place in Germany immediately following the end of WWII. The personal stories against that chaotic backdrop are sometimes poignant, sometimes disturbing, but it is the devastated landscape and surviving humanity that capture the imagination. So many of the elements that seem to be playing out in Iraq today are the same elements that figure in this book set in post-war Germany. It is a mystery with a romance interwoven (or vice-versa, perhaps) but it is mostly the story of survivors picking up pieces of lives in a totally new, and frightening, world."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"Set in torn Berlin after the war, the story revolves around a flight of reporters and a young Tully. The main character Jake writes for Colliers and passionately searches for his German love left behind, Lena.The suspense grows and builds in his Lena search, coupled with the search for who killed young Tully.The author writes well, revealing just enough of the plot to keep one intrigued and reading on. His knowledge of post-war affairs between the Big Three and Berlin is the twine which holds it all together, and the journalist's ever relentless search for the scoop dominates.Found it all so good reading, all making sense, except left me a little lost at the end, trying to reweave all the fibers that were hidden.However, a marvelously composed tale touching on many emotions of war torn countries and relationships."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"I enjoyed this book alot. But I would warn a potential reader that I believe you must have a good working knowledge of German history especially concerning WWII and the Nazis. While the author does a good job of describing Berlin immediately after the end of the war, much of that description assumes the reader is aware of various streets, hotels and other landmarks in Berlin (e.g. the significance of the Hotel Adlon). With that warning, I recommend it - as both a good history, love story, and murder mystery with intentionally added moral dilemmas."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"This remarkable book did not make it to the bestseller lists because (I believe) the publisher did not position it properly. It was widely pushed as a murder mystery/love story. And yes, it is that and so much more. Others have gone over the plot so no need to dwell on that here.The title is ironical. Who is the \\"good\\" German and how good is he really? And to what lengths will the Americans go to make him good? There are serious moral questions raised here and no easy answers. The book is well-paced and written and comes alive with fully-fleshed characters: the tough Schaeffer who cares only for the result, the tragic Renate who just tried to survive, but at what a cost, the missing Emil who becomes the \\"good\\" German...or does he?, the shrewd Gunther who finds something to live for after all...and so many more. This is a mature and confident work.This is a book that can be read simply for the story line of the murder mystery and love story. Whodunnit and why? On that level alone, the book is quite satisfactory. However, there is a deeper, more visceral level. The questions of complicity with the nazis and of turning a blind eye to the monstrous evil they perpetrated are all here. These questions raised by Kanon seem especially relevant today. I will be looking for a copy of his earlier books."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"Jake Geismar, formerly one of Murrow's boys with CBS Radio in Berlin, returns to the defeated cityto cover the Potsdam Conference for Collier's magazine. This welcome assignment affords him theopportunity to try and track down his pre-War lover Lena Brandt, wife of a brilliant mathematicianwho ended up working in the Nazi rocket program. As he searches through the rubble of thedevastated city and navigates the corruption and black markets, Jake also becomes involved in amurder mystery, surrounding the shooting of a venal American G.I. It quickly becomes evident thatthe two investigations are intertwined as Jake uncovers a covert battle between American and Sovietintelligence operatives aimed at collecting as many Nazi scientists as they can get their respective handson, both sides needing to pick their brains to gain an advantage in the Third World War that obviouslylooms on the horizon.Mr. Kanon, as in his earlier thriller Los Alamos, makes effective use of the historic setting, letting theactual situation provide a constant background tension. He also creates a series of characters whosemotivations and ethical dilemmas are sufficiently complex as to make it seem like he takes the moraldimension of his tale seriously. But again, as in his earlier book, the author fails miserably in fleshingout the full moral context of the story.Obviously one has to feel some qualms about the crimes that were excused or overlooked in our hasteto rebuild Germany and to get ahold of Nazi technology and expertise that had made Germany such aformidable military power, but Mr. Kanon ignores the fact that we had just spent four years ignoringequally repellent Soviet crimes while they helped us defeat the Nazis. By 1945 it was way too late toreclaim our spiritual virginity, we'd already bedded down with one evil, all we did after the war washop into a different bed, and at least in the latter case we'd defeated the Germans before wecollaborated with them. Though FDR seems to have deluded himself about the true nature of theSoviets, Winston Churchill was realistic enough to acknowledge that they were evil. Criticized by hispolitical cohorts for being overenthusiastic about the Russian alliance, Churchill said :If Hitler invaded Hell, I would make at least a favourable reference to the Devil in the House ofCommons.The comparison is entirely apt.Personally, I think it was a mistake to ally ourselves with the USSR in the first place, I'd have leftthem and the Nazis to grind themselves into a bloody pulp on the Eastern Front. In the event, evenafter helping the Soviets conquer all of Eastern Europe and even with them threatening a war-wearyWestern European, I think you could have made a good case for bringing American troops home afterGermany was defeated. Trying to dominate all of Europe would have so overextended the USSR thatit would have fallen apart even more quickly than it did as a result of the fifty year policy ofcontainment that we pursued instead. But we didn't follow either of these options; we confrontedHitler with the Soviet Union at our side and then confronted the Soviets with a democratic WestGermany and a number of former Nazis at our side. It is utterly disingenuous to mount one's highhorse over the one moral compromise, I believe the lesser, without at least acknowledging the other.Beyond this intellectual dishonesty, there are a few other problems with the book. For one thing it issimply too long and owes its length to quite standard chase scenes and gunplay. It doesn't help matterseither that Mr. Kanon has Jake running all over Berlin facing off with Russian generals, Americancloak and dagger types, and black marketers. George Clooney has signed to play him in the movie,but it reads like a role for Schwarzenegger. The other problem with Jake is that his own moraldifficulties make it all too easy for those he confronts to turn the tables on him. For one thing he's anadulterer. For another, he's manipulating people, cutting corners, and causing deaths to serve his ownpurposes. And he's accompanying a conquering army; imagine how he might have acted if he'd beentrying to survive the death throes of the Third Reich. This makes his self-righteous indignationawfully difficult to stomach.Unfortunately, Mr. Kanon is a bestselling author so no editor is going to push him to improve. He'snow settled into a formula that works well enough, but leaves the reader somewhat frustrated. Abetter, more focussed, novel lurks within the too numerous pages of this just adequate thriller.GRADE : C"},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"Berlin, 1945 -- the ruins still smoulder and Truman and Stalin meet at the new border. Millions of civilians murdered by the Nazis and a complacent and complicit German population. Displaced persons desperate for anything to eat. Add a reporter with the assignment of a lifetime -- the Potsdam Conference -- and you should have a remarkable novel. Unfortunately, the result here is a collection of tired themes and predominantly cardboard characters that conspire to make 500 pages feel a lot longer.Jake Geismar, our hip-ly named protagonist reporter who manages to submit perhaps three stories to his editor at Collier's during the course of the entire book, checks into the plush (relatively speaking) press quarters, then it's off to find his old flame and solve a murder that seems less important to the reader than to the author. Black market activity runs throughout, though given the spectres of mass murder and modern war, the document/cigarette/chocolate trade fails to strike a chord.The issue of who is to blame for the systematic murder of Jewish civilians, the great burning question of the past century and one with eternal relevance, fuels a few heated conversations between our hero Jake and a German scientist implicated in the horrors of the Nordhausen camp. The convenient conclusion is that everyone in Germany was to blame. True? Maybe, but Kanon picks up on this when the mood suits, unwilling to pick at that fresh scab with the conviction it merits.Given the fascinating and historically important setting, and the plausible pretext of a journalist in Berlin, we are plunged -- or dipped on occasion -- into a mundane and exasperatingly complicated loose-cannon investigator story, complete with the lost-long-ago-found-again girl who swings from stoic bitterness to schoolgirl love, a sexy photographer, a blond and blue-eyed German-American officer, an evil Russian colonel, a corruptible windbag politican, a vengeful Jewish prosecutor and any other sterotype you could want. Especially astounding is the willingness of the scientist to relinquish his wife to Jake with the kind of grudging remarks one would use to protest a stolen weed-whacker or ski rack.If the characters are wanting for depth, the story usually is not much better. The brief trial of an German-Jewish informant threatens to involve us deeply because the issues are deep and painful, but a ludicrous deus-ex-machina escape and contrived parade chase remind the reader that it is a long way between morsels such as the trial of the &quot;greifer&quot; (who turned in other Jews to save her life). As if the author needed to prove that he could write a plot that would elude even the most patient and dedicated reader, we are treated to 8 or 10 pages of explanation (by our hero Jake) to the effect that even if not everything can be proven, he can lay blame for the murder (of someone the reader does not care about) at the feet of someone else who hardly appears in the story.Why three stars? Kanon gets high marks for his setting, which intrigues even if the story never gels, and for his style of writing, which could flow along quite nicely given more interesting characters and a less cumbersome plot. I suspect a visit to Kanon's writing room would reveal a plot chart that resembles one of Von Braun's V-2 rocket schematics in its complexity."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"The Good German is a compulsive read and a compelling portrait of Berlin in the immediate aftermath of defeat. Its chief strength is a strong sense of place--not just the landscape of shattered Berlin, but moral/emotional freeze-frames of various Germans, Jews, Russians, and Americans struggling to come to terms with the world created by the Nazis' crimes. Memorable portraits include those of a disenfranchised, fundamentally decent German police chief; a German Jew who survived by fingering other Jews in hiding; a perpetually cool British journalist; and a rigidly upright old German mathematics professor. The novel achieves some moments of high drama as characters' moral choices come into sharp relief: a Jews reveals why she worked for the Nazis; a father dissolves in grief as he recalls his SS son as a boy; a U.S. intelligence officer shreds evidence of war crimes by a coveted German scientist.While successfully bringing one of history's great crossroads to life, The Good German is limited by a kind of potboiler sensibility. At heart, it's more a Casa Blanca redux (complete with a lover-rescues-resurfaced-husband variation) than a full-souled literary engagement with its gigantic theme. The main character is essentially a superhero cipher, preposterously noble and competent. The plot is a numbingly complex and unlikely connect-the-dots. The prose is burdened with a tired,flat overlay of stream of consciousness in tough-guy sentence fragments. The love interest is cheesy and cliched. The book made me want to read and know more about Germany after the war -- but left me thirsty for a deeper novelistic consciousness (maybe Gunther Grass?--haven't read him) to see into the life of things."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"This resonant tale of love among the ruins is the best yet from Kanon, who takes what is often a tired form -- the historical thriller -- and charges it with new moral intensity. The plot keeps the pages turning with all the speed you'd want from a thriller. But at heart the book is a darkly glittering meditation on civic and personal responsibility.Kanon's ear for period dialogue seems faultless, and his feel for postwar Berlin with its moonscape of collapsed buildings is an imaginative triumph. Jake Geismar, the book's journalist protagonist, is a period piece himself - tough, principled and yet tender (think Bogart). His lover Lena, who has experienced the full cruelty of life in bombed and occupied Berlin, is the complex European to this brash American. The plot is fleshed out with vivid supporting characters -- a business-minded American congressman with dubious priorities, an attractive Jewish Berliner who survives the war by turning in fellow Jews, an American lawyer who buries himself in reams of Nazi record-keeping in what appears to be a lonely mission to bring Nazis to justice, a black marketeer ex-policeman.The reverberations of September 11th give added richness to this story of life trying to knit itself back together after catastrophe. It's a continuously engaging book, but into its many bright colors are woven the dark threads of evil which more than ever seem part of the fabric of human life."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"Unlike so many other thrillers, this is a subtle and thought-provoking novel, a search for moral truth within a mystery and a love story. Creating fully developed main characters, filled with the good intentions and personal failings that make us all human, Kanon portrays the ethical dilemmas of the occupying forces in a devastated Berlin, just as the Potsdam Conference begins. The Good German, an ironic title, explores the practice of American policymakers of \\"sanitizing\\" the Nazi connections of German scientists so that they may be spirited into the U.S. for work on the atomic bomb. By transforming them into \\"good Germans,\\" as opposed to the \\"bad Germans\\" who will face war crimes trials, the American \\"good guys\\" reveal themselves to be as morally compromised, perhaps, as the German scientists, willing to stop at nothing, including murder, in order to keep these men from falling into the hands of the Soviets.Kanon's eye for the telling detail is unerring. To fix the scope of the devastation, he remarks: \\"Buildings, like soldiers, were expected casualties of war. But the trees were gone too, all of them...The dense forest of the Tiergarten, all the winding paths...burned down to a vast open field littered with dark charcoal stumps.\\" He refers to those Jews who tried to delay their fates in the only way open to them as \\"U-boats,\\" hungry people who walked anonymously around the city all day, every day, so that they could not be identified by \\"friends,\\" sometimes captured and deported when they took their worn out shoes to be repaired. Nazi big shots are \\"golden pheasants.\\" The Russians are said to \\"pack up the power plants and anything shiny and hope for the best,\\" while the Americans searching for scientists were doing \\"patriotic looting.\\"The several subplots--the search for Emil Brandt, the love story of Jake and Lena, the conflict between war crimes investigators and the State Department, in conjunction with U.S. industry, and the difficulties of sharing power with the brutal Russians--are smoothly integrated into a thoroughly engrossing narrative, which, in combination with the unique characters, allow the reader to keep track of what's going on and stay involved till the end. I cannot attest to the accuracy of the history, but I came away from the novel with vivid images of the level of devastation in Berlin and a new appreciation of the difficulties faced by occupying forces. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"Kanon offers a convincing portrayal of Berlin in the final days of the war, in terms of its ruined buildings, uneasy alliances, and almost-ruined lives. If the book has any central theme it is in that \\"almost\\" --- the challenge of determining what and more particularily who can be salvaged from that rubble, of distinguishing between reparations and repair. The \\"what\\" in this instance is the fate of the German rocket program; the \\"who\\" is the question of which scientists get to come with Wernher von Braun to America and which are left to the Russians. When this story is told in terms of individual people --- whether villains, victims, or mere survivors --- it raises fascinating moral and human issues; there is enough here for a substantial novel of ideas, and many of Kanon's vignettes have a disturbing power. But he chooses to handle it by means of a spy / mystery / adventure tale with too many twists, linked by a rather ordinary love story, and depending too much on coincidence. Various reviewers have compared Kanon to Graham Greene. But Greene never allowed his mechanisms to obscure his human or moral focus; Kanon, alas, does."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"This is the third book I have read by Mr. Kannon, and I do recomend him for his ability to portray a time and place in all its dimensions: physical, historical, personal, and moral. This is no small achievment in a genre filled with tin characters and TV movie settings. In this book we are in Berlin in the summer of 1945. Kannon's descriptions of Berlin and its shell shocked citizens are affecting. Jake, the main character, lived in Berlin before the war, and through his eyes we experience his shock at the pysical destruction of the city from Allied bombs and the Russian shelling and occupation and also his shock at what Germany became under Nazi rule. There are harsh judgments made, but Kannon also attempts to understand what perhaps cannot ever be fully understood...how so many people could blind themselves to the evil going on all around them.Kannon explores the moral complexitites and horrors of the time through his characters; many of them will linger in your mind. Jake's outrage at the Holocaust(not even named yet at the time of the story) is genuine if a bit self righteous--but perhaps it is only later that someone like him would know about the ways in which the West, while not responsible for the atrocity, did so little to stop it or to provide assylum for its victims.My one complaint, common to all Kannon's books, is that his plots go on too long, are too convoluted, and resolve in ways not altogether believable. Still, Kannon is worth reading, he will enlarge your picture of the world we live in as you read him"},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"This is one of those politico-detective type thrillers, such as things we've read by Frederick Forsythe, Robert Ludlum or Jack Higgins. As far as it goes, it's not too bad; the pages drift by painlessly and one has at least a mild interest in what the outcome is going to be. Along with this we get a pretty intense examination of the actions of human beings in times of crisis, and also those who sit in judgment of them when the crisis ends, and to me, this is what is most compelling.The plot has to do with an American correspondent in post-war Berlin, and by post-war, I mean immediately after the war has ended: May and June of 1945. This correspondent had had an affair with a married female Berliner prior to the war, and now that he has returned has hopes of finding her amid the rubble. In the meantime, a fellow American has been found shot to death, and when nobody seems too interested in finding out who did it, he begins his own investigation.This is the whodunit aspect of the novel. As I mentioned, it is at least mildly interesting, as he ends up uncovering various plots and subterfuges involving German scientists and the American and Russian forces who are attempting to get them out and keep them away from each other. Our hero's girlfriend's husband, it turns out, is one of these scientists, so he has a personal involvement as well.The centerpiece of the novel, and the event which truly stirred me, is the trial of a Jewish German woman, accused of being a \\"greifer,\\": one who turned in her own, in her case, to save both herself and her mother from the camps. The anguish of this woman is almost palpable. She knows she is a monster, she knows what she did was horrible, yet we can still empathize with her: if she did not work for the Nazis, her ailing mother would have been sent to the camps to die.Her accuser, a policeman, comes under some interrogation of his own. He was a police sergeant, which means he himself worked for the Nazi regime. No, he only arrested criminals, but, yes, criminals were sent to camps also. No, he had no say in where they went. Yes, he continued to work for them after they arrested and killed his wife. He had no choice. Nobody had a choice. Except . . . everybody had a choice.This of course emerges as the theme. Who was a \\"good\\" German? Simply being alive and German at the end of the war could be construed as a sign of guilt to some degree. Yet, somehow, the valuable scientists that both the Americans and the Russians coveted were able to escape such close scrutiny. So, alas, even those sitting in judgment are shown, predictably, to act in their own self-interest.Interesting, thought-provoking work, and inevitably, very, very sad."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"Are there any good Germans left at the end of World War II? Put another way, who bears responsibility for the enslavement and slaughter of the Jews? Is it just those Nazis who actually participated in the final solution, or must we also include all those millions of Germans who looked the other way to protect themselves, their careers, property and family? And what can we possibly say about Jews who either failed in their duty to other Jews or even actively participated in the final solution themselves?Although this perceptive novel is framed as a mystery when a young American soldier is killed at the start of the Allied Potsdam negotiations, it's also an exploration of morality. The many voices of the novel examine the problem of responsibility for genocide from various points of view. Jake Geismar, the American reporter who drives the story with his insistence on investigating the soldier's death, naively believes (at least at the start) that anyone he knew before the war when he lived in Berlin must be a victim, not a perpetrator. He is aided in this belief by the ruins of Berlin he sees all around him. Bernie Teitel, a Jew himself, is the Army's Nazi hunter, who studies the voluminous paper files kept by the Nazis looking for people to indict. Also on the American side are the scientist hunters, who want to bring the Nazi rocket scientists over to the US to exploit them for their knowledge, regardless of their complicity.The German points of view are also well-represented: hausfraus who claim no knowledge of anything, scientists who claim their only interest is science, old men who maintained an anti-Nazi stance throughout the conflict and still managed to survive, Jews who hunted other Jews, gentiles who tried to protect Jews. Of actual German soldiers we hear little, probably because their case is so easy. And all of this is played out against the frightful ruins of Berlin, so appalling and ever-present they become a character in the story.In the end the mystery is solved and in a sense the good guys win, but by the time you get there you are far less sure who the good guys actually are. And, if you're at all like me, you may find yourself wondering what you would do if you found yourself in the same desperate situation as the German populace under Hitler.It's a fascinating and complex novel, although not one to read if you're looking for an escapist mystery."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"I just finished The Good German, and I struggled through the last two-thirds of the book, resisting the impulse to just stop reading the damn thing. I have a fascination with World War II, especially the post-war period in Europe. Seeing Kanon kill off the possibilities of mystery, danger, plot, and romance in this book is like watching an ax-murderer at work. Occupied Berlin with its collapsed &quot;civilization&quot;, shattered buildings, destitute citizens, and contesting occupying powers, ought to provide a seductive background for mystery and skullduggery. Although Kanon seems to have assiduously studied post-war Berlin, he really hasn't been able to bring the city to life. He can't get his story to leave the ground.This book fails on so many levels. The characters are poorly drawn and unconvincing. There is no reason to care about any of these people. The plot meanders, staggers, and repeatedly stalls. Internal events simply aren't written effectively enough to be plausible. Finally, this is a confusingly told tale-- it's just not written with enough precision or life to capture the reader's attention.Too bad this story didn't work. Kanon seems to have put plenty of effort into what he wrote, but the story just drags along, without life or any real sense of intrigue. I'd suggest that readers try Philip Kerr, who writes about the same period and whose efforts in this regard are far more successful."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"I had a bit of a hard time with the cumbersome plot plodding along, and found the book at times confusing. Historically, however, the book was very informative about the period after WWII generally and about Berlin specifically re a populace living in the most dire circumstances. (Though my most favorite after-WWII read is The Good American by Ursula Maria Mandel, also at Amazon). In general, The Good German was a good, suspenseful read. There were moments one couldn't put the book down, and others, when one just wanted to turn the pages to get on with the plot."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"1) Since the plot has to match history and this book doesn't offer any new twists the story feels contrived and just plods along.2) Two leading characters are overwrought, self-absorbed and their love for each other doesn't feel rooted in anything.3) Plot includes a \\"Casablanca\\"-like love triangle, but without any of those characters' color, warmth or humor.4) Supporting characters are all drawn to be a suspicious lot whose sole purpose seems to be to explain the tough realities of war.5) 500 pages is way too long for a 150 page plot...too much period detail is crammed in without any regard for flow. This should have been a book you can't put down and instead it took me three weeks to finish."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"This was an interesting read - at times slow and boring , then almost equal to John LeCarre at his Cold War best and finally closed out as if the author was tired of it or had his publisher on his back to get it finished .I can understand why the first third of the book was slow since there werE many characters to establish and the circumstances pertaining in Berlin at the end of the war had to be shown to the reader . Having got through this phase the author produced about half of the book which was very much a John LeCarre story with twists and turns typically of his Berlin stories .Then the last part of the book seemed to lose the thread and to become a convoluted who-done-it which very quickly lost the trend of thestory which it had built up.A shame,it could have been such a good book!"},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"Deeply profound, yet shattering in its illumination of the dark days following the defeat of Germany in 1945. Though at times the story seems to plod, it reflects the reality. Kanon has achieved a similar psychological impact for the reader as befell those living in the times--overwhelming disbelief, scorched ruins, suspended anticipation, denial, relentless stamina, indifference, horror, cut-throat opportunism, contradicting moralities, ugly truths, hidden motives, sacrificial dedication, culpable acts, limitless egos, universal guilt, mazes within mazes of intrigue--and yet infinite hope runs parallel to Jake Geismar's quest to find, first, his lost love, and then to solve the mystery of who killed the American soldier dragged out of the waters in the Russian zone during the Potsdam Conference. How quickly the Holocaust was forgotten in the race to be first in space and to get rich on the spoils of war! A cowardly yet greedy human condition, as sad as that is, that still goes on and existed before the Holocaust began and went on while the Holocaust occurred. Kanon takes the stark truth and creates characters to reflect it--not in paper-thin stereotypes but in real examples, and if they seem to stretch credibility for some readers, it is because they did not experience it and can judge with rosy hindsight. A literary triumph that deserves five stars!"},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"A news correspondent in Berlin before the war, Jake Geismar, now returns to cover the Potsdam Conference and write articles for Colliers Magazine. Jake's highest priority is finding his former lover Lena, the wife of a pre-war university mathematics professor and later Nazi scientist working in the German rocket program. When a lieutenant that flew into Berlin with Jake is found dead by Russian guards at a reception near Potsdam with thousands of occupation marks in his pockets, Jake can't resist becoming involved in the investigation. Jake's search for answers leads to involvement with the Army CID (Criminal Investigation), Army Intelligence, and Russian Intelligence. Jake enlists the aid of a former savvy German policeman and people in the black market to find the reasons behind the murder. As his investigation proceeds, the situation becomes increasingly dangerous and he finds himself not knowing who to trust. This is an interesting read with more than a murder investigation at its core. The author paints a vivid picture of Berlin immediately after the end of World War II. The destruction was massive and disease, hunger, and displaced persons were everywhere. The Berliners had to degrade themselves to eat and survive. The birth of a huge black market and the chance for riches infected the Allies as well as the Germans. Destroying information and creating false documents to protect those guilty of war crimes was a thriving business. The tension between the Western Allies and the Russians was at a dangerous level and the competition between these former Allies for the services of German scientists was intense."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"It is in the months following WWII in Berlin that \\"The Good German\\" is set. Joseph Kanon in his third novel captures, readily the tonal integrity, the dynamic symmerty, thefull atmosphere of this traumatic time in history. Jake Geismar returns to Berlin to cover the Potsdam Conference, at least that's his cover.More knowledgeable than his colleagues know, Jake has spent time in Berlin before the war. He's now looking to pick up the pieces, perhaps more literally than one might think. At the center of his reasons for returning: to find Lena, the woman he loved-and left-because of the war. Jake finds Lena, but Lena's husband is missing. He's a top-rated mathematician and both the Russian and American intelligence agencies want him-badly.However, as the Conference is progressing, an American soldier's body is found in the Russian sector of Berlin. Thus begins what is certainly one of the tautest murder mystery thrillers lately.Yes, Kanon evokes LeCarre, Len Deighton, even Robert Ludlum in places, yet he holds his own with the riveting story line and Jake is a memorable character, one who easily combines romance with espionage, social significance with irony. Philosophicand poetic, Kanon's literary reach is broad, but not so much that it drags. The author, clearly in control of the plot development, cruises to a dramatic-and exciting-finish.

Rather than tell a story, Kanon fills page after page with dialog -- not particularly great dialog -- and leaves it to you to wade through and find meaning. I found myself desparately scanning ahead, looking for a paragraph that would advance the plot or illuminate the characters. Alas, there weren't many."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"I originally bought this book because it was a thriller, a genre I enjoy, and because it takes place in Berlin, where I lived for nine years. I really didn't expect to like it. However, within the first few pages, I was hooked! Each clue and event compelled me to keep turning pages. The characters were well developed and believable. I also enjoyed the descriptions of Berlin in 1945, and the philosophy behind the title and the book. Who are the &quot;war criminals&quot;, to what extent are a people guilty of what their government does. etc."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"Joseph Kanon first earned my attention with &quot;Los Alamos&quot;. This is a second, intriguing read. &quot;The Good German&quot; offers a look at Berlin in late 1945, recovering from the war. As part of the recovery, people try to assemble their lives shattered by the war. There are the two lovers, one American and one German, separated for four years. There is the German scientist, eagerly sought by the Americans. There are the Russians, stereotyped as intent primarily on rape, revenge and pillage. And then there is the dead American, shot after the fighting, found at the time and location of the Potsdam Conference. This death draws the story together, including the black marketeer, the British journalist, the starving local citizens, and the resurrection that follows deadly combat.An engaging, entertaining, detailed read, painting vivid pictures of lives drab and destroyed by war."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"In this fictional romance detective (mystery/thriller) novel Joseph Kanon works with real historical facts (Allied occupation of Berlin in the summer of 1945) and places (Berlin and environs of Potsdam and Grunewald) to create a MORALLY INTROSPECTIVE plot. Historical facts are presented to show the evils done not only by the Nazis, but also the Russian soldiers, and the American GIs.As some of the other reviewers mentioned, this novel is not great for it's detective story. Our action-hero, Jake/Jacob Geismar, is a war-correspondent for the US Army and seems to survive many incredulous circumstances.The complexity of the novel is much more than untangling a web of mystery in the underground world of post-WWII Berlin. At the heart of the novel is the MORAL EXPLORATION of what we mean by good and evil, and of the nature of justice in times of war and relative peace.As such, the title \\"The Good German\\" is a key to understanding the moral intricacies of the characters presented in this novel. This title is echoed in only four places (as far as I could notice).So what does it mean to be a \\"good German?\\"According to Joseph Kanon:a) \\"Not a Nazi.\\" (pg. 72)b) De-nazified German scientists. (pg. 265)c) Gunther, a German policeman during the war and detective-for-hire under occupied Berlin who was also an Iron Cross veteran (1917) during the Great World War. (pg. 464)d) Americanzined Germans (German scientists and German population who is willing to forget the past and get with the new program: the new war, the Cold War)."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"What was life like in Berlin after the fall of the Nazis, when the conquering Allies first took over the government? This very well-written book answers that question, and in addition, gives us a fine mystery to solve along with the hero. We see the condition of the city and its inhabitants, and also get a good glimpse into the Allied administration, perhaps a closer, and more searching, look than we really want to see, after all of these years. There's a mysterious death at the site of the Potsdam conference, and from that flows all of the rest of the action. There's a love story that also drives the plot, because it becomes essentially tied into the murder. Out hero displays a lot of stubbornness in the face of history, and from the view of hindsight it seems that he was one of the last of the \\"true believers\\" in the righteousness of the Allied cause. The Allied governments don't come out in this book as quite the upright folks we'd like to believe, but history has been kind to them, so we must pity him for his naivete. You'll enjoy this book, so I recommend that you read it."},{"Title":"The Good German","review":"The Good German is a rarity---a thinking person's thriller. The characters are extremely well-developed, the moral issues raised by the story (and setting) are really thought-provoking and the plot is fascinating.Jake, an American journalist, returns to Berlin in 1945 to search for the married woman with whom he had an affair before being forced to leave Berlin. While Jake manages to find Lena, his attempts to persuade her to join him become hopelessly convoluted when she insists on finding and notifying her husband of her decision to leave him. Lena's husband, it turns out, was a rocket scientist/mathematician who worked for the Nazis and who is now the target of a concentrated search by both the Russians and Americans (who want not to try her husband but rather to exploit his knowledge of weapons and missles).While Russian and American intelligence are courting former Nazi scientists, Nazi and Nazi sympathizers who lack valuable knowledge are being systematically put on trial by both the Russians and Americans. The parallel story of Renate, a Jewish Berliner who worked for the Nazis as a \\"catcher\\" (someone who identified and caught Jews for the Nazis while under threat of death) presents an incredible counterpoint to the story of Lena's husband.This is not a book which you can easily put down---the writing is great and the story moves along quickly. But it is the issues or moral responsibility which will remain with you long after you have finished the book. You won't regret buying this book!"},{"Title":"WALKERS","review":"I've been reading a lot of Graham Masterton lately and with each book, I've turned the last page with more appreciation and wonder at his talent and imagination. I finally got around to reading WALKERS recently and it blew me away. Masterton really outdid himself with this one. It is one of the fastest moving novels he's ever done and in some ways, his most outrageous. I felt like I had jumped into a moving car when I sat down to read it... Jack Reed comes across his life's ambition in the woods of Wisconsin: an old derelict building that was once a sanitarium known as The Oakes. Abandoned for almost 60 years, Reed sees potential in it as a future resort or country club. He learns very quickly, however, that it harbors dark and dangerous secrets and it has chosen him to open it's Pandora's Box of horrors. 135 patients vanished inside the place in the 1920's and they have been living inside it's very walls. Not behind the walls, mind you, but IN the walls. They will stop at nothing to free themselves, including kidnapping Reed's own son. And once they are free of the confines of The Oakes property, they go on a bloodthirsty spree across the city and state... Masterton pulls no punches with WALKERS. It is unapologetically bloody and fast moving, (almost, but not quite, to a fault.) Highly recommended for horror fans who think they've read it all..."},{"Title":"WALKERS","review":"When it comes to horror, Graham Masterton has done it all, and quite successfully. Walkers is considered by many to be one of Masterton's most entertaining and most horrific efforts. And entertaining it is. Written at the end of the 1980s, when the big horror boost of that decade was waning, Walkers is a hold-no-barrels horror story that is all about pace. And blood.The story gives us Jack, the All-American father who stumbles upon an old building on a dark, rainy night. He falls in love with the building and decides he wants to buy it to turn it into a resort hotel. Only, the building is still inhabited, and the people living there aren't quite ready to give away their home.Ghosts? Not really. They are walkers, people who are trapped between two worlds. They come to the surface by merging into walls. But when they are accidentally set loose, the world itself will be faced with the most dangerous kind of monsters. And even worst, they kidnap Jack's son in the hopes of sacrificing him. A high body count ensues, and a race against time begins.Is the book fun? Yes, brainless fun. Is the book entertaining? Yes. The suspense is great, the horror is original and the premise is quite fun. But don't expect a masterpiece out of Walkers. The characters are one-dimensional. And every time a secondary character comes into the story, it's not hard to guess what will happen to them. They all end up the same.But what the book lacks in plot and plausibility, it gains in pacing. The whole thing can easily be read in one sitting. It's the kind of book where you just have to let go of all your notions of realism and just go with the flow. If you're capable of doing that, then you'll probably end up having a good time reading Walkers. It's not Masterton at his best, but it's still very entertaining."},{"Title":"WALKERS","review":"Walkers is one horror novel that rivals anything written by Stephen King or similar authors of the horror genre.Graham Masterton does it again with this chilling novel.Masterton is known for his candid brand of horror writing without getting the reader lost or sidetracked. The first story of Masterton I read back in the 70's was The Manitou (story and movie about an evil ancient Indian spirit entering the world through a tumor in a woman's neck !). The major difference in Walkers is the story and action move at an alarming rapid pace without ever losing the reader or the reader's interest!The central character Jack finds himself yearning for a greater prospective goal in his midlife. He thinks he finds this realization in an old abandoned 60 year old building which once housed 137 criminally insane patients. He soon discovers the building's horrific secret when his only 9 year old son suddenly vanishes. What is the link between his son's enigmatic disappearance and the abominable secret hidden in the structure of the sanitarium's walls? You must read the book to find out !I highly recommend this title based on it's author's incredible and otherworldly imagination. This is not a novel about ghosts, nor about a haunted house (in the typical sense). The novel almost echoes a resemblance to a late 80's to early 90's film called People Under The Stairs (or vice versa)... What the reader discovers is that for every fear or phobia he or she might have or think they have, this novel by Graham Masterton will surely instill yet another one ! Do not read this novel alone at home near a brick wall...In fact, you may never look at any of your walls, ceiling, or cellar the same way again !..."},{"Title":"WALKERS","review":"I picked this book up from the library without knowing anything about it beforehand - the blurb on the back and the cover image enticed me, so I picked it up. This is not my usual way of going about reading books but I cannot express how glad I was to have laid my hands on this one. I'm pretty hard to scare or impress but this book scared the absolute s--- out of me. It stayed with me for weeks, months. I tell you: after reading this you'll never look at the walls the same again. Half way through reading it I had to go outside because I was too terrified to keep my back to the wall; but then, after reading a bit more, I realized that leaving the house wasn't enough: this book stay with you no matter where you are. Gives you nightmares. I'd only recommend reading this if you are a true horror fan; otherwise, prepare to be tormented. And because it had such an effect on me, it was brilliant. Once a book affects a person it has achieved its purpose."},{"Title":"WALKERS","review":"WALKERS contains plot elements that I've seen in other Masterton novels.There's the protagonist's obsession with a piece of spooky real estate that we saw inThe House That Jack Built. There is the mythology fromHouse of Bones. There's the strategy of pursuing the villains by going into their supernatural domain that we saw inMirror,Prey, andSpirit(and probably a lot of others).And there's also that element of the protagonist engaging in some behavior that many readers may find just too stupid, like leaving your child unattended in a spooky house (similar to the stupid behavior of the protagonist inPreyandPicture of Evil).But the book that WALKERS reminded me the most of is the aforementionedHouse of Bonesbecause of the shared mythology that provides the basis for the story, and my biggest problem with WALKERS was that it suffered by comparison. HOB had the better laid out plot and more compelling characters, and relied less on gore to provide chills."},{"Title":"WALKERS","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I have never read anything by Masterton before, so I really didn't know what to expect. Just when I thought the poor main character suffered enough, more came along.

I will read more of this author."},{"Title":"WALKERS","review":"i have to say that this is quite possibly one of the most amazing books I have ever read.

If you can get the chance to indulge in this book, jump all over it.

This book deals with the occult and undead with the ability to travel through the ground and in walls. Sounds a bit odd, I know, but Masterton really knows how to make horror work.

This is one of my favorites so far from Masterton."},{"Title":"WALKERS","review":"I got this book shortly before Halloween -- I was looking for a good thriller for the season, but it was just okay.

Literally I didn't feel safe anywhere.! He makes the make believe so real, and for those who didn't like it, what can I say-samll intelectuals. Too much information to grasp! God, I mean his characters are always 35 year old men, with marital problems and son's but thei're adventures are beyond mortal. Manitou and the Sphinx were superb.

Otherwise, be prepared to slap your forehead at regular intervals. I found Masteron's overly simple, patronizing narrative style hard to bear, but the sheer idiocy of the plot made me grind my teeth with every page turned. In fact, this is one of the rare books I simply couldn't force myself to finish - not because is was &quot;scary&quot; in any way, but for the simple reason that life is too short to waste valuable reading time with drivel like this.

There are nice full color pictures of the drinks in the appropriate stemware.In the back are several recipes for food nibblers, guacamole, salsa, chili con queso, fajitas, etc. all with pictures and clear instructions.

He makes so much sense about a right relationship with our Maker. This small book (143 pages in my version) is a series of 46 two to three page essays, covering a variety of topics including: \\"The Great God Entertainment\\", \\"The Cross is a Radical Thing\\", and my two particular favourites: \\"The Whole Life must Pray\\" and \\"We must Die if we would Live.\\"Each essay is to the point, usually quotes Scripture, and challenges the reader to spend more time with God and less time on themselves. As the back cover of my particular edition states:\\"Progress in the Christian Life is exactly equal to the growing knowledge we gain of the Triune God in personal experience. And such experience requires a whole life devoted to it and plenty of time spent at the holy task of cultivating God. God can be known satisfactorily only as we devote time to Him.\\"In our too busy lives, we can give God fleeting moments, when He desires to walk with us all day every day.

Now to the third instalment."},{"Title":"The Root of the Righteous","review":"Most Christians tend to look for the fruit as evidence of a transformed life - Tozer reminds the reader that the root of righteousness produces fruit. Regardless of whether you can see the evidence of a life rooted in Christ, the goal of the Christian life is not solely the outward expression, but rather the inward transformation.

Yet this book was written in 1955!Tozer is an island of Truth in today's wishy-washy sea of dumbed down, \\"smiley face\\" Modern Evangelicalism and the Church Growth Movement. It's too bad American Protestantism hasn't heeded Tozer's warning."},{"Title":"The Root of the Righteous","review":"I have yet to finish this book but already it has been behooving to read. Tozer points to the root of our interaction with the Lord being more important than the preoccupation with our egocentric \\"fruit-bearing.\\" Do not get me wrong, Jesus commands us to bear much fruit and so prove to be His disciples, may God strengthen you (and me!) to do just that; however, there is no everlasting fruit from a branch not on the Vine. This is Tozer's point: fruit will blossom from the Christian who is constantly growing His roots deeper into Christ. His many essays in this book explore the facets of the life lived in constant communion and seeking after God. The essays make this book very readable for those who, like myself, can only afford to read in short breaks every now and then."},{"Title":"The Root of the Righteous","review":"Simply awesome book and must have next to the Bible.

In the 1910s this was done, as it is done in every generation, but only with great difficulty and some soul-searching on both sides.So buy and read this book if you want to read about young Harry's epic quest. Bess' letters to Harry are lost, but Harry Truman's letters are so vivid that their contents can be partly reconstucted. The two were real soul mates in the end - in the true sense of this most over-used phrase. They could actually converse by letter. How many of us are so lucky?Buy and read this book if you want to see these two attractive people in the vanished world of 1910s Missouri. If you're looking for President Harry Truman, you won't find much of him here. By 1945 this pair had been married and living together for 25 years and were no longer writing daily letters to each other. But if you are one of those people who think that Truman was one of our greatest Presidents because he never forgot who he was and where he came from, you may want to know where he came from. He came from here, in this book."},{"Title":"DEAR BESS - THE LETTERS FROM HARRY TO BESS TRUMAN 1910 - 1959","review":"The courtship of Harry Truman and Bess Wallace, is *the* over-looked love story of the century. Dear Bess is the most romantic book I have ever read. Harry's simplicity and honesty is a joy to read, and Bess would have been a fool to turn him down a second time.From a historical standpoint, this book is a glimpse into the everyday, pre-presidential life of HST. The respect and dignity this Missouri farmer had for the Office of the President is refreshing. I come away from the book feeling like I know Harry. Coupling Dear Bess with David McCullough's Truman gives a picture of the man and his times in a very compelling fashion.Dear Bess is a must-read for anyone who wants to know what love and responsibility are."},{"Title":"DEAR BESS - THE LETTERS FROM HARRY TO BESS TRUMAN 1910 - 1959","review":"This very personal look at young Harry S. Truman (1884-1972) should be of interest to history buffs and fans of our 33rd President. The book is primarily a collection of letters that Truman sent to his girlfriend (and later wife) Bess Wallace (Truman), the letters being found in her home shortly after she passed away at age 97 in 1982. Most of these letters were written by young suitor Harry Truman prior to the First World War, when he was a struggling farmer and she a desirable beau from a prosperous (if dysfunctional) city family. Sadly, Harry didn't save Bess' letters to him, and those are lost to history. In these letters Truman comes across as decent, honest, and intelligent - if slightly prejudiced against immigrant workers in Kansas City. If his presidential talent isn't evident in these letters, his sturdy Missouri roots clearly are."},{"Title":"DEAR BESS - THE LETTERS FROM HARRY TO BESS TRUMAN 1910 - 1959","review":"This is a great book. I ordered a copy for my student's graduation. She writes to her fiance every day who is in the Army. I thought she could appreciate how Harry Truman kept his marriage alive while in the whitehouse.

Murphy gives a satisfying and stimulating introduction to biblical Wisdom literature (including Sirach and Wisdom of Solomon) as well as treatments on Wisdom intertextuality, theology, and the metaphor of Woman Wisdom. However, the layout of the book - moving updates to separate appendices - makes it cumbersome to read, and Murphy's methodology leaves something to be desired. All in all, this is an invaluable resource for lay readers and those without an extensive background in Wisdom studies, but the more advanced scholar will probably be disappointed in this work."},{"Title":"The Tree of Life: An Exploration of Biblical Wisdom Literature","review":"The wisdom literature of the Old Testament is an engaging and important aspect of Old Testament studies, yet one that is not always well understood or fully appreciated. Roland E. Murphy, a Catholic scholar who has devoted his life to the study and exposition of that wisdom literature, has provided an informed, balanced, and useful volume that summarizes the results of that lifetime of study. The third edition is an expansion in the form of an added supplement, the Millennium Supplement, which interacts with developments in the field of wisdom scholarship since the publication of the two previous editions. The aim of his study is to survey the biblical quest for wisdom, what that quest entails, and how the wisdom literature is a part of and converses with the rest of the Old Testament (x).Murphy's book is organized into nine chapters. The first chapter is an introduction, which treats preliminary issues such as classifying wisdom literature, identifying the biblical books that belong to that class, speculating on the identity of the Israelite sages, and discerning the language and literary forms the wisdom writers employed. The next five chapters examine the biblical wisdom books themselves: Proverbs, Job, Qoheleth, Sirach, and the Wisdom of Solomon. The latter two wisdom books are deuterocanonical, and scholars can appreciate Murphy's Catholic perspective, which enables him to include these books that make a valuable contribution to Israelite wisdom. The seventh chapter is an investigation of supposed wisdom influence on other Old Testament literature. The eighth chapter considers the theological message of the wisdom literature and how it relates to the deuteronomistic and prophetic corpora of the Old Testament. The last chapter is an analysis of Lady Wisdom, her literary characteristics, her theological import, and her identity as female. An appendix on Egyptian, Mesopotamian, and Hellenistic wisdoms and their influence on the biblical wisdom literature completes the main text, while the two supplements, designed for advanced students and scholars, engage more recent and technical discussion on wisdom studies. Overall, the book is well written and lucid, and Murphy tries to expound the Israelite wisdom as candidly and thoughtfully as possible.His introduction makes clear that biblical wisdom literature should be limited to Proverbs, Job, Qoheleth, Sirach, and the Wisdom of Solomon. He postpones detailed discussion of wisdom influence on other Old Testament passages until chapter seven. He highlights the crucial fact that Israelite wisdom literature is concerned with what it means to be a human being in general. Therefore, one should not be surprised by the absence of distinctively Jewish themes, such as covenant, cult, and promises (1). While acknowledging the existence of sages in Israel and their role in the formulation and transmission of the wisdom tradition, Murphy cautions that the wisdom books themselves provide little information about the sages and that wisdom was also communicated in the context of family and the immediate community (3-5). Whether a professional class of sages or the core family unit was the more likely context for the development of wisdom tradition, nevertheless wisdom took on and was dressed in various structures and forms, examples of the former being parallelism and paronomasia, and examples of the latter being the saying and the admonition. On how to interpret wisdom - especially proverbs - Murphy offers two apt observations. First, proverbs were not mechanistic formulae for the working of the universe, i.e. they did not constitute a rigid and inflexible retributive theology. Therefore, each statement is not absolute truth; it is only relative (11). Second, and perhaps helping to explain the first, wisdom took account of and ultimately recognized the mysterious working of God, the fear of whom was the foundation of any true pursuit of wisdom (11).Although there are only five wisdom books properly, Murphy is aware of and interacts with scholarship that looks for wisdom 'echoes' elsewhere in the Old Testament; and though he does not entirely dismiss the search for wisdom influence (see 107-108), he does encourage a careful and judicious approach. The main problem with discerning wisdom influence is the lack of methodological precision for what constitutes influence. Murphy delineates the three typical criteria scholars use to adduce influence (vocabulary, literary forms, and content) and says that even the presence of all three cannot demonstrate conclusively wisdom influence. The reason is that the sages did not have a monopoly on wisdom themes and literary forms; otherwise, their language would be jargon and unintelligible to common people (100). Murphy critiques the claims of wisdom influence in the Psalms, Deuteronomy, and Song of Songs. He believes that the clearest demonstration of wisdom influence is in certain Psalms - specifically 1, 32, 34, 37, 49, 112, and 128 (103). He also accepts that wisdom tradition may have influenced certain prophetic sayings, such as Isaiah 28.23-29 (100).Whether one can attribute explicit wisdom influence to various parts of the Old Testament, one can nevertheless affirm with confidence that wisdom permeates the Old Testament and therefore must be a more integral element of its holistic theology than scholars have acknowledged until now. Murphy is not advocating a systematized biblical theology, as though there were a center of biblical theology (he does not believe there is one). Instead, he is saying that any biblical theology seeking to be faithful to the Old Testament itself must incorporate the wisdom literature and its tradition as a central part of the biblical witness and not as a peripheral one (112). Murphy lists four theological perspectives that wisdom offers: an understanding of reality, a search for order, creation theology, and the wisdom experience (112). He emphasizes that wisdom does not view reality ahistorically and that consequently it recognizes an organic relationship between people and the world. Yet it also takes account of the mysterious working of God, so that it can affirm on the one hand human free will and on the other the ultimate causality that is God (114). Murphy is skeptical that Israelite wisdom was, at its core, a search for order, like the Egyptian concept of ma\`at (115-116). Instead, wisdom was about a dynamic relationship with the one God, who created the cosmos, imbued it with his presence and values, and who made human beings to fulfill their potential in sole orientation to God (120) Thus, the creation is as much a means of God's revelation as the Sinai covenant (122).In his last chapter - that on Lady Wisdom - Murphy focuses on this literary character as a personification of wisdom. He doubts that she was a hypostasis in the later Hellenistic sense but rather thinks she was an integral part of God himself, an extension or communication of God (133). Lady Wisdom is intriguing because, on the one hand, she engages human beings to come to her, listen to her, and embrace her; on the other hand, she is a gift to be received from God. In fact, Murphy calls attention to several texts (notably Job 28 and Proverbs 8) that talk about how wisdom is inaccessible to humans and how only God knows where wisdom is located, with the result that only God can reveal her. When God grants wisdom to his people, what he grants to them is himself (147). This tension highlights the human and divine aspects that characterize the mystery of wisdom.The prolegomena to wisdom studies and the theological nature of wisdom serve as the bookends for Murphy's book. In between are his analysis of the wisdom books proper, and again he detects a tension in the biblical witness. While Proverbs has a rather optimistic retributive theology, Murphy sees Job and Qoheleth as nuancing that perspective, as genuine questioning that is able to be part of Israel's faith (34). He sees Sirach as a traditionalist whose contribution consists in equating wisdom with the Torah, and he perceives thorough Hellenistic influence on the Wisdom of Solomon, which gives a perspective from the Diaspora. Murphy says that the Wisdom of Solomon teaches immortality, but he qualifies that assertion by saying that the author does not see immortality as a natural property of human beings, but as a gift received in relationship with God (86). Also, in regard to the connection between Proverbs and the Teaching of Amenemope, Murphy states that direct literary dependence, while possible, does not need to be maintained, as the Israelite writer shows his independence and the connection can be explained by the way in which ideas become common currency (24). As for the historicity of Job, Murphy prefers to see the story as legend, not history, and he thinks the speeches are polished literary accomplishments, not anything actually spoken by historical persons (35).The structure of Murphy's book is both distracting yet helpful. The book would have been a more fluid read if Murphy had rewritten the book and wove into the fabric of each chapter material from the supplements. Such a re-working would also minimize the need to turn back and forth between pages. On the other hand, as Thomas Renz and Stephen Garfinkel observe, this structure allows the main text to focus on the elementary and principal issues, an approach that preserves readability for the student or intelligent lay-reader. The supplements, then, provide interested and able students, as well as scholars, with a more technical treatment.Some reviewers, such as David Penchansky, disagree with Murphy's insistence that the biblical material should have a univocal witness, contending that Murphy does not allow for ideological perspectives of the text that cannot be harmonized or reconciled. Murphy does see tension within individual witnesses (e.g. Qoheleth) and within the wisdom corpus as a whole (e.g. Proverbs vis-&agrave;-vis Qoheleth). Still, he does not see a tension that is contradictory, but one that is creative and allows for a more coherent picture than many scholars assume. Also, Penchansky disapproves of Murphy's use of numerological indications in the text to reconstruct and interpret those texts (i.e. proposed emendations). While Penchansky is right that one has to be cautious when engaging in reconstructive exegesis (i.e. emending the texts and basing one's exegesis on the emendations), Murphy is only trying to make sense of and follow the indications that the text itself evinces and how they shed light on the author's compositional strategy and meaning. Overall, Murphy is conscientious and judicious in this enterprise.Murphy does a good job of showing how the wisdom literature is a valid interpretation and expression of Israel's faith. He could be faulted for feeling the need to establish this validity by connecting wisdom to the concept of 'salvation history.' More likely Murphy is just trying to work in the generally established framework that scholars assume, and it is within that framework that he tries to challenge traditional assumptions. In this way, his goal is not an interpretive or schematic overhaul. The result is that Penchansky's critique, while a discrete observation, is slightly beside the point.One place that Murphy did not bring out the fullness of the wisdom literature is in regard to form, i.e. how the form determines the function and performance of the saying or admonition, a very interesting area of study. More research needs to be devoted to this question.One can read Murphy's book and walk away somewhat disappointed. The book is not exhaustive; it only addresses the major and most salient issues. But the purpose of the book was not to be comprehensive; its purpose was to pull together the main threads of Murphy's research into one place and give a readable account of the place of wisdom literature in Israelite thought and in Old Testament theology. If this was his goal - as it seems to have been - then Murphy succeeded admirably; and while not a particularly novel monograph, it is nonetheless a cogent, intelligent, and careful reference work that will be helpful to students and scholars for years to come.Select BibliographyBland, David.

He gives careful analysis of the main issues in each of the books (Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Wisdom of Solomon & Ecclesiasticus or Ben Sirach) and indications of the variations among scholars in relation to these issues. His bibliography is helpful without being overwhelming. It is also helpful that the book includes two updates of the original 1990 publication, the latest in 2002. A helpful antidote to some of the Barthian-era scholarly cliches which were dismissive of the Wisdom tradition and its impact on the New Testament and church life in general."},{"Title":"The Tree of Life: An Exploration of Biblical Wisdom Literature","review":"Roland Murphy's Tree of Life ( 3rd edition) is a wonderful study of the so-called \\"Wisdom Literature\\" in the Old Testament--including Proverbs, Job, Qoheleth, Ben Sira, and the Wisdom of Solomon. The book was originally published in 1990, but Murphy has added two fascinating supplements, one in 1996, the other in 2000. While his addition of supplements seems a bit unusual (why not integrate new material into the old?--a question he asks himself), he decided, wisely I think, to separate the new updated material from the original. The result is that one can see the shift in interpretive approaches over a 10 year period or so.For the ordinary reader such as myself, what is most fascinating about this study is the light it puts on a rather profound question: how is wisdom literature related to the historical tradition by which Israel identified itself. One way to see this is to experience the difference between a salvation-liberation narrative and a literature of wisdom, or the search for it. I think Murphy does throw much light on this issue, though I suspect more will be written about it in the future.One of the perspectives that struck me was that books like Qoheleth and Job actually became part of the Christian scriptures. They are frankly skeptical and questioning in tone. While some might say that faith in Christ resolves all the skeptical tensions raised in these books, I think to the contrary that these tensions always remain. However, Murphy does an admirable job of showing how skepticism in this ancient context always presupposed a faith in God. We are not used to the idea that these two things could \\"go together\\". This is why attention to Wisdom literature, among other reasons, continues to be relevant to Christian faith even today. Faith and questioning are not antithetical."},{"Title":"The Tree of Life: An Exploration of Biblical Wisdom Literature","review":"I ordered this on Jan 1st and found it in my mail today! (Jan 4) Now that's service. It is indeed in new condition and, to my surprise, is an updated version of the one I have been reading, making the whole deal even better."},{"Title":"The Tree of Life: An Exploration of Biblical Wisdom Literature","review":"Roland Murphy's The Tree of Life provides an excellent introduction to biblical scholarship on Wisdom Literature (primarily Proverbs, Job, Ecclesiastes, Sirach, Wisdom of Solomon). Murphy gives a thorough but accessible overview of the genre of biblical wisdom texts, the history of research on those texts, and the big theological themes they raise. That said, the book's format for the updated editions was short-sighted and created a cumbersome reading experience. The book is in its third edition. Rather than add material in a proper revision of the first edition, the updates were tacked on the end of the volume as \\"supplements.\\" The supplements add a few pages of additional comment on each chapter and bring the bibliography up to date somewhat. So, the third edition actually has two separate supplements. The 1996 supplement adds to the 1990 original and the 2000 supplement adds to both. Getting Murphy's full treatment of a topic requires reading the chapter, flipping to the first supplement's addition to that chapter, and then flipping to the \\"Millennial\\" supplement's addition to the same chapter. Even adding the supplements to the end of each chapter instead of the very end of the book would have been a better organization. The book would get five stars from me if it were not organized in such a fashion. I hope any plans for a fourth edition would result in an actual new edition, incorporating the updates into the main text."},{"Title":"The Tree of Life: An Exploration of Biblical Wisdom Literature","review":"Roland Murphy is an acclaimed scholar of biblical wisdom literature, but this introductory book is quite plodding and uninsightful. He's overly cautious throughout, and refrains from saying anything particularly pointed or definite. A lot of the time, he'll write, \\"theory 'A' is intriguing and there are evidences for and against,\\" but not really say anything one way or another. His latter chapters on Wisdom's Echoes, Wisdom Literature and Theology, Lady Wisdom are especially insipid.But I do give him credit for his chapters on Proverbs and Job. His explanation of the ending coda on the worthy wife was helpful, though I thought he could have gone further and made the obvious connection to Jesus. (That's another thing: he makes no Christological or New Testament connections. I guess it's to make the book as ecumenical [read: bland] as possible.) His analysis of Job as a corrective to a simplistic theology of retribution that one might get from a superficial reading of Proverbs was great. His chapter on Ecclesiastes (Qoheleth) was so-so. And I fell asleep several times reading his summaries of the two Apocraphal wisdom books.His introductory chapter was also helpful. I found his sagely advice on pg. 10-11 especially good - \\"A proverb presents only a narrow slice of reality; much depends upon its context...What is needed is the proper context in which they are pertinent...The saying is not an absolute; it is relative.\\" You basically can't read a proverb in isolation and apply it uncritically to all situations; this is the mistake Job's three friends made.But all of this does not overcome how completely uninteresting his latter chapters were. I'm quite disappointed that for such a poetic topic, Murphy wrote a sleep-inducing prosaic textbook. This is a side note, but kudos for the book cover."},{"Title":"MCSE Windows 2000 Security Design Exam Prep (Exam: 70-220)","review":"This book covers everything that is necessary for the exam. It was pretty well organized, and covers everything in enough depth to answer exam questions. The only thing missing is the end of chapter &quot;cram outline&quot; - something to stuff into your brain just before the exam.The book did not always incorporate Microsoft's guidance on design issues - what's really included on the exam. I found that the slide decks from Tech Ed (find the one on CA's!) did a better job preparing me for the exam. This exam requires a lot of real world experience - anyone with a CISSP certification should well.The CD has only a few sample questions (mostly not on security), but provides access to the web site for the additional questions. The CD does duplicate the exam format, which is substantially different than the old exams. The CD software crashed with Dr. Watson errors on an NT Workstation, so it took several tries to get through the practice exams."},{"Title":"MCSE Windows 2000 Security Design Exam Prep (Exam: 70-220)","review":"I liked the book, It covers in detail all the conceptual stuff.

My other gripe is that the only challenge posed by the questions at the end of the chapters is that they are ambiguous or otherwise poorly worded, often leading to incorrect conclusions.If you buy this book, you will be back looking for a replacement pretty quick.. take a look at the &quot;Designing Microsoft Windows Network Security MSCE Training Kit&quot; from MS Press as an alternative, and definitely pick up the MCSE Readiness Review for a better look at what an actually test might be like."},{"Title":"MCSE Windows 2000 Security Design Exam Prep (Exam: 70-220)","review":"I am a student at the University of Houston-Downtown.

Patrice McSherry's research is rigorously documented and lays bare the central role the United States played in supporting Operation Condor and nurturing the Latin American \\"national security state.\\" This book will be very useful for any reader interested in Latin American politics and society and in United States relations with the rest of the Americas. I highly recommend \\"Predatory States.\\""},{"Title":"Predatory States: Operation Condor and Covert War in Latin America","review":"This is a must read, especially if you're still puzzled by seemingly unanimous worldwide contempt for Washington. With lucid prose, thorough documentation and gory detail, historian McSherry leads her reader to the inescapable conclusion that, in Latin America at least, the U.S. government rarely lets respect for human rights get in the way of self-interest. As the Reagan team reassured the generalissimos even before its electoral victory, the early days of the Jimmy Carter presidency (1976-1980) would be an unusual exception. Even before Carter came to Washington, the Nixon and Ford administrations helped create the Chilean monster that was the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, which would quickly exterminate 3,000 of its perceived enemies. And with a helping hand from the CIA and encouragement from Henry Kissinger, Pinochet would partner with neighboring caudillos in Operation Condor, a kidnapping and assassination collaborative that would target the dictators' civilian opponents abroad. All of which is common knowledge among the supposedly ignorant masses, the myriad victims of IMF and WTO austerity regimens south of the Border. It's high time norteamericanos achieved comparable historical literacy. \\"Predatory States\\" is a good place to jump start the process."},{"Title":"Predatory States: Operation Condor and Covert War in Latin America","review":"Among the reason why I liked \\"Predatory States: Operation Condor and Covert War in Latin America\\" by J. Patrice McSherry is the fact that she kept relevant the events that took place in Lating America more than 20 year ago by comparing them to current ones like the just \\"revealed brutal methods and secret operations\\" (xxi) used by the United States to fight terrorism worldwide.On the first chapter the author successfully explains what led Latin American countries into the bloody repression by military dictatorships: \\"the distribution of power and wealth in human society, who gets what, how, and why.\\" (6)It is also interesting the fact that this books shows how repression spread from South America to Central America. Repression in Central America was not just the result of government fights against guerrillas, military governments wanted to consolidate their power.One more thing that made this book worth reading was the testimonies the author gathered. Having witness, victims, and survivors speak about their experience adds value to the research done in this book."},{"Title":"Predatory States: Operation Condor and Covert War in Latin America","review":"My sister and I read this book and were not only impressed with McSherry's clean and highly readable writing style but her detective work and synthesis of so many newly released files allows the reader to absorb and remember so much of this truly astonishing Condor story. We were both surprised at how much we were able to remember when talking to each other on the phone about the 6 Condor countries and their strange brutal training from the C.I.A. and ex-Nazis. The book arcs back to World War II and then brings the reader to the 1970s and Condor. Chapter 2 and 3 are really stunning."},{"Title":"Predatory States: Operation Condor and Covert War in Latin America","review":"The author seems to have started with the theory that the US is to blame, then searched for evidence to validate her theory.But what she calls US involvement or support isn't proven by the documents she references.

They don't show knowledge or support."},{"Title":"The Land Breakers","review":"This is the first Ehle book I've read and I can say categorically that he richly deserves every award won, and more.From Ireland's County Ulster to the mist shrouded highlands of North Carolina, Mooney and Imy Wright search for a new beginning. The year is 1779, the infancy of a new country. Both are indentured servants finally free of service. They're accustomed to working hard in tandem and are willing to fight for any parcel of land they can find to call home. Home becomes a high mountain valley, a place of breath takingvistas thick with primeval forests and dangerous predators. Working together side by side as they have done since childhood, Imy and Mooney clear a spot of land and builda cabin.Family by family, new settlers move into the mountain valley. Tinkler Harrison sold vast holdings in Virginia to resettle in the new territory. Tinkler is a hard man who desires to be master of all he surveys. Accompanying him are herds of livestock, horses, seed for planting, several slaves, and his remaining son and daughter. All but two of his children have deserted him.Ernest Plover is the patriarch of a bedraggled band of daughters, each one prettier than the next. The oldest daughter, Belle, becomes Tinkler's bride. In contrast toTinkler's mansion home and the Wright's sturdy cabin, the Plover's build a ramshackle cabin that barely protects them from the elements.German immigrant Nicholas Benz brings his family to the mountain in search of peace and promise. Nicholas is a hard worker who hides his demons behind a bland faade.The Larkins are newlyweds, still too young to fully understand the hardness of life. Like their neighbors, they enjoy the mountain air that seems clean and alive. The mountains, forests, and valley are still and peaceful except for nature sounds. Primordial forests surround them, vibrant with bloom and bird. Despite the hardships, this small community of settlers love their mountain valley.Each family battles the elements and wild animals while laboring to break fields and plant crops. In 1779, any illness or injury can prove fatal. Imy is the first to die of lung fever and overwork in harsh weather. In a hair raising passage that left me shivering, the Larkins are lost when their cabin is overrun with swarms of poisonous snakes. Dogs and livestock are lost and Mooney seriously injured when a huge marauding bear attacks each enclave.The Land Breakers is a beautifully written saga of life as it was in the early years of America. Mooney and Lorry Wright, Tinkler Harrison, and Pearlamina Harrison are unforgettable characters. Such pioneers survived in a harsh country without adequate food, wearing flimsy homemade shoes - if they had shoes at all -- and homespun clothing, lacking medical care or medicine. There were no schools, no churches, no stores, no doctors, no roads. They persisted, subsisted on sheer will and labor that people today cannot comprehend. The living history written here is amazing, and the mountainous North Carolina locale is as much a character in this book as the humans. Ehle's literary style is exceptional and this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Land Breakers","review":"First released in 1964, The Land Breakers is a historical fiction that spans from 1779 to 1784 when the first settlers went beyond Morganton, North Carolina to homestead in the Appalachian Mountains.Mooney Wright was the first to break ground to start a farm and a variety of others followed. He has big dreams and isn't afraid to work towards his goals. He is a tough man but feels things deeply.Tinkler Harrison comes with his family. Tinkler has his own ideas for the settlement, all the way down to its name, Harristown. In his vision, the only settlers that will be allowed in the area have to meet his standards. There will be no riff raff or deadbeats in Harristown.Ernest Plover, Tinkler's brother-in-law, comes later with his family. He has a houseful of girls and his oldest, Belle, is Tinkler's second wife. Ernest isn't exactly the 'right' kind of man to have at the new settlement. He doesn't really fit the bill--but he's family.Many others follow despite the hardships. These people are united in one goal, to keep their homes and to build something out of this wilderness. They come close to losing everything, but they stick with it with an eye toward the future.The characters are so genuine that it's easy to become involved in their fight for survival. The Land Breakers truly depicts the reality of settling this country. Some parts are almost poetic in their description of the beauty of the land. In other chapters the wonder in the birth of twin lambs and the joy a newly cleared field brings can be felt. There is also the crushing disappointment when bears or wolves kill some of the stock and the ongoing fight to prevent that from happening.Tinkler Harrison says it best, \\"it's harder here, but I care more here. It takes more work here, it takes a man's life here, it asks all a man has to give and a man gains as well as loses by joining in with land like that.\\"Armchair Interviews says: A heart-felt story of the first settlers."},{"Title":"The Land Breakers","review":"From my perspective as a poet, I applaud an author who knows how to use good, solid declarative sentences to tell an unforgettable story. So solid, in fact, is author John Ehle's command of the language, that the words in his powerful novel, The Land Breakers, seem carved on the pages. Yet, there is a lyrical beauty in the cadence of his characters' speech, that takes me back to my own roots and ancestry. When one of Ehle's most memorable characters, Mina, declares, \\"Law, I never thought no such a thing,\\" I could picture my grandmother, Ila, and her sister, Ethel, sitting on the front porch \\"of an evening,\\" saying something very similar, if not precisely the same. It was always \\"Law\\" this and \\"Law\\" that, as if every statement needed that linguistic punch to make it authentic. And authentic is what this book is, without question. I can't imagine how any photograph could be more revealing of what life was like for settlers in the mountains of Northwestern North Carolina between the years of 1779 and 1784, than this exquisitely rendered piece of work. If I never fully appreciated the miracle of electricity, not to mention my dishwasher, the washer and dryer, the convenience of grocery stores, and the nearly impenetrable walls of my professionally-built home, believe me, I do now! So, I urge you--curl up in your favorite chair and spend an afternoon with The Land Breakers. I promise you won't be able to put it down until the very last word is chiseled into your imagination, and the characters firmly entrenched in your heart. It is a must-read for anyone who appreciates an excellent story, masterfully told."},{"Title":"The Land Breakers","review":"This is a good story, and can be read just as that. As a fiction yarn it will keep you interested and the characters are realistic.But the book is also a good depiction of what life was like in the mountains of western carolina while the revolutionary war was going on (and was pretty much ignored by those in the mountains.I have spent a lot of time in the area and sometimes I think I can even identify locations which are described in Ehle's books.While much of what Ehle wrote includes a whole series of books about the west carolina area, all the books stand independent, so don't worry about being in the middle of something.Ehle is one of the most under-appreciated writers around."},{"Title":"The Land Breakers","review":"Simply, I do believe, the finest single piece of literature set in Appalachia. Loved it years ago; re-read it just now, cherishing every perfectly-chosen word and regional idiom, the living, breathing realness of the people, the mastery of how things worked in that hard time and place, where the loss of a crop, or the death of a dog, could end the story in starvation and terror.It's a love story on the deepest level, of men and women, neighbors and kin, of an awesome, fearsome, seductive setting, and above all, of the land itself.And such characters! Prideful, spiteful, empire-building little old Tinkler Harrison, who made his first profit on 14 hogs rustled from a neighbor; his shiftless, trifling brother-in-law Ernest Plover, fiddling beside the collapsed family lean-to while his flock of oblivious, barefooted, gorgeous young daughters dance gleefully in the snow; Mooney Wright, who must ultimately wrestle a monster bear to protect the stock that stands between his adopted family and hunger; and indeed the bear itself, who -- like every other tenant of that wild country, is neither saint nor total villain.NOBODY can quite match John Ehle as a story-teller; in this, the first volume of a continuing Wright family saga, no word or image is wasted; they all lead somewhere. And caught up in them, we yearn to go along."},{"Title":"The Land Breakers","review":"A great read if you enjoy books on early American Pioneering!

In the course of these investigations Minkowski conjectured that in a lattice tiling of n-space by cubes some two cubes must share a complete face. Minkowski proved this for n=2,3. Our authors couldn't care less about his proofs however; instead we quickly move the the idea that worked for general n: Haj&oacute;s reformulation of the problem as a simple statement about factorisation of abelian groups. The rest of the book is just more of the same, but without the heart and soul of classical mathematics. So, one may study tilings not only by cubes but by clusters of cubes (chapters 2-5), or one could try to tile some polygon by some triangles (chapters 5-6). The final chapter 7 presents R&eacute;dei's theorem, which generalises the group theoretic version of Minkowski's conjecture."},{"Title":"Drugs in America: The Case for Victory : A Citizen's Call to Action","review":"If you're going to comment on Vincent Bugliosi, there is one thing you can't criticize: his passion. Although his ideas may seem unconventional at times, there is no question that he believes what he says. It's a cliche to say that, &quot;drugs are a problem that must be stopped&quot;, but it's another thing to actually do something about it. Bugliosi proposes to do just that. The legendary prosecutor suggests in this book that the so called, &quot;War on Drugs&quot; has been a joke thus far, and real measures need to be taken to rid our country of this plague. The two solutions he offers in this book are 1) we should launch a military seizure (primarily in South America)to eliminate the drug lords who traffic these deadly narcotics and 2) we should take action at our nation's banks (i.e. place IRS agents at busy branches, exchance currency). While his suggestions may seem easier said than done, I have to admit that his proposals are honestly better than the methods we're currently using to fight the war on drugs. As for the writing itself, it's fairly dry. &quot;Drugs&quot; isn't as compelling of a read as Bugliosi's &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, or even his O.J. Simpson opus &quot;Outrage.&quot; But he has the guts to comment on a social problem that everyone else seems to think will just go away, and for that he should be commended."},{"Title":"Drugs in America: The Case for Victory : A Citizen's Call to Action","review":"Although it's important to read all of Bugliosi's books for the education they provide us about the efficiencies/inefficiencies of the criminal justice system, (and who better to learn from than the valedictorian of his class), what this book does more than anything else is give our country a specific course of action in this desperate time so lacking in aggressive moral leadership. Read this, and then read Bugliosi's &quot;Phoenix solution&quot;. Then read all of his books! Outstanding!"},{"Title":"Strategic Management (The Fast-Track Mba)","review":"I NEED READ THE BOOK IT'S MY OBLIGATION"},{"Title":"The Silence of Strangers","review":"its a wonderful book. though it was confusing how a maan can love two woman at the same time. but i think the author handled the matter very convincingly.The heroine of the book is someone you only want to be in your dream. she is strong, determined and a beutiful woman both inside and outside. though the matter that the hero was responsible for her father's death after all the things he (the father) had done for him was not easy to digest.at the end the way the hero won her over was something very special."},{"Title":"Meritocracy and Economic Inequality","review":"It's very interesting how the experts here tore apart The Bell Curve with minimal effort by taking a look at the data in a sensible/ rigorous way. One author assumed that all the data was correct as given and challenged its relevance.Most importantly, one of the articles used the mathematics associated with these social experiments and asked &quot;Do these numbers really show you what you think they do?&quot; In all of my exhaustive reading about this subject, this book is the first that I have read that specifically addresses that point.While lots of people have dismissed the proponents of genetic inferiority as an explanation for the &quot;failure&quot; of blacks in the USA, the rebuttals have invariably failed to contront the reasoning of the authors, preferring to dismiss them out of hand as &quot;racist.&quot;One thing that was lacking in this book is a more detailed analysis of the disparity between ethnic groups of the same race-- and yes, they do exist, contrary to what you would believe from reading the newspapers. For this, one of two Thomas Sowell books is a good read. The first: &quot;Race and Culture.&quot; The second: &quot;Knowledge and Decisions.&quot;Unfortunately, the use of lots of technical jargon is going to put this fine piece of literature out of the reach of the vast majority of the hoi polloi."},{"Title":"An Untamed Land (Red River of the North #1)","review":"The grueling life of this Norwegian pioneer family made me so thankful for all the blessings in my modern life. They had so few material possessions, worked so hard, endured such hardships, but yet maintained their faith in God, the most important possession anyone can have. I've read all of the books of this series, but this one stands out above them all."},{"Title":"An Untamed Land (Red River of the North #1)","review":"This book was almost too real. The Christian characters were far from perfect and very believeable. It offered true insight into the hardships of settling a new land in the 1800's, much more than Little House on the Prairie, in that you could see and feel the struggle and sacrifices in their life. It was riveting and I can't wait to read the next one."},{"Title":"An Untamed Land (Red River of the North #1)","review":"&quot;An Untamed Land&quot; was VERY enjoyable. It was exactly the way it was. I am sure because of the stories I've heard from my mother and her many relatives who grew up as Norwegian North Dakota farmers. Uff-da, the characters even speak Norwegian occasionally. Anyone from this heritage will get tears in their eyes and a lot of joy."},{"Title":"An Untamed Land (Red River of the North #1)","review":"I thought this book was a great book for people interested in romance, history, immigrants/emmigrants, life on the prairie, and raising a family in the 1800's. It was terrific and I look forward to finishing the series! You should too!"},{"Title":"An Untamed Land (Red River of the North #1)","review":"In 1999 I bought this book for my Norwegian mother who later passed it on to my Asian wife. They both loved the book. I have continued to buy later books in the Snelling's Norwegian immigrant series as gifts to this day (April 2010) which now comprises sixteen books, plus four ancillary works in the same genre (the Dakotah Treasures series). I started reading An Untamed Land myself in 2008 and I am now starting on my eleventh \\"Bjorklund\\" book.Reviwers would categorize these books as Christian chick lit, so what is a man doing reading them? It started with curiosity because of the Norwegian connection, in addition to my interest in European 19th century immigration to North America. In this world of much pessimism, violence, cynicism, family disconnection, Hollywood hype and disbelief in the Divine I thought it might be worthwhile to spend some time with positive, character-building, and inspirational, family oriented literature. Lauraine Snelling knows how to write books infused with elevated human values and the emotions that accompany doubts, trials, depression and tragedies as well as joys and celebrations.I must say that I was quite disappointed by this first books lack of genealogical research and historical integrity. I can't understand how Snelling could venture into this project without getting information verified by Norwegians. Since I found myself editorializing as I was reading this spoiled some of my reading pleasure and it became a sufficient irritation for me so I began to mark the book whenever I met with these distractions. Here are some examples (apply also to the second volume, A New Day Rising):The worst errors concern personal names, first names as well as last, many of which are improvised and inauthentic. For a starter, the Bjorklund (Bjrklund, Swedish Bj&ouml;rklund) name has historically been ten times more prevalent in Sweden than in Norway. In the same vain, surnames which Snelling consistently ends in the patronymic \\"son\\" (e.g. Knutson, Johnson, Olsson, Hanson, Thorlakson, Hjelmson, Sjornson, Peterson) are thus marked by their Swedish origins. Norwegian patronyms end in \\"sen.\\" Quite a number of names in the books have quaint spellings incompatible with Norwegian lore. One might wonder why the author didn't use a Minnesota or Dakota's telephone book to choose common traditional names. The spelling of Carl, rather than Karl, is also commonly Swedish. The spelling of Kaaren, with two a's, is nonexistent in Norway; Karen is correct. Thorliff may be Icelandic but is definitely not Norwegian. The correct form would be Torleif or Thorleif. Thorly would not be his nickname but Tor/Thor or Leif. To be authentic Gunhilde should be Gunhild. Bridget was not a 19th century Norwegian name; Birgit would be. Andrew is not a name new Norwegian immigrants would name their son; Anders or Andreas would be. Haakan should be Haakon or Hakon. Hjelmer is a nonexistent name; should be Hjalmar. Hamre is nonexistent. Soren is named as the wife of Johann Bjorklund but it (Sren) has always been a man's name, never a woman's! Katja was not a 19th century Norwegian girl's name, but German or Russian; Kaja would be Norwegian. In reference to the city of Oslo it was called Christiania up until its name changed in 1925.As far as \\"norsk\\" is concerned, why did Snelling not take the time to ask a Norwegian and get it right? \\"E Jesu naven gor vi til brod,\\" should be \\"I Jesu navn gaar vi til bords.\\" \\"Takk fer matten (meaning the mat!),\\" should be \\"takk for maten (the meal).\\" \\"Hu tu me tu!\\" should be \\"hutte meg tu!\\" \\"Mor's den lille gutten,\\" is insensible; it should be \\"mors lille gutt.\\" The expression \\"uff da\\"--popularized in America--is way overused. Normally it is correctly uttered light-heartedly. It wrongly trivializes a situation when used in a serious context. \\"Mange takk,\\" is also overused. \\"Takk,\\" or \\"takk, takk,\\" or \\"takk for det,\\" or \\"takk skal du ha,\\" are other variants which could have been used in between. From the start, Ingeborg frequently refers to Thorliff as \\"den lille,\\" which means \\"that little one,\\" which lacks gender. In most cases, in his presence, it should be \\"du lille,\\" meaning \\"you, little one.\\" When Carl goes shopping in New York City, he asks for \\"egg\\" and \\"melk\\" and amazingly is NOT understood when the English of these words is pronounced similarly! In all the Bjorklund books the German and Norwegian languages are presented as conversationally easy for speakers of either language to be understood by each other. This is a complete fallacy.In this book we are told that the Bjorklund clan hails from Valdres which is a mountainous landlocked inland valley in southern Norway. But the menfolk are fishermen and refer to working on fishing boats, which can not be related to Valdres. In the second book, inexplicably, the Bjorklunds' origin shifts to Nordland in northern coastal Norway, which then does fit in with the reference to ocean fishing.Ingeborg goes bird hunting with the same rifle used for deer. The birds would have exploded! She should have used a shotgun. The native half breed who befriends them they call Metis but in subsequent books the spelling changes to Metiz. Burning deciduous trees does not produce pitch; conifers do. Deciduous trees have sap. Unlike what the author states evergreen trees were not uncommon in the Dakotas before land was cleared extensively. The Bjorklunds' first sod house is only twelve by fourteen feet, which was common, but as the story progresses it would have been impossibly small for all the people, furnishings and activities described. Incredibly it states three men could build the sod house in one day, including the roof and finish raising the walls for the barn the next day! Oh, and contrary to what is stated numerous times, ducks do not fly in a V-formation and mosquitoes do not buzz around in the late fall. And, chairs can not be \\"pushed back\\" on a dirt floor. They must be lifted. These are some of the more obvious errors.Fortunately most readers of this book will not be distracted as I was by any of the above. Now having completed my tenth book I can say that occasions to become irritated diminish greatly with each subsequent book. I give Snelling credit for keeping readers' attention from beginning to end. They can easily feel involved with the characters' personal relationships and the drama of their experiences. There are hardships and tragedies but also happiness, comfort and joy. Each book introduces more children and unique characters, having personalities we probably recognize from our own life journey. There is no lack of tension and conflict but love and co-operation usually win the day. I recommend this first book but perhaps more for its necessary groundwork, establishing the Bjorklunds in Dakota Territory, than for what it has to offer on its own."},{"Title":"An Untamed Land (Red River of the North #1)","review":"I read this book almost two years ago, but I still remember how much it captured my attention. I think what made the book so interesting is the fact that it didn't create a phony atmosphere. Everything was so real and their problems were so crushing that I think I better understood what a hard life many immigrants went through. I appretiate the spiritual side of the book too. I think it's a great witness when writers use Jesus Christ as a key player in their character's lives. I have also read the next two books in the series and am looking forward to the third. I have a lot more to say of the book, but I'll leave it at this; it's a great book for people interested in history and in love with great reading!"},{"Title":"An Untamed Land (Red River of the North #1)","review":"This book is really a tear jerker!!!!

I have just finished the sequel, 'A new day rising', and I can't wait to read 'A land to call home'. I love the way Mrs. Snelling incorporates the Lord into her books.

It's a great series to start and you will definitely want to read them all!"},{"Title":"An Untamed Land (Red River of the North #1)","review":"An Untamed Land is my fist book by Lauraine Snelling and I am impressed with how her writing engaged me. Excellent character development helped me to really come to know the main characters,and she really made me appreciate and admire the fortitude of the emigrants/immigrants that they were determined to make a successful life in this country after a horrendous ocean voyage,and suffering exploitation at every train stop on their journey from New york to the Red River Valley of North Dakota. for every item the travelers might need.After living 3yrs. in Minot,ND ('65-'68) when my air force dad was stationed there,and hating it more than any other place we ever lived,I am amazed that any human being ever chose to stay there! At least our home had central heat and we had neighbors and modern conveniences. Still we risked frostbite every time we went outdoors in the winters with 60mph winds and wind chills of 60 below zero! The wind never stops blowing there,no matter what the season.So I am anxious to read book 2,in the Red River Of The North series to see who manages to survive physically and mentally,in such a place.

I absolutely loved this book. Ms. Snelling has a knack for delivering a true page turner! I especially loved the descriptions - I felt like I was really there."},{"Title":"An Untamed Land (Red River of the North #1)","review":"AN UNTAMED LAND by Lauraine Snelling is interesting, authentic, and informative. With relatives in the Red River of the North country in North Dakota near Snelling's fictional community, I have travelled in this area many times and have listened to many stories of the old days and its emergence into the rich agricultural region it is today. It is a worthwhile experience to recall some of the travails of those who settled and developed the land at any time and especially when one is driving through the region on good highways in modern vehicles with heaters in the cold months and air-conditioning in the summer and with timely weather forecasts to help ensure our safety.Not having read much in the genre of Christian fiction, one of my first impressions from this book was the importance of religious concern by many of the characters. In time I decided that this too was probably good as it helped balance the view we have generally synthesized from the writings of secular authors. It also meshed well with those stories I have heard from oldtimers who lived during some of these formative years and shared their memories and those of their parents and grandparents. I believe that enhancing our perspective is a valuable part of life.Enjoy the book and the sequels. I did."},{"Title":"An Untamed Land (Red River of the North #1)","review":"This is one of the best series that I have ever read.

They have no end of hardship and heartache. Their journey to homestead land is filled with pain. Even after they arrive, they have absolutely no idea the misery and heartbreak they will face their first full year there. It is a wonder they survive with their sanity - or do they?This is Snelling's first book in the series Red River of the North. I am well into book two already."},{"Title":"An Untamed Land (Red River of the North #1)","review":"I am shocked by the number of positive reviews on this site. This book was boring, slow, and depressing. Whenever the author was at a loss for what to do next, she simply killed off another character. The plot line was predictable and the Christian aspects were contrived. If you want to read good historical, Christian romance, look elsewhere. You will not find it here."},{"Title":"An Untamed Land (Red River of the North #1)","review":"I, like many others, am very picky about the fiction I read. Although I will read romance, too many times authors ruin a good historically based story with clumsily written dialogue or unrealistic character development in their attempt to include romance. This story is gritty, very accurate in its detail and just a plain well-told story with a touch of romance that enhances rather than dominates the story. I haven't cried in a long time while reading a book and this one made me cry. The character development is wonderful, the narrative gripping and the reader gets a very real sense of what it must have been like to be one of the first families on the prairie as our great United States frontier was first settled. The Christian themes are well written, appropriate and appreciated. I couldn't wait to purchase the second book in the series and look forward to reading much more from this author. I have seen Lauraine Snelling for years as an author but never picked up one of her books. I'm so glad I chose this one as my first."},{"Title":"An Untamed Land (Red River of the North #1)","review":"Actually, I had previously read this book and enjoyed it very much, so much in fact that I ordered it from Amazon as a gift for someone else.

It is about learning to depend upon God no matter what you are going through.Ingeborg Bjorkland comes to America from Norway as a new bride in the 1800's. She, her husband, and her in-laws settle in the Dakotas where they are homestead farmers. Many trials and joys occur during the first few years of their new life here. The arrival of children, blizzards,illness, family conflicts and Ingeborg's tendency to be headstrong are all useful in her learning that God is in control.This book is not preachy or judgemental, but there are lessons to be learned. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"An Untamed Land (Red River of the North #1)","review":"I enjoy historical, Christian reading and found this series very enjoyable. Though some may think it slow or boring in parts, it really describes the believable life of the settlers on a daily basis. By today's standards they would seem boring, but Ms. Snellings careful descriptions of life in that setting was intriging to me and kept my interest.I like the way she grew the territory with different characters and wove their lives into existing families. No extremes such as over-done sex scenes or violence to haunt me. Just realistic life-scenerios for the era.I look forward to reading more of Ms. Snelling's work."},{"Title":"An Untamed Land (Red River of the North #1)","review":"An Untamed Land (Red River of the North #1)(Paperback)I own all (so far) of the books from this series for a couple of years now.

At this point, there are 14 more books to follow (these books start with the Grandparents in Norway and go all the way to the Grandchildren who are not even born yet in this book). The family starts out in Norway, and immigrates to New York's Castle Garden. There are very happy moments, and also horrible moments as you continue to read. As Ingeborg and Kaaren depend on the Lord God, they get through the times in their lives that forge them together. You'll learn they are much more than sisters-in-law. The times are trying and difficult at times. You will not want to put this book down, believe me. And at the end - you'll be ready to read the 2nd book in this series (of 14 right now) as well.

The story itself was wandering and unfocused although it showed how hard life was for the homesteaders. The characters were pretty much one-dimensional but Ingeborg and Kaaren were likable and I wanted to know what was going to happen next. It almost felt like the Mitford series and would be worth trying for readers who liked those stories. The limp, unbelievable ending was a serious drawback. Snelling rushed through several significant events in the epilogue and Ingeborg's change of heart did not ring true.

I call them \\"Little House on the Prairie for adults\\" but totally suitable for children, as well. Very Christian based and inspirational. Hard to believe the hardships the early immigrants went through - even though fiction, I'm sure it's not very far from the facts.

This by no means implies that i was dissapointed or that Piraro isnt a good humorist. He is. It's probably the Larson comparisons that threw my expectations way high, expectations that \\"Bizarro Number 9\\" didn't overall live up to.But comparisons aside, this is indeed a good read (some would associate a certain room of the house as appropriate for leafing through it..).Cool for a gift as well, and cool for fans of this genre of comics, recommended for those who seek intelligent humor."},{"Title":"Bizarro Number 9","review":"Piraro is a true American original.

Mandie books are probably the best books I've read, ever!Mandie, Jonathan and Celia are traveling with Mrs. Taft to Germany next, to visit Baroness Geissler whom they met in Rome. During the long carriage ride, the carriage breaks down and the driver goes off to find help. Finally, after a lot of struggle, everyone makes it to the huge castle.There are mysterious rumors that a huge juniper tree outside the castle jumps! People say they have seen it before, and Mandie is determined to crack the case. Furthermore, the baroness's grandson, Rupert, who is engaged to a woman named Elsa, is unfriendly and seems to hate Mandie and her friends. One night they spot him doing odd things with another lady. Near the end of the book, they actually see the tree jump!I know this seems impossible, but my sister read it first and says that it really jumps, and I read it and now I understand. You'll have to read the book to find out the surprising reason!I love the way Mandie always trusts in God through everything. It makes the books even better!This book was so good.

If you're reading this review, The Matrix was more than just a movie to you. Something that you saw in it made you question, if even for a moment, the nature of reality as you have always understood it. And if you're willing to entertain that tantalizing 'splinter in your mind' awhile longer, you need to read this book.All of the essays in this book are thought-provoking and well written, with authors ranging from prominent members of the science fiction community, to theologians, to computer scientists. All have been similarly affected by this truly remarkable movie, and all take you on their own personal tour of The Wachowski's mindbending dystopia.Essay content ranges from comparisons of Neo with Christ and Buddha, to whether we are in fact living inside a simulated world. The two finest essays in this book (in my opinion) are by techologists themselves, one by Ray Kurzweil and another by Sun Microsystems' Bill Joy, each with a very in-depth examination of the technology behind The matrix, albeit with two very different visions of humanity's future once our technology catches up with that depicted in the movie.If The Matrix made you question the nature of the world around you, even a little, you need to read this book. You may not like it when you discover just how far down the rabbit hole goes, but at least you might be on the right track to freeing your mind."},{"Title":"Taking the Red Pill: Science, Philosophy and the Religion in the Matrix (Smart Pop series)","review":"THE MATRIX is arguably one of the best done, most profound movies of our time, conveying concepts of depth and wisdom in a format that appeals to a broad range of fans, and entertains as well. Only a few films manage to do this, STAR WARS, CHARIOTS OF FIRE, and LORD OF THE RINGS are among the scant examples. There is so much packed into this movie that many viewers might miss what is really there, only having fun and enjoying the spectacular FX work.While that is not a bad thing, it would be a shame to miss all the depths hidden behind the fun, so the authors in this book have analyzed it on several levels. On a scientific front, the hows of THE MATRIX are examined, explaining the mind boggling concepts that when probed can be seen as frightening possibilities, even probabilities. However, the book's real impact is when it gets into the philosophy and religious aspects of the whole thing. It is shown to be parabolic to not only the Christian religion, but to Jews and Buddists as well. Allegories are explained and critiqued in depth.***** If you have never seen the movie, like me, you will be prompted automatically to go out and rent it. Much of the book, despite the helpful glossary in the back, will make little sense without having seen MATRIX. After seeing it, and reading the book, learning how plausible it might be, then you will wonder about what is real. Isn't that a question that has tormented the greatest thinkers of time? This is a book not to be missed if you have a critical, yet open mind. *****"},{"Title":"Taking the Red Pill: Science, Philosophy and the Religion in the Matrix (Smart Pop series)","review":"\\"Taking the Red Pill\\" is, as its title implies, a collection of essays that explore the scientific, philosophical, and religious content of the groundbreaking science fiction film \\"The Matrix\\". There are fourteen essays, each by a different author, and a glossary of Matrix terms as well as short bios of the contributing authors in the back of the book. The essays address a wide range of topics as they relate directly to the film: the nature of reality, the evolution of artificial intelligence, postmodern theory, Judeo-Christian symbolism, Buddhist metaphors, and the science behind the Matrix' technology. The last three essays don't discuss the film itself, but express ideas about emerging technologies which may make a Matrix-like world of human-machine interdependence a reality in our future. Editor Glenn Yeffeth has given us contributors with opposing views in many cases, so many of the essays are grouped in pairs so that we can read them in a point-counterpoint style. The very fact that \\"The Matrix\\" can be interpreted as representing both Socialist and Capitalist, Monotheist and Pantheist, Postmodernist and Crass Commercial ideals may provide the greatest insight into the film's genius and staying power. My only criticism of the book is that, among its many interesting essays, there are none that analyze the film's meaning in and of itself, as opposed to discussing its relationship to various external religious and philosophical doctrines. \\"The Matrix\\" borrows from and alludes to numerous esteemed schools of thought, but it is the film's own fascinating, complex, and thought-provoking conditions that make \\"The Matrix\\" resonate so powerfully with its audience. \\"The Matrix\\" has a philosophical identity of its own. That said, the essays that are included in this collection are thoughtful and enlightening. I recommend \\"Taking the Red Pill\\" to fans of \\"The Matrix \\" who would like to delve further into the film's iconography and implications."},{"Title":"Taking the Red Pill: Science, Philosophy and the Religion in the Matrix (Smart Pop series)","review":"There was a reason that cyberpunk's quick-paced revival resonated with audiences, something more than Neo and Trinity's sexy androgyny, the cool effects and apocalyptic story. Audiences left the theater literally blown away; people heatedly discussed \\"The Matrix\\" in the car on their way home.As I sat in the theater seat nearly four years ago, the screen flashing before me, I got the sense that I was on to something big. There's so much going on, so much packed into the film -- how can you even begin to address it, compartmentalize, etc?Taking the Red Pill picks up all the threads woven into the film and gives them a good tug. The result? A vibrant plentitude of interpretation springs to view. The book is accessible. It's funny and riveting, and filled to the brim with a diversity of approaches.

But honestly it could have been better. \\"The Matrix\\" is a striking film--in my opinion one of the best movies of the decade. To me, the most gripping thing about the movie is the implicit parallel between the unreality of the parasite-controlled Matrix and the commercially-shaped Matrix of our American culture. What the average joe experiences as reality is a false world. It's a created set of impressions that don't match reality very closely, but do serve the commercial interests that foster them. Like the movie Matrix, the parasitic \\"matrix\\" of our time exploits us. It extracts our money, time, and energy to its own ends. The essays in this book were good. But the editor seemed to sidestep any serious commercial or political issues. Maybe he was hesitant to take them on. Or maybe he just didn't get it."},{"Title":"Taking the Red Pill: Science, Philosophy and the Religion in the Matrix (Smart Pop series)","review":"Every essay in this book will shed new light on the way you view this world.

There are theories presented here that will have you talking to anyone who will listen about the almost unreal possibilities these authors present. They are the top people in their respective fields and were not chosen because they just had cool ideas. They were chosen because they know what they're talking about.

Nanotechnology (which I never heard of before reading this book) could be small engineered machines that are many times smaller than 1mm and could be inserted into the brain in the future by the billions. There they could take their place in the brain and transmit and receive information via a wireless network. This will allow us to learn about the brain and how it works in a much more detailed manner.Also, it would allow us to finally communicate with the brain directly (bypassing all the sensories...smell, touch, taste, sight, sound) We might even be able to start downloading information, skills, even create Virtual Reality like the matrix.This all lends itself to the real question...&quot;If we can get the technology to recreate 'reality' as we know it and create simulations in the future, then what's to say we aren't a simulation already? Or a simulation of a simulation? and so on.&quot;Some people might think that's implausible, but mathmaticians would disagree. All a brain is, is a very slow bio-computer that is wired in parallel to give a very powerful bio-computer that we have yet to duplicate in speed. Give it 50 years and we'll have a computer more powerful than all of the human brains put together. That said, you still need software to give it &quot;intelligence&quot; or &quot;AI&quot;.I believe that reverse engineering the brain from the replication of one brain cell, to the replication of the entire brain will be the path to AI, because it will allow the computer to teach itself. Thus &quot;learning&quot; will be limited by the speed of the computer...which could be very very very fast.I would HIGHLY recommend this book to people who are &quot;moved&quot; by the Matrix series, as it brings up even deeper thoughts with more science to back it up.Just my .02-Jimi"},{"Title":"Taking the Red Pill: Science, Philosophy and the Religion in the Matrix (Smart Pop series)","review":"I just finished reading this book, and WOW!

Never the less, it is worth a read for some of the forward looking ideas explored in it's pages.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"Taking the Red Pill: Science, Philosophy and the Religion in the Matrix (Smart Pop series)","review":"I am using &quot;one star&quot; not as a means for expressing my displeasure with the book overall, but as a tool to get your attention -- For I write this not so much as a review as a warning.I have only read the first 62 pages of this (240+glossary+index page) book and look forward to reading the rest of it... just not right now. The problem is that the essays in the book talk about more, much more, than just &quot;The Matrix&quot; the movie. For example, in the forth (not counting the introduction) essay, &quot;Artificial Intelligence, Science Fiction, and the Matrix&quot;, the essayist (Robert J. Sawyer) mentions 22 other works -- including three motion pictures and a television series. That the essay mentions &quot;The Matrix&quot; almost only tangentially is not what irks me. (If that were the only problem I could over look it as just a less than stellar essay and move on to the next essay in the book.) The problem is the spoilers. Among the spoilers (major, ruin-the-whole-surprise spoilers) are Stanley Kubrick's &quot;2001: A Space Odessey&quot;, Jack Williamson's &quot;With Folded Hands&quot;, Issac Asimov's &quot;Robot Dreams&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;. To old hands, this may be a non-sequitur, but to others, like myself, who have not read or viewed all of those works, the damage of reading the spoilers was many times greater than the enjoyment received from the essay.Having read these spoilers upset me, but I decided that it was most likely just that particular essay and that I would read on. Unfortunately I began the next (fifth) essay by James Gunn &quot;The Reality Paradox in The Matrix&quot; and read the first four of that essay's ten pages and got more of the same. In fact, the first paragraph of that essay consists entirely of a spoiler (Stanislaw Lem's &quot; The Futurologic Congress&quot;). On the third page Robert A. Heinlein's &quot;All You Zombies&quot; is spoiled, only to be followed on the next paragraph that completely and utterly spoils Heinlein's &quot;They&quot;. I know this to be true because the essayist begins the spoiling sentence with the words, &quot;In a final passage, the reader learns that the patient is...&quot;. James Gunn in that paragraph has just told me in his own words that he has denied me the experience of enjoying what he himself claims to be an landmark work by Heinlein! Two paragraphs later he does it again. This time he begin the spoiler, &quot;By the end of the novel...&quot;At that point I slammed the book shut in disgust. It was like buying a dozen Sherlock Holmes mystery novels and reading the last chapter to each of them in the car on the way home from the book store.Now, I feel compelled to say that the first essay was e-x-c-e-l-l-e-n-t. The editor, Glenn Yeffeth, even introduces the essay with, &quot;If you only have time for one essay on The Matrix, this is the one to read.&quot; Of the four and a half essays from the book I have read, this one is by far the best. It is 100% about The Matrix and packed full of insights. The second essay is also great and proposes a very interesting (and I think new and refreshing) way to view and analyze the movie. The third essay is a good survey of the various philosophical texts and thinkers who have been around many years before The Matrix who deal with the issue of reality and perception. The fourth essay (outside of the spoilers) was not so much about The Matrix as a laundry list of other works that have touched on similarly memes and didn't provide (at least for me) any insights in to the movie by itself.So I have read five and a half of the books twelve essays (I read Bill Joy's essay previously) and am pleased overall to this point outside of the spoilers. At this point I would give the book three out of five stars. I will not be reading any further in this book until either 1) I can get confirmation that there are no further spoilers or 2) I find out what additional spoilers there are and read or view those works prior to their mention in this book."},{"Title":"Taking the Red Pill: Science, Philosophy and the Religion in the Matrix (Smart Pop series)","review":"Enjoy the science and philosophy of the first Matrix movie with such greats as Robert J.

Basically I give this a three because it does not go into great depth. If you have thought about the Matrix while watching you more than likely have an opinion and thoughts on the subjects they write about, for example - Was Cypher right in wanting to be plugged back in? The good part of this book though is that it is a great introduction to some philosophical concepts if one hasn't taken an intro to philosophy course. It does give the background on where the ideas for this movie came from. If you really like this one or don't like it for that matter read The Matrix and Philosophy. This is a good read that goes into a little more depth than this book seems to do.

It really shows you just &quot;how deep the rabbit hole goes.&quot;"},{"Title":"Taking the Red Pill: Science, Philosophy and the Religion in the Matrix (Smart Pop series)","review":"There are good essays, and there are bad essays.The book also lacks focus. It seems to be just a bunch of essays that are by people who are famous and who slightly modified another essay that they had already written in order to make them apply to The Matrix as well. Only three or so of the essays directly applied, and one of them didn't mention the movie at all (although that essay was noted as having been written before the movie and was included as a prophetic statement). Of these essays, one focused entirely on whether the technology in The Matrix was possible, which wasn't entirely interesting to me.Other essays, notably the religious ones, were quite amusing, as religion was never really intended to be a main theme of the movie, although philosophy was. The author (can't remember his name off hand, but I am sure you can look at the table of contents) who said that The Matrix was a Christian movie was quite entertaining, although a bit...inaccurate. He compared Neo to Jesus (of course) and cited Biblical scripture about the Messiah coming and being a military and spiritual leader, which is funny, since that isn't what Jesus did at all.The author comparing it to Buddhism seemed similarly deluded, since The Matrix is an anthem of personal choice and individuality, which is not at all what Buddhism is all about. Granted, there are overtones of both in the movie, but they are both wrong that the movie instills their religious viewpoints. It is, however, interesting to note that such widely disparate religions could both think that the movie referred to their religion. Perhaps they are not as far apart as they think? Perhaps they simply fell into the trap of confirmation bias.Either way, it is a fairly fun read, but not because it will give you any terribly new thoughts on the movie...rather, it will allow you to see why the movie was so popular. It meant many things to many people, and the creators did a great job of manufacturing a movie that allowed people to suspend disbelief, even if for only a moment.The book is all right, but I would rent it from a library instead of purchasing it again. I will likely only read it once.You may find it to be better. Good luck.Harkius"},{"Title":"Taking the Red Pill: Science, Philosophy and the Religion in the Matrix (Smart Pop series)","review":"I found this book interesting at certain points...and terribly tedious at others. I am definitely not a science person, so some of the hard-core technology and scientific language went over my head a bit. However, it is easy to pick and choose with this book, as it is divided into essays and you can either read all the way through (as I chose to do) or read one, wait a week, read another, etc.The essay I found most interesting in the book was \\"Finding God in the Matrix.\\" As I was raised in a Christian family, I found many parallels in my own mind with the story of Jesus Christ and Neo, but this guy definitely did his research. I was a little disappointed by the misquotes and flawed citations to the Bible that I found, but it was nothing significant enough to make the entire essay moot.This is definitely not leisure reading, so I wouldn't recommend that you take it along to the beach. If you're not a scientific person, I wouldn't recommend that you read all the science essays, either, but that's the great thing about this book--it allows you to pick and choose what you want to read without having to drag yourself through a lot of crap to get to the good stuff.

It is comprehensive in its coverage of Steiner's ideas and work, and for a person approaching the ideas of anthroposophy for the first time, it is the perfect introduction to the man behind it all. I found the book to be much clearer on Steiner than Steiner's own writings. I was nineteen when I read the book so I will recommend that especially young people interested in Steiner get this book. When I finished reading it I was in awe of how much Rudolf Steiner accomplished in his life and the sheer number of fields of knowledge (philosophy, science, medicine, education, art, agriculture, religion) he contributed to. The book is very well written and inspired me to look more deeply into Steiner's philosophy and his work."},{"Title":"Writers for Relief, Vol. 1: An Anthology to Benefit the Survivors of Katrina","review":"What a wonderful idea!

The different Indians that are represented here span the American continent from sea to sea and North to South.I understand that there is also a video that has been made to be a companion product to this booklet but I have not seen it yet."},{"Title":"Blossoms of the Dharma: Living as a Buddhist Nun","review":"These essays shine with intelligence and compassion. They also fill in so many little details about nuns' lives, dreams, obstacles and the work ahead. I was stunned by the book's vivid descriptions and its practical approach to everyday problems. Buddhist nuns are regular people, of course, but have focused their energy on the monastic discipline which supports a solid spiritual way of life. The essays break these things down, giving them a human face, a view of spiritual matters in perspective. Most of all, the book imparts a precious gift - an opportunity to imagine what it would be like. We can all rejoice."},{"Title":"Blossoms of the Dharma: Living as a Buddhist Nun","review":"This book was the fruit of a conference of female ordained Buddhist monastics. Like all essay collections, this is a mixed bag, but contains at least three or four very interesting chapters. The book is organized into two main sections. The first is a series of essays by Buddhist nuns from different monastic traditions--Zen, Theravadin, Tibetan Kagyu, etc. They describe the routine in their monasteries, the rhythm of collective life. This section begins with an excellent article by Professor Chatsumarn Kabilsingh of Bangkok on &quot;The History of the Bhikkhuni Sangha.&quot; She raises some interesting points concerning the historical Buddha's efforts to improve the status of the nuns (bikshunis) in relation to the monks (bikshus). The second section consists of brief dharma teachings by some of the nuns. Most notable is an essay by Khandro Rinpoche, a female Tibetan tulku and daughter of the head of the Mindrolling lineage. Another very good essay is about &quot;How to Rely On A Spiritual Teacher&quot; by Bhikshuni Jampa Chokyi, from Spain."},{"Title":"Blossoms of the Dharma: Living as a Buddhist Nun","review":"This insightful book has 14 chapters based on \\"Life as a Buddhist Nun,\\" a 3 week educational program for nuns @ Bodhgaya, India, Feb. 1996. The authors are from numerous countries, mostly European. Major sections include: history & monastic discipline, living as a Buddhist nun, nun's teachings, and a poignant appendix: p. 187: Bhikshuni Tenzin Palmo (England) \\"The Situation of Western Monastics,\\" which made the Dalai Lama weep and an interview with the him in which he stated, pp. 192-3: \\"I think the rights of women practitioners in the Tibetan Buddhist community have been neglected.\\"There are many references to cultural differences between East and West and the need to adapt:p. ix: Dalai Lama: \\"Wherever Buddhism has taken root in a new land, there has always been a certain variation in the style in which it is observed.p. xxxiv: editor Bhikshuni Thubten Chodron (USA): \\"Western monastics must determine how to keep some of the precepts according to the society and situation in which they find themselves. When Buddhism spread from India to Tibet, China, and other countries, the way of keeping the precepts was also adjusted to fit the mentality of the society as well as the geography, climate, economics, and so on of the country. This process is only beginning in the West now.\\"pp. 7-8: Bhikshuni Lekshe Tsomo (Hawaii), \\"Buddhist Monasticism & its Western Adaptation\\"--\\"Differences in social conditions now and at the time of the Buddha require thoughtful adaptation of the precepts in the present day.\\"p. 19-21: Dr. Chatsumarn Kabilsingh (Thailand) \\"The History of the Bhikkhuni Sangha\\"--\\"The Buddha always made exceptions after the general rule was established...Questioning the authority of certain passages in the Buddhist scriptures is a delicate issue, and we have to be very careful. How can we prove that everything was passed down exactly as the Buddha spoke it? On the other hand, isn't there a danger in saying that certain passages are later interpolations? I become suspicious only when a passage does not correspond with the spirit of the main core of the Buddha's teachings.\\"p. 31: Kabilsingh: \\"Certain ancient Indian social values were taken into Buddhism, because the Buddhist community was not separate from the general Indian society at the time.\\"p. 117: Chi-Kwang Sunim (Australia), \\"A Strong Tradition Adapting to Change: The Nuns in Korea\\"--\\"\\"Westernization and technology are not the problem; what we do with them is.\\"pp. 141-2: Thubten Chodron \\"Finding Your Way\\"--\\"What is the essence of the Buddha's teachings that we must practice, bring back to our Western countries, and teach others? What is cultural form that we need not bring to the West? ...I had to confront the fact that copying a cultural form and others' external behavior was not necessarily practicing the Dharma...Because most of us Western monastics are operating cross-culturally, we would benefit from adapting the positive aspects and values of all culture we contact, while leaving behind whatever prejudice and preconceptions we may encounter.\\"pp. 167-8: Bhikshuni Wendy Finster (Australia) \\"We should be careful to distinguish between the Buddhadharma & the cultural context within which it has developed & be sure that we grasp the essence of the Dharma without getting caught up in the paraphernalia appropriate to its Asian cultural context. We must make an effort through our own individual practice to separate the grain from the chaff.\\"Of particular note: Bhikshuni Ngawang Chodron's (England) cogent arguments for full (Bhikshuni) ordination for nuns: p. 91: Under King Langdarma most Tibetan \\"monks were killed or forcefully disrobed, but 3 who survived fled to Kham, Eastern Tibet. There they met 2 Chinese monks who completed the required quorum of five monks to give ordination. If Tibetan monks could enlist the aid of Chinese monks, I feel that nuns in the Tibetan tradition should be able to enlist the help of Chinese monks & nuns who now give the Bhikshuni ordination...A central land is defined in the scriptures as a place which has the 4 classes of Buddhist disciples: bhikshus, bhikshunis, & lay practitioners of both sexes. If a place has no bhikshunis, it is not a central land...Why should a 70 year old nun still be a novice?\\"Further, there were some very interesting psychological observations and comments:p. 144: Thubten Chodron: \\"Feelings of low self-esteem and inadequacy are prevalent in Westerners...Tibetans do not have words in their language for low self-esteem or guilt, so Westerners' problems with these feelings are not readily comprehensible to them. His Holiness had difficulty understanding how someone could not like himself. He looked around this room of educated, successful people and asked, \`Who feels low self-esteem?' Everyone looked at each other and replied, \`We all do.' His Holiness was shocked.\\"p. 158: Finster (a clinical psychologist and nun): \\"Only enlightened persons are totally mentally healthy.\\" Her powerful & provocative chapter speaks to sangha dangers, responsibilities, & cultural differences.p. 166: [not meeting one's expectations] \\"causes us to judge ourselves harshly and feel guilty, and as a result our self-esteem plummets. This surprises our Asian teachers; they do not realize the level of self-criticism and self-hatred that can arise in individuals raised in our culture.\\"p. 169: \\"If we find that we are not happier in our daily life, then we are not practicing the Dharma correctly.\\" She also contrasts \\"spiritual materialism\\" vs. \\"kitchen sink reality.\\"But, perhaps the heart of the book lies in the descriptions of modern monastic life as actually experienced today, such as \\"Life in Gampo Abbey\\" by Bhikshuni Tsultrim Palmo, including rituals and daily routines. After all, the main point of a nun's life is to practice the Dharma. As the editor points out, p. xxxiii: \\"If we were able to keep the precepts perfectly, we would not need to take them.\\" This is a fine book."},{"Title":"Modern Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces with Mathematica, Second Edition","review":"The visualization of complicated geometrical objectsis now routine thanks to the excellent software thathas been developed over the past two decades. Nowstudents and professionals can have a betterappreciation of the geometrical properties of theseobjects thanks to these software packages. In thisbook the author has done a great job of doing this,having chosen one of the best tools for this purpose:Mathematica. The book is a hefty one, totaling almost1100 pages, but its perusal is worth the effort forthose who want a more intuitive appreciation behindthe concepts of differential geometry. Physicists inparticular, who usually need a pictorial approach tocomplement the learning of a subject, should reallyenjoy this book. It could definitely be used as atextbook in a beginning course in differentialgeometry since there are problems at the end of eachchapter and most of the results in the book are provenwith the required mathematical rigor, I.e. this bookis not just code and pictures, and a substantialportion of it is devoted to definitions and rigorousproofs. This is especially true for the discussion ondifferentiable manifolds and Riemannian geometry. Theauthor also includes a brief biography of themathematicians who have been involved in differentialgeometry at various places in the book. TheMathematica code in the book though can be revised tomake it look more like standard mathematical notation,thanks to the new features of Mathematica that haveappeared since this book was published (1997). The useof color shading is not done in the book, except for ashort insert with pictures of several surfaces, butthe reader can easily experiment with the colorfunctions available in Mathematica if needed. A verylengthy appendix that lists the functions and codeused in the book is included.Some of the concepts that are usuallydifficult to grasp intuitively for those approachingdifferential geometry for the first time but are hereillustrated nicely include: 1. The computation of thecurvature of plane curves and the plotting of thiscurvature. The curvature of the famous Lissajouscurves, very familiar from oscilloscope traces, iscomputed. The author might have spent a little moretime explaining why the curvature plots have the shapethey do however. 2. The treatment of osculating curvesto plane curves. 3. The finding of curves whosecurvature is equal to the arc length times a Besselfunction. The resulting plots are very entertaining.4. The computation of the torsion of a curve in space.The discussion on torus knots is particularly well-done. 5. The author's discussion on surfaces inEuclidean space motivates well the concept of adifferentiable manifold. He plots a few surfaces withcoordinate patches that have a singularity, and showshow to plot surfaces that defined nonparametrically.Kummer's surface, of particular importance inalgebraic geometry, is plotted here. Even more usefulis the author's treatment of nonorientable surfaces,wherein he shows the reader how to plot the Moebiusstrip, the Klein bottle, and two realizations of theprojective plane using Mathematica. Several examplesof the Gaussian curvature of surfaces are plotted. TheGauss map, one of the most important tools for thephysicist, is given detailed treatment. 6. Rare intextbooks at this level of differential geometry is adiscussion of minimal surfaces, but the author gives avery nice treatment in this book. The Enneper's,Scherk's Henneberg's and Catalan's minimal surfacesare plotted along with the Gauss map of Enneper'ssurface. Minimal surfaces are extremely important intheoretical physics, such as superstring and membranetheories, and are also very important in optimizationtheory, so it was nice to see a discussion of themincluded in the book. In recent years galleries ofminimal surfaces have appeared on the Web, and thisbook allows one to plot these without too much effort.The author even introduces the use of complex analysisin the study of minimal surfaces. Readers interestedin understanding the mathematics of string theory willappreciate this discussion. In addition, theWeierstrass representation, which allows generation ofnew minimal surfaces, is introduced. Readers familiarwith the Weierstrass function for elliptic curves willsee it used here for this generation."},{"Title":"Modern Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces with Mathematica, Second Edition","review":"Using this book might help you learn Mathematica, but if your goal is to learn differential geometry, please try something else. The Mathematica learner can benefit from the numerous useful examples and exercises in the book. In most programming books, the examples provided are trivial and usually do nothing useful, and this can make reading the book extremely boring. By using &quot;Modern Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces with Mathematica&quot;as a companion to a standard book on Mathematica, you can find a way out of this boredom. But the book essentially lacks the qualities of a text on pure mathematics. In some cases it lacks mathematical rigor, and even sometimes the definitions and their usage are inconsistent (see pages 159-161 for instance.) The proofs are also usually nothing but simple manipulations of formulae, the type that we have encountered mostly in high school. And when complicated mathematical reasoning becomes necessary, the author simply tries to avoid it. To summarize, if I were to pick a title for this book, I would chose &quot;Fun with Mathematica through Differential Geometry.&quot;"},{"Title":"Modern Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces with Mathematica, Second Edition","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone that needs an intuitive introduction to the subject that is complete in many ways and that provides visualization and examples using mathematica when needed. Before purchasing this I was expecting the treatment to be 'informal' and using mathematica rather than mathematical rigour to introduce concepts and results. This is not the case however.

Also, this book makes greater use of elementary linear algebra than is common in some more standard texts, for example in defining the second fundamental form in terms of the Shape Operator.

This book makes a great effort to realize this lofty goal with some success as a reference book. As a main textbook, however, it fails to deliver what it promised by overlooking one small point: the lack of CD-Rom. The readers are expected to type in the sample programs manually. This can be very time-consuming especially for inexperienced students. Inevitably, a lot of valuable class time has be consumed helping students looking for and correcting errors, many of which are small typographic errors completely unrelated to either their mathematical understanding or their computer skill.Instructors can attempt writing their own Mathematica class-notes, but copyright issue will come up if they don't be careful distributing the notebook files to the students. All such hassle can easily be eliminated with the CD-Rom(s). Hopefully this issue is resolved when the next edition is printed. Until then, I cannot recommend this book as a main textbook."},{"Title":"Free Advice","review":"I come back to this book again and again. I've owned it for several years.

And when taken together, this collection of stories almost transcends Malamud's normal limits: the stories are compressed, short, and below the surface, charged with almost unbearable tension. Unlike other collections of stories (or when you read too many Malamud stories) Malamud does not parody himself in the Magic Barrell. Everything is where it is supposed to be, and works like a well oiled machine. It is a shame that (as of writing this) only eight people have reviewed this masterpiece of a short story collection. In Roth's The Ghost Writer, Zuckerman explains that the world's morality has already passed by the E.I. Lonoff's (a character based on Malamud). Seems Roth was correct... and this is true even more today, thirty years after the publication of The Ghost Writer. We no longer live in Malamud's world, and it is a shame."},{"Title":"The magic barrel","review":"These stories are pervaded with a certain sadness and disappointment, a sense of life as largely a trial in suffering. They are also however deep in a kind of quiet beauty, a unique language of slightly Yiddishized American colloquial restraint. The title story, and the most famous one tells of the hopes and disappointments of poor Jews seeking to find their ' bashert' their destined mate. It touches upon the world of tormented souls selling illusions to themselves and others. It really moves us with the sense of how the dreams of life turn bitterness into greater bitterness, with longing disappointment beauty. These stories are for those who are willing to read and take inspiration from the sadnesses of life, that nonetheless enrich our human meaning."},{"Title":"The magic barrel","review":"These stories about New York, even when read fifty years later by someone like me from a totally different demographic, in Los Angeles, are still relevant. There are universal self-loathing themes for all immigrants, at all times.

These are real short stories, not failed novellas."},{"Title":"The magic barrel","review":"I wasn't sure about this book but decided to give it a shot and I am so happy I did.

He writes very well indeed. These 13 stories, mainly about first-generation Jewish immigrants in America, but also about visitors to Italy from America, capture so much of life in a society where one is an outsider---that feeling of \\"being here but not here\\", or of living in a country, but not belonging. The wasted ex-coffee salesman, the harassed landlord, the loner rabbinical student, they all seem to pulsate with failure, with uncertainty, and fatal mistakes. Ah, this is a book about life all right, but it's a book in which the vision is almost tunnel vision. Every single story, without exception, deals with people who cannot rise to their own imaginations of themselves. They meet frustration, failure, death or disappointment, they are deflected from any purpose they might have once had. They are melancholy shades of fruitless endeavor. Does even one reach his ambition ? (They are all male.) No, the student doesn't find a house in Rome, the would-be art critic abandons his research, the would-be lover lies about his Jewish origins and loses the beautiful girl, the buyer on credit never pays back, the so-called reader never reads, the shoemaker allows his daughter to marry an unsuitable man. Only once, after humiliating an angel to tears, does an old man admit his mistake and save his wife from death, and this occurs in the only fantasy among the thirteen. Most of the characters lose, their labors come to naught, they grow wiser, but sadder. I would assume that Malamud himself felt an outsider everywhere, comfortable nowhere. If that is not true, his dreams must have been filled with worry, because this is a most melancholy collection. Does anyone smile ? Does anyone laugh ? Does anyone dash down the street radiant with love ? No. Life is full of personal shortcomings, a bald spot, a stubborn rejection of family, an inability to swim or make money. Frustration and lies run rampant--people certainly do shoot themselves in the foot again and again. Life is a tragedy, life always ends in disappointment-these are truths told in half the literature of the world, but there is more to our humble existence than that. Even when Malamud writes a humorous story, it is filled with underlying doubt in human nature, concentrating on the tendency of people to try to be what they are not. If you want thirteen superb stories to illustrate that sad point of view, here they are. If you think life is more of a mixed bag, then perhaps this book will only depress you."},{"Title":"The magic barrel","review":"'The Magic Barrel' by Malamud contains several (mostly) entertaining short stories involving Jewish (/Yiddish) characters from the 1950s.

Recommended."},{"Title":"The magic barrel","review":"This is a very strange book. There are a lot of small messages that Mr. Malamud delivers in each of his stories. Everything from the mistreatment of others to stealing. He covers many different aspects of life that can help make people better citizens of the world.I did not enjoy his style of writing though. It was dull, and very dry. There was no excitment in any of his stories and I found it hard to keep myself reading. I can see how somebody else might enjoy it though... if you're the type that likes dull, dry stories, Malamud is the guy for you."},{"Title":"The magic barrel","review":"&quot;The Magic Barrel&quot; was a collection of stories that intrigued me, if only for the whimsical sounding name. I was disappointed, however, to find that the stories themselves were themselves not whimsical in the least. Malamud has created a world where paranoia is abundant, and worse, where poor, lackadaisical decisions are abound equally. There are no winners in any of Malamuds stories. I found myself becoming angry at the characters, for the way in which they responded to conflicts was alarmingly pathetic. His character development is strong, however, and I did enjoy maybe one or two of the stories until I found the ending rather dreary. If a literary work is &quot;sad,&quot; that is not a deterrant for me. Malamud's characters, on the other hand, are hopeless. I can't seem to enjoy reading about people who operate in such ways."},{"Title":"The magic barrel","review":"I was looking for a hard to find book in large print.

Clear and as simple descriptions of the techniques and how to interpret results as it's possible to be with this field, plus fantastic contextual info on what the strengths and weaknesses of various methods and what is appropriate where. Got me through my PhD a decade ago and was just as helpful for a MSc student working on plant/pollinator networks this year. A little out of date now and slightly weak on the new kid on the block - Multidimensional Scaling - but still the best place to start."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"A poignant story of adventure, love, and compassion laced with humorous similes and metaphors. An easy read, but more important, an enjoyable read. It ended much too soon.This is the finest gay novel that I have ever read. I believe heterosexuals would enjoy it as well."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"Well, here is something different: A gay romance-thriller set on the American frontier in 1796. Sex, bad guys, more sex, Indians, more sex...a real page-turner, and nicely told, too. I can't wait to see what author Michael Jensen offers us next."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"I was supposed to be reading my student's essays. I was supposed to be working on a works cited page for a research report. I was supposed to work on transcribing an interview for the website I write for. But I made the wonderful mistake of opening my just arrived copy of Frontiers when I came home this evening and the rest is history. The plot is pretty standard faire -- a crime thriller, but set in 1797. The plot is well executed and Jensen is quite skilled at planting sublte hints and slowly reeling out the elements. What really makes this an excellent novel worth a re-read is Jensen's exquisite eye for detail, his vivid similies, and his quirky cast of characters, all of whom in one way or another live on the &quot;frontiers&quot; (ie. margins) of society. Though this is a novel with an emphasis on action, I particularly enjoyed Jensen's unobtrusive exploration of the themes of lonelyness and alienation. Each chapter begins with an often bittersweet recolection from the narrator's childhood and subtly shows that even as a child he has always been an other, looking for a place to belong. This book also has its roots in one of America's most beloved bits of folklore, and that's what I found really daring and subversive about this novel -- its not just that the narrator is a gay man, but that homosexuality is inextricably linked to something as wholesome,natural, and all-American as apple pie. (And you thought Tinky-Winky gave Jerry Falwell fits!) A fine novel. I hope Jensen has another one baking in the word processor."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"Michael Jensen is gifted with the ability to paint vivid pictures with mere words. &quot;Frontiers&quot; captured me from the very beginning and didn't let go. I felt myself being swept back to another time and not eager to return. Thank you Michael for the experience!"},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"I admit it, I'm an easy sell when it comes to gay romance, particularly if there's a little hot sex thrown in. So when I found &quot;Frontiers&quot; I was thrilled to see something new, something that wasn't contemporary, Science Fiction or Fantasy. Alas, the book did not live up to my hopes. It's NOT about the wild west, as one review on this site implies, it's about the colonial era. No studly, stony-eyed cowboys, guns a-blazin'. Still, the era is not without a good deal of interest, so that's not really a drawback.The central character, John Chapman, has had the requisite Traumatic Childhood with the Abusive Macho Father, and as a result has a Bad Self-Image. Yes, really, it's that obvious. I felt as if I was being hit over the head with what a miserable life he's had. John is not the brightest bulb in the lamp and he's a whiner, so that by page 100 I wanted to start abusing him, too. On the run from a disastrous affair with a British officer, he travels on foot into the interior of an unsettled country with some vague notion of getting a piece of land and settling it. Except he has no money, no possessions, no supplies and no clear idea of what it means to be a pioneer other than showing up in the right place at the right time to get some free land. He encounters a mysterious, drunken, paranoid Irishman who is so weirdly written that it's impossible to get a fix on him. (Possibly this is part of the Plot Twist, but it's about as subtle as a sledgehammer.) John is terrified of him, but at the same time physically obsessed. When they finally do have sex, it's so unengaging (and not terribly believable, in my opinion) that you have to wonder why they even bothered.Animals play a great part in this book, and that's not really a surprise since they were heavily relied upon by settlers for work, food and income. John is the odd man out here in that he has a distinctly modern attitude towards the subject. It gives him pain to watch an animal suffer. Okay, I can buy this since it is established upfront that he is not typical in this respect. Over and over, this fact is drummed into the reader. John is Sensitive. This is, or should be a plus to any contemporary reader who probably shares his feelings to some degree. Alas, his presence seems almost like the kiss of death to any animal within ten miles, and the carnage eventually becomes so gratuitous that it's likely to put off the very people who had been on John's side all along. Add to that, the impression that it's a good thing that he's learning to be a hard man, a less sensitive one,(a &quot;real&quot; man like his father, like Daniel?) and we get a very mixed message about John and his sensibilities.Jensen has clearly done a good deal of research into the period, which is admirable. But when he peppers his narrative with contemporary phrases such as &quot;pissed off&quot; you have to wonder why he bothered. It's that jarring. Even if he didn't think about this aspect of his narrative, why didn't his editor catch it? His anachronisms make the narrative sloppy, and detract from the weight of the considerable effort he put into his research.I don't know why it got such good editorial reviews. Can the field of gay-positive literature still be so thin, that this counts as some sort of classic? Personally, I don't think an author needs to rely on overkill when it comes to proving that being gay has always been harder than being straight in any given society. You don't have to provide profound trauma and bizarre plot devices. Life, particularly life on the frontier of an unsettled country, will bruise your characters quite enough as it is, and sort the weak from the strong pretty handily. John Chapman, defined by both sexuality and misery (and a healthy tot of stupidity) is not my idea of any sort of gay icon.I give points for the research and good intentions. And for that nice cover. Other than that, not recommended. Sorry."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"Well what can I say! I loved this book from the very first chapter! I am a romantic so this book swept me away. I could not put it down and at one point started reading it from the early evening to 7am the next morning. This book painted such a clear picture for me of the wild west that I could really see in my mind exactly what the land and the people looked liked. I want more and I e-mailed Michael Jensen and told him so. When the end of the book came I cried, I really cried not only for what John and Palmer went through but for the fact that my fantasy was over. I am giving a copy of this book to my best friend in Florida. Michael can't wait for the paper back version with the new cover on it!"},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"I've been scratching my head wondering what I might say that would help the prospective buyer make a decision about this book.There is an interesting peek into what times were like for a young, gay, single settler staking a land claim during the westward expansion. What was difficult to grasp in this period piece was this young man coming in contact with three other gay men in the short time period the book covers. That was too much irony even for fiction.This book ends, in my opinion, near the point where it should have begun. There is no doubt there is a good story for a potential sequel.Thank you."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"I enjoyed it very much, although at times I thought the verbage, internal and otherwise, a bit too contemporary. I was encouraged to read the book by a recommendation on a film star fan site, so naturally I read it with casting in mind. My recommendation: as John, British actor Rupert Graves (but definitely NOT Hugh Grant); as Gwennie, Anglo-Indian actress Rita Wolf; as Palmer, Heath Ledger; and as Daniel/Zach, Rufus Sewell."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"I could not put the book down. I was very well written and easy to follow. It has a surprise ending and several twists that made me keep reading. I highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"What a glorious find this book is! Although this novel is &quot;light,&quot; it is not without its virtues nor is it without serious thought, humanism, and a great deal of historical fact. If you like humor, it's here. If you like action, it's here. If you like historical figures brought to life, it's here. Jensen, a true artist, can write passages so poetic that the imagery transports your imagination into the Colonial American wilderness and holds you there. It may seem odd, but reading &quot;Frontiers&quot; gave me much the same reaction as the first time I saw the original &quot;Star Wars.&quot; Good luck, Michael Jensen, may the &quot;force be with you&quot; to produce many more novels ahead."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"Frontiers, by Michael Jensen, is an historical novel filled with adventure, suspense, steamy sex, beautifully described scenery, note-worthy characters to both love and hate...all woven together to tell a rich and interesting story. A riveting tale, Frontiers is told in the first person through the eyes of John Chapman, a young man with a strong sense of moral values, an endearing love of animals, and, despite all the hardships he has endured, compassion for his fellow man.Using colorful language, Jensen paints a realistic picture of how difficult life was in the late 1700's for a sensitive young gay man, who has had so much grief and tumult in his life, that he wants nothing more than to settle down. Barely escaping death, Chapman runs for his life. He escapes the men who killed his lover; there was zero tolerance for \\"sodomites\\" in 1797. In his haste to avoid being killed or flogged, Chapman escapes without money, supplies, or a horse. Starving, and near frozen to death, he is rescued by Daniel McQuay, who offers him food and shelter, but not necessarily out of the goodness of his heart. Chapman manages to survive the long, cold winter, sharing a cabin with McQuay, but he senses something is not kosher with this moody, alcoholic man. As soon as he's able to escape, Chapman is on the run again.History repeats itself. He is rescued from starvation and death, this time by a kind Indian woman, Gwennie. She deposits him in a new settlement, Franklin. Being welcomed into this new settlement represents a brand new beginning for Chapman.Frontiers takes place at a time when settlers were stealing land, left and right, from Native Americans. John feels compassion for the \\"Indians,\\" and feels the other settlers wouldn't be any happier knowing he preferred men, sexually, than they would if they knew he had an Indian friend. He is indebted to Gwennie for saving him and giving him a real chance at happiness, and hopefully, permanence in his lifeJensen uses flashbacks of John's youth to recall events in his life. I thought this was an excellent touch. It allows the reader to understand John, and helps define his personality. We see why John becomes a wanderer-running away from problems instead of facing them head-on. John is tired of running; he just wants to settle down, be left alone and live his life as he sees fit. He is perfectly willing to give up personal relationships with men in order to avoid further trouble in his life.Then he meets Palmer, a young man who shows interest in something more than simple friendship. John cannot deny a strong attraction to Palmer, and once again attempts to escape from his natural instincts. Can he avoid temptation or will he give in to love and desire? You simply must read this book.What I liked best about Frontiers, was how it grabbed me, enticing me to keep reading...I could not put the book down. The sexual tension in the beginning, between John and Daniel, was only appeased by reading further into the story. Jensen relieved the pressure so eloquently and completely, that the first love scene was not just memorable, it was HOT! I was pleasantly surprised when there were more erotic scenes further along in the story. Frontiers had me on the edge of my seat on more than one occasion and I couldn't read quickly enough to get to the outcome.My only criticism, but I take it back now that I've finished the book, is that the first half of the book was peppered with so many metaphors and similes, that I actually started counting them. They're distracting, but by the second half of the book, I forgot all about them. Not that the similes weren't good; it made me wonder if that was the way people spoke in the 1700's, or if Jensen got carried away. (The author has since told me that more colorful language was used at the time the novel is set in.) Don't get me wrong about the first half, despite my mentioning the similes; Frontiers is incredible and exciting, with elements of fear, longing, hardship, and danger. The whole book is great, and if you like suspense and romance set in historic times, I cannot recommend enough that you should not miss this gem of a novel. I could easily see Frontiers as a new generation major motion picture, in the Gay/Western genre. Move over John Wayne-here comes John Chapman, Palmer, Gwennie and their story of how the west was won."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"This book has it all: action, adventure, romance, and hot sex! I think Daniel McQuay is one of the most interesting characters I've ever read, and Gwennie is almost as fascinating. My only quibble is a plot twist at the end involving an identifying characteristic of one of the character's sons; it seemed a little contrived. Even so, this is one of the best \\"gay\\" books I've ever read!"},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"Wow, quite a lot of controversy about this book.Some think it's a sort of Harlequin romance, which may be so. But I found that it had an interesting historical relevance, as most all Westerns delete any reference to the part gay men played in early US history.I found the repressive environment, the sexual tension, and the hard life well-described. I have a hardcover version, with a very beautiful painting used as cover art. It's a book I'm keeping, and may read again, which is rare.This isn't Proust, or Nobel lit, but stands out as one of few Western novels about gay men. As others have mentioned, it could well be made into a compelling film."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"I was at first looking for something new and different to read, rather than another atypical, anicdotal coming of age story that seems to overrun the book shelves of today, and wow what a find. Not only was it a fresh new story it was one with a timely and pioneer feel of an era long since past. You could almost feel what it would have been like had you lived in those days. A great find and a good read. I couldn't put it down... Waiting for news of a continuation to this book...I will be first in line for it!"},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"What a wonderul read! FRONTIERS is an emotionally and erotically charged novel. The narrative is excellent and quite ambitious, since most of it takes place in colonial America (before &quot;gay,&quot; &quot;queer,&quot; or &quot;homosexuality,&quot; were constructed); Michael Jensen obviously did his research. Because the imagery and setting is so real, readers can easily empathize with the experiences of the main character, John Chapman. This isn't a cheap, get-off-quickly dime novel; it's actual literature that places gay sensibility and eroticism to the forefront. FRONTIERS, I think, sets the precedent for other gay novels to come. I anxiously await Jensen's next installment. (The cover for the paperback version is hot!)"},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"What might life be like for a gay man in 1797? Michael Jensen looks at the possibilities in his debut novel, Frontiers. I thought the book was well researched, smoothly written and its characters were well-drawn and multi-dimensional. The narrative is entertaining but at the same time skillfully raises some gay-sensitive issues for the reader to think about. Jensen writes with a fine sense of emotion, poignant but not overwrought; I found the protagonist's struggle to make a life for himself away from the confining pressures of society very moving. One thing which bothered me a bit was that some of the scenes toward the end of the book seemed improbable. Overall, though, I found Frontiers to be an evocative and original novel and a promising debut for Jensen. I eagerly await his future efforts."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"Warning - Don't pick up this book unless you have some time on your hands, because you won't want to put it down! An outstanding first novel by Michael Jensen set in the 1790's. His hero is John Chapman, a kind, gentle, caring man who we easily understand, identify with and root for. John has been ridiculed and pushed down all his life. Now he's tired of running away. All of Mr. Jensen's characters are three dimensional, well-defined and real. His dialogue is always believable and often humorous. He has a great talent for making us feel we are right there within the action of the book. And there is A LOT of action! I also learned a great deal about what living on the frontier must have been like. There are some great messages also - tolerance and respect of others and their differences, the danger of violent relationships, environmental issues, not blaming ourselves for fate's whims, but most of all through John Chapman, that we deserve to be in happy, loving relationships regardless of how others may feel. I give this book my highest recommendation. Don't miss it! I'm hoping for a sequel!"},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"I am an avid reader and have read many gay/lesbian books but none that come close to what 'Frontiers' has to offer. This story is not a merely sexual experience but a very intriguing story with suspense and mystery that makes it a book that you cannot put down until the very end. When you have finished it you find yourself feeling like the characters are personal friends of yours' and want to keep in touch with their everyday adventures. I have to say that it is one of the best books I've read in sometime and I read at least 80 books a year. A MUST read"},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"As a history buff, who also happens to be gay, I was really excited to read this story. You just don't see alot of historical gay fiction. Jensen's effective in getting us to care about the main character and in the man he comes to love. His descriptions of life on the frontier, for the most part, rang true with me. Some portions of the book, however, don't connect. While the time is well after the American Revolution in 1791, he links the plot line to references of the French &amp; Indian War 40 years before and it's confusing. At the very beginning of the novel, the main character is inside the office of the commander of a fort and it's so cold he can see his breath. A page later, he emerges in the warm sun of August. Can the confines of a log fort be that cold on a warm summer day? Inconsistencies like this, while minor, were somewhat annoying. The climatic action at the end was unbelievable. Still, I cheer Jensen (a flight attendant, by day) for his first effort and hope he tries again."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"Frontiers is a page-turning thriller, a gay romance novel, and a well-researched historical fiction all rolled into one. Its worth reading just for the adventure and fun of it. . .there is even steamy sex!I enjoyed the novel more, though, on another level. I was moved by Michael Jensen's gritty, clear-eyed presentation of the so often romanticized and sugar-coated settling of the west-&quot;How the West was Won,&quot; et al. What settlers perceived and preached as a taming of the wilderness, was in reality its destruction--both of the land and the people already living there. To my mind, Jensen shows us a picture closer to what the reality of the frontier must have been.The novel's protagonist, John Chapman, has confronted the disconnect between his culture's myths (about being a man and a gay man, for example) and his own experiences. This allows him to see beyond its other myths-about nature, Indians, women and religion-and to search for the truth, or at least to begin to create a new, &quot;truer&quot; myth. By the end of the novel, Chapman has begun to carve out a place of sanity, safety and love for himself-a home in the frontier of his own culture as well as his country. Perhaps he is on his way to becoming a prophet. . .I wanted the book to continue, not just to find out &quot;what happens next,&quot; but to learn from Chapman (and Jensen) how one person can live a good life and find beauty against such odds and amidst such ugliness. I am looking forward to reading more."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"I couldn't even get past the first 50 pages of this utterly amateurish novel. The style is filled with awful inverted sentence structures like 'Startled, I jumped.' and 'Trembling, I lay in the snow.' The dialogue is stilted --alternately contemporary then annoyingly arch, like something out of a bad period movie. Characters are constantly peppering their speech with the hundreds of 18th century terms that Jensen obviously spent an awful lot of time researching (check out his unnecessary bibliography with at least three books on colonial lingo). The central character, a dim-witted naif, often whines about not wanting to chop wood or show any interest in being a settler and only wanting the virile Daniel McQuay to cook for him and strip off his shirt so Chapman can gape and fantasize. Of course Chapman is obsessed with the naked male physique, like so many characters in gay fiction, and it's not long before he is masturbating to relieve himself of his sexual fantasies in the second or third chapter. I didn't care about the italicized sections that begin each chapter in which we are subjected to a cliche rendering of a 'traumatic' childhood and couldn't wait to dump the book at my local thrift store.It's astonishing how many people find junk like this insulting embarrassment worthy of laudatory comments. I really can't believe gay men think this is the kind of book we want to read. It was infantile from the very first page. ...The two stars are for the decent book cover illustration, the inside gets no stars."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"OK, I'm glad that finally a western gay literature is exist but this book have so much plot in it and there is no depth in all the characters.

Although Michael Jensen has many chance to write more about the background of his character but he choose not to and when he write, he give all of the detail in one time.The reader know what happen but Mr. Jensen fail to create the emotional involvement between the book and the reader.I suggest you borrow it from your friends or from a library but this book does not have enough value to buy."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"I could not put this book down.

A bit of the 90s style psychology along the way certainly irritated me, but I think Jensen had a message to get across, so its forgivable.

John Chapman keeps running, desperately trying to find his &quot;place&quot;. However, he finds that his &quot;place&quot; is really where his heart is: a cabin in western Pennsylvania, way out on the frontier, on his own claim. But if his past catches up to him, would he give it all up and continue to run?Well, Johns' past catches up and he is forced to make a decision: stand and fight, or run further west. He makes a grown mans' decision: he decides to stay and fight. And this is his frontier: he has what he wants and is now willing to fight for it.That, in a nutshell, describes the main plot. However, from a &quot;90's gay sensibility&quot;, I can see so many parallels with today: xenophobia, intolerance, right-wing zealotry/bigotry. Gay mens' lives have never been easy, but in the late 18th century on the western frontier, it must have been deadly. Michael Jensen has captured the period with exceptional clarity.Please take the time to read this book. It gives us a perspective on gay history: where we were 200 years ago. Compare what is in the book to what we know today; have things really improved?I'm grateful that Michael Jensen has taken the time to write this book.

That's why I loved this book! There are no over riding issues in this one. However it is dramatic enough to pull you into it's lanscape. It grabbed my attention from the first chapter and held it all the way to the end. With the way John Chapman was written as the settler with no settler skills, it provided me chance to imagine myself in John's shoes and learning about what it would be like to be a settler - at least in spirit. I thank Mr. Jensen for taking me away from the real world for a couple of days. I just wish the book had been longer."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"If you like your tales to be adventurous, and your men to be rough and strong but also sweet and innocent in a way that only frontiersmen can be, then this is the book for you. I didnt' think I would fall for an historical gay romance novel but I was hooked from the get-go. The prototypical characters are endearing, from our hero John Chapman (who takes almost as many pratfalls as Lucille Ball) to the monstrous villian Zach who, despite his murderous bent, gives some of the best fictional sex I've read in years. Add to this some really beautiful descriptions of Western Pennsylvania and frontier life, a blooming love story with a youthful buddy surrounded by a menacing, racist community (an Indian boy is killed for no reason), and you've got a novel that would hold any reader's interest.

I just took this book for what it was meant to be, not a masterpiece of literature but a resourseful, gay novel with characters I cared about and a positive message from a gay view point and we need more books that show gay men with many emotions both positive and negative, strong as well as weak. Human men during a time when our country was under constant threat from all her borders. The sexual encounters were very well written and understated for the mind of the reader, that was a big plus in this book as well as the suspense and human emotions.

Of course there are exceptions, but most of these books tend to use contemporary language and slang, and are told from a modern point of view, leaving me feeling like I've just attended a costume party instead of completing a work of viable fiction. I am thrilled to say that FRONTIERS by Michael Jensen is one of the previously mentioned exceptions. The painstaking research and the almost obsessive attention to detail are apparent from page one of this mesmerizing, and edge-of-your-seat-exciting story. I felt as if I had been transported to the harsh and unforgiving landscape of 1798 Western Pennsylvania, where I watched the life of protagonist, John Chapman, unfold.John Chapman, fleeing an impoverished childhood and an abusive father, has been running for his safety since he turned 14. (...). As the adventure begins John, living in Lower Canada, has been having a relationship with a Major in the British Army. The affair has been discovered by local authorities, and John and the Major are forced to make a dash for freedom. Unfortunately, the Major gets shot so John, on his own, heads for the Western frontier in hopes of staking a claim and starting his own farm. (...)Winter is coming on and, John, with no frontier skills, wanders across the Allegheny Plateau in search of an outpost called Warren, where he has read, claims, and the supplies to work them, are being offered to settlers. Near starvation, our hero is discovered, and taken in for the winter, by a gruff and drunken woodsman. Discovering his benefactor has some deep and disturbing secrets, John once again flees at the first sign of spring.He heads for the small settlement known as Franklin. Once again on the brink of disaster, John is led by an Indian woman to an abandoned claim a days walk from the new town. Encouraged by the settlement leader to take over the claim, John decides to stay. Among the few settlers he meets, is Palmer Baxter, a brash but handsome, seventeen year old frontiersman. Desperate to keep his natural inclinations in check, John does his best to discourage young Palmer, but the boy has no intention of being kept at bay. Even though they are on the very outskirts of society, John and Palmer must still face the overly-suppressive circumstances of the day. Added to this pressure, is the re-emergence of an incredibly evil presence from John's past. This is the outside edge of the known civilized world, and wrong decisions can easily equal death. Can John and Palmer survive the tremendous odds stacked against them?Jensen is able to weave an incredibly romantic love story, despite the extremely cruel and prejudicial attitudes of this society, inside an outdoor adventure to rival anything ever written by Jack London.This wonderful novel hooked me and reeled me in faster than a trout in a shallow stream. Jensen's incredible sense of detail and his sharp writing style made for one heck of an entertaining read. The scenes painted here provide the reader with a very real sense of time and place; a repressive time in an incredibly beautiful but dangerous place. I understand there is to be a sequel, I for one can't wait. I HIGHLY recommend this book, especially for anyone with an interest in accurate historical fiction."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"Michael Jensen's first novel tells a tale gays have always suspected--there were indeed men who loved other men among those brave pioneers who settled America.John Chapman is forced to flee to the uncharted wilds of New England when his affair with a British officer is discovered. Once there, he is saved by and begins a rough but hot relationship with the contentious Daniel McQuay, only to discover to his horror that the Irishman is not who he seems to be. The remainder of the novel details his escape to the settlement of Franklin from his savior turned psychotic killer, and his growing friendships with both the Indian woman Gwennie and the handsome young Palmer.Though at first the stilted dialogue and needlessly violent situations rouse skepticism, Jensen's careful attention to historical and geographical detail and ability to create interesting, colorful characters manage to hold the interest. The plot gathers steam and compels the reader toward the harrowing climax. Surprisingly for a novel that is advertised as a masterpiece of gay erotica, there are few actual sex scenes, a pity as the very first explicit encounter between Chapman and McQuay is a masterpiece. It occurs in a bathtub immediately after the two men have shot, gutted and cleaned an elk, all described in gory detail, and the juxtaposition of bloody death with wet, steamy sex creates a uniquely masculine and intensely erotic chapter. A pity Jensen could not have written more scenes like this and less of the rather offensive episodes involving both the Native American woman and Samantha, the pathetic daughter of a settler, who views marriage with the unwilling Chapman as her possible ticket to freedom. Both these portrayals are marred by stereotyping and unsuccessful attempts at dialect.All in all, &quot;Frontiers&quot; is adequate and even absorbing entertainment. It would make a good made-for-TV movie on one of the more permissive cable channels, though it's doubtful that a screen version will be forthcoming anytime soon."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"Kudos to you Michael for creating such an wonderful, well-developed story. This book has no problem drawing the reader right inside with a beautifully descriptive style. Within the first few pages, I found myself wondering what other books Michael had out for us to enjoy. To my dismay, I found that this is his first published work. I can only hope that he keeps up the great work. Fontiers gives us a look at a past filled with love, loss, adventure and plenty of frontier spirit."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"In 1797, John Chapman flees his home after being confronted with criminal charges for sexual misbehavior due to being seen in the arms of another man. John seeks a new home for himself in the Allegheny Mountains. However, instead of salvation, John's inexperience in the wilds leaves him near death. Loner Daniel McQuay saves young John from starving to death. Soon the pair becomes lovers. However, a darker side of Daniel appears that frightens Johnny with its violent tendencies. When Daniel tells John about a psychopath who murdered many people before vanishing into the hills, a scared Johnny decides to flee.After leaving McQuay, Johnny meets a teenage Southerner, Palmer and an Indian woman Gwennie. The trio travels together in search of their own dreams. However, McQuay has tracked Johnny down and the lad knows that he will never enjoy life until he faces his one time rescuer and would be murderer.FRONTIERS is a multifaceted historical fiction that paints a different picture of early American history than seen in text books. The star is an extremely complex individual, whose sexual preference leaves him struggling with a society that disses him. The story line is filled with non-stop action and heated sex scenes between gay lovers. However, the characters turn Michael Jensen's novel into an entertaining novel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"I wish Michael Jensen would kick whoever wrote on the inside of the book jacket &quot;A thrilling homoerotic odyssey.&quot; Sooner or later there is bound to be one ignorant critic who calls this book &quot;the gay adventures of Johnny Appleseed.&quot; He should be kicked too. There is much more to this story.First of all, it's good clean fun. There is sex, and it's pertinent and romantic. There is melodrama and predictable plot moves, but they're somehow superceded by Jensen's energetic use of detail and the sheer speed of this book. And there are subtle strokes and delineations throughout that almost get by you: without giving anything of the plot away, I could say it's remarkable how Jensen makes clear the deep need for love and companionship which motivates the person who turns out to be the villain of the story. The story moves easily from the savage to the subtle and the author's skill with both is deft.Appropriate to his topic, Mr. Jensen comes off as an folk-tale-type story teller, weaving narrative for the pure enjoyment of it. I had the same experience of the reader directly below me: once I picked up _Frontiers_, I was 3/4 of the way finished in no time. The author's writing style is as smooth and readable as anybody since David Leavitt. Great, great fun."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"I am usually motivated to talk about a book I liked! I tried not to write this review, thinking it was not worth my time, but I must. I have never read a book that seemed to relish violence as much as this one. I have looked at the reviews and tried to figure out what kind of person seems to be unaffected by, or even resonate to, the mental and physical terror, torture, and gore I found in this novel. As if this were not enough, I found that the characters never materialized as real and complete human beings. While there were glimpses of what it might have been like in the early days of the frontier, it often seemed to be taking place in today's world of corruption and violence. I suppose I should go into a lot of detail about what I perceive to be some of the weakness of the novel - such as the flash-back at the beginning of every chapter to the protagonist's childhood - but it's really just not worth it.END"},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"I hope Michael Jensen will write more books like this one. It's difficult to find good gay novels, and good gay historical ones are even more rare. He did a good job on his research and keeps everything within the period. Once I got started, it was difficult to put down."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"This is a trashy, poorly written romance novel (similar to those for which the likes of Fabio poses)pretending to be a historical novel. The Dialogue is trite and false, and the characters are flat and empty. Pass this cliche ridden novel by and pick up something good our genre has produced--White, Holleran, Levitt, Hollinghurst, but certainly not Jensen."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"I read this book before I saw all the reviews here and I'm wondering if we're all talking about the same novel. The one I read was formulaic and totally unremarkable. Compared to some really excellent novels set on the frontier and featuring gay characters (The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon or The Rest of the Earth), Frontiers is pretty lame--lowest common denominator fiction, written as if it wanted to be a screenplay. I never believed for a second that these characters lived in the 1700s, what with all the late 20th century pop psychology running through the narration. Within 20 pages of the end, I simply stopped reading. I was so bored with the characters and knew exactly what would happen next. If you like contrived, anachronistic historical fiction with tons of gratuitous sex and violence, then Frontiers might be right up your alley."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"The first 40 or 50 pages seemed uneven to me; there were rapid plot and character developments, followed by long dry spells. But by the middle of the book, it began to look as if the author may have matched the plot's development with that of the main character, John Chapman. As Chapman gained greater confidence, the plot moved faster. By then, Chapman was capable of handling situations that would have destroyed him earlier in the book. I enjoyed this book very much, both as historical fiction and an excellent novel about a gay man."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"As a budding little gay boy, I was always intrigued with &quot;the olden days&quot;...&quot;Bonanza&quot; on TV, Knotts Berry Farm, even history lessons in school. But the most wonderful way for my imagination to soar was to read...some of my favorites were the Laura Ingalls Wilder books (the &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; series). While reading &quot;Frontiers&quot;, I couldn't help but feel that same old rush of excitement as all of the historically accurate details painted a picture for me that kept a flame alive in my consciousness, illuminating what life was like two centuries ago. Unlike Laura Ingalls Wilder, however, Michael Jensen portrays a side of life so rarely explored anywhere before in the context of this period of American history: queer love. It's raining gay men...hallelujah! ALL the characters were great, and the story itself utterly believable. Whether cheering for the hero, hissing the villain, or being drawn in by the supporting characters, I was riveted from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"I have just finished this book for the third time in two days. The details are not only accurate, but show an insight into the human condition which is missing from a great deal of fiction. Frontiers will have barriers to face by being branded a &quot;gay&quot; novel, but hopefully its readers will open up to the fact that homosexuality is not only a fact of nature, but of human nature. The themes of love and betrayal are universal, but difficult to portray so vividly and heart-renderingly. Also, I appreciate greatly when historical details are accurate as these are. With any luck, Michael Jensen will continue to write for many years to come."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"Readers buy novels for many reasons, and an insight into real individuals is rare. This historical fiction I found to be a good read. The real \\"Johnny Appleseed\\" probably was as backward as the John Chapman of \\"Frontiers\\", and one senses the outcast nature of being an \\"abomination\\" in the 1790s. The author does a masterful job with the difficulty of John's sexual difference as well as the hardship of living on the frontier. There is no positive sense of closure with the novel, just as there probably was with the real John Chapman's life. I enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"but I didn't! I read this book after the author contacted me. He had read my Amazon review of John Rechys' CITY OF NIGHT and wanted me to read his book also. Of course, I was honored. I really found it difficult to believe anything in this book. And oh, how I tried. It's supposed to be a period piece. But, the voices of the characters are like they are alive in our time rather than 200+ years ago. I was really very hungry for something I thought it was going to be. Unfortunately, it didn't deliver. Of course, this is just my opinion. Thank you for reading my review."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"I waited years after reading this book waiting for another work of art my this auther. M. Jensen did not disapoint me when he wrote his new book Firelands. I think everyone should read his works."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"I realize there's always a need for gay-positive novels. But unfortunately, this is merely a silly, shallow gay-themed Harlequin romance. It's ineptly written, the characters are poorly drawn and even the &quot;historical&quot; aspects have been better covered by other authors. Sure, it will mindlessly kill a couple of hours. But you'd be better off -- and better entertained -- discovering more innovative authors."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"Michael Jensen's novel FRONTIERS is to gay literature what the 'bodice-ripper' novel is to the hetero-novels! In the tradition of &quot;Forever Amber&quot; and &quot;The President's Lady&quot;, we have in Jensen's magnificent novel, the first &quot;buckskin-ripper&quot;, a highly charged, homoerotic, slice of American history. It is so well written that the average reader cannot put it down, once begun. And, of course, that is just the sort of novel that cries out for an immediate film adaptation. The filming of Jensen's masterpiece would, IMHO, be the first break-through film of gay interest that would be of special interest to a general audience. (Hey, I've heard enough jokes around my water cooler at work to know that even the 'straight' boys wonder what those mountain men did for fun in an isolated enviroment.)Mr. Jensen, please consult with the great, gay, screenwriter/producer Arthur Laurents and bring this exciting novel to the screen. And if I were casting director? Yes, Rupert Graves, would be perfection as John Chapman. Russell Crowe or Patrick Swayze as that hard hearted, HARD Daniel/Zack! Winona Ryder as Gwennie and Wes Bentley as Palmer. The mind reels and the mouth drools at just the thought of giant, George Stevens'-like close-ups of Rupert Graves and WesBentley together.This is a story that is more than an erotic turn-on. Your left with the question of what is it that makes a 'real' man? No one has a wrist problem in this story -- in the days of the New Frontier when men were men and other men were sure made happy by that fact!"},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"The well researched historical setting and fully developed characters make this a refreshing change from many Gay oriented novels. Mr. Jensen captures the overall feeling of 18th century frontier society and harshness of every day life. If the ending is drawn out, it is one small flaw in an otherwise well written novel. I will look forward to more of Mr. Jensen's work and hope for a sequel to this book."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"What can I add to the praise that others have so lavishly heaped on this book and its author? Well, here's what I said in a private review to the author - &quot;unique, touching, believable, fast-paced, engaging characters, the first, but hopefully not the last, in a genre, and I'm hoping for a sequel Or better yet, a trilogy.&quot; For the record, I am a middle-aged vanilla female, straight, and not a fan of historical fiction in particular. This book is so good it doesn't need a genre-specific readership. More, please, Michael, soon."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"I wasn't sure whether I'd like &quot;Frontiers&quot;, but as I started reading it, the story just pulled me in.Many gay novels are either about AIDS (sad) or some superficial group of character (comedy). &quot;Frontiers&quot; is neither and that is certainly a plus.&quot;Frontiers&quot; takes place in an unlikely time for a gay novel and Michael Jensen describes this time very well. I could picture every scene vividly in my mind. Jensen kept me very interested in the fate of John, our &quot;hero&quot;."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"Well, this book was not one I would have picked on my own, but I was surprised and found it to be quite fun and offered an interesting twist. It is nice to see the traditional gay theme being interwoven into a different setting - the 'old west'. Although I found the ending to be somewhat overdramatized - I kept thinking that this guy watched too many Wild Wild West and Lone Ranger episodes - and finding it interesting that two &quot;gay&quot; men would find themselves together in the middle of nowhere, the story kept me intrigued.I hope that this is a beginning of more stories containing infusions of gay themes within historical contexts."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"This is a truly delightful read. I couldn't put it down and found myself very engaged in the story and characters. It was a bit disturbing at times but then so were those days on the wild frontier; especially for a gay man. This is a must read piece of gay literature. Groundbreaking.What's next Michael?"},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"I read a review before purchasing &quot;Frontiers&quot; which promoted the book as a modern-day Fennimore-esque novel with a wonderful gay twist. Wow ... what a let down. The characters were thin (I didn't for a moment believe such people could ever exist), the plot was transparent (not much happens that you can't predict), and the characters all definitely have an anachronistic 20th century sensibility. The main character, John, is a whiny wimp who never would have survived the frontier.But even those sins might be forgiveable, had the style lived up to (or even approached) James Fennimore Cooper's way of story-telling.I planned to and wanted very much to like this novel, but it did NOT live up to its hype. Sorry, but thumbs down and save your dough."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"From the first, Frontiers grabs the reader and doesn't let go. Throughout the novel, new characters emerge as new chapters unfold, and each one is as engaging as the last. While the major players are gay men, this thought-provoking tale has universal appeal. Anyone with an open mind and a free spirit can appreciate John Chapman's struggle for justice and pursuit of happiness in 1700's Pennsylvania. Thus Frontiers has all the elements -- memorable characters, great use of language, humor, passion, suspense, and a message that needs to be heard. Hats off to Michael Jensen, a gifted storyteller with a promising future..."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"&quot;Frontiers&quot; certainly does break new ground in many ways and deserves 6-stars for the 3 years which author Michael Jensen put into researching the historical, linguistic, and geographical detail that went into the making of this gem. Never has historical fiction been as breathtaking in its epic sweep (reminiscent of Alan Eckert), its exploration of the pioneer mind (something which Michener and Uris could never get right), and its fresh take on American values and where they may have started. I appreciate that the humanity, humor and psychology of his characters -- John, Daniel, Palmer and Gwennie -- never get lost in the huge palette of events (1779-1812) that transpire. To call this a &quot;homoerotic&quot; romp misses the mark completely; &quot;Frontiers&quot; is about finding, fearing, and adapting to change, internally and externally. We've all explored that &quot;Frontier.&quot; Do yourself a favor and explore Michael Jensen's &quot;Frontiers.&quot; Then share it with a friend."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"Lambda Awards Committee, are you reading these glowing reviews? &quot;Frontiers&quot; is a stunning achievement on many, many levels, and without a doubt one of the best historical romances of all time -- with a twist. Jensen's skill as a novelist in his chosen genre is unparalleled today. And what a twist -- a positive, optimistic, uplifting adventure story about people you will long remember after you put down the book. I finished it last week and have started rereading it already. John, Palmer, Gwennie, and even the ambiguously evil &quot;Daniel McQuay&quot; have become part of my heart and soul. Without a doubt this novel should be voted &quot;Best Novel of the Year,&quot; and Pocket Books should be commended for its publication of what must have been for them &quot;sensitive&quot; subject matter. I can only hope that we see more of this high quality from Michael Jensen and Pocket Books in the future."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"Wonderful story, engaging characters, and a profound sense of life on the frontier! I'm hooked, Mr. Jensen. More, please!"},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"Frontiers! Is an excelent novel. Its characters are believable and vibrant the story line spellbinding and captivating.I started this book two days ago. From almost the first moment I could not put it down. There are so many elements that work together to create this stunning tale.There is the western theme, and the baldly erotic scenes mixed in with an engaging tapestry of horror, all woven together by a master storyteller. I loved my visit to the old west.Being a romantic I was a little disapointed with the ending, but I guess Mr. Jensen was leaving room for what is to come. Mr. Jensen says that he was trying to write about somewhere other than NY or SF well he did it and he did it quite well.Over all I'd say this is a definte must buy. Do yourself a favor and try something new and refreshing. Read Frontiers!"},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"In my opinion the perfect novel has two qualities. It grabs the reader and doesn't let go until well after the book has been read, and it makes use of language in a way that makes it a joy to read.&quot;Frontiers&quot; has both of these qualities. From the moment I started the book, I literally could not put it down. The characters are wonderful, and the story itself is a wonderful blend of romance, erotica, adventure, and even horror. It is beautifully written, filled with passages that beg to be spoken out loud. It is so rare these days to find an author who can both write an enjoyable story and honor the sacredness of the written word. With &quot;Frontiers,&quot; Michael Jensen has done both. I hope he writes another novel soon!I cannot recommend this book enough. It should be read not only by gay men, but by everyone who appreciates good literature.(P.S. - Thank you so much, Michael, for contacting me and asking me to check out your book!)"},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"I purchased this book mainly out of curiosity, to see how gay characters would be portrayed in a historical novel. But I was quickly drawn into the story of John Chapman, and found it difficult to abandon the book for very long over the course of a weekend. The author obviously put a lot of research and time into his novel, and I was especially impressed with his ability to describe antiquated terms without distracting the reader from the story. In the end, I enjoyed the banding together of the &quot;misfits&quot; into a real community of trust and mutual concern. It is doubtful there is much documentation of actual same-sex relationships from this part of history, and I think Michael Jensen did an outstanding job of weaving history, romance, and suspense in a page-turning tale."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"So, I just finished Frontiers by Michael Jensen. I didn't have high expectations when the best blurb on the back cover said that the book was \\"invigorated by hot sex scenes in bathtubs and amid thunderstorms...\\" Believe it or not, that doesn't make me want to buy a book. If I wanted to buy a book for the sex scenes, I'd go pick up a copy of one of the Friction series. (Oh look...there's a new one out...hmmmm...)I picked Frontiers up, because frankly there hasn't been anything out in a while and I was still waiting for the new Alan Hollinghust novel.The book wasn't horrible, but the characters were all just types, not real people. There's the stereotypical gay greenhorn who is helped by the stereotypical knowing frontiersman, and who then has to escape the knowing frontiersman but is helped by the stereotypical wise Native American woman. There are the stereotypical pushy settlers who try to get the stereotypical greenhorn to marry their stereotypically ugly daughter. And, the stereotypical, young, nubile gay iconoclast. This is a romance novel. It should have Fabio on the cover in a coon-skin cap. Some of the other reviewers discuss the \\"historical accuracy\\" of this novel. I'm afraid they haven't done much research themselves. Yes, there was indeed a person named John Chapman who was the basis for the American Myth of Johnny Appleseed. But that's where the accuracy ends.Frankly I was surprised that the western frontier of Pennsylvania was such a cornucopia of hot man-on-man action in 1797. Pennsylvania isn't much like that now, I'm afraid. I also learned that frontier people are made of sterner stuff than us wusses today. You can throw them off a cliff, shoot them, bash them in the head several times with cast iron skillets, but they keep coming back to try to kill your young, naked, gay lover. Only a cabin filled with gunpowder seems to really kill them. (But no one mentioned finding a body...uh oh, I smell sequel!)Was there anything good about this book? Yes. It wasn't set in LA or NY, didn't involve a single screenwriter, and absolutely no crystal meth was snorted by any character. A pleasant change of pace from most of the gay books I've read recently."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"Jensen's debut novel has been much maligned for its anachronistic dialogue and attitudes, and with much justification. The book's greater crime, to me anyway, seems to be the inconclusive characterizations and unconvincing relationships. The &quot;affair&quot; between Chapman and McQuay, for instance, seems a thing of contrivance rather than a relationship based on any genuine sentiment or need. And the fact that Chapman has, up to that point, been portrayed as rather passive if not meek is turned on its head when he takes the &quot;lead&quot; role, so to speak, in the big bathtub sex scene with McQuay. It is such an erotic, turbulent, and well-done &quot;coupling&quot; that the reader expects a new and more intimate dimension to their relationship to be explored. It never is. Instead they become instant adversaries, their relationship doing a complete 360. Other connections between characters have that same uneasy sense of start and stop, as though Jensen were not entirely sure which way he wanted his novel to go.Another grievance would be the excessive gratuitous violence perpetrated upon animals. I know this is the frontier, where gentility was more often than not alien and the whole notion of humane treatment towards animals was nascent, but really some of the scenes (the early one with the captive rabbit especially) seem unnecessary and are upsetting. The novel would definitely never receive a citation from PETA.Still FRONTIERS is pleasurably paced and easy to read. Jensen has done his homework with regard to customs, geography, topography, flora and fauna, and the day to day struggle of these people trying to make new lives for themselves; he is able to give us a fairly convincing portrait of this tumultuous time in American history. And who knows, perhaps he has ushered in a new pop literary genre that will result in better, more ingratiating novels."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"I found this book frustrating. I had hoped it would fulfill its premise that John Chapman (the historical &quot;Johnny Appleseed&quot;) was gay. While Jensen's John Chapman is gay and does plant a grove of apple trees, the book turns into a (albeit sweet and even credible) romantic novel about Chapman's (sexual and other) adventures in western Pennsylvania in the 1790s. The characters are a bit one-dimensional and I did find myself wondering at some possibly anachronistic usages (&quot;truck farm&quot;?). I do agree with the reviewer who expressed pleasure at the availability of gay romantic charcters and plots, but this book left me wishing for more substance. Maybe Mr. Jensen plans a sequel, in which Johnny Appleseed heads out to fulfill his folkloric destiny, accompanied by the man of his dreams. The conclusion of this book does allow that option, by the way...."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"I grew up reading westerns. Some of my favorite series were \\"Buckskin\\" and \\"Spur\\" I always replaced the women in the books with myself. I tired to write a western using only men some years ago with no luck. I learned about Michael Jensen's novel \\"Frontiers\\" on the back flap of Brent Harbingers' novel \\"Geography Club\\". I had just finished reading both \\"Geography Club\\" and \\"The Order of The Poison Oak\\" the last part of 2005 and bought both \\"Frontiers\\" and \\"Firelands\\" to read later. My first book of 2006 was \\"Frontiers\\" and I couldn't wait to read \\"Firelands\\" the second book of the year. The characters were real. The violence was believable and the love between John and Palmer was real. I finished \\"Frontiers\\" on a Friday night and started \\"Firelands\\" finishing it the following Monday. What a way to start the New Year with two of the best novels I've read in a long time. I will be checking the name Michael Jensen on Amazon most often waiting for the next novel from this brilliant man. - Joe - TX"},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"It seemed to me this book was written by three people: a literate writing an well-thought and interesting introduction, an 10th-grade wannabe, awkward and stumbling in dialogue, plot and character development, and then a tabloid writer rushing to an implausible, depressing and ultimately tragic ending. I admire anyone that can write a book, and must respect the author for also having scored such a well-known publisher. But really now, every chapter either begins, furthers or ends in a tragedy. I appreciated the historical context and in that regard, I think life on the frontier is fairly well represented. However, the main character whines his way through the book, much as you'd assume he has through his entire life, and there is little or nothing to make you care - it would have been a relief if a bear had taken the protaganist early (like, first chapter) in the book, relieving us of every tragic detail that follows, and then the book could be enjoyed as an reasonably accurate historical adventure. The only thing to pity then would be the plight of the native americans. As it is, you get just too dang annoyed at the main character to care!"},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"Warning - Don't pick up this book unless you have some time on your hands, because you won't want to put it down! An outstanding first novel by Michael Jensen set in the 1790's. His hero is John Chapman, a kind, gentle, caring man who we easily understand, identify with and root for. John has been ridiculed and pushed down all his life. Now he's tired of running away. All of Mr. Jensen's characters are three dimensional, well-defined and real. His dialogue is always believable and often humorous. He has a great talent for making us feel we are right there within the action of the book. And there is A LOT of action! I also learned a great deal about what living on the frontier must have been like. There are some great messages also - tolerance and respect of others and their differences, the danger of violent relationships, environmental issues, not blaming ourselves for fate's whims, but most of all through John Chapman, that we deserve to be in happy, loving relationships regardless of how others may feel. I give this book my highest recommendation. Don't miss it! I'm hoping for a sequel!"},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"I'd love to wax poetically or give some scholarly treatise about this book because it certainly deserves that. Instead, I'll tell you what you really need to know, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PUT IT DOWN ONCE YOU START READING IT! It was the most intriguing and fun story (not to mention sexy) I've read in a while. I bought three more copies to send to friends. It's that good. It reminds me of reading Vonnegut, in that, you think you're going to read some wierd, wild romp and laugh your brains out (and you do), but the next thing you know, he's got you wanting to save the human race and be as good a person as the characters. You will get to caring about these characters and want to know what happens to them next. So, hurry up and write Part II, Mr. Jensen."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"The thing about historical fiction is that no one will agree on content accuracy, because we all have percieved ideas about what past cultures *may* have been like (I'm safely assuming that no one reading this novel actually *was* a frontiersman?).So, setting that aside, this is an excellent novel. There were scenes that I would read over and over in one sitting. I became very attached with the main character and worried for him during the plot. It's a great, great story =)"},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"It was actually quite amazing that this book was written in 1999, before Brokeback Moutain and a steady stream of gay romances published by people like Dreamspinner Press. And the novel hasn't aged at all. John Chapman comes across as a very well developed character with his sensitiveness and inner battles concerning his life and sexuality. Also Gwennie and Palmer were two strong characters, especially Gwennie with her idiosyncratic behaviour. Palmer was more of a modern free thinker, and the settlers partially conformed to the modern point of view of being ruthless and brutish. Nevertheless, the story was very engaging, thrilling and romantic, and the climax will keep you on the edge of your seat. But this is not simply a thriller or a romance, but the story of John Chapman, who has to deal with his traumatic past, his fears and his own identity. In this way this book is still as good as the better gay romances published today, but if you're looking for a even longer and more epic gay historical romance, I suggest strongly to have a look at Steph Minns' One Man Drowning."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"Sometime ago a friend told me he loved Western Romance, and I thought, how many chance he will have to read them? If I think really hard, I probably come out with two, three titles. At the time I didn't know about Frontiers; I found about it in the top 10 list Brent Hartinger compiled for my LiveJournal, and I immediately added it to my wish list; I was not sure about it, not knowing about it before, I had a little doubt that maybe the novel was too \\"heavy\\", I like historical, but sincerely, I don't like when they are too heavy on details, making the read more a challenge than a pleasure. But Michael Jensen is also the partner of Brent Hartinger, and so this romance outside the romance was a point more the pro list to buy it.The book is a good historical, and above all a good Western romance; if we are true with us, Western romance is the \\"light\\" subgenre of the Historical romance, and so the risk to be \\"boring\\" is less, and Frontiers is not boring at all. It's a mix of drama and romance, the drama part makes the novel realistic; it's not an easy life for the people living on the Frontier at the end of the XVIII century, and both side, white men and Native Americans. All the story is centred around John Chapman, apparently a lucky man, but Lady Fortune does strange tricks; John seems to be always on the run, first from his family, then from expectations he is not willing to meet, and now even from the law: he was seen with his lover, and English Officer, and so he is double a traitor, to the Law of God as sodomite, and to the Law of his country, sleeping with an Englishman.John runs away once more time, and he ends up literally lost in a snowstorm and right on the doorstep of Daniel, a strange hunter, who first seems to don't like so much strangers, and John in particular, and then teaches him how to survive. But Daniel's love borders in obsession, and John has to find his own way, and another run is there for him. This time he ends up in Franklin, a settler town in the middle of nowhere, but even here John finds a possible partner, Palmer, a 17 years old boy (don't worry, John is only 24) who, on the contrary of his townsfolk, is able to appreciate and respect the nature around him.Colin, the English Officer, Daniel, the rough hunter, and Palmer, the young settler, represent different type of love and lover. In order of appearance, develops also John's involvement; don't get me wrong, in a way or the other, John loves them all, but only with Palmer he will realize what true love is. The novel was also acclaimed like a good erotica: indeed, it has more sexy scenes than other mainstream novels, but don't worry, the sex is never gratuitous, and it always serves the story, not the way around.Another point that let me perplexed reading the blurb, and that in the end was better than expected, is Gwennie's character, the Native American woman who will help John settle down with his new life; I'm sincere, I was a little worried that John had to \\"settle down\\" also in the other meaning of the words, and that Gwennie was his \\"historical\\" beard. Maybe she will be, and maybe the author sometime hinted at that, but she is not part of the emotional development of John: one thing he is sure and doesn't change, is his strong belief that he prefers men to women, and he has to deal with it, on the good and the bad.The author neither saves to the reader the dark side of that part of History, and I think he is by the Native Americans side, and also by that of Nature. Almost all the worst episodes, if not all, are by the hand of the white men, and I don't doubt that they are not fantasies, but unfortunately only retelling of what really happened."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"I would normally never read a \\"period\\" piece - my book supply ran out so my Partner gave me a book he has had on our bookshelf for a long time to get me by until my Amazon order arrived.

This novel was as successful taking me away from the daily grind as &quot;Wolves&quot;, but since its main character was gay it was even more delightful. I hope there will be a sequel! --Ronald L.

Didn't like the way the lead kept loosing the men he loved, but still a good book. I read it in a day and a half."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"Jensen does a wonderful job with this first book. However, it is not for the faint at heart. The brutal, harsh environment is depicted accurately and passionately. The reader gets a sense that Jensen has really done his research and has created a landscape that is both beautiful and dangerous. The author's sense of pacing is excellent making this a powerful page turner. Told in the first person, the novel introduces us to John Chapman, a man trying to escape his past and establish a claim in the 1797 town of Franklin. This is not your typical gay novel at all. The obstacles he manages to face are seemingly insurmountable!I felt that some of the sexual content was a bit gratuitous and was taken aback at times by scenes of intense, horrific violence. These are not typical cosmopolitan gay men sharing drinks at a local bar. Jensen is part Stephen King, part Laura Ingalls Wilder, part Gordon Merrick. A great first effort from Jensen! I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"I really enjoyed this book, which is a curious mixture of contemporary gay porn and descriptions of the rough life on the frontier in the late 1700's. The hero, John, is an introspective jittery type, getting into bad situations and having to be rescued, searching for a decent life. I rather doubt gay men did so much thinking and self-analyzing back in those days!!! John meets Daniel, has hot sex, escapes and settles down on a land claim where he meets Palmer, has hot sex, and they meet Gwennie, the straight female friend. All are menaced by a psycho killer until a Friday the 13th type ending. In between the neurotic self-analysis are marvelous descriptions of the hard primitive frontier life - cutting up an elk in the snow, watering the garden in a drought, dealing with the desperate, nosy people in the settlement. The ending may as well have had &quot;End of Part I - Look for the Sequel Soon&quot; added on. All in all, quite different and enjoyable. Beware the casual cruelties to animals! Sadly a movie will never be made of this book, but I would cast a younger Hugh Grant as John, Marilyn fm Northern Exposure as Gwennie, Leonardo DiCaprio as Palmer, and (why not) Tom Selleck as Daniel/Zach, the psycho killer. Hurry up with that sequel, Michael Jensen, there's a whole lot more to Johnny Appleseed's life !!!"},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"&quot;Friendships never came easy for me. Perhaps embarrassment over my drunk, traitorous father compelled me to keep people away. Possibly I feared that my longings for other boys would be discovered if I let anyone too close.

Hope to be reading more by you."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"What can be said of a novel that grabs you from the beginning, takes you on a wild ride fraught with peril and struggle and finally releases you back to reality? I would call it &quot;Frontiers&quot;. Michael Jensen has taken colonial America in the guise of John Chapman and transformed it into a living history filled with love, hope, despair, sorrow, and finally rebirth.Mr. Jensen skillfully develops the story as he builds the characters into real flesh and blood people. He shows how pious the early settlers had become and how intolerant they were of anyone who was different from them. John Chapman must also hide his true feelings because of fear of prosecution. Isn't that a strange parallel to today's events. Hasn't anything been learned in all this time? Mr. Jensen uses the flashback sequences to effectively develop the main character, much in the same way that Michael Lowenthal did in his novel, &quot;The Same Embrace&quot;.The research that Mr. Jensen did for the constructing of this novel is evident throughout. It is history in a way that history should be portrayed, with perspectives from those that have been previously ignored. Open your mind and read a novel that deals with issues that haven't been dealt with before, and be gloriously entertained as well."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"I'm not really into Westerns, but by about halfway through the book, I was totally hooked! Brilliant use of the various metaphors of 'frontiers': physical, sexual, emotional. I especially loved how well he expressed the concept of being gay in an overbearingly non-gay world. And it's a love story to boot!"},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"John Chapman, a 24 year old town-dweller who is hiding that he is homosexual, ends up on the run in November 1797. He?s had an affair with a Major in the British Army and been found out. From the unexpected violence of the opening pages to his journey?first in Lower Canada, then Pennsylvania and onward as he travels West?it is clear that Chapman is an innocent. He has no frontier skills, no horse, no weapons, and some serious doubts about his courage, most of which were implanted by his abusive father. But he does have determination to try to make it to free land in the West to stake his claim or die trying. If he can make it to the Warren Outpost and get free supplies and a parcel of his own land, he thinks his troubles will be over.Despite the snow and ice, he manages to cross the Allegheny Plateau, but is lost, physically spent, and out of food. Days?perhaps hours?from death, he comes upon a cabin in the wilderness where he is reluctantly taken in by the threatening and mysterious Daniel McQuay.From this point on, the characters he meets (Daniel, George Chase in Franklin, the solitary Indian woman Gwennie, and the charmingly handsome Palmer Baxter) all have a huge impact on his life. Over the long winter, Daniel teaches him survival skills, but he wants something and eventually scares Chapman away. George Chase then lets him stay in a vacant cabin, but he wants something. Chapman doesn?t know what Gwennie wants. It?s clear Palmer wants Chapman, but our hero isn?t about to succumb to the kind of love and attraction that has already gotten him in trouble and cost a man his life. Despite the fact that Chapman manages to resist Palmer?s charms initially, he still has to deal with small-mindedness, sexism, racism, the ignorant swath of compassionless ?Christians,? bad weather, and new enemies. And old enemies. Lurking in the midst of Chapman?s seemingly safe world is an evil enemy who has the capacity to turn his world upside down and who, of course, does just that. Injuries, deaths, and intrigue ensue, and I was at the proverbial edge of my seat through most of the last half of the book.The tale is wonderfully told. Jensen?s dialogue is fresh and realistic, giving an accurate flavor of late 18th century while not overwhelming the reader with colloquialisms. Chapman has a sense of humor, especially about his failure to be a tough, he-man type. He displays a gentleness and humanity many of the settlers lack that made me identify with and love him. His narrative of the weather and environment is balanced perfectly as in this lovely description: ?Lightning flashed against the darkening sky, giving me an excuse to turn away. Already dark clouds the color of ugly bruises and hateful intentions were closer, bearing down on us as surely as winter on autumn. Occasional gusts of wind rumbled own the valley rippling through the treetops, their leaves trembling suddenly in the sunlight like a million green-winged birds in flight? (p. 263).Jensen has crafted a compelling story the likes of which I have never read before. I am not aware of any historical drama/adventure/romance based upon such a well-rounded and mesmerizing gay character. John Chapman?s first person account is riveting. This is bildungsroman of the highest order, a story of love, lust, greed, and striving set against the unforgiving American frontier. I can?t recommend it highly enough! ~Lori L. Lake, author of lesbian fiction and freelance reviewer for Midwest Book Review, Golden Crown Literary Society?s 'The Crown,' The Independent Gay Writer, and Just About Write."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"A MUST READ FOR ALL READERS Excellent,vivid,and positive view of gay men during the pioneer days.I can not wait until you publish your next book! A DREAM TO READ!"},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"Though I've never read a Harlequin romance, I imagine that they must read much like Mr. Jensen's &quot;Frontiers.&quot; I feel misled by the early hype. The experience of gay men and women in the early American period is ripe for exploration. Unfortunately, Mr. Jensen was not up to the task. There are many well written books by gay authors out there . . . read those. Skip this one!"},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"One of the finest books I've read in quite some time. Frontiers is destined to become a classic. Michael Jensen has produced a work of art. He tells a story of a young man's struggle against society, against the wilderness, and most importantly, against his own internalized hatred for being gay in a time when expressing these feelings could get you imprisoned or even killed. I immediately connected with our hero, John Chapman as he finds himself fleeing for his life into the promise of freedom in the Pennsylvania wilderness. Clinging to the hope to start a new life for himself he finds himself fighting just to survive. The novel has some very romantic passages that will tug at your heart with just the right touch of eroticism. The characters John encounters are all well developed, each with their own personality, convictions and hang-ups. Setting the book in the late 18th century adds a touch of fantasy to the entire novel making everything seem unreal yet familiar. This novel has it all, love, deceit, romance, lust, murder, revenge, adventure and the added bonus of giving you a glimpse into the past where life for a gay man was different from, yet the same as, many of the lives gay people lead today. I recommend this book to anyone with any interest in either historical novels, erotic novels, romance novels or gay ficton."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"The different thing about Jensen's book than other &quot;life-in-the-frontier&quot; novels, is that the main character was considered a sexual outlaw. We follow the story of John Chapman, after he ran away from his hometown to a new life in the frontiers, and how, along the way, he had to endure numerous problems in his personal and love life. At times, it seems that Jensen indulged himself in exploring Chapman's mood too elaborately, dragging the story too long. The pace picks up towards the end considerably - I shouldn't reveal the plot, but let's just say it's almost like &quot;Terminator&quot; in 1800's setting! Overall, it's a light pleasant read (with some good bits in the middle)."},{"Title":"Frontiers","review":"This book was refreshing, fun and exciting. It was a pleasure to read.

This quiet but compelling novel is the story of a family in trouble, trying to eke out a living as dryland farmers after the death of the family's mother. A housekeeper is hired through a newspaper ad, and the arrival of Rose and her brother from Minneapolis is the launching point of the story. The narrator is the all-grown-up Paul, eldest son of the family, now the Superintendent of Schools for Montana, who reflects back 50 years to this particular time in his life (1909) when the world changed dramatically for him. A couple of reviewers have complained of boredom, but this novel's strenght lies in its simplicity...family love and interconnectedness, truth and honor, strong belief in education as the path to success, etc. Although I loved all the characters, I was most struck by the Turley family, a father and son who were the bottom-feeders of this rural community....threatening bullies who were oddly sympathetic because they had so little going for them. My first Doig book, and definitely not my last!"},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"Ivan Doig has been called \\"the reigning master of new Western literature.\\" And THE WHISTLING SEASON, his latest book, certainly confirms his writing stature.The story is told from the point of view of Paul Milliron, currently the Montana state superintendent of schools. He has been delegated to decide the fate of the state's last rural schools. As he struggles with the decisions he must make, Paul recalls his childhood and the one-room schoolhouse he attended in Marias Coulee, Montana in the fall of 1909.Paul's father Oliver has been recently widowed. The family, including three boys --- Paul, Damon and Tobey --- are struggling to keep their daily chores done. This includes cooking, housekeeping, attending to their father's farming duties and going to school. It's too much for all of them, so Oliver decides to advertise for a housekeeper. When a woman applies with the statement, \\"Can't cook but doesn't bite,\\" she is hired anyway, sight unseen. None of the Millirons quite believe that she can't cook.The widow Rose Llewellyn arrives in Montana with an unexpected guest: her brother, the well-educated but quirky Morris Morgan. Both Rose and Morris are hard workers. Rose knows how to clean a house through and through, and Morgan works at any job that Oliver can find him --- including cleaning out a chicken coop.For the boys, school life is never without its challenges. When Paul Milliron slugs the school bully, Eddie Turley, Damon comes up with a plan to prevent a fight. He suggests a horse race. The loser is to leave the other boy alone for the rest of the year. The only catch is that the riders will sit backwards on the horse. Paul wins the race and all is well, until their father finds out. As punishment, Paul will help Morris stack the wood piles for their elderly Aunt. During their work time together, Paul and Morris begin a relationship of mentor to student.When the schoolteacher runs off to get married to a traveling minister, Paul's father talks Morris into taking on the job. As Morris engages the class, the reader is engaged in the minds of the students, the Milliron home and life in rural Montana in the early 1900s. Morris also tutors Paul in Latin after school, which deepens their relationship. His teaching abilities are tested when the inspector comes to visit.A horse crushes Tobey's foot and Rose moves into the house to help Oliver take care of him. The closeness leads to romance between Rose and Paul's father, and Paul figures out the puzzle of why Rose and Morris left the midwest to journey to Montana.Ivan Doig evokes the sense of the Old West as few writers can. His depiction and description of Montana gives the reader the breadth and depth of life on the land a hundred years ago. The reader travels back to the early 1900s with Paul, as he revisits his past to choose what to do with Montana's last rural schools in the 1950s.--- Reviewed by Jennifer McCord"},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"Montana in the early 1900's is a generous setting for a stable of characters rich in flaws and idiosyncrasies.

My wife is reading The Whistling Season in hardcover a second time, so I figured it must be pretty good. So far it is a wonderful story but the Kindle edition has numerous typos (misspellings, extra sentences, etc.). I admit I'm a stickler for wanting to read a book that has been thoroughly and successfully proofread. If you are too, skip the Kindle edition and buy the book in hardcover or paperback. If this proves to be the norm for Kindle books I'll have to return to real books and give up reading in bed. Support your local bookseller or library.

Obviously, the editor did not actually read the words on the pages to see that the correct words were used to be appropriate for the meaning and grammar! How else does this happen? Sloppy!"},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"This is my first book by Ivan Doig but it will not be my last. This novel, set in remote Montana in 1910, is told from the viewpoint of Paul, a 13-year-old boy - the oldest of 3 boys whose mother has recently died. The father is hopeless as a housekeeper, so he responds to an ad in the newspaper ad placed by a widow in Minnesota looking for a position. After some negotiations over money, she arrives with her over-the-top brother but must immediately borrow money for his unpaid train fare - you get the picture. These two -- quite unlike anyone else in Marias Coulee, Montana -- quickly became a major part of the life of this family. How and why did they -- dressed in silk and tweed -- end up in this rugged, homespun place, content to do work that seems beneath them?Although I loved the historic Montana setting of this book -- reading what seemed like an accurate depiction of life on a farm at that time -- I also thought the well-developed characters were a strength of this story. It's been a while since I've encountered such interesting and three-dimensional characters -- all of them. But I found the children in this story quite believable, and children are notoriously difficult for novelists to get right. They are pitch perfect.If I have any complaints, it's in occasional lyrical excessives -- sentences that go on for too long and require three readings to comprehend. I also found the device of the now-grown Paul -- who is the Superintendent of Schools for this district -- unnecessary but not all that intrusive.Over all, a wonderful read about wise but very human (flawed) people."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"If you are nostalgic for Montana, ranches and one room schools, this is your book.

The lives of the Montana homesteaders and their families come to vivid life within the pages, allowing this reader to lose herself in the beauty of Doig's descriptions. The language Doig uses is artistic, exquisitely illustrating a way of life lost to us many years ago.There are so many great things about The Whistling Season that I could quite literally write pages about it! The characters in are phenomenally well-formed. From Rose and her brother Morrie, to Oliver and his boys, to the schoolyard bullies they encounter, Doig has created realistic and complex characters, leaving the reader wanting more. The setting constructed in The Whistling Season is wonderfully atmospheric and the detail the novel contains is simply breathtaking.Ivan Doig's The Whistling Season is everything a good story should be - interesting and entertaining, with realistic characters and a strong sense of setting.

We all really liked it, but most of us felt dissatisfied, one way or another, with the ending. That made for a really interesting evening's chat.Most of us found the book a little slow to start with. The voice is very authentic, but takes some getting used to. But it's worth persevering, we agreed. Soon you're absorbed in a not-so-distant world, watching an everyday life that you more-than-half regret missing. Everything is told from the view-point of a young teenaged boy--details skipped that you might have wished told--details added that surprise and intrigue. And there's a cleverness in the way the tale is put together that rewards deeper thought afterwards. Why doesn't Rose cook? Why does she whistle? How do different pairs of siblings compare? And whose decisions in the end are more similar than different?But, as I said, we weren't at all sure about the end. We speculated at what might be missing, which questions unanswered perhaps, and came to no conclusion. Maybe that's what the author intended of us, because life leaves us wondering too.I felt like I'd spent a year in the country when I'd finished. It was a pleasant time though the living wasn't easy. I learned something, and I'm left questioning--what have we gained? What have we lost?

At first I thought it was going a little slow, but it didn't take long before I was really hooked. My sister had recorded this book on my Ipod for me, but only got the first half.

She arrives on the train, unexpectedly bringing along her brother, Morris Morgan, who is later hired to teach in the one-room school.

I miss them already. I loved Toby, with his sweet innocence and optimism; mischievous and resourceful Damon; scholarly Paul and his obsession with Latin; and the industrious, kindhearted Rose. My favorite character may just be Rose's brother Morris. At first he comes across as a bit of a dandy and a bumbler, but turns out to be a formidable teacher who can rise to any challenge. His scholarly manner of speaking just tickled me no end. And then of course, there's the father Oliver. He's the one solid, stable figure in the story, keeping it together for his three motherless boys.The Whistling Season is a love story in every way. It's about love of family, love of learning, love of nature and the changing seasons, and especially, love of good old-fashioned humor."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"Disclaimer: I am a huge fan of Ivan Doig's writing and probably couldn't give him a bad review if he deserved one. But that's okay, because he doesn't deserve a bad review.The Whistling Season is one of my favorite of Doig's novels. Set in rural Marias Coulee, Montana, the novel takes us into the lives of the Milliron family, recently bereft of wife and mother. Seen through the eyes of eldest son Paul, the book chronicles the eventful winter of 1909-10. Paul's father, in need of a solution to a lack of culinary skills among the four males now living together without any women, responds to a \\"work wanted\\" ad headed \\"Can't cook but doesn't bite\\".In due time, Rose Llewellyn, widow, arrives with her brother, Morris Morgan. Despite Mr. Milliron's confidence that every woman can cook, Rose has been completely honest. She does everything but the one thing they thought they most needed. Somehow, that doesn't prevent them from keeping her on, and it seems good cooking may not have been what they needed most. Over the course of the winter, a great deal, or nothing at all, happens in Marias Coulee. When the school teacher decamps in the middle of the fall term, Morris Morgan--Morrie--takes over, and the change in the school is as great, and as positive, as the change Rose has wrought on the Milliron home. Through it all, Paul is struggling to grow up and figure out his own place. Part of growing up is learning when to speak up and when to keep your mouth shut. Paul generally makes a good guess.Doig spins his story in a deceptively simple prose where every word is well-chosen, and every turn of phrase crafted. And if you could argue that the ending is, in a way, predictable, there is plenty in it that you or I would not have thought of if we'd thought all year. I give Doig and The Whistling Season five stars and two thumbs up, and I will recommend his books to anyone who loves good language, and a story well-told."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"I read 2-3 books a week and I am frequently disappointed. I went to a one room school so I decided to give The Whistling Season a try. I was afraid that the book might either be boring or cutesy. WOW, was I wrong! Ivan Doig is a masterful writer and captured the essence of the era in a thoroughly entertaining way. There is dry humor, a heartwarming story, a bit of intrigue and even some Latin lessons as a bonus. I help find books for our book club and we enthusiastically chose this one. I am anxious to read the \\"sequel\\", Work Song."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"This was a book club choice to read and I must say that only 3 of 13 of us even finished the book. The era isn't one of particular interest to me, however I hung strong until the very end anxiously WAITING for the climax of the novel. The twist didn't come until almost the very end of the book.

The whole story is fascinating in a very simple way that drew me in and carried me to the end, and left me wishing that there would be a follow up book waiting for me about the same characters. I have recommended it it to every teacher that I know, and although I've had no feedback from them, I feel confident that they probably loved it as well.After finishing the book I was searching the net about the \\"Two Medicine\\" country in Montana, and found a site with an 8TH grade graduation test from Salina ,Kansas from the 1890's as I recall. That was an eye opener.But read this book.

Living with his father and 2 younger brothers on the plains of Montana in 1909, the motherless family knows hardship and good times in equal measure.When Paul's father takes it upon himself to hire a housekeep from Minneapolis, Paul and his younger brothers are in for the treat of their life when Rose Llewellyn and her brother Morrie Morgan show up on their front steps.Gradually the relationship between Mr. Milliron and Rose grows to be something more and the boys begin to see her and Morrie as irreplaceable parts of their lives. Morrie and Rose are harboring a secret however, one that could either break, or make the family.I had mixed reactions to \\"The Whistling Season.\\" Overall I liked it. The writing is superb and descriptive and the characters are people I can relate to and want to know more about. On the flip side, there really was no solid plotline. Yes, there was a growing relationship between the characters and minor happenings that will happen in 1909 Montana, but besides that it was like an ongoing episode of \\"The Waltons.\\"That's really all I have to say about it. It was good, I liked it. Would I read a sequel? ...meh. Maybe, if I couldn't find anything more interesting to pick up.I give \\"The Whistling Season\\" 4 stars for the quality of writing and the characters, 3 for the overall plotline. Overall it was unremarkable through a haze of slightly peaked interest."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"This is an awesome story and the writing is absolutely amazing. I originally borrowed the book from a friend, and when I finished reading it, I actually went back to the beginning to read it through again. It was just as enjoyable the second time through. And then, just to make sure, I bought a copy of the book from Amazon. This book is definitely a \\"keeper\\". I loved it and have recommended it to several friends already, and, who knows, I may be reading it again soon! I also went back to Amazon and bought other books by the same author!"},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"What a wonderful book. Doig knows his subject and characters so well that one feels as if it has to be an autobiography, which it isn't.The writing itself is also excellent. I highly recommend this book, set in the days of the Montana one room schoolhouse. This intelligent novel,the endearing Milliron family of Motherless boys,and the indefatigable school teacher, Morrie, all come together to make this a book you hate to see come to an end."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"Ivan Doig must be the Midwest's answer to Stegner...well written, engaging, great characters that reveal just enough (unlike our People Mag oriented society). One of those books I am so glad to have read and will recommend.

This story is told from the perspective of Paul, the eldest and most intellectually gifted son of a recently widowed dry-farmer in Montana. Paul is fortunate to have a father who is well-read and supports the life of the mind. Unfortunately Paul is haunted by dreams and nightmares that leave him perpetually exhausted.Paul's father, Oliver, and his two brothers are devasted by the death of Paul's mother and struggle to keep the household together with the loss of the essential skills of the homemaker. Hiring a housekeeper, Rose, brings not only cleanliness and harmony to the home, but a new schoolteacher to the community. The school teacher is Rose's brother, Morris. Morris' love of learning and theatrical style inspire the children in the tiny schoolhouse. Ultimately the story turns on how these newcomers fit into and transform this little community.The strengths of this novel are in its vivid portrayal of prairie life, elegant language and poignant plot. Definitely a novel that leaves me wanting to read more of this author!"},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"This novel is about a motherless family of three boys and a widower in a very small Montana town in 1910. A housekeeper is hired and her brother tags along from Minneapolis to the frontier. There the story begins.The best way to describe the book may be to tell what it is not. It is not hokey or a father falling-in-love chic romance. Although the narrator is a teenage boy, it is not a coming of age novel. Although there is shadowing of mystery from the beginning, it is not mystery.So what is it? It is an ode to the single room school house and education. It is a frank telling of a family's year on the Montana frontier. There are relationships explored between the boy and his family, the teacher, the housekeeper and his school mates - friend and foe.Paul, the narrator, has to face adversity (beyond the death of his mother) in several different ways while maintaining his place in his small and insular world. His most difficult task, however, is to decide what to do with a secret he learns.The writing is terrific, although the book got off to a slow start. After the first 70 pages, which seemed choppy, I was worried I had picked a dud. From there on the book was captivating. Paul, and almost all of the characters, were extremely likeable with all their foibles and weaknesses exposed. The one pure \\"bad\\" guy was tangential and truly wicked.This is a great read once it started to get going. Both the story(ies) and the characters (especially Morrie, the reluctant teacher) will stay with the reader. It is entertaining and thought-provoking. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"\\"Whistling Season\\" by Ivan Doig is a deeply affecting coming-of-age novel set in the dry Montana prairie of 1910. The story is told through the memories of Paul Milliron looking back to one important year in his childhood, when he was 13. The book begins in 1950 when Paul, now Montana State Superintendent of Public Instruction, travels to his hometown of Marias Coulee with the unpleasant task of closing its one and only one-room schoolhouse. He gazes up at the night sky watching Sputnik blink across the stars and knows that a new era has arrived. He is heartbroken because this new era will wipe out all that has come before. There will be no going back.Doig knows this territory well--it is his own ancestral roots. He has researched it thoroughly and published other successful fiction and nonfiction books set in this period and place. While reading this book, I felt transported back in time--the landscape, the people, the very dust that covered everything--came alive on the page. So do the characters--the singular, bizarre, and clarion-clear characters of the Old West--Doig is, indeed, a master at creating wonderfully authentic people that you really care about.The story is poignant. Young Paul and his two younger brothers are experiencing the first year of grief following the death of their mother. Oliver Milliron, their father, is understandably overwhelmed with the task of being father, mother, and homesteader. Through the distant Minneapolis newspaper, he sees an ad by a housekeeper. In this manner, the ever-whistling, beautiful Rose Llewellyn comes into their life. She arrives unexpectedly with her brother, Morris Morgan, an eccentric, walking encyclopedia. Events unfold that push Morris toward becoming the town's schoolmaster. Although he has never done anything like that before, teaching seems a task that he was born to. His students flourish under his idiosyncratic and outrageous style. But Rose and Morris hold a secret that Paul eventually uncovers. How he handles that situation delineates young Paul's crossover from child to adult.The novel is in every way, a loving lament about the passing of uniquely American way of life--the rough, yet magical and free life of Western Montana dry-land farming homesteaders."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"The Whistling Season by Ivan Doig is a beautiful novel, with rich and delicious prose, and characters that are detailed, complex and fully developed. I dreaded reaching the final page, wanting to spend more time with Paul Milliron, his family, Rose, Morris, and the community.Paul Milliron is the Montana state superintendent of schools in the 1950s. It is his job to determine the fate of the few rural schools that are still in use. As he returns to his home, he reminisces about the year 1909, when he was thirteen and attended a one-room school in Marias Coulee.In 1909 Paul's father, recently widowed and caring for his three sons, hires a housekeeper from Minnesota. The housekeeper's ad in the Westwater Gazette read, Can't Cook But Doesn't Bite.The housekeeper, Rose Llewellyn, arrives in Montana with her brother, Morris. She's already received several months advance on her salary and immediately begins to organize the Milliron's home and quietly insert herself in their lives. But as she said in her ad, she doesn't cook.When the local schoolteacher leaves to marry an evangelist, Morris accepts, for the rest of the school year, her job. His arrival impacts the Milliron children and their schoolmate's education in ways no one expected.I expected Rose to be the focal point of the novel, but in many ways, Morris' personality took center stage. His relationship with Paul continually broadened the young man's life and education. There are several interesting twists and turns that were unexpected and contributed to the charm of Doig's novel.Armchair Interviews says: The Whistling Season is a wonderful and satisfying read."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"This is my first Ivan Doig novel, and I wasn't disappointed. The author delivers with uncluttered, straightforward diction the story of a widower and his three sons living at the turn of 1909-10 in eastern Montana. They answer an ad for a housekeeper (Rose) from Minnesota and get more than they bargained for (in many ways, as the denouement will reveal) when Rose's brother, Morrie, steps off the train with her.\\"The Whistling Season\\" suffers only two profanities in its 345-page narrative and is truly family fare in its poignant re-creation of the one-room schoolhouse culture of so many western yesteryears. Although the protagonist is the adult eldest son, Paul Milliron, looking back on his eventful 13th year, it is Morrie Morgan, destined to become the emergency teacher, who steals the show characterization-wise. Morrie makes the book especially appealing to readers who like to read about gifted teachers, schools, and learning -- specifically Morrie's specialties: science, Latin, and subterfuge. Though the plot is as steady and uneventful as Montana's gunmetal skies, the ending does feature a twist (for any O. Henry fans in the crowd). Also of note is Doig's care with description of the land. The landscapes he fondly paints, obviously informed by experience, are a strong competition for Morrie as they become like ghostly characters forged from the anvil of the author's -- and by extension, the narrator's -- memory.All in all, \\"The Whistling Season\\" is a good, solid book about good, solid people, some of whom are burdened by a secret."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"With the passing some years ago of Wallace Stegner, Ivan Doig is probably the writer who now most personifies the West. English Creek, Dancing at the Rascal Fair, and Ride with me Mariah Montana are among my favorites. It was with great enthusiasm that I began to read his latest, The Whistling Season. It was for that reason, perhaps, that I was initially disappointed. It had the tone of a juvenile book, at first. There's nothing wrong with that--I write juvenile fiction myself. But this seemed just a note off from where it belonged.True, the book is about a juvenile, through his reminiscence 50 years hence. There was something that did not ring true. I don't know if I got over it, or if the book improved. More likely I was picking something up in the audio narration that wasn't just right.Ultimately, the book is not a disappointment, though not his best work. Early on you could see the happy ending rolling toward you like a train in the distance: recently widowed farmer with three boys sends for a housekeeper on the basis of a cryptic ad. Surprise, surprise, she's quite good looking. The real surprise is that she brings her brother with her. He turns out to be much more than we expect, and in many ways is the center of the book.Much of the novel takes place in a one-room Montana schoolhouse, beginning in 1909. There are several sub-plots that provide the action. The real story is about the kind of education one could get in that kind of setting. A couple of years ago I was privileged to have the opportunity to edit the history of a similar school in Idaho. That kind of grade-spanning education, all but lost today, had much to recommend it.There is some entertaining wordplay throughout the novel. We come dangerously close to learning a little Latin. In the end, the entire book turns on the definition of a word. A bold step that a lesser writer might not have pulled off. Doig does it with ease."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"The problem with reading Ivan Doig is that I can read his books faster than he can write them. I never want the book to end because I know that my trip to the bookstore will be a let down as I decide what to read next. I've read all the other authors that are described as Doig-like: Haruf, Enger, Proulx, West, and a few others. They're all good authors in their own right, but they are not Ivan Doig. I'll admit that I'm a bit biased given the fact that I was born in Montana and have spent many vacations in my last 48 years breathing the pure air of Big Sky country. That emotional connection notwithstanding, Doig is a masterful author. His prose is meaty and strong; his phrasing is creative and memorable (though not 'cute'), and his characters are well-developed, believable, and for the most part, endearing. Particularly enjoyable characters in the book are narrator, Paul; teacher Morrie; and the lovely housekeeper, Rose.This book is so well crafted that once finished I went back and read several passages at length that were brick work (unbeknown at the time) that eventually shaped the book into being more than merely a 'good read,' but real literature.This is a keeper. You really can't go wrong with it. I don't know if Doig would ever allow his books to be movies, but the right director would have a smash hit motion picture with this book. It is the one book of his (I believe) that would really lend itself to a great film.Happy reading."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"It's 1957, and Paul Milliron, Montana's Superintendent of Schools, finds himself forced by the legislature to close the state's remaining one-room schools. On the way to perform his task, Paul takes a trip back to 1909, when he attended a rural, one-room school like the ones he must now close, and he relives a school year that shaped his life. We get to know his family, consisting of his widower father and his two younger brothers, plus an eclectic array of classmates, all brought to life by the author's masterful descriptions. When Paul's father hires a housekeeper from a newspaper ad, she comes with a surprise, and the action really begins.Sure, some of the events are pretty predictable, but all are delightfully so. Doig wraps it up with some deft twists to the predictable, however, as Paul shows a somewhat different side of his character in dealing with the dilemmas of both the past and present.The reader is left wanting to know more about what happened to Paul's brothers and classmates. But Doig does not clutter the story with that information, leaving it for our imaginations--or perhaps another trilogy as good as his English Creek, Dancing at the Rascal Fair and Ride with Me, Mariah Montana series.Wonderful reading and inspirational as well."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"This is the fourth Doig book I've read and I never fail to be impressed. As a long-time teacher I've read hundreds of books that sometimes blur together, but I can absolutely remember every one of Doig's. Like Wallace Stegner, Doig has a way of evoking a time and place (the West) that is accurate while being truly lyrical and memorable. What I like about Doig is that you can \\"see\\" it all just so clearly. If you have an interest in life for some at the turn of the century, this book is for you. If you ever wondered about rural education and how the teacher coped, this book is for you. If you like hisorical fiction that is one hundered percent accurate while telling a good story, this book is for you. Ultimately, if you like quality writing that is worth reading in and of itself, this is time well spent. You will find yourself wanting to read other Doig novels. Like me, I know you will find them truly satisfying."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"I was fortunate to see Ivan Doig at a book reading for Whistling Season. Certainly he draws upon his real life experience at a one room school and with a father widowed with young children. However, I think that in this new book, he goes beyond his real life experience (at least as described in his biographies, House of Sky and Heart Earth) to create a fictional environment. This new tack is, in my opinion, a good one, and I found this a very enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"One of the best \\"coming-of-age\\" stories I've ever read.Truly touching....you feel for these characters and come to knowthem, AND there is a bit of a mystery and secrets to be discovered within, whichDoig hints at and reveals perfectly!

The characters are wonderfully robust, even the minor ones so that you get a feel for the entire town. This is the first Doig I have read and now have to read others. It was a book I picked up on the \\"bargain\\" table at Borders and so glad I did. He writes in a lovely prose with actual literary style-more than a trashy summer novel, but less than say Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. I loved every bit of this book. One of the nicest ones I have read! I really don't understand the criticism of this book. No, it's not fast, does every book have to be slam dunk, rising plot and WHAM the ending? This builds nicely and the ending made me want the sequel. Enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"I picked up the novel, \\"The Whistling Season\\" by Ivan Doig, at the suggestion of my wife and enjoyed it thoroughly. It is a coming-of-age story told with great charm, taking the reader back to the fall of 1909 in remote Montana. There, Doig introduces the motherless Milliron family, Oliver, the father, and three school-age boys, Paul, the oldest and the story's narrator, Damon, a sports-news scrapbooker, and Toby, a perfectly loveable naf, all of whom receive their schooling in a small one-room schoolhouse.Complications begin almost immediately, when, in answer to their ad for a housekeeper, Rose Llewellyn appears accompanied by her erudite brother, Morris Morgan. Oliver is a very busy man, operating a drayage business for the construction of The Big Ditch, an irrigation project, the chairman of the school board, father, cook, and provider for his three boys, and a \\"dryland\\" farmer, tending both his own homestead and that of the boys' Aunt Eunice.Doig keeps a clear focus on these chief characters, but by the book's end, the reader has met a host of engaging characters, Eddie Turley, the school bully and his fearsome father, Brose Turley, who earns his livelihood killing and skinning wolves, the other boys and girls of the one-room schoolhouse, and the dreaded school inspector, Harry Taggart.Early on, Morris Morgan is appointed to replace Miss Trent, the schoolmarm, who has eloped with Brother Jubal, a traveling evangelist, and much of the story revolves around Morris Morgan's teaching at the schoolhouse and the arrival of Halley's Comet, that once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon, the visiting star trailing its glistening tail.All in all, \\"The Whistling Season\\" is a wonderful story of American prairie life peopled by well-drawn, loveable characters, with sufficient intrigue, mystery, and surprise to keep the reader eagerly turning the page until the perfectly worked out conclusion, a splendid book in every way, showing Ivan Doig to be a master of his craft."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"Our PAGES (Prose-Adoring Girls' Enlightenment Society) Reading Group read and discussed The Whistling Season by Ivan Doig.

We rate this book 4.5 stars.A couple of things that may not have come out in the published discussion questions and elsewhere in these reviews:Did you notice the possible similarities in the two brothers, Paul and Damon, and in Morrie and Casper?Also, we all felt rather melancholy at the end of this book about the loss of that way of life and the one-room school education. In searching the internet we found that, at the time of the setting of this book, there were about 250,000 one-room schools in the United States. Today, there are fewer than 400.

The reviewer who drew that connection to Harper Lee, I gotta hand it to you, not withstanding the racial conflict in her book I can see the similarities.

The family of 3 young boys and a father with the mother dead is a family under considerable stress as they try to make do following mother's death.

Although one of the primary characters is a teenage boy, it isn't really a coming of age story. However, that character is presented with a choice to make that is tough for one of his years. This is a story of a rural Montana community, particularly the type that is developed in a one-room school in 1909. The story is told in a gentle, and sometimes humorously insightful style. It definitely isn't a plot driven story. However, I enjoyed the characters, and the glimpse into a bygone era.

Told from the point of view of a 13 year old . . . which surprisingly also fast-forwards to him in the 1950's . . . is a joy to read. Descriptive writing at its best.Unfortunately, the Kindle version has many (perhaps 50 or more) \\"typos\\" which tend to distract from the flow of the story. It appears as if the book was scanned and words came out wrong . . . ie. trading cloud for \\"trailing\\", threads of fight for \\"light\\", setting hall sale into life for \\"full\\", fifing to the front of the room for \\"filing\\" (That one really made me smile, seeing children tootling their fifes as they marched to the front of the classroom!) Even Rose's name was Kose at one point.This was my first Ivan Doig, but won't be my last.

What a wonderful experience those children had with that talented teacher! One-room schools were a blessing."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"I chose this novel because Amazon suggested it to me and because of its high rating by readers. I had never heard of this author. I now consider him one of our best contemporary writers. I think of him as a kind of Mark Twain of the prairie. His characters are well developed and his descriptions are often pure poetry. The humor is subtle and not to be missed. Finally, this author, unlike so many others , knows how long to string out his plot and how to bring the story to a conclusion. Everyone in my book club enjoyed this book, and you will, too."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"In The Whistling Season Ivan Doig writes about life as we've heard it described before electronics clenched our throats and made us their captive. The story is beautifully told with wonderful characters clawing their way through life on the homestead and education in a one-room school in 1910 in hardscrabble Montana. The characters resonate with finding their place in a family and community. One emerges as state education official charged with determining the future of schools such as his. But I think it was the ending [not really conclusion] that struck me as so delightful. I'll be thinking of this book and these characters for a long time to come."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"This is a reread for me and a gift for my granddaughter. This author has such a command of language and discriptive powers that makes it such a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"It took a little while to get into the story. Time frame and characters seemed a little fuzzy at first. Once it got to the school system and later that the narrator had become in later life a school administrator things were more clear. The characters were very interesting once into the story! You don't know where \\"The Whistling Season\\" comes from until near the end of the book."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"I am almost finished with this book. I recommend reading any book by Ivan Doig. Especially if you live in Montana. I received this book on time and in great condition!! Thanks so much!"},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"Whistling Season has been on my \\"to read\\" stand for many years. Gratefully, retirement has created time to read these \\"tucked away\\" treasures. For me the book was a little slow at the beginning, but once I reached the section on the one room school house, I was \\"hooked\\". This is a eulogy of sorts for education as much as for early dry farming pioneers. Underpining the entire book, is a father's love for his children and his lifestyle. The relationships were real, and the ending masterfully crafted. This is a book that you want to discuss with others. I savored it for the author's style and ability to craft language as well as a story with human kindness as well as human fraility. This is a book that I highly recommend. There aren't many books that I read that I would rate a 5. I have ordered the sequel as well as well as This House of Sky. Obviously, I enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"Ivan Doig has always been one of my favorite authors, but I don't know what happened here. A short story perhaps, but the lack of narrative drive did not sustain any interest for me. The evocative, pastoral settings of time and place were sweet but not enough to bolster an incredibly threadbare plot. Certainly not one of his finest."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"There's a lot to like about THE WHISTLING SEASON. It's set in 1910 Montana; there's a one-room schoolhouse; there are three likable kids and their mostly immigrant classmates; there's a housekeeper from Minneapolis who, along with her brother, arrives when the boys' father answers her ad in the newspaper, and there's Halley's comment.Despite all of this, I had a hard time getting into the book. For one thing, Doig switches from the thirteen-year-old narrator, Paul Milliron, to Paul as a grown-up forty-some years later. He has now morphed into the superintendent of schools who must decide the fate of the one-room schoolhouse in Montana. His diction is stilted to say the least. The second problem with the book is its seeming episodic nature. There's a bully who must be dealt with. A horse steps on the youngest boy's foot; the bully's father threatens the housekeeper's brother who becomes the teacher of the one-room schoolhouse after the former teacher runs off with a preacher; an inspector of schools shows up to decide the fate of the boys' school; Paul takes Latin after school. None of this seems to be going anyplace. But then, towards the end, Doig pulls a rabbit out of his hat and everything begins to make a bit more sense. The climax is definitely the best part of the book.The teacher, Morris Morgan, is definitely the most interesting character. He seems to intuit that the bully needs glasses; he latches on to the teachable moment when Halley's Comet passes overhead; he's willing to devote his free time to help Paul realize his full potential. But then there's the matter of the brass knuckles that materialize when the bully's father confronts Morgan. At first, I thought this was awfully convenient, but really all Doig is doing is \\"planting\\" a prop that he will use later.The ending seems awfully rushed as well and a bit unbelievable considering the superintendent's decision and the fate of Morris Morgan and his sister. I would also have liked to have known what became of some of Paul Milliron's classmates."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"I thought this was a wonderful story and when I described the plot to my friend she said she saw the movie and was able to tell me all about the characters.

There is one rough character who makes for a few tense scenes, one at knife point..."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"What an excellent book -- one of the best books I have read. Ivan Doig has a style of writing that is so vivid, so descriptive, you can feel, taste, and smell exactly what he's describing. For example, he's speaks of a clear October day, \\"but the wind was practicing for winter.\\" You could feel the chill. The characters were rich and unpredictable - each one described with such care that you feel you know them and care deeply about what happens to them. No one character in the novel was inconsequential; each had a specific purpose necessary to embellish the plot. Phrases like, \\"even when it stands vacant the past is never empty,\\" stayed with me long after I turned the last page. The story was believable and poignant. It made me laugh and it made me cry. I'm usually one of those readers that skims sections when I think they are getting to \\"wordy\\" or unnecessary. With this book, I read every word, afraid I might miss another wonderfully described trait or action. I think one of my favorite quotes was, \\"Much of the work of my life has been to sort instruction from illusion, and, in the endless picture gallery behind the eye, I have learned to rely on a certain radiance of a detail to bring back the exactitude of a moment.\\" I can't wait to track down the other books by this wonderful Seattle author and can only hope that I enjoy them all as much as I enjoyed this one."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"Growing up in Nebraska, small country schoolhouses were still around untill recently. I thought the storytelling writing style of Ivan Doig was fantastic, and he paints a vivid picture of the time through the eyes of a young boy.

Just a nice read."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"Ivan Doig has written another captivating account of life on the homesteads of eastern Montana in the early 20th Century. This book is centered on one of the old one-room schoolhouses that were common in rural areas of the west through the first half of the last century. The book is a fascinating account of life in those days, with some surprising twists. A book to savor, but one that is very hard to put down. At least as good as his other early Montana stories."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"I won't go into the details of plot or character much, as others have done so admirably.I think I liked this novel in much the same way I like the movie \\"A Christmas Story\\" - it's nostalgic without being saccharine, without being maudlin, and without being mean-slash-smart-alecky. Its characters don't have anachronistic vocabularies or habits (a common fault in period fiction, I find) and their lives are ordinary in a believable, interesting way.I loved the Paul character the most, though Morrie was good too (anyone else keep picturing Dr Bombay from \\"Bewitched\\"?). I loved the setting -- more fiction should be written about the folks on the prairie. My family hails from prairie country and the little I have experienced while visiting grandparents always thrills me with its unique romance.Interesting note (well, interesting to me, anyway): During the spelling bee sequence, Morrie is trying to stump Paul, who is normally not permitted to participate in classroom bees due to his dominance. One of the words that Morrie wisely chooses to test Paul is \\"pharaoh\\" -- a tough word almost always misspelled -- but the author has made the ironic error of spelling it \\"pharoah\\" in the book. If the word were truly spelled that way, p-h-a-r-o-a-h, then it *wouldn't* be a good spelling bee word, as that's the way everyone misspells it. Anyway.Highly recommended to lovers of quiet, medium-weight American fiction."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"What a wonderful gentle, plainly-told tale this is to sit back in a comfortable chair and simply enjoy. The proverbial \\"slice of life\\" read, the focus on a loving but motherless home and a one-room Montana schoolhouse: \\". . .the trails in the grass that radiated in as many directions as there were homesteads with children, all converging to that schoolhouse spot where I stood. . .\\"I began reading Ivan Doig years ago, having gotten the only book available from a local book store. Others? I was told my best bet was to go to the Northwest. By coincidence, I was flying there in 2 days. Obviously, when I got there I bought everything and feasted for some time on Doig's stories. They are unmatched for beauty and warmth.If you by any chance are unfamiliar with Doig, I can only urge you to treat yourself to an excellent experience.There is one scene in Whistling Season where the protagonists watch a man on a steel-grey horse chase down a wolf. It is violent and repellent but so expertly written that one sees and feels the whole scene and is left open-mouthed. This is part of the West.And the West is beautifully described after one man says, while standing on a high bluff, \\"Extravagant scenery.\\" \\"Farther west, the tips of the Rockies were white with first snow, an iceberg flotilla that seemed to go on forever under the dark blue sky of late afternoon. All the hills in the world were stacked in shade of tan between there and where we stood. Almost at our feet, juniper patches pintoed down the breaks in the rimrock of the bluff, and lower still, wild roses blew gently in the wind.\\" Hard to beat that."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"This is a wonderful book about a vanished time.

I am now attempting to read any of Doig's books I can find."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"I recommended this book as a title for our church book club after reading a review in the local newspaper. The story appealed to me as it is about family life and attending a one room country school. It is a very gently written story with enough mystery to keep the reader involved. It is much more than the story of closing one room schools in Montana in the 1950's."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"Another intreging look at life in Montana and the struggles faced by a family left to themselves after the loss of the mother. What evolves is full of surprises and the characters come alive in the small farming community. I love Doigs writing and he is masterful in his weaving of a good story. I loved this book and would recommend."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"This is not a review of the book/story. It is a review of the Kindle (Fire) Edition. The Edition is riddled with typos, punctuation errors, garbled paragraphs, random capitalizations, and so forth. For example, the name of a major character turns from Rose into Kose; another from Toby into Tobe; and so forth. Amazon gets an A for the Kindle concept; an F for execution and quality control."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"This is an outstanding example of Doig's ability to create characters that the reader can identify with and cheer on to succeed. It has a happy, but very plausible ending. Several narratives are cleanly interwoven and enhance the reader's enjoyment. It provides a foundation for the sequel, \\"Work Song\\", which I found enjoyable as well."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"Since there are so many reviews, I am going to make mine short. But I must say that the one-star review claiming this to be a trifle is so off base. This is one of the most beautiful novels I have read. And I am an avid read. It very clear to me that Mr. Doig has been influenced by Harper Lee. And in this case, Morrie Morgan, the teacher in the one-room school in rural Montana, is a very gifted, creative teacher who has never been trained. No \\"Dewey Decimal System\\" here (a reference to Miss Caroline in the Harper Lee classic). But there is also an Atticus here in Oliver, the father of the three sons. And, yes, touches of Jem and Scout, in the children who are just so wonderful portrayed, each so very different. Oh, yes, and a Mrs. Dubose character. And then there is Rose, the widow and sister of Morrie, who moves from Minnesota to be the housekeeper except she doesn't cook or bite!The novel is written from the point of view of the eldest son, Paul, who has become in later life the superintendent of schools. Again, a similarity with \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" with Scout narrating from the advantage of adulthood, looking back. I am so glad I read this novel before going on its sequel that I am now ready to launch into.This is one of those novels I simply did not want to end. Mr. Doig is a master of our language."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"An absorbing tale of young people growing up on the 19th century frontier.

Apparently the book was scanned and the scanner changed life to fife almost every time, along with many other respellings. I wish someone had checked the manuscript before sending it to my Kindle.

I felt like I was reading something of my own life when reading The Whistling Season, although I didn't grow up in Montana and did not attend a one-room school.

I could indeed picture the environment of the story (I happen to love Montana) and I rather enjoyed the characters. However, there's something too \\"goody-goody\\" about the scenario. It is set at an earlier time in the 20th century, yes, but read in today's world, it feels like a real stretch. So much so, that I was anxious to finish it toward the end.

I see he's quite a popular writer so I'll wind up just sounding like a curmudgeon. I'm just getting the hang of this reading club thing and find a lot of \\"mental popcorn\\" out there. Fair enough. I couldn't do it. But there is this nagging notion that a lot of literature has hung around over time because we're afraid to call it bad (the Bible?). I mean what's up with Leviticus?Back to the book: Goes along nicely, anecdotally, then Doig decides it's time to wrap the thing up and puts a frilly end on it. This is my last review.

At times I laughed out loud.Seeing Paul as both the state superintendent of schools and as a young student was so effective. Who would have thought that a bureaucrat's decision to close a small school would provide such a compelling concept for a novel. The effect of Haley's Comet on the school provides a perfect parallel for the effect of Sputnik many years later.The writing is clear, direct, and meaningful-- just like the characters.

The whistling season is one such book. When I read this novel I truly got the feeling that I was living at the beginning of the 20th century.That said, this storytelling method the author used (first person with flashbacks) is perhaps my least favorite method to read. The omniscient view irked this reader as I really felt the brief glimpses of the present were uninteresting and unnecessary to the story flow. If the author truly felt the need to include such musings, why not write an epilogue?Also, I thought the story suffered from a bit of heavy handedness in the form of Morrie and Rose characters. From the moment Rose arrived with her dubious brother Morrie in tow I was suspicious. These two characters soon dominated the story much to my chagrin. If the author truly felt the need to write about Morrie and Rose, why not make them the protagonist? In truth, Rose wasn't really that interesting but Morrie was clearly the star of the show. I alternated between loving the character and being annoyed he was taking so much of the spotlight.Overall, this was a fine solid read, but I didn\`t care for the ending which seemed rushed and forced. 4 stars."},{"Title":"Whistling Season, a Novel","review":"The Whistling Season by Ivan Doig is an engaging story of rural life in 1909 Montana. Oliver Milliron has recently lost his wife and needing a housekeeper for his three boys, is intrigued by a newspaper advertisement \\"Can't Cook But Doesn't Bite\\" for a housekeeper from Minneapolis. Soon Rose Llewelyn arrives with her brother Morris Morgan. Rose lives up to her word about cooking, but soon fills the house with her cheerful whistling as she cleans up the Milliron's lives. Morgan, in the meantime, takes on the job of schoolteacher when the latest teacher runs off with an itinerant preacher. The story is told from the perspective of 13-year-old Paul who is haunted by terrible dreams and an amazing intellect. There is no great climax or action in this book, it's just a quiet enjoyable read about a community, its one room school, and the people who are trying to make a living off of land that doesn't want to give an inch.

Doig has once again delivered a dazzling read, and proven himself the king of Contemporary Western literature.As Montana Superintendent of Schools during the 1950s, Paul Milleron faces the difficult decision of closing the state's rural schools. \\"The Whistling Season\\" takes Milleron back to his extraordinary seventh grade year at Marias Coulee, a single-room school in eastern Montana. Paul, his two younger brothers, and their father Oliver, are still raw from the loss of their mother and wife. Domestic life is nearly unbearable as they practice \\"downkeep\\" instead of \\"upkeep\\", and Oliver's cooking is a significant source of depression. So when Oliver discovers an advertisement for a housekeeper titled \\"Can't cook, but doesn't bite\\", how can they not hire the woman?The lovely Rose Lewellen, however, hardly arrives from Minneapolis alone. She brings her brother, Morrie Morgan, a man of letters with a sketchy past. Through a twist of fate not uncommon for prairie schools (matrimony), Morrie is pressed into service as the new school master. Milleron's memory of the 1909-10 school year and the wonders it brought (Halley's comet for one) force him to question how closing these schools could possibly serve its students. An education of quality can sometimes be found in unlikely places.Doig has always been my favorite author. I savor his every word. Of grave markers, he says, \\"The patience of stones.

Like many authors of the era, Anderson injected a great deal of dry wit into his SF, while still maintaining (at the time) futuristic lingo.'The Makeshift Rocket', one \\"side\\" of the book, is a short (97 pages) and silly tale of the false quarantine of the ship 'Mercury Girl' on the planetoid Grendel, which has been overtaken by members of the Irish revolutionary Shamrock Expeditionaries.It's up to 'Mercury Girl' engineer, Knud Axel Syrup, to find a way off Grendel. With the help of alien Sarmishkidu Von Himmelschnidt, who wears six-legged lederhosen, and flighty female dancer Emily Croft, Knud manages to build the first beer-powered spaceship to escape Grendel. While the tale was entertaining, I found the language (a heavily accented Dane/Germanic dialogue) to become tiresome and at times difficult to read.'Un-Man', the second, \\"flipside\\" of this duel-book, is about a brotherhood of special secret-agents for the now globally influential U.N. The world is close to accepting a new world-government, but the opposition is brutally against the U.N. and will stop at nothing to maintain their cliques of dictatorial enclaves and corporate power. The brotherhood, a collective of men physically identical down to the most minute facial expressions, must put an end to the war-driven opposition. The story follows Brother Robert Naysmith as he rescues Brother Martin Donner's family and then sets out to rescue the world.There are also two short stories included, 'Margin Of Profit', an extremely fun story following the escapades of one Freeman Nicholas van Rijn, an irascible and cursing Merchant of extraordinary vision as he fights to secure a trade route away from the brutal interference of the Kossaluth of Borthu. The second short, 'The Live Coward', follows Wing Alak in his chase after war fugitive Samuel Varris to a planet called Ryfin's Planet, where the King of Thunsba rules over a barbarian society of medieval scope. Alak must find a way to release Varris from the service of Thunsba in order to return him to justice ... without starting an intergalactic war by violating the strict rules of Thunsba's autocracy.Like many of the older SciFi books, you'll find pieces of these tales somewhat dated, but also like the great SciFi that it is, the tales themselves remain timeless. This is an excellent book to pick up if you like the old-style, humor-infused \\"hard\\" SciFi. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Makeshift Rocket / Un-Man and Other Novellas (Ace Double F-139)","review":"Occasionally, the Ace Double Books would publish two books by the same author-- John Brunner, Andre Norton, Gordon R. Dickson, Poul Anderson, Fritz Leiber, Leigh Brackett, Robert Silverberg, or Jack Vance. The astute science fiction fan knew that single author Ace Doubles were likely to be good ones. (Of course, there were exceptions; the reader would be wise to avoid Ace Doubles by Robert Moore Williams.)_The Makeshift Rocket_ by Poul Anderson and _Un-Man and Other Novellas_ by Poul Anderson (1962) is a single author Ace Double book, and a good one. All of the stories were originally published in _Astounding_ between 1953 and 1958, and were therefore edited by John W. Campbell, Jr. All are solidly crafted pieces in which Anderson seems to be having fun._The Makeshift Rocket_ was serialized in 1958 as \\"A Bicycle Built for Brew\\". It plays with our conventional notions of what spaceships are like. A band of slightly nutty Irish revolutionaries have taken over a terraformed English planetoid named Grendel and are keeping the crew of a spaceship prisoners there. The crew must leave the planetoid right away. I won't say exactly why, but I will hint that it has something to do with bulls and China shops. So the elderly Danish engineer, Knud Axel Syrup, hatches a plot to build a spaceship out of boxes, barrels, bicycle parts, and gunk-- and powered by beer. Anderson being Anderson, he is scrupulous about his scientific details. There may be some engineers out there who can quibble over how well the rocket would really work, but Anderson made me believe in it completely._The Makeshift Rocket_ invites comparison with a couple of other _Astounding_ serials from the late fifties-- Murray Leinster's _The Pirates of Zan_ (1959) and Mark Phillips' _Brain Twister_ (1962). All are light comedies, with outrageous but logical plots, intended to make us laugh. They are reminders that stories intended simply to entertain should not be derided.Technically, the subtitle of the second book should read \\"and two short novelettes\\" rather than \\"other novellas\\". But in any event, all three stories are fairly well done. \\"Un-Man\\" is a novella about an agency of secret agents for the United Nations, which is the last bastion against the forces of terrorism. (Terrorists probably seem a bit more relevant today than they did to many readers back in the fifties.) The nominal hero is an agent who is killed off by the villains early in the novel. But after his death, another man who looks like him seems to be taking his place. Has he been resurrected? Or is this somebody else? \\"Margin of Profit\\" is a snappy Nick van Rjin story in which the wily old trader uses statistics to outwit a planet of space pirates. It's a gimmick story, to be sure, but it is still nicely done. The final story is called \\"The Live Coward\\". It, too, has a gimmick; but it is not, for me, a credible one. It relies too much on members of a medieval culture being overly bound by laws.My individual ratings are: _The Makeshift Rocket_, four stars; _Un-Man and Other Novellas_, three stars. There are no cover credits given, but the cover for _The Makeshift Rocket_ is almost certainly by Ed Emshwiller, and the cover for _Un-Man_ seems to be in the style of Ed Valigursky."},{"Title":"Intangibles: Management, Measurement, and Reporting","review":"There is no larger controversy in accounting or investment circles today than the treatment of intangible assets. Economists and investment analysts may debate what is new about the \\"New Economy\\", but one thing remains clear, intangible assets are assuming a critical role in the creation of wealth.Non-physical sources of value, intangible assets are generated by innovation, unique organizations and human resource practices. This asset class often interacts with tangible and financial assets to create shareholder value and stimulate economic growth. Yet they remain conspicuously absent from required disclosures.Baruch Lev argues in this book that his lack of public information results in improved management of corporate assets contributes to a higher cost of capital and affords abnormally large gains to insiders at the expense of outside investors. To level the playing field, Lev proposes companies periodically release, in addition to the required income, balance sheet and cash flow statements, quantitative and standardized information most relevant to the company value chain or business model.Specifically, he would require three classes of timely disclosure on what he calls the innovative and successful company's lifeline: Discovery and Learning, Implementation and Commercialization. Under Discovery and Learning, he would require disclosure of internal renewal, acquired capabilities and networks. For Implementation, required disclosures would include intellectual property, technological feasibility and Internet metrics. For Commercialization, required disclosures would include data on customers, performance and growth prospects.These disclosures will transform the accounting profession from one that is essentially backward looking - how much was sold at what cost - to a forward looking - the creation of value enhancing assets. This recognizes that in the current knowledge-based economy, value creation or destruction precedes transactions, often by years.Lev's proposed disclosures would compliment current disclosures, providing a reality check on the system of value creation or destruction as products, services and processes move along the value chain."},{"Title":"Intangibles: Management, Measurement, and Reporting","review":"This book was published 2001 by Brookings as part of a pair; the other being Unseen WealthLev's book comprised his view, whereas Unseen Wealth included about 20 views including Lev'sLev is primarily concerned with helping the accounting industry fill its black hole; intangibles being the difference between market value and the tangibles that the 100 years rules of tangible accounting prescribe for. Formerly this blackhole was also known as goodwill.The trouble is as the service and globally/locally networked economies compounded over the last quarter century, goodwill (or transparent trustflows of an organisation mapped in flows of productivities and demands and across to partnering organisations) became the larger dynamic explaining how most value compounds (both finacially and in human terms like learning, community, social progress that take more than 90 days to invest in and may have diverse views of development).I dont find in Lev's book any answers to such issues as how to resolve the wicked assumptions that all tangible accounting revolve round. These include:people are costs, only machines are investmentsseparate units, separate 90 day periods rather than want to map how they interact and compound in non-lonear waysWhat is really needed for tracking, strategizing, transparently governing, leading, developing intangibles (and human relationships) is an opposite type of maths that value multiplies instead of separating out bottom lines as if everything in teh world adds up perfectly in 90 days periods. Whilst Unseen Wealth is clear about the magnitude of the Intangibles Crisis, Lev is not so clear. However, his work is the middleground and epicentre if you are looking at intangibles only from the perspective of what to do if you are intent on perpetuating the traditional accounting profession as nearly as possible as is."},{"Title":"Intangibles: Management, Measurement, and Reporting","review":"Overall, Lev has created a landmark review of the state-of-the science in Intangible Asset Valuation. I haven't found a better book on this very new area, particularly from an Academic Finance point of view.My main quibble is with his lite treatment of human resource drivers of value. In making his conclusion, he places more weight on a working paper than he does on two peer-reviewed papers in good journals showing relationships between high-end HR practices and shareholder value.Lev suggests nicely, though, how value gets created, and specific metrics (with empirical support) that are helpful in each part of the value chain. Rather than citing Kaplan & Norton, he creates his own \\"Value Chain Scoreboard\\". If he informed his approach with new ideas from Organizational Psychology (e.g. John Bodureau), Industrial Engineering and Marketing, and this would be 5 stars.Overall, I like Jeanne DiFrancesco's (ProOrbis) ideas better for more concrete application of intangible value creation, measurement and optimal asset mix."},{"Title":"Intangibles: Management, Measurement, and Reporting","review":"This book makes a huge contribution to the intellectual and practical tool-kit of the smart businessperson. Smart businesspeople sense that intangibles can be the key to creating huge value in the New Economy. What Baruch Lev does so persuasively in his book is to clarify that general sense into sharp knowledge.Intangibles have very different business attributes than do tangible investments in land, buildings, machinery, and the like. Baruch clearly and cleanly lays out the economic issues involved and summarizes the relevant evidence from a variety of business disciplines (a significant portion of which is from his own highly innovative research and real-world consulting experience).The book is particularly accessible to anyone who has MBA. I've used the book successfully in my own teaching on the New Economy, and strongly recommend it to anyone interested in learning key insights about today's business environment."},{"Title":"Intangibles: Management, Measurement, and Reporting","review":"The discipline of intangible management (knowledge management) has been around for decades; there have been many attempts in better understanding & management of intangible assets, with different perspective (organizational learning, technology, strategy etc). Lev has provided a very concise analysis of intangible management with an economics perspective. His analysis is very systematic, robust, with support of empirical studies; his treatment of the subject is coherent & enjoyable to read. But I find the recommendation part of the book slightly weak; the 'value chain scorecard' does not provide significant enhancement over Kaplan & Norton's balanced scorecard."},{"Title":"Intangibles: Management, Measurement, and Reporting","review":"The topic of intangible assets is one of the most vexing issues facing corporations, investors and policymakers today. Professor Lev's book is an important contribution to the literature on intangible assets. The author is well-informed on the inadequacies of current accounting practices and his prescriptions for dealing with the problems are extremely insightful. What makes this book special is the author's obvious passion and enthusiasm for his subject. This book deserves more than five stars."},{"Title":"Intangibles: Management, Measurement, and Reporting","review":"This was an easy to read guide to intangibles. It started at the beginning with a simple explanation of what intangibles are and as you go through the book, it gradually dug deeper and deeper into the issues that businesses are facing with measuring intangibles in the current economy. By the end of the book, I had learned more than I had expected about intangibles. There were no complicated tables or graphs included--the author gave real world examples to issues with intangibles, which was a great way to emphasize his points or make the reader really understand his explanations. The appendices in the back of the book also provide information about various accounting rules and regulations for the different categories of intangible assets as well as defining intellectual capital management best practices, which are very useful in the new technology economy. I would recommend this book to anyone beginning to study or learn about intangible assets. Before I read the book, I had very little experience with intangible assets, but the book gave me a better understanding of the background of intangibles.As we have been moving to a technology-based economy and we are seeing a decrease in the strictly bricks and mortar companies,it seems like now is the time for the business world to see the importance of the measurement of intangible assets. It is not enough for management of companies to know these intangibles exist, they need to find a way to relay that information to the shareholders of the company. I believe this book helps to add to the argument for increased focus on intangibles."},{"Title":"Intangibles: Management, Measurement, and Reporting","review":"I am writing this review in the perspective of using this book as an instructional tool for intangibles. I found the book extremely easy to read. It was straight forward and included a large amount of relevant information concerning the problems connected to the lack of disclosure of intangibles. The book was not filled with equations or pages of models but simply the authors views on the need for changes in intangible recognition. I did not agree with all the authors' views but can say that I agreed with the majority of them. I felt the author laid the book out in a nice format. He started with a basic definition of intangibles and the problems associated with the lack of their disclosure. He ended with his solutions to the problems and other alternative solutions. The back of the book contains the actual rules and regulations for intangibles and best practices for intellectual capital management.I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn more about intangibles and the reasons for the present lack of disclosure. The appendix in the back of the book can be used for reference material in reports for present intangible regulations. The book provides much thought in the possible areas of change for the future of intangible disclosure. I believe that the future will include intangible asset disclosure and this book brings to light many possible future solutions to consider. I believe the book was well worth the money spent and the time consumed reading it was to my benefit."},{"Title":"Intangibles: Management, Measurement, and Reporting","review":"It isn't easy to make a book about accounting interesting and uplifting, but this book comes fairly close to accomplishing that. It provides a clear understanding of why it matters how well accounting rules treat intangible assets, and gives some good guidelines on how to improve them.Some of the proposed improvements are fairly easy to evaluate, such as breaking down R&D; into subcategories for basic research, improvements to recently released products, etc., but with some of the book's suggestions (e.g. trademarks) I'm puzzled as to whether there's little to be gained or whether he has a good idea that he hasn't adequately explained.Alas, accounting standards are a public good that few people have an incentive to create. The improvements suggested by the book could generally be adopted without first being approved by a standards committee because they mostly involve adding new information to reports. But the first company to adopt them gains little until investors can compare the information with that from other companies. And accounting standards committees tend to attract people whose main concern is preventing harm rather than creating new value. And that tendency is currently being reinforced by investors who want a scapegoat for their complacency at the peak of the recent stock market bubble."},{"Title":"Intangibles: Management, Measurement, and Reporting","review":"With the collapse of dot coms and many other high tech companies, many wonder whether intangibles should also go by the wayside. In his book, Lev persuasively argues otherwise. In today's environment, in both old and new economy sectors, the only systematic and sustainable drivers of value and growth are intangible assets, such as patents, brands, unique supply and distribution processes, and human resource practices.This landmark book represents the most comprehensive and thorough economic analysis of intangibles to date. Building on the author's high-impact research and first-hand experience working with executives, consultants, and regulators, the book offers a coherent framework for understanding the fundamental economics of intangible assets. Baruch Lev identifies attributes of intangibles that are different from tangible assets (property, plant, and equipment), by focusing on their distinctive role in value-creation. He highlights the most critical issue concerning intangibles: the need to make relevant information available to outsiders.Perhaps the most difficult job in tackling a challenging issue, such as intangibles, is to recommend a practical solution. Baruch Lev proposes an information system, the Value Chain Scoreboard, to enhance information disclosure about intangibles. A notable feature of the system is its emphasis of key drivers in the creation of valuable intangible assets, as opposed to ex post measurement of performance. Although the focus is on improving external information communication, its mission of reflecting the valuation-creation process of intangibles makes the system potentially useful for managers who want to monitor the performance of investment in intangibles.With a wonderful blend of real-world stories and easily understood economic reasoning, the book also has tremendous educational value, in a variety of business disciplines. It is an especially valuable source for those interested in learning about managing knowledge-based business."},{"Title":"Gotta Sing Gotta Dance a History of The","review":"Beautiful pictures of all the famous dancers, movies and singers.

This wonderfully illustrated book distills the knowledge gained by the restorers of the National Gallery in London, from decades of well-documented, cutting-edge restorations of the outstanding Italian and northern European Old Master paintings in their care. It is much, much more than a technical handbook. Historical essays cover the categories of Renaissance painting, 1300 to 1500, and their many uses, while the second half of the book is an informative catalogue (with gorgeous color reproductions) of individual paintings by many of the best-known Renaissance artists (Botticelli, Jan van Eyck, Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Durer, to name the most obvious)."},{"Title":"Giotto to Durer: Early Renaissance Painting in the National Gallery (National Gallery London Publications)","review":"This is a beautiful, sumptuous book, crammed with detail and excellent colour reproductions. Other readers mightn't go for all the technical information but I can't get enough of it.

Much of the material is of general relevance, of course; but don't forget that many of the major works from this period aren't in galleries at all: they're still in the places they were meant to be."},{"Title":"Giotto to Durer: Early Renaissance Painting in the National Gallery (National Gallery London Publications)","review":"I'm a real art geek, and I've read a lot of books on this subject. This is one of the best. It provides a wonderful review of paintings and how they were made in Western Europe before the 16th century. This was a time of great transition in style, subject matter, and materials. This was when oil painting transitioned from an ancillary medium, believed useful for a few minor aspects of a painting, to the primary means of making visual art.

I have probably averaged at least a week a year during that time when I would be in so much pain I would see a chiropracter for daily visits, and have even tried acupuncture. I also have osteo-arthritis in my right knee to the point of being bone-on-bone, and was told 15 years ago that I should probably have a knee replacement, but it would probably be best to try to live with it until it became unbearable. With the use of supplements, I have been able to cope, but it has always been very tender. I do not take pain pills, so finding a reliable means of relief for the back pain and the knee problems has been an ongoing matter for years now.I learned of this book from a newsletter I receive, and purchased it from another source about 6 months ago. I have a problem allocating an hour a day or more to exercising and working out, as so many sources suggest, so while I know such efforts can be very beneficial, I just haven't been able to commit to them. I figured 3 minutes a day was something I could do, and while my wife told me it didn't sound realistic, and not to expect much, I started in on the program, and within just a few days, I could notice a difference. After a month, I noticed my sciatic pain was gone, my knee seemed less tender, and my back didn't feel like it was going to \\"go out\\" at any moment, like it usually did. I was feeling so good, my wife (age 65) decided to start on the program, and within a week, her normal aches and pains went away! I gave the book to my son-in-law's mother (age 67) who also had back and sciatic pain. After a couple of weeks, she sent me an email with the comment that \\"it's a miracle!\\" and that she can't believe how much better and pain-free she feels.I have just received a new copy (from Amazon this time, and at about half the price I paid from the other source!) and have no problem recommending it to anyone who wants relief from pain."},{"Title":"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life: The Groundbreaking Program for Total Body Pain Prevention and Rapid Relief","review":"It works.

I had resigned myself to being in constant pain and that it would only get worse with age. After 1 week of doing these 6 simple stretches every night, my pain started to subside, and I have been completely pain-free since! I no longer live in fear of throwing my back out every time I lift my daughter. What used to be constant lower back pain is completely gone. The increasing pain in both knees is totally gone. The plantar fasciitis that was preventing me from doing all the things I love and that I thought I was just going to have to learn to live with is completely gone. The best part is that these stretches take no time at all, so I can actually commit to doing them every day. Like the author says, I treat them the same way I treat brushing my teeth.

It's an worthwhile tool for the boxes of each who lives with disabling pain or wish to avoid entering that world. The angry Yoga practitioner writers may have missed a point that often long hours of even the healthiest moves can create discord.

If you are one of those people, or if you don't want to become one of those people, then I recommend this book to you."},{"Title":"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life: The Groundbreaking Program for Total Body Pain Prevention and Rapid Relief","review":"I overheard a passenger on a bus (recovering from a knee injury) rave about this book. I was curious. Investing 3 minutes seems a bit too easy.I ordered the book and read through it in one evening. The first portion deals with the causes of pain, how we accept and treat pain and the general misconceptions of contempary pain management. Halfway through the book you'll come to the \\"exercises.\\" Six basic positions. Sweep your skepticism aside and try the series of yoga like positions in the order prescribed. These are relaxed, non-bouncy, dynamic moves and slowly stretches muscles and joints in a very positive way. It's a well organized book and stresses that the prevention program can be done at anytime of day. In the time it takes to brew a cup of coffee or during the long commercial breaks on network TV - you'll experience, litterally, an overnight improvement.This book will be part of my Christmas gift list to friends and relatives."},{"Title":"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life: The Groundbreaking Program for Total Body Pain Prevention and Rapid Relief","review":"Got into a mess with inflamation... arthritis, dropped foot syndrom, extreme pain from sciatica etc. and couldn't walk, couldn't work, couldn't sleep. Doctor put me on Zydol and turned me into a zombie.Tried the exercise for sciatica and the pain subsided 50% in 30 seconds. That convinced me to do the 3 min execrices plus a few other specific ones several times a day. Soon stopped Zydol and over the next two months got a new body. Two months later I could run. Now 9 months later I have flexibility and it's like the clock has been turned back 10 years.

I have been having regular chiropractic treatments for more than 50 years, but now I'm finding that my back is feeling good without them. I suppose I might sometime in the future need to again consult a chiropractor, but for now, I'm feeling great! The exercises are easy to do and because they take only a total of 3 minutes each day, I have no trouble following through and doing them with regularity. I recommended the book to my older brother who has been having severe back pain. Now he is also doing the exercises and feels better than he has for many years."},{"Title":"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life: The Groundbreaking Program for Total Body Pain Prevention and Rapid Relief","review":"This Book has helped me tremendously.

I couldn't do anything, just standing up was enough misery that it became impossible. At one point, I thought to myself, \\"If I have to live with this the rest of my life, I don't want to live\\". I'm a Marriage and Family Therapist with some level of expertise in working with clients who have chronic pain, but this gave me a whole new level of compassion and empathy for people who have to live in those circumstances. And, even more important, it gave me great hope that it doesn't have to be that way for me and for the majority of people who experience pain.Needless to say, when I heard about the 3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life (from my lovely mom - other than my existence, this turned out to be the greatest gift she's ever given me!), I was highly skeptical. After all, I spent about two and a half hours exercising and stretching each day and was still living with a lot of pain. I thought I was in great shape, but I was perplexed about why I was living with multiple aches and varied levels of pain (my neck, shoulders, fingers, toes, knees, upper back, lower back, and hips all hurt), all of which seemed to be getting worse. I'm 48 years old and was diagnosed with arthritis in my knees at the age of 22. I thought that by staying extremely active, I could circumvent further pain and injury, but this notion wasn't panning out in the reality of how I felt. Dr. Wesiberg helped me to understand exactly why this was happening to my body and what I needed to do about it!I have been doing the Weisberg method for 10 days now and I can tell you, I'm experiencing an absolute miracle!!! This morning I woke up pain-free for the first time since I can remember. Not only is the extreme pain resulting from my back injury completely gone (I'm still left with some stiffness and limited flexibility, but I'm convinced this will completely go away as well), but I feel no pain in any of the areas aforementioned! I now consider myself an ambassador for the 3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life and will share my results of the method with anyone who is willing to listen. If you read this book, you'll understand why most of us live with musculoskeletal pain and what can be done (in three easy minutes)to heal and live virtually a pain-free life. Thanks to Dr. Weisberg I feel like I have a whole new lease on life! I am convinced that you will too if you read the book and follow Dr. Weisberg's method! I am overjoyed for you and for me! Thank you Dr. Weisberg!!!By the way, the one person who wrote a negative review, obviously never read the book. I feel sorry for K. Prater... he/she is probably still living in pain..."},{"Title":"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life: The Groundbreaking Program for Total Body Pain Prevention and Rapid Relief","review":"ABSOLUTELY THE BEST NON MEDICAL, PRACTICAL PAIN RELIEF BOOK I HAVE EVER USED.

I have a connective tissue disorder with a lot of chronic muscle and joint pain, and the 3-minute exercises didn't work at all for me. For one thing, I was unable to do the regular exercises because of an injured hand so I did the exercises for seniors. I did these mostly sitting on the sofa, as is recommended by the author. Not only did they not help, I started getting low back pain that I did not previously have. If you use these exercises, don't do them on the sofa! Use a straight-back chair. The exercise for hand pain made my hand worse.While the author does seem to know a lot about the human structure, the book is wordier than it needs to be and the exercises are simply yoga asanas under a different name. One reviewer thinks \\"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life\\" is what Egoscue exercises should be and aren't. Having done the Egoscue exercises and benefited from them, I completely disagree."},{"Title":"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life: The Groundbreaking Program for Total Body Pain Prevention and Rapid Relief","review":"Amazon has done it again!

The title implies (at least to me) that there are some real (sort of psycho - hypnotically)pain management techniques. But instead the book just provides with anatomy and exercises to MAINTAIN the body and PREVENT from issues to happen.I do yoga for years and have a medical degree, so this book has no use to me."},{"Title":"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life: The Groundbreaking Program for Total Body Pain Prevention and Rapid Relief","review":"90% of all the exercises are strictly yoga poses. I am throughly disgusted that I spent my good money on a BIG RIP OFF! 2/3 of the book is spent with Mr. Weisberg loving the view of his own words in print.Take my advice and go to the library and rent either books or videos of yoga for FREE.Mr. Weisberg cleverly renames all of the poses but I can guarantee you they are Yoga poses as I took yoga instructions for 3 months and attend weekly classes on a continuing basis. I showed his book to my Yoga teacher and he was thoroughly disgusted that this supposedly professional person would do such an unprofessional act all for the sake of book sales."},{"Title":"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life: The Groundbreaking Program for Total Body Pain Prevention and Rapid Relief","review":"For those experiencing pain, this is the book to get! I have been doing them more-or-less daily for over two years following treatment for a herniated disc. Before I started them, I could not garden, play with my dogs or vacuum my home. When done regularly, they are amazingly effective at disc repair (yes, that's how good they make you feel), as well as relief of arthritis in my knees and shoulder. Yes, the exercises that Dr. Weisberg promotes are indeed yoga-based, so if you want to spend your money and hours of your time, take a yoga class or buy a yoga video. However, if you want to truly HEAL YOURSELF, then buy this book and do the exercises regularly. Some are difficult at first, so do not try to work past your pain - over time, you will be doing them all and loving the way you feel! What's to lose for 3 minutes a day?"},{"Title":"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life: The Groundbreaking Program for Total Body Pain Prevention and Rapid Relief","review":"This book has literally changed my life! After working for years with various therapists for back pain, including physical therapy, Osteopathy, Chiropractic, Feldenkrais, and various others, this was the first book (and I have read many on pain relief) that helped me help myself. While the various therapies always helped for a while, I needed a way to make the benefits more lasting - and this technique WORKS! It also made a difference to me that he explains why each position helps and what to expect as I continue to follow the program. I began this program 5 months ago and considering this has been a life-long problem the results from the beginning have been amazing. I find this book so helpful that I gave many friends and relatives a copy for Christmas and they are now sending me their own rave reviews. A delightful \\"side effect\\" reported by friends in their 70's and 80's is a noticeable improvement in their sense of balance. Where they once might have fallen, they notice a stronger sense of balance and control. This is a major benefit as we get older. Also, my younger friends who are active in sports and work out regularly, are finding their workouts both easier and improved. One young friend says she often does the 3 minute program several times a day \\"just because it feels so good and doesn't take long.\\" Included in the book is a three-month check up that makes one aware of a future problem before it gets severe enough to cause pain. By doing the suggested remedial exercises we can then prevent pain before it starts. I'd like to see this book in every person's hands who cares about a life that is pain-free both now and in the future. I would give it ten stars if permitted."},{"Title":"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life: The Groundbreaking Program for Total Body Pain Prevention and Rapid Relief","review":"Dr. Weisberg is a breath of fresh air in an age of victimization. While others push harmful drugs on us to relieve the pain that is an \\"inevitable\\" part of aging and everyday life, he provides the rationale and method for taking care of yourself. I'm a believer in trying routines that put the burden of success on me, not a drug or some contraption. I read his book, tried the stetching routine and was immediately rewarded with the elation that comes from a relaxed, smoothworking body. The soreness in my wrists, forearms and back went away. I've greatly increased my daily exercise routine and it feels good.

However, as I read the ad there was a challenge for the reader to try two examples of the stretching exercises. One of the exercises was for back pain and another one for shoulder pain, so I decided to try them both. To my great surprise both of these exercises worked immediately. I had been experiencing pain in my back and shoulders, to a degree, which caused me to wake up from a deep sleep at night. Upon trying both of these stretching exercises I felt immediate relief from pain and since using these exercises daily I have not experienced the pain at night where it was truly troublesome or during the day where it impacted on my ability to perform my duties at work. Subsequently, I have purchased three more copies of this book and given them to family and friends who were also experiencing pain and discomfort. The people to whom I have given this book have reported success in eliminating pain and discomfort that they thought they might have to live with forever. While initially pain may not be immediate or totally relieved, in all cases, continued use of these exercises does result in total or great elimination of the pain.However, one of the great benefits is the increased motion and mobility of joints and muscle groups. I now find it easier to put on my socks and tie my shoes for example.Doing these exercises does not require great strength or great effort nor does it take a great deal of time. I recommend this book highly, and I will be purchasing more copies to give to family and friends."},{"Title":"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life: The Groundbreaking Program for Total Body Pain Prevention and Rapid Relief","review":"I have fibromyalgia, chronic myofascial pain, and osteoarthritis in the spine plus had a spinal fusion in 1998.

I am amazed that I already am feeling less pain! I highly recommend the program in this book."},{"Title":"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life: The Groundbreaking Program for Total Body Pain Prevention and Rapid Relief","review":"Good stuff overall. Yes it is modified yoga, so what? Cherry picked postures to give you maximum relief in minimal time. Reminds me, in some ways, of the Five Tibetan Rituals used for an immune system 'tune up' with added benefit of a more supple body, also highly recommended (mumbo jumbo notwithstanding).So, why only four stars? A few things... 30 seconds of Arch seems unnecessary, especially in light of noted spinal biomechanist Dr. Stuart McGill's research that anything over 8 or so repetitions offers diminishing returns in terms of any benefit. Also, may movements, such as Natural Squat are with feet shoulder width apart. That's fine, but he doesn't really explain why. INFLEX stretching instructs most movements with feet together, on the other hand Dan John's 'Goblet Squats' or 'Potato sack Squats' position feet slightly wider so that when you are in the down position you are 'in the hole'. SO, which is it, what is the rationale? Not clear to me.Nevertheless, an excellent book, helpful, and doable in a way that Egoscue, for all its theory, really isn't for normal, working, child-rearing people with real-life time constraints.

I was searching for something that I could do to help myself (in addition to Chiropractic). I learned SO much from this book! His exercises are very easy to do.

I have recommended this book to a least a dozen people and purchased one for a friend as a gift. God bless you Dr. Weisberg wherever you are."},{"Title":"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life: The Groundbreaking Program for Total Body Pain Prevention and Rapid Relief","review":"I bought this book for my husband to read but he wasn't interested so I read through it. I found it very interesting & was amazed at the ages of some of the people who gave reviews in the book. I am in my early 60's & couldn't squat down & get back up without getting on my knees first & grabbing the counter to help me get up. Not any more! Since I started doing the 3-minutes a day therapeutic movements, I can squat with no problem & get back up on my own. There are times when I have worked out in the yard & feel a little lower back pain. When I do the TM's it seems to help a lot. I tell everyone I know about this book. There is so much useful information in it. I'm getting ready to read it through again; this time understanding it much better because I know it works."},{"Title":"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life: The Groundbreaking Program for Total Body Pain Prevention and Rapid Relief","review":"A friend loaned my husband his copy of this book and now I am buying it to have for reference. I am 'only' 47 and feel I should be in much better shape, but am not. I have old injuries and am in quite a bit of pain daily requiring me to take both otc and prescription meds just to function. I began doing the program and a few of the additional exercises. What I want people to realize is that you can modify the positions until you become stronger and more flexible, which will happen. You can even do some of the exercises in bed. The most difficult position for most seems to be the squat. I modified it by putting a book under each heel of equal thickness. As I become more balanced and stronger (which is happening quickly) I reduce the thickness of the books with the end goal of using nothing. If you cannot lower yourself from the standing position, start in the squat. Use your common sense. Even though I have decent knowledge of the human body, I really enjoyed learning the \\"why\\" of each position. It gives me something to concentrate on while I am holding the position. My advise is to go straight to the exercise portion of the book, read and review it. Then go through and read the rest. Most people want instant gratification for all things. well, our bodies are not microwave ovens. It took time to get where you are and it will take time to reverse the conditions causing your pain. If you try to stretch a muscle to aggressively to get faster results, you will just tear the tissue, injure yourself and be further behind. It doesn't take years to see results from this plan, but it might take a few months to see dramatic improvement. My initial impression was a sense of accomplishment and a better mental state because I was doing something rather than sitting/lying around being in pain. As my muscles stretch I noticed quickly feeling more at ease and stronger, more balanced. It is worth giving it a try. It takes a very short amount of time and you have nothing to lose. Think about it this way: If you do nothing you are guaranteed to stay in pain and it will get worse. If you do this the worst that can happen is it won't get worse, and it will probably get better!"},{"Title":"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life: The Groundbreaking Program for Total Body Pain Prevention and Rapid Relief","review":"The body specific exercises are really good. So far I have only picked and chosen among them all for ones I could use right away. They are well explained and easy to do one by one. The hip one has really helped a lot since I am avoiding a hip replacement. I plan to do the whole program just to see how it works. The food advice is just too far away from my proven way of eating according to Weston A. Price principles so I only give this book 3 stars. Weisberg should have stayed away from diet because his body care exercise information is so good."},{"Title":"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life: The Groundbreaking Program for Total Body Pain Prevention and Rapid Relief","review":"I have used these six exercises for years. I can't claim that they are the only stretches I do, because I try to do a full set of stretches that cover all the muscles in my body from head to toe. However, these six are probably the most important that I do to prevent back pain. A pain specialist I saw a few years ago told me that he believes that 80% of the chronic pain in this country is caused by muscle pain. He said that the most important things to do for relief of muscle pain are stretching and the application of heat from aheating pad.This book is well-written, easy to read, and the illustrations make it simple to emulate the exercises. There are two ways to do them, full out stretch if you are not too feeble, and modified versions if you have severe disability. That is one of the important features of this program--no matter how much pain you have, you can still do it."},{"Title":"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life: The Groundbreaking Program for Total Body Pain Prevention and Rapid Relief","review":"Use information as directed and you indeed have your own Program for total body pain PREVENTION and RAPID RELIEF.

I am old (58:) and very active physically. I have suffered pain that would normally be associated with having severe lower disk problems or maybe a pinched nerve - plus my low back muscles have been very painful. I work out carfully every day. I have had 4 MRI's in the last year plus a bone scane. I have seen a Neuro Surgeon, chiropracter(s), Orthopedic surgeon, family doctor, spinal surgeon and two physio thearapists. All of them have been helpful in some ways but no one can really help me or tell me what my problem is. My disks are fine and I have no pinched nerves. I purchased this book along with Framework. I read 3 Minutes 1st and started the exercises. I am completely pain free! I still find it hard to believe. It is over three weeks and I awake every morning wondering if my pain is back. I do the exercise for atheletes and have added a lower back exercise plus one for elbows. The total time is 4 1/2 minutes. I should mention I always warm up on my bike 1st so my muscles are able to accept any stretching. Plus the reading of FrameWork has helped in my weight workout. I have already recommended this to a friend and he is having similar results. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star report is that I believe he should have said more about warming up 1st and the book would be as good as FrameWork if he had added to the content to help those of us who are very athletically fit.

I was not aware of any causative event, but suddenly I could barely walk. I tried every treatment and product imaginable. I had an MRI, consulted two orthopedic surgeons, and briefly considered surgery as my only option. This was after spending hendreds of dollars on products (knee braces, heat and cold wraps, herbs, ointments, etc.), and trying acupuncture, physical therapy, massage, and a host of other therapies. I was unable to exercise, gained weight, and began scanning Modern Maturity magazine for walking aids! Then, my daughters gave me a copy of the book, \\"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life\\", and I started to do the six therapeutic movements outlined in the book. I've been doing them daily now for a month and I have regained considerable mobility. I was able to start an exercise program and I'm amazed that I can now walk and exercise without pain. I even had my back go out on me, and I immediately did the specific stretches the book recommended. By the second day I was able to stand tall and move without debilitating pain. Another bonus of the book is that it is a highly readable layman's text of Anatomy and Physiology. I learned a lot about my body in the process of healing it. I plan to buy this book for everyone I know who struggles with chronic pain."},{"Title":"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life: The Groundbreaking Program for Total Body Pain Prevention and Rapid Relief","review":"Hardly a \\"revolutionary\\" program for those who have read anything about the muscular-skeletal structure of the human body, the interrelations of muscles and joints, and the importance of keeping the muscles stretched. But the author does offer an inviting, simple, and feasible set of six exercises which, if done religiously every day, 30 seconds per exercise, can prevent further abuses and damage (the title's apparent promise of restoration or a \\"cure\\" seems a bit exaggerated). Compared to the impossibly long list of tedious, often painful and exhausting exercises given me by my PT, Dr. Weisberg's program is cause for a sigh of relief.Well over half of the book is devoted to anatomical discussions, motivational talk, and testimonials rather than the program itself. The heart of Dr. Weisberg's advice is the familiar \\"use it or lose it.\\" The author practically demonizes the chair and the unnatural \\"C\\" shape that it encourages. The idea is to align the body to its natural center of gravity, producing the \\"S\\" curve. Anyone who finds it excruciating if not impossible to assume the squat position (maintaining balance on the heels is the challenge) or the split (only in my dreams) may be frustrated by the book's program of exercises. All others should benefit."},{"Title":"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life: The Groundbreaking Program for Total Body Pain Prevention and Rapid Relief","review":"My problem: hip bursitis and piriformis syndrome.

As for the program of stretching, I think it is great. My only wish for the book was for some info on obesity and how to work the exercises when you're just too heavy to do them correctly.

I got rid of a pain in my shoulder I'd had for 2 years using one of the book's suggestions - it is completely gone after maybe a month of simple stretching, not even every day - that alone was worth the price of the book for me."},{"Title":"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life: The Groundbreaking Program for Total Body Pain Prevention and Rapid Relief","review":"Do you think because you exercise you're less likely to get injured?Wrong - you're MORE likely to hurt yourself.Do you think lifting weights or taking an aerobics class \\"is the same thing as tending to the biologocal needs of your muscles and joints\\"?(quote from Dr. W).If you're like me and my 40 something friends with joint pain you may have found this is not true either.This book is upbeat. One book I read says \\"back pain is the price we pay for walking on two legs\\". Dr. W insists we are not defective by design. In fact our back is perfectly designed. We just neglect to maintain it. Did you know our muscoloskeletal system is made to last for 120 years? This book gives hope in what can be a hopeless world.His \\"3 month tuneup\\" will clearly show you your problem areas.His \\"Encyclopedia of Pain Relief\\" gives simple TM's (therapeutic movements) which only take a minute or two to do and effectively target exactly what your problem is.Dr. W explains how chronic pain is from tissue being irritating not damaged (as in acute pain) and is a result of microtraumas which slowly build up over years of misuse or neglect. Then one day, our shoulder goes out. Well it didn't go out in one day. It's been building up for years.As a dancer with experience in NYC, full splits, hand stand pushups, pistols, 25+ chinups, blah, blah; I can say this book ferreted out problems and gave simple exercises for my shoulder, feet and back problems.Don't expect this book to fix a bad back but it's a start.I recommend Dr. DeNubile's \\"Framework\\", Pavel Tsatsoline's \\"Beyond Stretching\\", and \\"Pain Free\\" by Pete Egoscue but none are as simple and easy to follow as this book."},{"Title":"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life: The Groundbreaking Program for Total Body Pain Prevention and Rapid Relief","review":"The first thing to know about reading 3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life by Dr. Weisberg is that you are going to get to page 132 before you learn ANYTHING about those 3 minute exercises! That is a lot of slogging you have to do to get to the reason you bought the book.The book discouraged me right from the beginning. The introduction talks about how just 100 years ago people did not practice preventative dental care. What?? I study history and even in medieval days they had tooth cleaners, mouthwashes, and tooth whiteners. Apparently the first toothbrush equivalent traces back to 3,000 BC and it may simply be that we can't find earlier ones because they've decayed.The same introduction states that \\"the very notion of preventative care [for the musculoskeletal system] is nonexistent\\" right now. Again, what?? The six exercises presented in this book are pretty much exactly what I do in my yoga practice every day! The very things discussed in this book - the importance of synovial fluids, the flexing of joints - are things I find in every yoga book I read. This is hardly new stuff.This introduction is by someone who says she's sedentary and in constant pain - but she's in \\"excellent health.\\" Is there a serious disconnect here?So to get all of this in the first two pages of the book is exceedingly disheartening. Then we move on into the main content.Pain is an alarm system for your body. Sure, acute pain, like if you cut your finger, is something you can see the source of and know how to fix. However, with chronic pain, you don't know what's causing it. You don't know what to fix. So it goes on and on and you start to want to just drug out the pain. However, this will just make it worse! Whatever is really causing that pain is going to keep growing.It's important to realize this pain is not caused by one action, like a slipped knife. It's the end result of a long buildup. You have to research and investigate what is causing that buildup and undo it. To use pain meds is like turning off a fire alarm when a fire is in your house. It lets the fire keep raging. You have to examine the alarm signal and figure out what it means.Now the book goes into a furious hatred of chairs. You get far more pages about chairs and their evils than you could ever want to read. Was this necessary to fluff the book out to a given size? Was having a book of six pages - with the main exercises - just too light to make a book? You hear how cultures without chairs would all squat constantly which is good for your spine. Cultures with chairs would sit which damages the spine, creating a C shaped spine which hurts. Even sitting up straight still doesn't have your legs as \\"shock absorbers\\" beneath your rear, so you've lost that benefit.Again, this made me start to question the content. I study medieval Japan and the screen paintings I've seen has everyone sitting on the floor. They don't have chairs - but they weren't all squatting all the time either! The chair fury seemed quite extreme.There are also strange analogies like \\"every living thing is in motion ... cats scamper ...\\" - he's trying to tell us that we are too sedentary. However, cats tend to sleep at least 16 hours a day! I'd have avoided the cats example and focused on animals that are constantly in motion. For example, focus on sharks which have to stay in constant motion.About this time I was yelling at the book, \\"get on with it already!!\\" I'd had enough of cats and chairs and the joys of squatting. I wanted to learn something useful.On to a full chapter on anatomy. This is what bones are made of. That is what muscles are made of. Cartilage sits between your bones to cushion them, and synovial fluid helps to keep that lubricated. They need to flex fully each day to stay healthy. Similarly, muscles need to be stretched to their optimal length each day to retain their health. This needs to be done for at least 30 seconds to give them the healthy stretch. So here we have some glimmers of information!Back to the bulk dump of information. The book explains why every single medicine, both man-made and natural, is bad in some way or another. Again the purpose is to push you to use his technique and to avoid medicines. He has certainly hammered that point home. We learn how different foods can damage our health. For example a diet of processed grain, flour, and sugar can increase arthritis symptoms.Then the book says that stress has no impact on a well tuned body. If your body is healthy, stress has no effect on it. I found that suspect, but by now I was too deep into the book to turn back.Finally! The six exercises! I was expecting something new, phenomenal, and extraordinary after all this buildup of \\"nobody has ever done this in the history of mankind.\\" Then - pose 1 - child pose! The most basic pose of yoga! I do child pose every day. Heck, this is the Muslim prayer pose as well. Pose #2. I won't reveal it, because it seems a little unfair to reveal the key steps when he's trying to sell this book, but I'll say that it was no more \\"new\\" than pose #1. I do every single pose in his secret routine as part of my normal yoga routine, and we're not talking about stand-on-head-twist-your-legs types of poses.Next, the book offers specialized exercises for specific pains. There's also modified exercises for seniors and kids and so on. It seems like they cover all the bases. However, interestingly, there isn't a good amount of information on the exercises. It's odd. I have a lot of exercise and yoga books that I've read. Usually if they tell you how to do a pose, they then follow it with a series of modifications - \\"if you can't do X, you can always do Y instead.\\" However, here, you're just left on your own if you can't do what they say.So for example, pose #3 is \\"Lizard\\". It involves laying on your stomach and pressing your torso up with your hands until your arms are straight. You get descriptions of what body areas this exercise helps. You get the straightforward instructions. \\"Your elbows are straight.\\" Then you go into a long description about how wonderful this pose is for you. But wait!! What if I can't get my elbows to be straight? There's no guidance. Should I keep my lower stomach on the ground and allow the elbows to bend? Should I make sure the elbows are straight and not worry for now about my stomach staying on the ground? I'm completely on my own. The book has 50 pages on the evil of chairs but the information on the actual exercise - the key purpose of the book - is sparse.Then we get into the summary area - and now the book says that stress DOES cause issues for your body and that you should work to reduce stress. I knew that before, and it contradicts the \\"stress isn't really a problem\\" message from earlier in the book.So, with all these issues, why would I give the book four stars? The key is that I do these exercises already as part of my daily routine. I believe in them. I've read tons of yoga books. I understand why rotating joints and keeping synovial fluid on the cartilage is key. My yoga teacher mentions synovial fluid regularly in our classes. So I absolutely believe in the message in the book. I'm just grumpy with the off-putting introduction, the PAGES AND PAGES of fluff, and the lack of full instruction for the exercises. Luckily since I have numerous yoga books, I was able to fill in the gaps myself.Since this book is aimed towards an audience who wants a quick, easy solution, I think the book could be much better laid out to make the information quick and easy to read. Skip the chair diatribes. Skip the anatomy lesson. Explain about joints, synovial fluids, and then show the exercises in FAR more detail."},{"Title":"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life: The Groundbreaking Program for Total Body Pain Prevention and Rapid Relief","review":"Item came within prescribed time and in very good condition.

In an era when the medical industry has complicated the simple, made the transparent opaque and the cheap expensive this is a very refreshing book.Weisberg's bagging of junk medicine - where pills are used to mask symptoms is timely. Back Pain is not caused by a lack of CelebrexHe makes good sense.When the price of a back operation costs unpwards of $100,000 (for a couple of hours work), spending 3 or so minutes a day doing some stretches looks like a wise investment.Though Weisberg has pretty much ticked all the right boxes, I would have included some strengthening exercizes and there's probably a few more flexibility exercises that would help speed up the rehab process.However many reviewers have remarked that the 3 minutes got them interested.Egoscue's principles- muscles pull bones out of alignment, and- the cause of the pain is rarely at the site of the painare also worth noting.This is a book well worth getting. It's a refreshing break from the same old, same old exercises you get in physio and chiro books, and the same old, same old treatments where the spot that hurts gets rubbed, crunched, heated and vibrated.

The book is nicely written with illustrationsas needed but not too much, just right.I used the workout for my shoulder for about a week, two or three workouts overall (page 161 in caseanyone is curious). Woke up this morning and it took an hour or so to remember......NO PAIN.I have been living with this for awhile now and though it would subside here-and-there, it was alwaysthere (so to speak). I was also getting this 'popping' type action, when I would move the shoulder /armaround, like the joint was out of alignment or something, and that is GONE as well.Anyhow, it's been nearly the entire day now and nothing. I'm going to keep up the exercise. I useda stretch band that I had available. I think it was a 13 pounder; you can get off Amazon. I used the BodyLastics brand (that too is a 5 star) but I'm sure about anything will do. I plan to use the planfor at least another week or two and then I'll decide to continue, or not after that. I have been doingother shoulder exercises and though I would get a little relief, here-and-there, nothing approached whatthis one exercise (apparently) did.I am REALLY happy. I thought that I had damaged the shoulder, apparently that is not the case and I savedmyself a trip to the Dr., physical therapy, surgery, drugs and who knows what. This would also be a greatbook to have handy as a reference. You'll know why after you read it over.Good luck with your problem. This book is a great investment, now and in the future."},{"Title":"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life: The Groundbreaking Program for Total Body Pain Prevention and Rapid Relief","review":"With this book I managed to cure my sciatica problem in 10 days. What a relief!"},{"Title":"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life: The Groundbreaking Program for Total Body Pain Prevention and Rapid Relief","review":"When I found this book I was indeed in need of a miracle. I had recently been diagnosed with cervical radiculopathy due to a bulging disc and was on the verge at seeing an orthopedic surgeon for epidural steroid injections. I was experiencing daily pain in my neck which radiated down into my back and right shoulder.As soon as I received the book I started up with the daily 6 stretches. WOW! After just doing the stretches just one time, some or might I even say, A LOT of the pain that I had been having that day went away.It's been a little over 3 months now. Unfortunately I'm still dealing with some pain, but the 6 three minute exercises in this book seems to have drastically improved the radiculopathy pain that I was having. So far, I've been able to avoid having any epidural steroid injections or any treatments by a physician.I think it's probably a bit TOO far to say that you will have a \\"Pain Free Life\\" but, I credit this book to saving me so far from medical treatments and helping me live pretty close to a pain free life.

I think she chose it for me because she knows I can get immersed in my work and ignore my pain until it gets simply unbearable. At first, I just flipped straight to the six stretches (for the total of 3 minutes of stretches). I have had nerve, knee and foot issues, sometimes aggravated by the dance classes I take every week and refuse to give up, so I wanted to see if the stretches could help. They did! I appreciated not only the helpful photo illustrations of each stretch but also the author's suggestion of very cheap and readily available alternatives to accessories or equipment like steps or strength bands. In other words: there are NO excuses not to get started. I also appreciate the stretches he recommends for specific areas of the body (like for me, my feet/achilles heels). The book is easy to read, and it includes compelling real-life examples, so I eventually read most of it. The author also compelled me to look at pain as an ally -- as a message from my body, saying: please do something, please change something. When you think about pain this way, it's not about covering it up with pain medications. It's about listening to your body to understand how you can work with it, not against it."},{"Title":"3 Minutes to a Pain-Free Life: The Groundbreaking Program for Total Body Pain Prevention and Rapid Relief","review":"This book is very downto earth AND very useful for maintaining musculoskeletal health.

I didn't have any problems but about two or three years later I began to experience pain whenever I was walking. I couldn't walk for more than five minutes without having to stop and sit down on something for a minute or two. I also could not stand for more than five minutes without incredible pain and I would have to sit as well. I believe that injury put my body out of balance through the micro-injuries that are discussed in this book.I went to my doctor, took pain medications, had an MRI, injections in my lower back, and also saw a physical therapist. Each helped to only a limited degree. I would still wind up having pain in walking or standing.I came across this book in my public library, ordered a copy for myself through Amazon, read the first half and then started doing the six stretch exercises. A miracle happened!!! My pain started dissolving and in three months it was all gone. I was able to walk as much as I wanted and to stand for however long without any pain at all.I recently strained or tore some muscles in my lower back through lifting an object that was two heavy for me. I've gone through a lot of pain for three weeks letting the muscles heal but now have started the stretches again. The magic is working again!!!I have recommended this book to anyone who has chronic muscle or joint pain of any kind. Yes, the exercises may just be yoga stretches, or yes, stretches every physical therapist may know, but the clear writing, the easy arrangement of effective exercises that decreased and eliminated my back pain results in my saying: \\"The promise on the cover is unbelievably true.\\" Too bad there isn't a prize for someone like this who has discovered an easy method to help people and then writes an inexpensive book that can help millions."},{"Title":"Pocket Professor Philosophy: Everything You Need To Know About Philosophy (The Pocket Professor)","review":"I am lucky enough to have Dr. Herman as my prof and he uses this book to help teach the class.

This book does have tips on executing an outdoor wedding, but they are mostly obvious like &quot;consider renting a tent, or reserving one in case it rains.&quot; This is not, by any means, a guide on how to plan an outdoor wedding, but if you just want to look at a few kind of random pictures in order to get ideas on things, than this is a nice book, if expensive."},{"Title":"Outdoor Weddings: Unforgettable Celebrations in Storybook Settings","review":"I actually got this book as a gift and I am sorry that my mother paid for it!

It looked good, was cheap, and I bought it. What a find! My partner and I eat \\"in\\" a lot because we live too far from good restaurants, but we like restaurant-quality food every night. So . . . we cook a lot out of \\"Best of Gourmet\\" and old Gourmet magazines (before Ruth Reichl destroyed the magazine), Pierre Franey's 60-Minute Gourmet books, and a few French cookbooks that have proved themselves. Bon Appetit has generally been a less reliable source, but not so this book.The recipes are for \\"main courses\\", but there is a sidebar with each recipe with suggestions for sides, some appetizers, and desserts. The book has many, many photos, which often include the suggested starch and/or vegetable side dish. These features make this a \\"no-brainer\\" book to use on evenings when the brain cells have already been fried at the office. In addition, for the relative novice cook, there is lots of very good, basic advice throughout, for example, an introduction that includes a very good list of pantry, basic produce, condiments, and frozen food staples, and each recipe section begins with advice on quick cooking methods, approximate cooking times, and some nutritional information.More importantly, all the recipes we have tried so far have been excellent. We eat a lot of fish, so we have tried almost all of the fish and shellfish recipes. The salmon and avocado scalloppine (page 102), featuring a lime-cilantro dressing, is excellent! It's light, refreshing, quick and easy to prepare, and different from any of the hundreds of salmon recipes we've made over the years. Halibut Provencale (page 91) is also very good.Another out-of-the-ordinary recipe that is really great is the Texas Beef Tacos (age 129). This is definitely a tasty meal not to be missed!This book is divided into six sections: Introduction, Pasta & Pizza, Poultry, Seafood, the red meats, and Meatless. There is great variety in the main and supporting ingredients, cooking methods, ethnic origins, flavors, and garnishes. More than half of the recipes are portioned for two, which is perfect for us \\"empty nesters\\" as well as for other two-person households. There are also a few recipes in each section calling for \\"cooked\\" this or that, i.e., left-over meats and fish. My main criticism is that the poultry section calls for a lot of boneless chicken breasts, which tend to dry out easily and are not nearly as flavorful as thighs, wings and legs. I have no complaints about the \\"convenience foods\\" that are listed throughout, as they are limited to quality items like jarred roasted red peppers, low-salt chicken broth, and tomato sauce (which of course can be canned or not).In conclusion, I heartily recommend this book for quick-and-easy week-night cooking. It is head and shoulders above Rachael Ray!"},{"Title":"Assuming The Positions (Pitt Comp Literacy Culture)","review":"Miller looks at commonplace books as sites of identity construction and gender formation.

Since an invitation to that dinner party has not yet been extended to me, I enjoyed the heck out of this book. It's a wonderful resource both for aspiring musicians and for those who simply seek to understand how the professionals think. The anecdotes and stories from the road are pure pleasure to read. I've named a few of the rock icons whose interviews appear, but Pollock has managed to gather within these pages a very diverse, cross-genre crowd: jazz, country, rap, folk, broadway, you name it. The overall effect: it's a gem."},{"Title":"Working Musicians: Defining Moments from the Road, the Studio, and the Stage","review":"A must read!! Goes deep into the heart of the working musicians, as told by the entertainers in there own words. Enjoyed every readable momemt of this book."},{"Title":"Working Musicians: Defining Moments from the Road, the Studio, and the Stage","review":"You don't have to be limousine famous to be a respected musician, I think that's the point of Bruce Pollocks copilation: \\"Working musicians\\", after all, only a lucky few can make it that big.Working musicians, or people who make a living out of their talent and ear, can be a good definition of Keith Richards work (even my 7 year old knows who Keith is), and to the likes of Richie Pollock who used to wake up before the sun came out in the late 80's to secure his place at the metro in Montreal. Performing hits of the 60's and 70's at the metro station was a noble way to make a few bucks.In this book we can find first person testimonies of more than 100 working musicians from the ones who filled the Madison Square Garden to those who dedicated their talents to make people dance in weddings and Bar Mizvahs. From those who felt that their fame and career had an expiration date to the blessed who will play their music till their last breath. From the big rock and roll star to those who choose to stay true to their art and could never make the commercial jump. Even Paul Simon has a humble history to tale.The different testimonies are divided by Pollock in themes: starting out, first albums, first gigs, the studios, the bussines, songwritters... I found the first chapters the best for the non musicians readers, the ones to take you to the soul of the craft. The chapters about the studio process were somehow boring for the nonmusician, but I really loved the book, it gave me an open window to the jazz, rock and pop musicians lives."},{"Title":"Working Musicians: Defining Moments from the Road, the Studio, and the Stage","review":"Most people, even if they've been living in Siberia, have heard of Bruce Springsteen, Jerry Garcia and Peter Tork - all famous and respected musicians. However, there are just as many unknowns profiled in this book, which makes identifying with their careers and music more difficult. (Just where does one find recordings by Julia Darling?) Other than that gripe, Bruce Pollock has broken his work into logical chapters - the first album, gigging, etc. If one is serious about making a living as a 'working musician,' then I could see how this book would be valuable."},{"Title":"The Funhouse of Dr. Freek (R.

Years later, I used the 3rd edition for the California State Board Exam. The tests are similar enough that I passed the latter with flying colors (after all, the science is the same, regardless of geography!) I owe much of the success in both cases to the Colville guide.I am now an instructor for the Vet Tech program at a local college, and recommend this book as an adjunct for studying--the CD-ROM is really helpful.

Alas I did. So then I hit the books...all of them I used in college. Still, failed by only a few, I repeated this process until I tried and failed a total of 4 times. That started in 1999 when I graduated college. For those of you unfamiliar, the CALIFORNIA RVT exam is well known for having a high failure rate, and for being archaic and out of date. You can be a very competent technician and still fail this exam. Its frustrating! My studying for this exam was scattered, and since you dont know what you get wrong or right on the test, I had no idea WHERE my weakness are/were i.e. Pharmacology, Anesthesiology, Physiology etc. WELL NO MORE! I cant tell you how this has helped me identify weaknesses and strengths! I am now studying without worry of passing as this book is exactly what every tech needs to study and pass! Great info, well written, I am learning and relearning better than the first time around in college. WORTH EVERY PENNY!!

CD with the book was a lifesaver!!"},{"Title":"Review Questions and Answers for Veterinary Technicians (3rd Edition, Book & CD-ROM)","review":"I really loved this review book to study for my VTNE. It is laid out in sections such as Medical Terms, Nursing, Pharmacology, etc. I could easily decide what I needed some extra studying in and go directly to that chapter to quiz myself. I also really love how in the answer section, a lot of the answers are explained, though not all of them are, which is one downside (though you don't really need a written out explanation for the feline dental formula). That would be the only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that while many of the answers have great explanations, some of the ones that need an explanation don't have one, while others that do have redundant explanations that basically just restate the question and say \\"this is the answer.\\" Also, some of the questions seemed tricky, but so can the VTNE be so it's possibly just following suit. Overall this was definitely worth the money and kept me busy on all of my lunch breaks for the few months up until the VTNE. I didn't buy the review book that goes along with this, though I've heard it is very useful, but I was able to go back to my textbooks for explanations when I couldn't figure something out.Bottom line: If you'd like a way to quiz yourself, get this book! It is nicely separated into different chapters to help you focus in on different areas you need to review. If you're having trouble remembering things from school, get the review book, and then maybe this book later or in conjunction. It won't really help you learn too many new things, but it will help bring to the surface what you've already learned and give you a decent feel for how you will do on the big test :)"},{"Title":"Review Questions and Answers for Veterinary Technicians (3rd Edition, Book & CD-ROM)","review":"I just recently took my california RVT exam and passed and I owe alot of my success to this book.It is definetly a go to book for studying for this type of exam."},{"Title":"Review Questions and Answers for Veterinary Technicians (3rd Edition, Book & CD-ROM)","review":"Didn't really look through the book, but the CD-ROM was great.

One negative thing about the CD generated tests, they seem to repeat sevearal of the questions (at least all of the tests I have done did this). I would prefer to have 100 different questions.

The questions do not correspond to the material in the Review book and the questions are super detailed (How many teats do specific animals have...etc) and cannot be found in the Comprehensive Review. Its basically two different \\"review\\" books. One book goes through material through an outline-type form and the other book goes through material in a question format. For example, the Anatomy and Physiology comprehensive review only has like...20 pages. The Anatomy and Physiology Review questions have 785 questions - and I had to google most of the questions and answers to get a better understanding of why those answers would be correct.The Review QUestions go through the following topics: Anatomy and Physiology, Hospital Procedures, Medical Calculations, Medical Terminology, Pharmacology, Surgical Nursing, Dentistry, Clinical Laboratory, Animal Nursing, Diagnostic Imaging, and Anesthesiology which are the topics on the Veterinary Technician Exam ([...])I found that the Comprehensive Review went through lots of things that you didn't need to know for the exam. Its alot of information that is kind of hard to memorize since it's just so much information (unless you have a photographic memory and can just read books and memorize them easily). I like the Questions and Answers book alot better - although I googled information to understand it in better detail, the helped me remember the content much easier."},{"Title":"Review Questions and Answers for Veterinary Technicians (3rd Edition, Book & CD-ROM)","review":"This book was required for my last semester of vet tech school.

And I was not working in a vet-related field during those six months so I had plenty of time to start to forget what I had learned. I was also pretty lax about studying for the upcoming test up until the final two weeks. The CD that comes with this book saved me. I spent almost no time studying my class notes from school and concentrated almost exclusively on working with the CD. The result? I passed, and with a pretty high score.The major advantage to working with this book/CD is that the questions are structured just like the ones you will encounter on the test. I swear I even recognized a few of the test questions from the book as I sailed through the exam. The major disadvantage I can see is that instead of studying the subjects in depth you are in essence \\"teaching to the test,\\" but since this is intended as a review and not a primary study guide, that's OK. I did, however, find a few questions for which the answer key was obviously incorrect, so if there's a question that you really believe you answered correctly and the CD says it's wrong, doublecheck it with other sources. I bought the review book (ISBN 978-0323052146) that goes with this one, but never even opened it. I also purchased the Peterson's review (ISBN 978-0768933727) but this was the one that I settled on as most useful.Good luck on the VTNE!"},{"Title":"Review Questions and Answers for Veterinary Technicians (3rd Edition, Book & CD-ROM)","review":"My wife used this to study for her national boards.

Not ideal for anyone. The CD eliminates that problem, but you can only run it on a desktop or laptop and cannot use it on a tablet. Since many people are starting to only have tablets, this needs to be updated somehow.Also, there are numerous errors. You choose what you know is the right answer and the CD marks it as incorrect. Sometimes they are very obvious and sometimes not. Hopefully the person studying will be familiar enough with the material to realize their answer was correct despite being marked incorrect and not second guess themselves when it comes to the VTNE.The level of the questions is well done, however. Other review books I have use very basic questions, but Mosby does seem to step it up a bit.As I said, it's a decent review, but I can't give it more than 3 stars.

The basic idea is that you think about how you would treat your grandmother and act accordingly in helping your customer.The book is enlivened by gently humorous illustrations of a grandmother by Joel Barbee.The book is a simple, pleasant read and one that will make understanding how to sell much easier for many first-time salespeople. The book is filled with examples of people selling items that are used at home (whether floorcoverings, furniture, appliances or electronic equipment for music). People who work in those areas will find the book to be just right for them.Mr. Coltran does a good job of explaining how a salesperson can go wrong. He uses a number of good examples from his own experience and that of others to reinforce his points.Best of all, the book is very commonsense. I doubt if anyone will have any problems forgetting its messages or what needs to be done. If you do have such problems, pages 191-204 will give you what you need to know.If you are a grandmother and one of your grandchildren is about to go into home product sales, this book would make a very meaningful gift.So, how can you $ell like you are selling to your grandmother today?"},{"Title":"The Saint in Europe","review":"I should mention that the Saint (a.k.a. Simon Templar) began his career by boldly seeking out adventure, and after awhile, it began coming to him. Templar mentions from time to time (e.g. in \\"The Elusive Ellshaw\\" in _The Saint Goes On_) that he also attracts women looking for lost dogs, con men looking for a mark, and a public who generally see him as \\"something between a benevolent if weak-minded uncle and a miracle-working odd job man.\\" He's adept at sorting the wheat from the chaff to find profitable adventures.\\"The Covetous Headsman\\" (Paris) - The headless body of a shipping office clerk was found in Paris - but the decapitation took place after death. Templar uses some of his old Resistance connections to solve the mystery. Note that this isn't a mystery story as such; Templar's problems generally have only 1 suspect, and aren't arranged to ensure that the reader necessarily has a fair chance at guessing things. Incidentally, the fictional story mentioned in passing is G.K. Chesterton's \\"The Secret Garden\\", from _The Innocence of Father Brown_.\\"The Angel's Eye\\" (Amsterdam) - A respectable-looking middle-aged couple approach Templar in a restaurant with a problem. The diamond cutter to whom they just delivered the Angel's Eye for recutting (on behalf of a firm of jewelers) now denies that he ever heard of it or them.\\"The Rhine Maiden\\" (The Rhine) - This is Templar's private label for a girl met on a (train) journey along the Rhine - a girl with an aura of enchantment about her, traveling with her newly retired grandfather. (His ideal of a Rhine maiden is closer to the original myth than the popular image fostered by opera singers.)\\"The Golden Journey\\" (The Tirol) - The Saint, meeting a spoiled, beautiful girl, decides to try to salvage her, by arranging matters so that she must hike overland with him to Innsbruck. While this is an unusual tack for him to take, there are precedents - \\"The Sleepless Knight\\" and \\"The Man Who Was Clever\\", for instance. Oddly enough, it also reminds me of George MacDonald's _The Wise Woman_, although stylistically they are quite different.\\"The Loaded Tourist\\" (Lucerne) - While walking up to his hotel by the lake on a dark night, Templar fails to stop two thugs from fatally stabbing a shoe manufacturer and stealing the victim's briefcase. Following the usual investigator's tack (looking for breaks in established patterns) nets an interesting collection of observations, starting with the victim: a businessman (and looking like it) in a tourist's paradise, on the eve of his immigration to the U.S.\\"The Spanish Cow\\" (Juan-les-Pins) - Templar doesn't rate the title of Saint here. The lady mentioned in the title is an aging, rich widow who hasn't done any harm. Templar's plan to steal her diamonds has no justification. What good he does is more accidental than intentional, at least initially. Not a bad story, but not consistent with the Saint's original swashbuckling philosophy.\\"The Latin Touch\\" (Rome) - Back to the old Saint, fortunately. Templar casually makes the acquaintance of Sue Inverest while sightseeing in the Colosseum - only to be knocked cold when Mafia kidnappers ambush her. (The daughter of the U.S. Secretary of State, she had eluded her escort as a lark.) Fortunately, upon Templar's awakening in jail, the Secretary has not only checked his war record with the O.S.S., but is prepared to trust him rather than risk his daughter's life to cops who may be in the Mafia's pay."},{"Title":"The Saint in Europe","review":"This is easily the best of the post-war collections of short stories, of which there are seven: they are set in Paris, Amsterdam, The Rhine, The Tyrol, Lucerne, Juan-les-Pins and Rome.Of these stories, my favourite is the fourth, \\"The Golden Journey\\". But \\"The Spanish Cow\\" is sheer entertainment, even though the Saint comes perilously close to becoming a gigolo. And \\"The Rhine Maiden\\" at least is a return to the old, pre-war Saint.P.S. For a list of -- and discussion of -- all Charteris's Saint books, see my So You'd Like To... Guide."},{"Title":"Slow Learner","review":"These five stories are all worth reading. &quot;Entropy&quot; is no doubt his most famous; first anthologized in BASS and, since then, numerous other places (even Norton anthologized it in American Literature). Pynchon writes in his elucidating intro. that this story is something like the epitome of every flaw of a young writer; but, man, he also realizes that this is his most famous short story (i.e., take his intro. with a grain of salt [whatever that cliche really means]). &quot;The Secret Integration&quot; is a wonderfully sensitive story -- and uncharacteristically NOT overwritten. It was fascinating to see the mind of a young, Cornell Pynchon at work and I believe is an inspiration for all aspiring young writers."},{"Title":"Slow Learner","review":"The intro is definately worth the book...however the last story is awesome (the secret integration) and is miles better than the other ones in the book."},{"Title":"Slow Learner","review":"pynchon's introduction to these stories is truly top-notch. he talks about being an author, what it is like to mature, and what it is to look back at work that one is soo very far removed from. this all makes for an excellnt read. the stories themselves are, for the most part, forgettable. if you do find yourself with a craving to read one of them, the last one is nearly a fine bit of work, but then, instead of sticking to his guns, pynchon spells out a fact that's already been made clear by character actions, and the story ends up feeling like something meant for middle-schoolers or a reading-comprehension trainer rather than a full short-story. of course, it could be worse. i mean, i guess it could have been printed on poinson ivy or have arsenic in the binding glue. . ."},{"Title":"Slow Learner","review":"After reading Pynchon's excellent, self-deprecating introduction to these stories, it is difficult to read the stories without searching for, and finding, elements of writerly clumsiness and naivete. The effect is similar to that of reading James Joyce's &quot;Stephen Hero&quot;: the realization that even great writers were human in their youth.I think of the preface to this book as the main body of the text, and the stories as figures and appendices elaborating on what Pynchon means when he criticizes his former self. I would not recommend this book for the intrinsic literary value of the stories -- they're not all that great, especially when compared with the Pynchon we more readily know. But as an essay about how not to write short stories, with some illustrations provided, or as a bit of Pynchon autobiography, Slow Learner is magnificent."},{"Title":"Slow Learner","review":"For those who find Thomas Pynchon frighteningly intimidating (and who doesn't?), a perusal of these stories will quickly bring The Man down a few notches where you can be certain that he once (once, long ago) was human.The stories, presented chronologically, are also a testimonial to an astounding learning curve, a man who in very little time learned from his mistakes. And there are mistakes: at times you may find yourself chuckling at the young Pynchon's overwriting or callow viewpoints. Yet these are still the works of a budding genius (my favourite, bar none!) and there glimpses aplenty.But don't buy the book for the stories alone! No no no! The candid introduction by Pynchon is the real gem here and, for all those Pynchonites, worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"Slow Learner","review":"I've read The Crying of Lot 49, as well as material about Pynchon, so expected a tough read, but found this collection of short stories surprisingly light, although the final story was excellent, thoughtful, and moving. As for the introduction, mentioned by someone as the worth of this book, he is nearly right, as it was an absolute pleasure to read, both light and witty; it wa so good that at times I simultaneously laughed and cried."},{"Title":"Slow Learner","review":"I agree with other reviewers that the fun of this book lies in Pynchon's thoughts of these early efforts. It made the reading of them much more enjoyable. It also made them seem better then they really were, since I realized they were not to be judged in the same light as his later works. So, the fifth star was for his honesty.This is a recommended read for any reader interested in the entire works of Pynchon."},{"Title":"Slow Learner","review":"This is an interesting collection of early stories, but my bet is that those who will enjoy the book most are those people who have already bought into the Pynchon mystique. I'm one of them, to be sure, so I must confess I have enjoyed it. Some of Pynchon's talents are already here on display, but what I miss the most is the irrepressible excess and the dizzying rhythm that characterizes his later prose. Some of the stories seem to flitter and fade, caught up in curiosities that are soon cast away. The settings in which Pynchon displays his talent varies: nineteenth-century espionage, a hurricane that ravages a town in Louisiana, a dysfunctional marriage. Pynchon fans will like some of those odd situations and odd characters, such as the ending of the story \\"Low-lands,\\" and the psychologist \\"Geronimo Diaz,\\" from the same story. Of great interest to Pynchon readers will be the opening essay, a blunt and detailed appraisal of the stories: a rare gesture in Pynchon. (I recommend reading it last, by the way, even though it prefaces the collection.) I titled this review \\"a second-best starting point,\\" and it is because people who read Pynchon for the first time will probably do best to choose \\"The Crying of Lot 49,\\" in which Pynchon's greatness is already well-formed, but it is encapsulated in a manageable 150 pages (as opposed to the bulkier later work)."},{"Title":"Slow Learner","review":"This is not a book that can just be read for pleasure on its own. It is very much part of Pynchon's work and has to be seen as such. The introduction is definitely interesting and surprisingly revealing. He seems to dislike CL49, and even admits that his own anoymity is due to his belief that fiction is &quot;too autobiographical&quot;, although he goes on to admit that almost every knows that part of the writer's life must go into his work, whether he wants it to or not. So perhaps this is a clue that his later works, perhaps most obviously Vineland, are more autobiographical than, say, V - which he reveals was robbed from a Baedeker he found in a secondhand book shop. The &quot;Under the Rose&quot; story is very interesting, probably the best in the collection. It is highly revealing for those puzzled by V (which means just about everyone). Indeed, although I read V a long time ago, I found this story did clear a lot up in my mind. It clarifies the idea that V is this odd woman who appears at crucial moments in history - she is, in this story, Victoria, but more generally she is a Venus that follows the hapless Goodfellow. Not all the stories are good. As Pynchon admits in his intro, parts are heavy going for the reader who wants enjoyment. But they are still fascinating for the Pynchonite who wants to humanise and demythologise the great man, and who wants to see how he found his style, despite him being a selfconfessed &quot;slow learner&quot;."},{"Title":"Slow Learner","review":"Well I am pleased that I finished another Pynchon work. Having read V., The Crying of Lot 49, and now Slow Learner-I have avoided the gigantic Gravity's Rainbow, which comes after 49 in order, mostly out of intimidation...Slow Learner seems to have been produced out of a public interest in Pynchon, perhaps out of the void of 10 years since Rainbow, as something to give us all, ever awed by his labrinthine worlds and layered stories.Though made up of five stories written from 1959-1964, and published in the Cornell Writer, New World Writing, the Kenyon Review, The Noble Savage 3 and The Saturday Evening Post, there is a sixth tale, the introduction, in which Pynchon shares his analysis and criticism of his works and his earlier self. It is a terrific piece, and suits the experience by pre-empting the stories' weaknesses with his exposure of them.Without going into them I'll just say that I enjoyed the first three very much, The Small Rain, Low-lands and Entropy. Entropy in particular was a layered, manic visceral fiction that manages to incorporate meta-physics with phychology and neurosis. I did not like Under the Rose, as I found it confusing, pre-occupied with itself and it's twists and I couldn't get into it's rhythm and so finished it in bunches. The glaring aspects of his style become annoyances here, the bizarre names, the digressions into the past, elaborate memories...The Secret Integration though is clearly his most mature, skillful work, with a haunting conclusion that resonates deeply.I feel the better for reading these works. I know he is a master of sorts, his style and execution are awesome, as well his reputation shrowded in mystery. I recommend this book...."},{"Title":"Slow Learner","review":"I had heard so many great things about Mr. Pynchon for so long that when I finally tracked down a number of his books I was sorrowly disapointed with them. After a period of staying away from his writings I summed up my courage, got &quot;Slow Learner&quot; from the library and was VERY impressed. These stories make up the beginnings of Mr. Pynchon's work and to my mind appeared much more concise and clear than his overcomplicated later works."},{"Title":"Slow Learner","review":"Yes yes yes, as omnipot says, it's fascinating to read this book to examine the learning curve that Pynchon climbed as a young man, but I felt that the most rewarding parts of the book was the auto-critical introduction. There are some marvellous moments, my favourites being his casual description of 'V.' as a 'complex philosophical allegory' (and readers of that book will be interested to read an early account of the battle between Porpentine and Bongo-Shaftsbury in 'Under the Rose'), and the way he describes 'The Crying of Lot 49': &quot;[It] was marketed as a 'novel,' and ... I seem to have forgotten most of what I thought I'd learned up till then.&quot;"},{"Title":"Slow Learner","review":"The first paragraph of the introduction is almost worth the price of the collection. For the person who has not read Thomas Pynchon, it is a first class review of what his work is like. The humor and seriousness are there, tempered with a bit of Sci-Fi whimsy. But the way that he takes the stories apart and shows what is missing, is a lesson for any budding writer. This book should be taught in many writing classes. I particularily love when he disses himself for creating a rule of writing and makes himself follow it. (The list of writers who do this very thing, is a long, long list!) I also love his comment that he was showing off his \\"Ear\\" (For dialogue) before he had actually attained one.It is nice that he left these stories in the condition that he found them, but I can't help but wonder what might have happened if he had revised or revisited them now as a master of his craft. (And then printed both versions.)Thomas Pynchon (and others) have downed these stories. But, what is poor, beginning writing for someone like Pynchon, is a level that many aspiring writers NEVER achieve. The story Entropy has been reprinted several times, so even though Pynchon finds it weak, it has great value. (At least to some editors.) The first time that I read it, I was not aware that this story was repudiated by its own author.While Pynchon really requires several hundred pages to reach the stride of his genius, I would certainaly state that these stories and introduction are an excellent place to start to read Thomas Pynchon. While he is often thought of as a writer who mines the pathway, and puts up boundries for his readers, this is far from true. Granted he is a difficult writer, and you need to know a LOT of stuff to completely \\"Get\\" what his is up to, he can be read for sheer pleasure. Get what you can and try to get more on each re-reading."},{"Title":"Blue Plate Special: A Novel of Love, Loss, and Food","review":"The main character is a food stylist, which is what intrigued my about this book from the beginning. The world of magazines and food photo shoots is hilariously observed, and the book is a comic wonder because of this inspired choice.

The loss element keeps the story subtantive so that its not just another piece of fluff. The book has hilarious characters (including an overbearing narcissist in an amoeba jumper), but the author treats all with compassion enough to make them full and true. The food styling scenes bring together Hollywood fakery with a delicious disgustingness (photographing motor oil poured on macshed potatoes to resemble a sundae).

The chapters are short--excellent for an evening's discussion. It is written in a conversational style, but filled with insights for deepening prayer, and helps for avoiding some of the common difficulties. This is a book that can be read and re-read. Fr.

The main goal of the book, and one at which it generally succeeds, is to give you an overall view of what J2EE is and how it fits into an overall IT strategy. The advantages and disadvantages of each piece of J2EE are discussed. There is very little code in the book (and what is in there could have easily been left out without any loss of clarity) so if you are looking for a book to show you how to write programs then this is not the book for you.The book has some serious drawbacks. First, the authors of this book are trying desperately to reach some level of geek coolness with mentions of The Simpsons, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Pulp Fiction, and with the use of deliberate (at least I think it is deliberate) poor grammar and spelling. But after awhile it just gets annoying. The book is probably twice as long as it needed to be because of the authors' desire to try to make the book fun. But unlike the Head First books, the \\"fun\\" here just gets tedious and turns short discussions into long and confusing discussions. (Why is a J2EE server like a dolphin? Does it like fish?) The book is also repetitive. For example, the discussion of session beans on page 48 is repeated almost verbatim (including the same picture) on page 139. The book does not cover JavaServer Faces and makes only a minimal mention of Struts. None of the other open source frameworks are discussed at all.Overall, the information in the book is accurate and there is really no other book on the market that covers the material at this level (which is why it is getting 4 stars and not 3). The authors apparently know their stuff but the book could have been a lot better."},{"Title":"J2EE 1.4: The Big Picture","review":"This book may be useful for marketing people, but it is not for software developers!Moreover the authors' attempt to make the book 'fun' is mediocre at best!If you are a software developer/programmer looking to develop J2EE applications, you are better off reading other books, likeHead First Servlets and JSP: Passing the Sun Certified Web Component Developer Examfor servlets & JSP andHead First EJB (Brain-Friendly Study Guides; Enterprise JavaBeans)for EJBs.

J2EE 1.4 is an environment that allows you to do very many things. Short for Java 1.(2) Enterprise Edition, it is a set of tools used to write large, distributed applications, although from the name, it is hard to discern that fact. Since distributed applications have many parts, simply understanding how those parts can be put together is a major undertaking. This book is designed to give the reader a broad overview of J2EE, the various components and what each is used for.There is very little code in the book. What does appear is skeletal and easy to understand. The premise is that Antoine is starting an online gourmet pizza business after being successful in selling locally. His online component is wildly successful and before long he realizes that he must scale his online business dramatically upward. The current structure of his website does not allow for rapid and efficient expansion, so his online business is in danger of collapsing under the weight of his success.The book is designed to be an overview of the different ways the components of J2EE can be used to create an application server. It is not in any way meant to be an in-depth technical manual, the goal is to explain the components of J2EE in a way that non-technical people can understand. That goal is successfully met, there is never a time where the authors rise to a technical level beyond that of someone who understands how software operates.If your goal is to learn the overall use of J2EE in creating large distributed systems, then this is the book for you. However, if you possess some technical knowledge, then it will probably not be interesting or challenging."},{"Title":"J2EE 1.4: The Big Picture","review":"The book is full of \\"cutesiness\\" which makes the book much longer than it need be.Conversely - what the book lacks is a good solid explanation, with detailed examples, of basic elements of J2EE like the Home_interface Component/Local/Remote interface - and how they actually tie-in with the Clients and RDBMS. It's not that these things aren't mentioned. They are. For example chapter12, p.148 :\\"The Home interface is kind of like a hostess at a restaurant. In fancier restaurants you don't find your own table and order your food directly from the chef; you ask the hostess to find you a seat and the hostess assigns you a waiter who talks to the chef.You ask the waiter for your food\\".Followed by 8 pages containing some codes and and explanations - that don't really explain how you connect everything together.So in conclusion - if what you want is to know the buzz-words, the book is to long.If what you need is technical detail beyond a long explanation why J2EE is like a fancy restaurant,and that: \\"The database just sits around holding data. Sometimes it hums snatches from Broadway musicals softly to itself but mostly it doesn't do much.

I've actually not finished reading it, and probably never will; I've tried three times, but end up putting it down after 20 pages every time I pick it up. I recently brought it on a plane trip with me so I had several hours with it, but it's just not possible to get very far. You truly have to suspend disbelief while reading this piece of garbage: \\"Are they really writing this? Doesn't Prentice Hall use editors? Or at least some sort of grammar check?\\"Every aspect of technology has been personified or anthropomorphized. The Dolphin is constantly talking to the Statue of Atlas who in turn talks to the Golden Retriever, but they only explain once that the Golden Retrieve equals the database server, so after five pages when you've forgotten that fact none of it makes any sense any more. You literally need Cliffs Notes to decode what the authors are talking about. All the \\"characters\\" talk to each other, with dialogue and everything. And the dialogue is AWFUL. If you can't write poetry or prose, then why bother writing a little play between the web serving Bee and the web containing Horse? Reading terrible writing is surprisingly distracting. Midway through trying to comprehend a concept the authors cut away to an example where the Scarecrow says something unbelievably stupid to the Cowardly Lion and all you can think is \\"how did this make it into the final draft?\\" Congratulations: you just wasted the last five minutes of your life, and you have nothing at all to show for it. (Aside: they actually use the characters from the Wizard of Oz to represent some concept, but the analogy is so flawed that they literally take several sentences explaining how the Tin Man represents Resource Management. You will never get those three minutes back, and you will be dumber for having read it. Shouldn't an example metaphor whose purpose is to illustrate a point be somewhat obvious?)This book is 90% filler and 100% poorly written. I just cannot figure out who the target audience is. It is not for anyone remotely technical. Anyone who is functional and has risen to a managerial role is probably too busy to deal with the ridiculousness of the book.

There was one page that I read that tells how to graduate into technical material from the web.It seems that as I go, there is more technical material, but I really don't like to have to be spoon-fed the stuff that I have already read repeatedly. I have to read the repetivie stuff to get to the more and more technical stuff as I read the later chapters.I'd rather have a book that I could highlight the main points and vocubulary and concepts and review them myself. I learned in a book called \\"How to Study in College\\" that rather than reading the same stuff over and over that if you actively study yourself, you learn more."},{"Title":"Greenwillow","review":"I read this book sometime during my growing-up years and it became my favorite book in the library. I kept myself from reading it too often so that it wouldn't become boring from over-familiarity. It is a gentle, timeless story, like a sweet dream. The end of the book is like waking up. The characterizations are so finely drawn that although they are sort of caricatures, they contain so much truth in them you can't help being drawn into the story. A must read for everyone who still values beauty and honesty in fiction."},{"Title":"Greenwillow","review":"Everyone needs to visit Greenwillow and meet its wonderful inhabitants - from the two reverends with their &quot;two ways of walking before the Lord&quot; to the irrepressible Micah who braves the devil. It is a story of a quiet, but strong love written in a way that is a joy to read. The world needs more stories like this - gentle and true, heartwarming and humorous. That this book is out-of-print is a travesty. It should be required reading for all ages."},{"Title":"Greenwillow","review":"One of the best books I have ever read -- BJ Chute has woven a tale of loyalty, love and humor into a timeless classic. The whimsical town of Greenwillow will draw you in and keep you hooked until the very last page. Chute's characters are eccentric and irresistible -- you'll read of sweet Dorie who bakes bilberry tarts and dreams of a happy ending; the cow that kneels down at Christmas; two Reverends battling over good and evil -- and Gideon, who loves the land with a passion we can only envy. I've read this book at least 15 times, and have never gotten tired of it -- in fact, its appeal grows with each passing year."},{"Title":"Greenwillow","review":"This is my favorite book in the world. It is the perfect book. I read my old beat-up-but-well-loved copy of it once a year, to maintain my equilibrium. It is simple, funny, and beautiful. Once you read it you will never forget it."},{"Title":"Greenwillow","review":"\\"Long ago, centuries perhaps, the village of Greenwillow had been stood in the corner and forgotten.\\" And so begins one of the most enchanting books ever to be written. BJ Chute has taken a cosy, quaint village and transformed it into a magical place populated with some of the most endearing characters that have ever appeared on a page. The whimsical town of Greenwillow will draw you in and keep you hooked until the very last page. Chute's characters are eccentric and irresistible -- you'll read of sweet Dorie who bakes bilberry tarts and dreams of a happy ending; the cow that kneels down at Christmas; two Reverends battling over good and evil -- and Gideon, who loves the land with a passion we can only envy. It's a story of courage and love and humor - and maybe, just maybe, a wish come true. Sit down with this book and you will be transported into another world - the world of Greenwillow.UPDATE (12/10/10): I just read the story again (for perhaps the 15th time) and once again, was transported into the world of Greenwillow. No matter how often I read this book, its appeal grows each and every time."},{"Title":"Greenwillow","review":"This is a charming little idyll about a small village, pretty well isolated from the outside world, which has two preachers, one a fire and brimstone fundamentalist, the other a gentle man of uncertain creed, but great heart. The main plot is a love story. Much of the charm of the book lies in the imaginative poetry of Chute's prose. When he describes a meadow, you can hear the bees on their rounds."},{"Title":"Greenwillow","review":"I can't tell whether it is the people (calling them characters is misleading), the precisely crafted prose, the humor, the plot that meanders like Greenwillow's river, the tension between two fundamental views of God which might be called &quot;Just&quot; and &quot;Merciful&quot;, the overwhelming gentleness, or the hopefulness that reawakens in me toward the human race when I read this book, that makes me love it so much. Originally published in the 1950s, it should never be out of print for even one moment. We need Greenwillow now, more than ever."},{"Title":"Greenwillow","review":"I first read this book as a teenager after my very literate aunt recommended it. I go back to it over and over again for the wonderful language and story. I have carefully guarded my original copy, and am so pleased to see it back in print."},{"Title":"Greenwillow","review":"This is simply one of the most beautiful, and most beautifully written, novels in English. Every sentence is a jewel of construction, filled with humor. I re-read it regularly to remind me of why I love to read.

If you have an appreciation for our language, and a human heart in you, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Greenwillow","review":"I've read this book a hundred times, and it still makes me happy. It's beautifully written."},{"Title":"Greenwillow","review":"Like many other reviewers of this small classic, I first read it as a teenager. I can't wait to share it with my granddaughter. My original copy is in tatters, so I have ordered another copy for me and one for my daughter and granddaughter. The magic of the village and its inhabitants is reminiscent of Treegap in Tuck Everlasting (written almost twenty years later), but the magic of Greenwillow is the realistic, comfortable, and available sort of magic that is firmly rooted in the traditional values of family, love, and friendship. You'll empathize with the villagers, laugh with them (and even, though not cruelly, AT a few of them), hope with them, and cry with them, sharing their struggles, trials, and triumphs from beginning to end. This is a book to be read, reread, and shared - there's no growing tired of the story, its characters, or its truths. Keep it on your top shelf where it's always accessible!"},{"Title":"Investing in Silver","review":"Eric Delieb has written a most interesting book on silver. Instead of a dry catalogue of makers and objects, he talks about these pieces in their historical context, the story of these items. He focuses on small items rather than the grand pieces. He really brings alive these little items and makes you understand why they are interesting and of value and how they really were used during their active lifetimes. He also points out how certain pieces and ideas evolved and how the styles changed..Who knew that tea-kettles were quite rare during the first decade of the 1700's? This was such a good book,I ordered his book on Boxes,also highly recommended.These books are recommended for those that would like to know all about their little pieces of old silver and what kind of life they led, and what ideas were behind their shapes and styles"},{"Title":"Tarzan and the jewels of Opar","review":"I was completely sucked into this book from page one. It has been several years since I read the first four books in this series (tracking down this book proved problematic, to say the least).After finishing this book I came to the conclusion that this is ERB's version of the classic cursed gold stories of the Norse sagas, (Neibelugileid..if I spelled that right, or the Volsung saga. More modern times, Wagner's Ring Cycle, and Lord of the Rings.)This book takes place of the course of one or two weeks, the time line is very very energy charged. Except for the few days where Tarzan has his amnesia and decides to loll about the jungle, no idea that he needs to save Jane.Jane is pretty impressive in this book, she doesn't let herself be a complete damsel in distress, she makes several escape attempts and is remarkably tough when it comes to finding out that her husband is dead. (So she and many others think).Of course she isn't the imperial seductress that La is designed to be. Who is a very interesting character to see in action, she is a spoiled child for the most part, who's only sympathy can be aroused when Tarzan is around.None of the bad guys in this are cartoonish, they all have sympathetic moments and times when ERB gives us insight into their character.I really enjoyed this book, I can't reccomend it highly enough and I really wish it was more widely available."},{"Title":"Tarzan and the jewels of Opar","review":"It is fun to ride the imaginary time machine back to read a Tarzan tale by E. R. Burroughs (1875-1950) again, to swing in the Congo jungles without fear from branch to branch vicariously with the Ape Man, to save lives, humans and animals. This volume contains twenty-four chapters.A young Belgian officer stationed in the Congo because of past bad behavior is affected by the isolation, loses his mind, shoots his superior officer who he imagines is tormenting him, and escapes after shooting and killing a sentry. He runs until he is exhausted, when he is found by the head man of his enemies, slave raiding Arabs. The officer, seeing his life in danger, tells the Arab that he was running from the Europeans to join him. The Arab is distrustful but decides to give him a chance. Months go by and the officer impresses the Arab. Then the Arab reveals his plan. He wants to capture Tarzan, force him to give him much of his wealth, and, if he refuses, kidnap his ravishing wife and sell her into slavery. The officer is appalled at the idea but agrees so that he might not be killed. They plan that the officer will disguise himself as a hunter and find Tarzan. So ends chapter 1.Tarzan is civilized at this time because and only because of his wife Jane, but he longs to strip himself of his European clothes and return to the jungle, jump from trees upon animals who will be his food, and eat their flesh raw and drink their blood, like an animal. He is known as John Clayton and Lord Greystoke, and has a vast African estate. The officer encounters him, and Lord Greystoke and Lady Greystoke offer him hospitality. While at their bungalow, he overhears Tarzan and Jane talking. The money Tarzan had invested in England has been lost. Now he must shed his clothes and return to Opar and take more precious goods from there. The officer contacts the Arab and they decide to follow Tarzan and take the goods from him. Tarzan drops his clothes, puts on the scant garment that he enjoys wearing, and sets out for Opar with fifty natives who respect him. So ends chapter 2 and so begins a great Tarzan adventure."},{"Title":"Tarzan and the jewels of Opar","review":"Yes, the famous ape-man gets amnesia, but it isn't old, because this is the FIRST time he loses his memory. And really, you have to wonder if he kind of likes it that way, because he really finds civilization to be a drag.And also, Tarzan gets, um... raped. Sort of. No details, but it isn't that hard to figure out. We should all be so lucky as to be raped by the High Priestess of the Flaming God.Opar is bad news. Every time anybody goes there, they get sacrificed or eaten or buried in rubble or, in this case, get amnesia. Gold is a solid investment, but really, this place is bad mojo.But the book is good adventure. Jane shows that she can be more than a damsel in distress, though she can be that, too. Tarzan has to deal with villains both savage and civilized, and with his own amnesia. La is, well, La. She will show up again in this series of books, and she's in fine form here. If there were ever to be ACCURATE Tarzan movies made, this one would break box-office records.You shouldn't start with this book; you need to know about the first time the Big T visited Opar."},{"Title":"Tarzan and the jewels of Opar","review":"Will purchase from this seller again. Shipping was on time and product was in the condition stated in the description."},{"Title":"Warrant for X","review":"In Philip MacDonald's world, the butler just may have done it. I was watching a movie \\"23 Paces to Baker Street\\" (1956), about a blind man (Van Johnson) overhearing a kidnap and murder plot. The credits said based on a story by Philip MacDonald. The story turns out to be Warrant for X.With a few differences, the story was going paralleling the film then I recognized the name of Anthony Gethryn. It turns out that this book is part of a series that includes Colonel Gethryn. I have even seen another movie with him in it that was totally different from 23 paces but matched the book to a tee. \\"The List of Adrian Messenger\\" (1963) where George C. Scott plays Anthony Gethryn.Naturally the book s more complex than the movie. And just incase you come in the middle of the series as I did; there is sufficient references to earlier novels to keep you from getting lost. The mystery will keep you and the edge of your seat and just as you think they have a handle on \\"the who, what and why,\\" they are off and running again."},{"Title":"S IS FOR SPACE","review":"Ray Bradbury's _S is for Space_ (1966) is a companion collection to _R is for Rocket_ (1962). I remember that there was mild critical disappointment when these collections first appeared. The problem was not with the quality of the stories-- which were quite good-- but over the fact that most of them were \\"recycled Bradbury\\". That is, they were tales that had been previously published in other collections. Nowadays, this doesn't seem to be an issue of great importance.\\"The Pedestrian\\" is here, one of Bradbury's best. It's the short, tight little gem about the last pedestrian who one night encounters the last police car. The world of this story, with shadowy figures glued to their television sets, is the world of _Fahrenheit 451_ (1953). The story was first published in _The Reporter_, a news weekly that deserved a longer life than it had.\\"Pillar of Fire\\" is a novelette length manic tribute to Edgar Alan Poe and fantastic Romanticism. A hate-filled madman rises from the dead and wreaks havoc on a rational, ordered, emotionless society. Ask yourself with whom you identify.\\"The Man\\" is the one about the spaceship captain searching from planet to planet for the second coming of Christ. James Blish (1964) pointed out a theological flaw in the story. An omnipotent God could arrange for a second coming simultaneously on all planets without requiring His Messiah to travel from one planet to another by rocket. But I think that Bradbury's main point still stands: There will always be people who are looking for a grail over the next horizon.There are two stories from _The Martian Chronicles_ (1950): \\"Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed,\\" about the Earth colonists who go native; and \\"The Million Year Picnic,\\" about a family's encounter with the \\"new Martians\\" that closes the chronicles.Bradbury has a love-hate relationship with flying machines, and this is demonstrated in two fables: \\"Icarus Montgolfier Wright\\" and \\"The Flying Machine\\". The first was made into an excellent short movie animated by Joseph Mugnaini and narrated by Ross Martin.When I was in high school, a classmate of mine was nicknamed (for reasons that I have long since forgotten) The Fungus. When he entered a room, he would cheerfully say, \\"There's a fungus amungus\\". \\"Come Into My Cellar\\" is a story about fungi. They may be among us even now.Other stories include \\"Crysalis,\\" one of Bradbury's earliest solo stories (his very earliest pieces were colaborations); \\"Time in Thy Flight,\\" a reflection of Bradbury's love of Halloween; \\"The Smile,\\" a nod to Leonardo da Vinci and a savage attack against American anti-intellectualism; and \\"The Trolley,\\" an exercise in nostalgia. Here in Chattanooga, there are still places where we have tracks where the old trolley cars used to run. Every so often, somebody talks about bringing them back. But so far, nothing much has come of it. Too expensive. The economy won't allow it. We'd have to raise taxes. Maybe next year, you betcha.These are stories representing Bradbury at his best. Many of his later tales would have the style and the sentiment as these-- but not quite the same substance or sparkle._Reference_: Blish, James. \\"Cathedrals in Space\\". In _The Issue at Hand_. Chicago: Advent, 1964, 57-58."},{"Title":"S IS FOR SPACE","review":"I'll start with mentioning a couple forms of reading I sometimes do NOT like. I sometimes don't like short story collections that are written in a fashion requiring excessive reader \\"work\\" in constructing the environment. You figure out what's going on . . . and it's over and time to start the next story (I know this sounds lazy, but I do often read for relaxation). And, I sometimes do not enjoy science-fiction that is overly technical, or overwhelms me with bizarre foreign names, terms, and political systems. This book is none of the above.This is a wonderful collection of easy reading and imaginative sci-fi short stories. Fit for readers of any age, it is the kind of stuff that makes one hunger for more science fiction (or more Ray Bradbury, anyway).I found myself looking forward to the world to be found in each successive story, and certainly was saddened to reach the end of the short book.There is a sister work, \\"R is for Rocket\\", which is more of the same good stuff.I promise you'll enjoy this."},{"Title":"S IS FOR SPACE","review":"I believe that S is for Space is THE best book I have ever read. There are several short stories that are entertaining and easy to understand. Bradbury once again captures the human essence in a series of stories. This is a great book for beginners or even advanced readers."},{"Title":"S IS FOR SPACE","review":"This book is a collection of short stories by Ray Bradbury, all of which are excellent. This particular copy arrived in very good condition; I would say better than as described, considering the age of this edition. This is a copy from the 1970's, and apparently it inhabited a bookshelf, because the spine wasn't even cracked (as tends to happen with trade paperbacks). I love good books, and treat them with great care. This one is a most treasured part of my collection."},{"Title":"S IS FOR SPACE","review":"I remember reading this book from cover to cover when I was a kid and I still love every story. Ray Bradbury always had a way to cross genres from Horror to Science Fiction so effortlessly. Zero Hour is the tale that made the most impact on me and I still re-visit the story and stories in this wonderful book today."},{"Title":"S IS FOR SPACE","review":"Viewed in the context of modern sci-fi, there's something almost childlike about Ray Bradbury's stories. They are so important and brilliant and fundamental that they've acquired the strength and power of fairy tales: something so central to the future development of narrative fiction that they MUST be reckoned with. \\"S is for Space\\" is my favorite of his collections, but they all have stories to make you smack your forehead from feelings of inadequacy."},{"Title":"S IS FOR SPACE","review":"\\"S is for Space\\" by Ray Bradbury, 1966This is a nice collection of stories. Like \\"Dandelion Wine,\\" these are not 'science fiction' stories herein, or rather some are, some are not. It is interesting how he seems to use phrases that sound so elegant, but after reading different ones for the third or fourth time in different stories, you get to expect them and are not so interesting, more, \\"ho, hum, here's another.\\"'Chrysalis' - Poor Smith has become a chrysalis. Rockwell has been taking care of him and dimly understands what is happening. Hartley has been around, but is not happy about it. Smith scares him as some sort of unknown, or just something that could take over the world with out much trouble. In the end they are both right and Smith just goes somewhere else.'Pillar of Fire' - This is the oddest story in this book. A fellow come back to life and goes on a killing spree because he can and it just makes him mad that in the future world he has come to, death is not a problem. Seemingly, people in this future world, are not bothered by dieing, nor by others dieing. No one gets upset that Lantry is killing any number of people for no good reason and wholesale at that. In the end he is barely found out, and reasonably, there being not much a society can do to punish a dead man, they just put back to being dead.'Zero Hour' - The invasion is coming. The children are playing at something they do not understand. The parents get the idea too late.'The Man' - Christ has come again to some other world. Captain Hart has landed on a new planet, looking for some business for his profit. He gets confused with who has been here before him, by a few days. He thought it was some competitor or other, but as they land later on dead or hurt, it could not have been them, so who had been there? He aims to find out somehow or other. Some of his crew decide to stay and he goes off. The oddest part is the civilized way he tries to get the information he wants, no torture or beatings, just questions and answers, and wailing that he is not getting anywhere. Than, when his crew abandons his ship, he just says, \\"Okay, bye.\\"'Time in Thy Flight' - A school trip gone bad. The kids travel back in time to 1928 and do not want to leave. Maybe improvement is not really an improvement.'The Pedestrian' - Mr. Leonard Mead likes to go for walks, but he is the only one in this future world who does. He gets picked up by the automated cops for not being normal.'Hail and Farewell' - Willie is an odd boy of twelve or so. He does not age. After staying for a couple, three years, folks start to talk and wonder about him. He moves on to another town, to another pair, or person, for parents who would like to have him as their own. He gives comfort and love to those who have not had their own children. They give him a place to stay.'Invisible Boy' - Old Lady is a witch who can not do any tricks. Charlie is a little boy she would like to keep her company, but he wants to go home. He does get away, and she is sad.'Come Into My Cellar' - An odd fungus is going to take over the world, maybe.'The Million Year Picnic' - A fantasy of living on Mars. A young family takes a trip, actually the last trip made to Mars from Earth, for a picnic. But in the first couple of days there, the Earth becomes unreachable because of some war or cataclysm. They are stuck on Mars for the foreseeable future. This is no surprise to the parents. The children are amenable to staying, though they do wonder about what has happened to Earth. This is an odd story of hope and moving on and the destruction of the world.'The Screaming Woman' - This is a detective story. A little girl hears a woman screaming from under ground. Apparently her father and anyone else around there does not hear the screaming as well, wrong time to be listening or something. She goes around to find out whose wife is missing and finds that out, but still no one is trying to help her get this screaming woman out of the ground. The last thing is the woman sings a song only this little girls dad knows. Finally, he goes to help her dig up the woman and solve the mystery.'The Smile' - In the future, people will be mad about how the past has bought them to such a poor present and they take it out on remnants and artifacts from the past. They destroy what reminds them of a glorious past.'Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed' - Another Mars settlement story. The settlers explore and live and become Martians. Eventually they 'channel' old Martian knowledge: names of places and things; and grow to look like Martians.'The Trolley' - A nostalgic story of a trolley that was being replaced. The trolley picks up kids on the way to a picnic, to relive the days of old glory when people used the trolley to get to the park for holidays or weekend outings, on last time.'The Flying Machine' - Military fear of new innovations in old China.'Icarus Montgolfier Wright' - It is amazing what some people can get published. This is something that seems to be about flying, but it gets all wrapped up in one person who gives the story it's name."},{"Title":"Substitute ingredients","review":"The book is pretty much as described in the &quot;Editorial Review&quot;; that is, &quot;A collection of imaginative language arts, math, and art activities for grades 3-8.

Her books featuring travels in the company of her (at the time) young daughter, Rachel, are particularly harrowing: \\"Eight Feet in the Andes\\", \\"On a Shoestring to Coorg\\" and \\"Cameroon with Egbert\\" are fine examples, as is this book.Ms. Murphy goes where only the indigenous folks live, and, occasionally, where they are smart enough not to live, and, in this book, to the Northern Areas of Pakistan/India where it is now unlikely that a Westerner could venture, safely or not.Walking was her mode of travel along the Indus and, at the outset, she and Rachel enjoyed fine accommodations, to wit: \\"...we have a cell with dirty bedding, no table or chair, a fifteen-watt bulb, no water for the reeking Western loo, and no heating. (A few moments ago I had to stop writing to sit on my hands for long enough to thaw them.)\\"But the sublime power of ice, rubble, thin air and the stark beauty of the mountains worked magic despite ritual victimization by government officials and guest house managers along the way. By the time they arrived back in Skardu, Dervla was already planning to return."},{"Title":"Where the Indus is young: A winter in Baltistan","review":"I read this book four months ago, and was so impressed I am now buying every Dervla Murphy book I can get my hands on. Why is this fabulous Irish travel writer not better known? She has the most unusual adventures and is diligent with her journal writing, which forms the basis of her books. True, this was written in the early 1970s, but her books are timeless. Only an occasional reference to current events makes the reader aware that this occurred several years ago.It's amazing that a European woman would go trekking in the Baltistan region of Pakistan in the middle of winter, but the fact that she brought her precocious 6-year-old daughter along under such conditions is shocking! She does purchase a pony for little Rachel to ride, but a child that would endure the cold, hunger and hardships with scarcely a whimper may be the most astonishing aspect of all. One may question the advisability of exposing a child to such deplorable conditions, but I suspect Rachel evolved into an equally intrepid traveler as her Mum.Murphy is the ballsiest woman adventurer whose books I've had the pleasure to read. Perhaps the world was a more innocent place a few decades ago, but she has a faith in humanity that's richly rewarded. This book is clearly one of her best.

In some respects it recalls travel journals written by literary men in the past, such as Sterne's (Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy, Goethe's (Italian Journey) or Voltaire's (Letters from England) , as it combines descriptive details about particular regions with a modicum of philosophizing and social critique.The first two pieces in the book deal with Sri Lanka (known in the fifties when this book was written as Ceylon). Bowles lived in Weligma, South Ceylon from 1952 to 1959. A black-and-white photo (all the pictures acompanying the text or B&amp;W) depicts the incredibly lush vista he enjoyed from his veranda. The beauty of the place is largely counterbalanced by Bowles' descriptions of the intolerable heat and humidity of the region, which combined with the incessant swarms of mosquitoes, made a good night's sleep about impossible. This would be a recurring motif throughout the reports. Finding lodging and adequate sleeping arrangements were constant aggravations in the out-of-the way environs Bowles visits.When Bowles writes of out-of-the way destinations, they really are remote in the strictest sense of the word. He takes the reader to regions that were (and are, for the most part) seldom visited by western travellers, and there are good reasons these are not popular tourist spots. Most of the towns don't possess what any western traveller would think of as a hotel. In practically every town (and that is a loose description as well) the only place a traveller can find quarters is at some hovel, where electricity, much less plumbing, is a rarity.The reader may ask, why did Bowles choose to visit such remote habitats? The answer to that lies in his section on the Sahara, in which he talks about the &quot;Baptism of Solitude,&quot; a motif that is of great significance in his major novel, The Sheltering Sky. Bowles describes it here: &quot;You leave the gate of the fort or the town behind, pass the camels lying outside, go up into the dunes, or out into the hard, stony plain and stand awhile, alone. Presently, you will either shiver and hurry back inside the walls, or you will go on standing there and let something very peculiar happen to you, something that everyone who lives there has undergone and which the French call &quot;le bapteme de la solitude.&quot; It is a unique sensation and has nothing to do with loneliness, for loneliness presupposes memory. Here, in this wholly mineral landscape lighted by stars like flares, even memory disappears; nothing is left but your own breathing and the sound of your heart beating. A strange, and by no means pleasant, process of reintegration begins inside you, and you have the choice of fighting against it, and insisting on remaing the person you have always been, or letting it take its course. For no one who has stayed in the Sahara for awhile is quite the same as when he came.&quot;This quote, which is central to this book, both literally and figuratively, is also at the core of Bowles' entire ouvre. He writes repeatedly of the individual in isolation, but always redefining and reconfiguring the terms and meaning of &quot;isolation.&quot;I don't know how much T. H. Lawrence Bowles read, but there are some definite parallels in the lives of the two men. Both are expatriates (Lawrence from Britain, Bowles from America) who were committed to and seduced by the desert, and by the predominately Moslem cultures they interacted with. They were also equally seduced by hardship and discomfort, actually revelling in extremely unpleasant conditions, which would repulse and defer most of their countrymen. I am sure that Lawrence had his initial Baptism of Solitude shortly after his arrival in the Sahara himself. He even describes a similar transformation in his description of the desert in his Seven Pillars of Wisdom.Bowles is an author with whom every serious reader should become familiar. His prose is uniformly excellent. He has great descriptive power and captures the nuances of foreign customs and cultures more than adroitly. This may prove to be a good starting point for those unfamiliar with his novels or his other works. He was an accomplished composer as well. He was an Eastern beacon to the Beat Generation. Every important Beat writer made a sojourn to Tangiers, where Bowles held court for many years. He also lived a fascinating life in other respects and his wife, Jane, also wrote an intriguing novel of her own that I would likewise recommend."},{"Title":"Their heads are green and their hands are blue","review":"If you are wondering about that title, it's an Edward Lear Lyric:Far and few, far and few,Are the lands where the Jumblies live;Their heads are green and their hands are blue,And they went to sea in a Sieve.This is a collection of eight travel essays all written in the 1950's. Bowles' sets down quite simply why he travels, &quot;Each time I go to a place I have not seen before, I hope it will be as different as possible from the places I already know.&quot; And it is not different landscapes(which alone are of &quot;insufficient interest&quot;) he seeks but different peoples, &quot;North Africa without its tribes, inhabited by, let us say, the Swiss, would be merely a rather more barren California.&quot; And there is always the pleasant feeling when leaving ones own homeland of becoming a stranger in someone elses. Anyone who knows Bowles immaculate tales of delicate strangers purposely stranded will find this book a light read but also a pleasant and informative diversion into the Arab world. My favorite essay is &quot;The Rif, to music&quot;. Bowles finds the key to Morocco's culture in its music. Their traditons and histories are not written down but rather passed down in song. In this chapter Paul is at work compiling what will eventually be the definitive collection of North African tribal music(now in the library of congress). To do so he has to travel to remote regions with tape recorder and runs into every difficulty imaginable with local governments and with the musicians themselves. Bowles laments the fact that the purity of the tribal music is vanishing as travel permits the musicians to play for larger and larger groups which has had diminishing effect on the music. The musicians play shorter and slicker versions of their music to please the crowds. There is a Bowles poem(though it is not in this book) which addresses this called Delicate Song:It was a long trip back.White lilies waved by walls.The sweat from blue grapesShone like glass.A wind blown straight from the harborBrushed the long grass.I suppose we thought of the harborAnd of how it looked with its blue waterAnd its sailboats moving.But even though the wind smelt of wavesAnd of the swamp grass nearerOur thoughts were of the road.Flutes are scarcer these daysAnd flutists are unskilled.The white lilies were by walls.The music does still exist though. An excellent CD was released in 1992, The Master Musicians of Jajouka, &quot;Apocalypse Across the Sky&quot;(Axiom). If they ever stop playing, legend holds, the world will end."},{"Title":"Their heads are green and their hands are blue","review":"I must disagree with the review written by T. Ross. The essays on travel are not dated any more than Paul Bowles wonderful prose is, which borders on the poetic. Certainly these essays were written in the fifties, but Bowles portraits of North Africans (and European settlers) are so vivid one can almost feel them breathe. The essay concerning Mustafa, a male Muslim and his beliefs should be required reading for the State Department, the Pentagon, and the Administration. As a poet and writer I appreciated Bowles style and his skill in presenting physical, philosophical and emotional landscapes. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Their heads are green and their hands are blue","review":"I like this book better than some of Mr. Bowles' longer fictional efforts. He is good at relatively short accounts, where his rich life experiences are related through highly descriptive prose. Bowles captures the abnormal psychology of the planet itself moreso than that of the individual, which is better left to Camus or Faulkner. Also, he is able to find some humor and meaning in the Western-Arab relationship, which helps relieve some of the strain of our current showdown, which Mr. Bowles foresaw. Especially funny to me is an account by Bowles of finding a filthy rag at the bottom of a pail of murky water he and his Arab travelmate had been using for drinking water. They up and left the \\"hotel\\" (and town) that day.Also of interest are chapters on Ceylon.Bowles seems to be more capable writing about real people and events than he is when functioning in the only slightly altered world of his fiction. I think it has something to do with him being an emotional loner. Like Sartre, he is more of an observer, more of a thinker, than a writer, so his fictional characterizations are, like Sartre's, often wooden and unconvincing (to me at least). To this viewpoint, he would strongly object I think. But, notice I refrain from calling him a moralist or a philosopher. If he were a painter, I would classify him as a post-impressionist like Matisse (great colorist, intriguing designs, romantic, but limited by \\"decorative\\" priorities.) And, like Matisse, he never really shocks me like a true Fauve because, no matter how gruesome the details of the narrative, his narrative voice is always too cultivated. He can't help it; he's from New England. For his fictional style to match the content, his manner would need to be cruder, like Kirchner or Vlaminck. And he is really not a portrait artist like Dickens, Joyce or Faulkner either. Or, maybe it's that his portraits capture places and milieus moreso than individual psyches. In this book, it doesn't matter because he is truly in his element: he travels wildly, observes meticulously and remembers creatively."},{"Title":"Their heads are green and their hands are blue","review":"The title comes from one of Edward Lear's \\"nonsense\\" poems, \\"The Jumblies\\":Far and few, far and few,Are the lands where the Jumblies live;Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,And they went to sea in a Sieve.Throughout his life, Paul Bowles traveled the world as if on a quest for the Exotic, the Alien, the Other -- those whom staid Westerners, smug in their own provinciality, tend to relegate to the periphery as the Jumblies. This book collects eight of Bowles's essays, all circa 1950-1960. The settings are North Africa (mostly Morocco, which for decades was Bowles's home base), Ceylon, southernmost India, and Istanbul.Twice I have tried reading novels by Bowles, both times quite unsuccessfully. His fiction was somehow too cold and forbidding, too alien even. His non-fiction, at least the pieces collected in THEIR HEADS ARE BLUE, is much better. His is a distinctive voice. It is both distanced and intimate, dispassionate yet compassionate. Bowles is ever curious, yet he also is discriminating. He accepts the Jumblies without moral judgment, but he doesn't try to pretend that in any way he is one of them. And his descriptive writing of exotic settings and landscapes is first-rate. The first three pieces in particular are small gems of travel-writing.Two subjects stand out. The first is the Saharan desert. Bowles depicts it as an inhuman environment, which nonetheless is seductive. \\"Why go? The answer is that when a man has been there and undergone the baptism of solitude he can't help himself. Once he has been under the spell of the vast, luminous, silent country, no other place is quite strong enough for him, no other surroundings can provide the supremely satisfying sensation of existing in the midst of something that is absolute.\\" (Not unlike, in my experience, the canyonlands of southeastern Utah.)Even fifty, sixty years ago, the foreign cultures that Bowles depicts were changing, as Western ideas and technology encroached upon them, and as a colonial political structure gave way to independence. And this is the second recurring theme of THEIR HEADS ARE BLUE. Bowles is more insightful than many regarding this transition. (For instance: \\"My own belief is that the people of the alien cultures are being ravaged not so much by the by-products of our civilization, as by the irrational longing on the part of members of their own educated minorities to cease being themselves and become Westerners.\\")And he relates a few telling anecdotes. One takes place at a dinner in Marrakech during the French occupation. A Frenchman, smiling, tries to defend the French occupation to a Moroccan across the table. \\"But look at the facts, mon cher ami. Before our arrival, there was constant warfare between the tribes. Since we came the population has doubled. Is that true or not?\\" The Moroccan, also smiling, replies: \\"We can take care of our own births and deaths. If we must be killed, just let other Moroccans attend to it. We really prefer that.\\""},{"Title":"Their heads are green and their hands are blue","review":"Here we see into the mind of the Muslim. It is a startling, stark land influenced by the harsh desert and harsher religion. Quite interesting as this is kind of the pure view where much of the worlds news is now stemming from."},{"Title":"Their heads are green and their hands are blue","review":"Paul Bowles's collection of travel pieces dating from 1950-1963 reveals a love of solitude and the unfamiliar road in a time when American influence began to dominate the post-war world. Seeking refuge from growing American conformity at home, Tangier, Morocco became Bowles's permanent address in 1947. Tangier made an ideal jumping-off point for Bowles, who visited Sri Lanka (Ceylon) in 1950, Cape Coromin, India in 1952, Istanbul, Turkey in 1953, and made frequent trips into Morocco and the Sahara, where he documented and recorded its music and musicians.His travel writing can be at once witty and withering. Many of his observations are about the discomforts and disappointments of traveling; reading the more sour reports one might wonder why he put himself through all the trouble. Bowles obviously relished his role as the cultural outsider, and enjoyed writing about drugs, sex, and traditions the West found taboo. The people he describes are individuals, sketched boldly and without reserve. A trip to Ketama, \\"the kif center of all North Africa,\\" becomes a chance to provide an extensive description of Morocco's drug culture.His willingness to describe the whole of his experience makes Bowles's writing more than mere reporting -- from an unexpected swarm of flies, to the unrelenting sun, to the cool desert night and the noisy neighbors in an overcrowded hotel. He was blunt about writing these pieces for pay (and published in American travel magazines) but the result remains an engaging and entertaining collection."},{"Title":"Their heads are green and their hands are blue","review":"Reprint of 1957 collection of eight travel essays by the well-known novelist. Though they include pieces on modern Sri Lanka, Turkey and South America, the book is at its most insightful in North Africa, where Bowles has lived a great deal of his life. While the book is not really about religion, despite the suggestive nature of the subtitle, it is in most ways about different modes of spirituality and belief. Whether this involves hexes, the spirits of animals, the solitude of the desert, Bowles is attempting to present an alternative vision. Some of the language and indeed the attitudes he takes could be considered very dated by today's standards, and some of the writing borders on whining about poor conditions. But the essays are still valuable for their portraits of newly independent countries struggling with their identities. His glib generalizations on the relative merits and effects of narcotic vs. those of alcohol are somewhat silly, as are some of his observations on nationalism and cultural tradition. But, each piece is a quick read, and well worth it if you have any interest in the areas written about."},{"Title":"Their heads are green and their hands are blue","review":"Unable to write a review of the above title; the book was given to someone as a gift.

Several pictures show items of field, service and special dress mixed or worn wrongly. Models present a real nightmare for any average sergeant-major: unshaved, long hairs, wearing totally unfitted uniforms (too small or too long sleeves, blouses and trousers are not pressed etc). The art of wrapping putties (see pre-1945 section) must be a great mystery to them (and to the authors). All this is described as \\"non-regulation manner of wear\\" but in fact present a group of scarecrows rather than regular soldiers.I remember my first sergeant-major who used to say that a real soldier is expected to kill an enemy by his look and appearance. I think - he was telling us the truth.

I agree with Mr. Barkovskiy's review regarding the live model photos being sloppy; using live models for uniform books has been around for some time, so it is rather disappointing that the author failed to match up his friends (models) to the appropriately sized uniforms and hats.Most of the uniforms are severly wrinkled, to the point of distraction. The sniper girl on page 38 is wearing a skirt and jacket so wrinkled, you might not notice her hat is 4 sizes too big...or that the sniper scope in her hand is certainly not going on that standard straight-bolt Mosin Nagant rifle! The same rifle and scope appear \\"next to each other\\" several more times in the book. It's not the sniper version with the turned-down bolt; placing the scope next to it doesn't make it a sniper rifle, either.The guy on page 35 has an open fly! Oops! Forgot to button that... Page 41, the guy's glasses are on crooked. Page 69--necktie is lose, jacket too big. Page 98--necktie is loose, jacket 2 sizes too small for model. P.105--jacket so small, model cannot button it all the way. P.109--these two guys look like hotel doormen hanging out in the bathroom on their first day at work in their ill-fitting uniforms. It would be easy to pick apart every page, but you get the idea. Medals look hastily pinned-on moments prior to the photos being taken, hats are too small, neckties are loose, etc. I would like to have seen more detailed photos on the canteens, helmets, gas masks, etc. in addition to the twelve variations of exactly the same hat the author has on at least two full pages.A running textual commentary on the development of the uniforms would have been nice, but all this book has is a dis-jointed array of specific photo comments. There was no real organization other than a broad sweep of three eras and military branches.To end on a positive note, however, I purchased this book considering the one review it had (2 stars--M. Barkovskiy), and was prepared for the sloppy live model photos. They do at least show real uniforms, not paintings or drawings. And seeing them on real people is better than on a dummy or coat hanger. The quality of the photography is great (lighting, composition, crispness of details), and the historical photos are a real plus. I appreciate the work the author put into his book; it's a shame he didn't pay attention to those last-minute details.I'll give him another chance by purchasing his newer uniform book on the WWII period. Hopefully, improvements will have been made based on his first experience."},{"Title":"Fraffly well spoken: How to speak the language of London's West End","review":"wonker nurnley sair this isser chommin bookin effry wear.

Freeman's style is extremely readable, particularly when you consider the era in which it was written. Yes, the four volumes are a bit intimidating when you look at them on the shelf, but is is quiet surprising how fast they read and how much important, interesting and useful information the author has packed into them.

It is full of pleasures--food, good writing, and a writer's passion for her topic. The subject is the food scene of Minnesota. But, this book has appeal far beyond state lines.

It is a great mixture so history, culture, recipes, and food essays. It follows the people of Minnesota, Native to recent immigrants.

Even so, I would be interested in reading similar books about other states and the food they have there. It was a fun way to learn a lot about culture through food."},{"Title":"A Cook's Tour of Minnesota","review":"This book provides a look at the culinary traditions of Minnesota. Divided into four sections (celebrations and festivals, savory specialties, memorable places and North Star Cooks) the book covers a lot of ground. It is a marriage of historical background and interviews with over 160 recipes.The strength of this book is in the storytelling. Burckhardt does a great job of bringing the places, festivals, and people behind Minnesota's rich culinary treasures to life. I spent the first 18 years of my life here and there was still plenty of historical background that was new to me. I love hearing the stories behind food so to me this was very interesting. I also think she did a good job of covering a diverse group of events, people, and places. One of the challenges in a book like this is inevitably an author will leave out something that to you is synonymous with Minnesota cooking. However, I think she did a pretty good job of covering enough ground that every Minnesotan can find something they relate to.While I really liked the historical background, I was a little disapointed with the recipes. She does a good job of providing a range of recipes, but many were not what I expected. For the State Fair section, for example, I expected to see recipes for the foods most synonymous with the state fair like corn dogs, cheese curds, etc. While there was one recipe for a Sweet Martha's like cookie, the rest, for me were quite disappointing. One, for example, was a recipe for watermelon on a stick, which was quite literally a piece of watermelon shoved on a stick. I find recipes like that a bit insulting. I found the same to also true for the recipes by Leeann Chin. I would have expected the recipes to be for the most beloved dishes from her restaurant like the chinese chicken salad, orange chicken, or Oyster wings, but none of these were included. In fact, none of the recipes she included were from the Leeann Chin menu. This may not be a disappointment for some, however if you are getting it for a particular recipe you may want to take a look at the table of contents before you make the purchase.From a skill level perspective, however, home cooks will likely appreciate how approachable these recipes are. Most are straight forward, well written, and do not require a lot of ingredients. Some even make use of pre-made ingredients like brownie or cake mix.Overall I appreciated this cookbook most for the rich history and interesting interviews it provided, but found the recipes lacking."},{"Title":"A preface to politics","review":"Timeless classic with rich examples.

Nothing covered in any depth, but on the whole very stimulating, thought-provoking and far-reaching.This book demands a great deal of self-motivation and initiative to be used effectively. But given the author's thesis that you learn by copying the Masters (and apparently they all copied each other!), the book provides excellent guidance on who to seek out and what to look for.

Instead he manages to instil the beauty of the art and get you inspired to find your own path and create! Technique, offcourse, isn't absent, it shouldn't be in any art; different aspects (shading, perspective, media etc) are introduced but then the reader is left to do their own work. That's how it should be: you get as much as you put in, that's how art works (I know as I have delved in many aspects of it, drawing, music and bands, poetry, theatre, film, dance etc).

Bataille is in some sense writing &quot;on Nietzsche&quot;, but more/instead of that he is using Nietzsche's work to explore the dynamics of communication and the limits of language, to question at a very fundamental level whether communication is even possible and if so how it takes place. In this exploration, of course, pain, suffering, loss, lack, desire, etc. all come into play, as they must since this is a work of Bataille's. But to speak of this pain as &quot;sadistic&quot; might be misleading... for (to essentialize perhaps too much) Bataille's &quot;argument&quot; centers more on what the individual must do to itself, its own subjectivity, in order to even approach community. When one inflicts pain on onesself, is that sadism? Masichism? The intense introspectivity of this work, much in tune with Nietzsche's, opens the door for the destruction of these very types of subject/object relationships, perhaps even to the point of obliterating the categories altogether. So despite the biographical and stylistic quirks of the author, which some might find troubling, others amusing, others entirely inconsequential, and yet others absolutely essential to the questions at hand (a la F.N.), ON NIETZSCHE is quite a provoking work if any of the issues mentioned are of concern."},{"Title":"On Nietzsche","review":"*On Nietzsche* really isn't a book explaining the philosophy of Nietzsche, but a personal meditation on Nietzsche's influence on Georges Bataille's own manner of thinking and living. For Bataille, it must be understood, thinking and living are inextricable; philosophy must be tested against life, and life--inner and outer--provides the raw material for philosophy. Bataille is no armchair theorist. So it is that a good portion of *On Nietzsche* consists of fragmentary entries from Bataille's own 1944 diaries which illustrated, more or less, his struggle to embody the thrust of Nietzsche's thought--the thrust of it, because Nietzsche, in Bataille's view, is a thinker who points the way beyond himself and into mankind's future. Bataille attempts to take up the torch and carry it further forward into the darkness of the not-yet-and-never-to-be-known. His method, if you want to call it that, is to leave himself open to \\"chance.\\"Well, it's something like that.Bataille takes Nietzsche's work as a template rather than doctrine, a method for a never-ending and open-ended inquiry into what it is to be human, which in itself is a concept that is forever developing.Bataille is often difficult reading and *On Nietzsche* is no exception. His thinking tends to turn repeatedly in on itself until you feel as if your brain is tied up into some sort of neural Gordian knot. He is also prone to verbal flights of fancy that seem a vestige of his surrealist days--he's a philosopher always straining for the inexpressible. It's all part of the appeal of Bataille, if you find that appealing. Some, most notably Jean-Paul Sartre, did not. And called Bataille a mystic, not a philosopher at all. This, coming from Sartre, was not a compliment. It strikes me that Bataille, like Jung, considered subjective states of mind as objective facts inasmuch as they are every bit as influential over us as any other objective phenomenon. So the concept \\"God,\\" for instance, has a \\"truth\\" regardless of whether an actual God exists or not.I found the first part of *On Nietzsche* to be the most coherent and most compelling part of the book. Here Bataille presents his radical theory that communication depends on an act of violence--the infliction of a sacrificial wound that breaks our own autonomy and the autonomy of another. The crucifixion of Christ being the highest example of this principle--facilitating the communication of God and Man. This transgression, which serves to make us human, thus illustrates the necessity--indeed the good--of evil.The rest of *On Nietzsche*--the diary entries--I found much less compelling, often incomprehensibly fragmented, and of interest primarily for the copious excerpts Bataille reproduces from Nietzsche's *Gay Science* and *The Will to Power.* Bataille makes some enlightening observations in this section regarding his take on Nietzsche and, as always, provokes with the occasional stunning and illuminating aphorism, but, on the whole, I didn't feel *On Nietzsche* was one of Bataille's best works. Certainly it isn't the book I'd recommend for first time Bataille readers. *Erotism* would make a better--and more readable--choice of his nonfiction work, or, maybe, something like *The Impossible.*But for those already familiar with Bataille, his general train of thought, and his idiosyncratic way of philosophizing, *On Nietzsche* provides a light into some of the deeper, though not the deepest, workings of Bataille's subversive oeuvre"},{"Title":"On Nietzsche","review":"Length:: 1:05 MinsBataille considers Nietzsche's observation that language makes it seem as if all things are held in common, even though we do not necessarily hold in common similar experiences, emotions, or attitudes. Language divides us, therefore, from the complexity of our experiences.Only through facing our annihilation do we become one, again, with ourselves."},{"Title":"On Nietzsche","review":"So for those who aren't overly concerned with Bataille, with proto-Deconstruction, or French literary theory in general, I would bump this rating down to four stars. As other reviewers have indicated, this text relies less on a point by point textual exegesis of Nietzsche's oeuvre, and more on a particular reading of Nietzsche which may or may not be obfuscated by the appropriation of Nietzsche by the National socialism. Bataille's Acephale group had for one of its task the safeguarding of Nietzsche from a explicitly fascist interpretation. Thus Bataille's presentation of what appear to be simply journal reflections written during the tumultuous wartime years at the end of the occupation of Paris seem indicate a way of reading Nietzsche that moves past rigid political conepts the of mid-20th century Europe. This is a childlike Nietzsche of play, rather than the strictly lion-like Nietzsche of Heidegger who offers only the will to power as the last epoch closing possibility of Western metaphysics. Derrida indeed takes up the thread of this reading, and, in my opinion, deconstruction distinctly emerges from out of an attempt to approach Nietzsche in this manner."},{"Title":"On Nietzsche","review":"It's a real puzzle: why we are compelled to spend our time in the ways that we do. So rarely, we do not question the reason behind our activities, the \\"why\\" surrounding it all. But it is hard to back off from our presuppositions; namely, our penchant for being recognized. And so I begin typing a \\"re-view\\" of this book, without quite knowing \\"why\\" outside of the fact of being-compelled. And, also, because to come to a work like Bataille's is to be compelled beyond one's knowing why, I think... for it ushers us out of the realm of \\"utility.\\"When we write or communicate, we never do so in total abstraction. Sure, I'm not sure who you are. But (bear with me), neither do you! The question surrounding Bataille's work is the question of communication and what it is to be a \\"me\\" with regards to it. His answer seems simple on the surface: communication is only achievable when being is put at risk, or surrendered to chance. This is a good thing to emphasize when it comes to reading his work in general: there is no use to it outside the putting-at-risk of being qua communication. Jean-Luc Nancy writes of \\"learning\\" Nietzsche as communication in this profound sense, outside language-as-reference, or outside thinking as a system of propositions, or philosophy as a set of truth statements: to learn Nietzsche is to have an experience at heart, to share something of, or touch upon, a certain kind of experience, despite apparent contradictions in its expression. As Bataille shows, such contradictions are inherent to the expression (\\"I'm overjoyed, ruined finally...\\"). This is precisely what Bataille \\"does\\" here: he puts into practice an intuition similar to Nietzsche's (which Nietzsche formulated variously as the death of God, the devaluing of values, the end of grand narratives, the failure of national, political, or economic end-oriented projects, etc.): this is an experience of the absence of community.Now, there's no getting around it, this is a difficult book, especially the theoretical section \\"Summit and Decline\\" which is a paper Bataille gave in front of the likes of Sartre, Hippolyte, Marcel, etc. But intellectional/cognitive cogency is decidedly not the point here, and this book is \\"sublime\\" to the extent that it causes these faculties pause and reorganization. To read this work is, in my opinion, to put the very \\"I\\" of \\"your\\" self at risk (i.e. it is sheer trauma or sacrifice, where both executioner and victim are sacrificed at once); to read this work is to read it as if you yourself were writing it, to be with it like a moment of your own journal. To gloss over a sentence Bataille wrote about anguish, or impalement (Zen), etc., looking for his argument or the logic behind it is totally \\"worthless\\"-- unless all of your experience and all of your being can, in a sense, \\"inhabit\\" the experience he tries to put to words-- which, make no mistake, would be an exhibition, your exhibition. Anyways, no one could convince you of that, especially not me; but if it's you, I think you'll find that it holds true. The ultimate word for Bataille seems to be \\"friendship,\\" and I don't hesitate to say that he is a friend of mine, in the same way that Nietzsche was a friend to Bataille (I'm trying to be friendly in the same way... and also: it's urgent). But this criteria of friendship is also the basis for a real heterogeneity; the difference in tone between Bataille and Nietzsche does nothing to diminish their kinship, but establishes it. These works proceed from a crisis that oscillates around joyful freedom (in Bataille's lingo, an anguish that circulates around an ecstasy, where the two transform into one another, etc.); and I don't think that it's being unfair to say that those who have experienced similar crises will find a greater companionship than those who approach this book as a work of philosophy. Or, these works might induce crises-- who knows?-- in whoever is ready, or vulnerable. I think of these works as \\"direct addresses\\" whereby I address myself, redress myself, and readdress myself. If I'm not at stake, it's worth nothing; or rather, if I try to make this work \\"worth something,\\" I've missed the whole point, and it won't reach me the way it could've. It's a real challenge to risk it all (it's not just me that I'd be putting at risk if I did); but for me to say \\"me\\" after reading such a work is to have opened a new potential for saying \\"we.\\" Not incidentally, this is the justification for the plethora of Nietzsche quotes in this book: it's a shared expression, totally, just as it's the traces of something \\"inexpressible,\\" which is not to say it's without translatability. To open this book randomly, to instantly refer the sentence you stumble upon to an event in your life seemingly removed from it, to allow the \\"synchronicity\\" of these juxtaposed glances to inform each other, and to come out the other end of it changed, yet without direction... I think that is the whirlwind ecstasy of risk/chance and non-knowledge that Bataille is indicating, and it situates us in otherness, as otherness, where what's other is the origin of the world...This book \\"brings to completion\\" Bataille's Summa Atheologic: the trilogy of \\"Inner Experience,\\" \\"Guilty,\\" and \\"On Nietzsche.\\" It is helpful to think of them as one struggle, which was for Bataille precisely the struggle to communicate an experience (is it so different from what I am doing here?). This struggle brings him to the limits of language and likewise to the limits of communicating an experience \\"through words,\\" as well as all the challenges that come with having a \\"project\\" as ambitious as communicating ones whole being. What endears me to Bataille is his honesty and his willingness to share (in a surprisingly literary way) all of his failures along the way. The twists and turns are truly human-- humanity at the extremity of being-human. I write with encouragement for this volume and his work in general because of it's honesty and its potential to be a kind of \\"companion\\"-- driving you mad as well as easing your madness, often in the same stroke/strike.Jean-Luc Nancy has coined a term for philosophy: \\"Excription.\\" It is what 'cannot be read' in a writing, what can't be inscribed, what lies entirely outside the realm of signification (i.e. in bodies, \\"only\\"). The word comes from his deep engagement with Bataille's work. The reference of the text is never in the text; when Bataille says \\"me,\\" or when I read \\"me,\\" he says nothing but being, that is to say, he says \\"me.\\" He is \\"speaking me,\\" not \\"speaking to me.\\" In a way, that's utterly stupid: in fact, impossible. But that, precisely, would be the point. Nothing is rendered when reading this work other than yourself; it rends you, and your reaction to it says more about you than it says about anything else (there is nothing to say anything about other than you, which is what makes this communication so difficult...).Alas, as Bataille writes: \\"The greatest, most certain love doesn't prevent you from being the butt of infinite laughter. Such love can be likened to an utterly demented music, an ecstatic lucidity\\" (p 61)."},{"Title":"On Nietzsche","review":"bataille's \\"on nietzsche\\" is at times incomprehensible and far too much like the author talking to himself than the reader, but it is nonetheless a must-read by any standards. like heidegger, at times we find ourselves lost and simply not knowing what the hell he is talking about, but every once in awhile we achieve a moment of understanding that made all the mental confusion and frustration worth it and then some. bataille takes the death of transcendence to the ultimate conclusion, absolute meaninglessness and hedonism, reaching far different conclusions than nietzsche did about how the individual should live in the absence of any underlying metaphysical meaning. indeed, bataille, while many see him as a kind of modern nietzsche, might be called an anti-nietzschean in that he not only rejected the idea of 'the superman' but, through his novels and philosophical works, created characters for whom the ideas of discipline and so called 'becoming' flew out the window along with any sense of morality or sanctity. bataille says, 'ah, to hell with some future! the future no longer exists, anyway', and the frightening thing is that for a moment we are tempted to say it with him. as with all of bataille's work the intensity of his aggressive amorality is chilling, but it is perhaps among the best literature ever written if we want to gain insight into the nature of the intelligent rebel and the sadean libertine. to make a long story short, read it."},{"Title":"On Nietzsche","review":"bataille's \\"on nietzsche\\" is at times incomprehensible and far too much like the author talking to himself than the reader, but it is nonetheless a must-read by any standards. like heidegger, at times we find ourselves lost and simply not knowing what the hell he is talking about, but every once in awhile we achieve a moment of understanding that made all the mental confusion and frustration worth it and then some. bataille takes the death of transcendence to the ultimate conclusion, absolute meaninglessness and hedonism, reaching far different conclusions than nietzsche did about how the individual should live in the absence of any underlying metaphysical meaning. indeed, bataille, while many see him as a kind of modern nietzsche, might be called an anti-nietzschean in that he not only rejected the idea of 'the superman' but, through his novels and philosophical works, created characters for whom the ideas of discipline and so called 'becoming' flew out the window along with any sense of morality or sanctity. bataille says, 'ah, to hell with some future! the future no longer exists, anyway', and the frightening thing is that for a moment we are tempted to say it with him. as with all of bataille's work the intensity of his aggressive amorality is chilling, but it is perhaps among the best literature ever written if we want to gain insight into the nature of the intelligent rebel and the sadean libertine. to make a long story short, read it."},{"Title":"On Nietzsche","review":"although i certainly appreciate the above reader's take on bataille's work, there really aren't that many parallels between georges bataille and friedrich nietzsche. they have a distinctly different writing style, very different ideas, and almost diametrically opposed visions of the future. (i would also say, although this would be nothing more than a personal opinion, that in terms of the quality of his prose work, bataille is nowhere near nietzsche's league, however much we may debate the legitimacy or merit of nietzsche's controversial ideas.) while bataille is more about apocalypse and exploring the possibilities of extreme decadence, nietzsche was about nothing of the sort. indeed, he would have in all likelihood abhorred bataille's work, and more than likely written him off as a &quot;decadent&quot; of the worst kind, although i would certainly not agree. the similarities are small, if any indeed exist at all. while nietzsche will certainly have a place in history as one of the greatest philosophers to ever live, it would not surprise me if bataille faded into obscurity, as shock value lessens as sensibilities become more hardened."},{"Title":"East of Desolation","review":"I am a big fan of Jack Higgins so i guess i am somewhat bias.

Movie stars, insurance agents, beautiful women all combined to produce volatile tension when an abandoned plane was discovered in the middle of nowhere with 2 dead bodies. A supposed griefing widow, an overly solicitious insurance agent, Joe discovered that greed can rear its ugly head in the most unexpected quarters.In a fashion, this book followed the style of Alistair Maclean when the narrator described everything that he saw, heard and felt, but refrained from revealing all the knowledge available.A good mix of mystery and turns, even if the excitement of the wilderness and artic aviation failed to rouse you, the superb drama between lively characters, with all the human failings and foibles would serve to delight and entertain, making this book hard to put down."},{"Title":"East of Desolation","review":"I was pleasantly surprised to read this. After immersing myself in the exploits of Sean Dillion, this was a breath of fresh air. Generally, Higgins novels are a quick read, but this lent itself to something different. Being that this is an earlier work, the plot was more imaginative and at times you could almost feel the cold. It's a shame that no one will film this because it is an intelligent thriller that is missing in today's market. Since his characters didn't seem to be based on characters from his other novels, ie. Dillion vs Devlin, it was a joy to read the development and how they interact.

Yay!The book itself remains engaging and provocative. The content is really nothing new (the author cites Christian thinkers over centuries of history), but way too many Christians today live as though it is. Basically, the target audience of this book is Christians who approach their faith as a religion, or as a proposition to be believed, or as a set of rules or a way of life. The message for these people is that it should really be all about being Jesus' friend, having a personal relationship with God. The things we do help us to have a closer or deeper or more strained or shallow relationship with God, so all we really need to do is whatever it takes to grow in that relationship.

The author describes, fully at last, the life of a great thinker and writer with unexpected power simply through the process of debunking her most grievous betrayers and influential critics, Nathaniel and Barbara Branden. In the process of revealing their sins against Rand, and the insincerity of their own narratives, the author simultaneously reveals the extraordinary person whose genius, courage, integrity and individualism tower over her detractors. Whatever one thinks of the lightning rod that was Ayn Rand, and certainly to whatever extent his or her appraisal might depend upon the legend perpetrated by the Brandens, the reader will see a figure of enormous proportions who challenges the most modern viewpoints on life, art, and sex to live up to a standard the most liberal-minded today will find inspirational. No book about Rand has ever gone here; this is untread territory. Apparently, even the Ayn Rand Institute has understood this, and, though the author is unaffiliated with the Objectivist movement, allowed the author to publish her last unpublished journal entries, which deal with the events preceding her break with Nathaniel Branden and Barbara Branden. These fascinating notes, which comprise psychological ideas that would, arguably and ironically, fuel Nathaniel Branden's career long after their split, make up the second half of Valliant's book. They are a window into a soul that was, prior to this book, diminished by the works of the Brandens in a way that cheats history and the future as well. This book should, finally, rectify that injustice."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"Ayn Rand, a brilliant novelist and philosopher, was involved in an odd romantic relationship for a number of years with a much younger admirer of hers, Nathaniel Branden.I won't recount all the details of this affair. It has been given much more publicity and attention than it deserves. Why this book is significant is the fact that AR has been excoriated for her part in the affair, and this book finally gives her side.So far we have only been given one side: the side of Mr. Branden and his former wife Barbara Branden. Both have heavily blamed Rand for alleged moral failings in regard to this part of their lives. And historians, commentators and biographers seem to have agreed.But Miss Rand kept private notes at this time and they are released in this book.The notes reveal a very different story. While we have all been told that Rand was demanding that Branden continue his affair with her, we learn here that Branden was the one insisting that it could continue (although in fact he had no interest in actually continuing it. He was lying.) Rand gave him many \\"outs,\\" but he insisted it was not over and shouldn't be.The Brandens have claimed that Branden lied to Rand for so long (he hid from her that he had fallen in love with another woman)because of fear that she would destroy his career. In fact she made clear to him that their professional career could continue even if their romantic relationship was over. And yet he insisted that he wanted such a relationship.In fact, even when he admitted part of the truth to AR (he told her he had strong feelings for the other woman, but didn't tell her he was her lover) she still felt that she could have some relationship with him.It was only when she finally found out that he had been lying to her for four years about the other woman (he even told Rand he was impotent, even as he was sleeping with the other woman) that she severed all ties with him.It's a sad story. And, again, I don't think it should warrant so much attention, but the fact that this affair has garnered so much comment and criticism makes it an important work.One point of criticism. I didn't necessarily like the author injecting his view so much in the book. And I understand that NB's behavior can provoke disgust. But it would have been better to point out the differences between the two accounts of the affair, and let the readers come to their own conclusions."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"This is a valuable book which I hope you will never read. If you are interested in Ayn Rand's ideas, read and try to understand her works, and those of serious Objectivist scholars. Ayn Rand wanted to be known by her works and ideas. And I believe the closest one can ever come, on a personal level, to Ayn Rand, is through reading her novels. If you want to know \\"what was she like?\\", read her novels. Unfortunately, two grifters named Branden who for a time managed to deceive Ayn Rand wrote extremely negative and innacurate biographies about her that poisoned many people's understanding of Rand.My primary suggestion is to ignore the Brandens and their allies, and understand that Ayn Rand as a person WAS the Ayn Rand who wrote Atlas Shrugged. That her private mistakes were personal, morally innocent, and that she attempted to deal with them in an honest and rational way. Do not be tempted by curiousity, as I was in my youth, to read the Brandens' accounts. If you haven't been poisoned by the Brandens, then I don't recommend reading Valliant's book. I don't believe Ayn Rand would have wanted people delving into a miserable episode of her life, which she considered extremely personal and private, simply out of curiosity.On the other hand, if the Brandens' poison has sickened your spirit, and led you to make excuses for Ayn Rand against their accusations, or in other words, seriously upset you, then please do read Valliant's book. Valliant's book provides a catharsis, based on facts and reason. Ayn Rand's copious notes are the most valuable material, and Valliant sets the stage and weaves the relevant factual context surrounding them as they progress. In the end, N. Branden emerges as a revolting manipulator and rationalizer, and as the archetype of the rationalistic, angry, repressed, impostor that one occasionally comes across in the movement.Thanks to Mr. Valliant for making this antidote available. But I don't recommend the book, in general. I don't think it would make sense or be valuable to someone not familiar with the Branden's lies and distortions. And I don't suggest that Ayn Rand's admirers become familiar with them - the last thing Ayn Rand, and probably Mr. Valliant would want, would be for a student of Objectivism to be led to be exposed to and explore the Brandens' books/allegations via Valliant's defense of Ayn Rand."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"James Valliant has tackled a difficult and painful project of setting the record straight on many levels. It's painful because he describes in excruciating detail how the Branden's exploited the trust of their benefactor and teacher.His sources are the published words of Ayn Rand and the Brandens as well as the transcribed journals Ayn Rand kept contemporaneously - she always wrote to clarify her thinking on difficult matters. She did it as she rewrote the foundations of philosophy and as she benevolently tried to sort out the deceptions of these close friends, colleagues and a lover.The first half of the book presents a forensic case in the manner of a professional prosecutor, which Mr. Valliant is. The second half has direct transcription of Ayn Rand's relevant journal entries, presented with their full context for the reader to evaluate.A most interesting observation is the difference between the character of two men: Nathaniel Branden, her original intellectual heir; and Leonard Peikoff, her final choice of intellectual heir. Branden was always afraid to raise doubts about Ayn Rands ideas and positions, as he himself states. He lacked the courage and integrity. Peikoff, in contrast, as college student, brought every semi-plausible idea he was struggling with to Rand who would spend hours helping him analyze each point, often staying up into the wee hours. When Rand would get strongly emotional about the issues, Peikoff knew it was never about him. It was about the issue they were analyzing. He assumed that her emotion was directed at the terrible damage a bad idea does to those that accept it. If you don't know what I mean, think of \\"The Emporer's New Clothes\\". If you do know what I mean, think of teaching children original sin, or that the world is unknowable. Every successful professional from truck driver to engineer knows that the world he needs to deal with IS knowable and he proves it to himself every working minute of every day.James Valliant has performed a profound act of justice in creating this book and thereby correcting many false accusations against this world class genius who has given the world as much as Newton has in physics. Thank you Jim.Jay Conne"},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"Vaillant's book is a perfect illustration of the cult character of the Objectivist movement. Barbara Branden's _The Passion of Ayn Rand_ is a sympathetic portrait of Rand; it's obvious that she admired and still admires Rand. But she also showed that Rand was human after all, and not one of the unlikely heroes of her own books (she repeatedly assured people that the heroes of her book *did* exist in the real world, literally pointing to herself and to the Brandens at the time!). She was stupid enough to start an affair with the 25 year younger Branden, even persuading her (apparently nice but not very assertive) husband Frank O'Connor and Barbara Branden to consent to it. Of course it ended in disaster, as any *really* rational person could have predicted, but Objectivists are seldom rational, their guru included.Now in a cult it is a mortal sin to depict the guru as a human being, warts and all. The cult members insist that she must be god-like, apparently thinking that their 'philosophy' would be invalidated if Rand turned out not to be quite perfect after all (yes, they really say that). Vaillant's silly book is an attempt to restore that god-like image, and of course he fails miserably, except in the eyes of the True Believers. It is one long rant against 'the Brandens', full of hyperbole, which doesn't contain any substantial facts against them. Sure, Branden had deceived Rand with respect to his feelings towards her, but that had already been extensively documented in the books by the Brandens, so what else is new? The only thing Vaillant further can do is to blow up minor discrepancies between the two books (which are quite normal for two independently written memoirs) out of all proportions, continuously making completely unsupported assertions about the allegedly evil motives of 'the Brandens' (a randroid doesn't need evidence, his word is of course sufficient). So even a surprise party for Rand becomes an example of 'deception' by Branden! Well, her own husband then deceived her too (what an evil man!), as he was in the complot. *That* is the kind of 'damning evidence' against the Brandens that Valliant presents. How silly can you get? And this is typical for the book, which seems to be written for, ehm.. people who are not too bright: 'Bullseye, Miss Rand', 'Rand's mind is the equivalent of a Magnetic Resonance Imaging device in psychological diagnosis'.Further Valliant is simply lying or he is grossly incompetent when he asserts that BB doesn't tell us that the Blumenthals themselves broke with Rand (and not the other way around). In fact on p. 388 BB tells us quite explicitly that it is the Blumenthals who break with Rand. So much for the reliability of the book (well, what can you expect from a lawyer?).Another example of the foolishness of the book is the inclusion of Rand personal journals. Only blinded True Believers can think that these will exonerate Rand. In fact they are quite embarrassing for her, as they reveal her laughable psychologizing and her extreme narcissism. For readers who want to know more about her weird cult I heartily recommend Jeff Walkers' The Ayn Rand Cult. There are rumors that Objectivists don't like that book at all, but Valliant repeatedly uses it as a reference, so it must be ok! Of course Valliant also calls the books by the Brandens completely unreliable, but he isn't averse to using them as a reference when it suits him. Randroids can eat their cakes and have them too. Who cares about logic? Certainly not Objectivists.The conclusion: don't waste your money on this book, which is just a witchhunt by a True Believer against the Brandens, unless you are a True Believer yourself, then it is obligatory of course and you can rejoice with the five-star chorus. If you are a normal person, however, I recommend reading Neil Parille's article on the Objectivist Living site where Vaillant's tract is mercilessly dissected. Or look at Jordan Zimmerman's database if you want to get a revealing sample of Vaillant's style (see Zimmerman's review for the details). Then you'll know enough."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"Ever since I became interested in Ayn Rand's works (and, by extention, the semi-organized movement of individuals classifying themselves as \\"Objectivists\\" and following the philosophy she promoted in her works, it has never ceased to boggle my mind WHY this whole \\"Rand Vs. Branden\\" thing was not simply allowed to die, back in the NBI days.Don't get me wrong, here. I like biographies as much as the next guy, but Nathaniel Branden's \\"Judgement Day\\", Barbara Branden's \\"Passion of Ayn Rand\\", and Peikoff's \\"My years with Ayn Rand\\" are all little more than extremely personally-biases recountings of events with absolutely no importance to the philosophy as a system of ideas.Let's take a historical example: Plato may have been honmosexual, or had a bad temper. But neither of those characteristics has anything to do with whether his sociopolitical views are valid, or whether his epistemology pans out, or anything of that sort.Mr. Valliant (obviously a sincere individual who is genuinely attempting to protect Ayn Rand's reputation from the half-truths and unneccesary bad-mouthing of her by her former students and \\"colleagues\\") is simply perpetuating a squabble that should have ended years ago, and continues to divide the Objectivist movement (such as it is) into antagonistic factions.Read the book -- if for no other reason than it's being a fitting companion-piece/rebuttal to NB and BB's works, but as with theirs, take it with a rather large grain of salt, and remember that the events it chronicles happened years ago, and need not define the Objectivist movement of today."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"Like many supporters of Objectivism, who for various reasons are too busy leading their normal lives to delve into the background and politics, I had often wondered about the Branden issue. I just assumed that the current \\"custodians\\" of the philosophy probably had good reason to just ignore it - in all probability, that it wasn't worthy of response. But that curiosity remained.This book was a very worthwhile purchase. It is fresh and reaffirms the clear spirited view I have always had of Objectivism. It's heavy going though, and not something that will hold the attention of one not indignant, as I am and Ayn Rand was, at injustice.I should add also that it will not convince any of the critics. This is not because it is in any way factually innaccurate, illogical, or lacking in substance. It's only becasue the author wears his righteuos indignation on his sleeve from page one, and as a *style*, that's not going to be as persuasive to a neutral observer as a more clinical writing style might."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"For over 20 years I have studied everything that Ayn Rand has written and I have read both Barbara and Nathaniel Branden's books regarding their time spent with Mrs. Rand. Based on the accounts in the Brandens' books, I was resolved to believe that even Ayn Rand had trouble living up to her own noble ideals. But this book brilliantly proves that the people responsible for the fallout between Rand and the Brandens is absolutely the Brandens. The Brandens are truly villians in my judgement. What they did during their time with her was bad enough, but what they have done since then makes it clear that they are completely immoral. The book also makes it clear that Ayn Rand did live up to her ideals and mine.Thank you Mr. Valliant."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"If one has questions about the value of Objectivism based on the Branden's accounts, THE PASSION OF AYN RAND'S CRITICS is a valuable defense of a slandered legacy. Contrary to the claims that Valliant does not allow the reader to come to their own conclusions (which is, ironically, true of the Branden's accounts, since much of their claims are unverifiable), Valliant takes the Branden's claims, presents his verifiable evidence and lays both claim and counter-claim side by side. (Though Valliant DOES present his conclusions very strongly, it's a right he's earned after his diligent study.) The Brandens tug on the heartstrings; PARC asks for you to make your own informed decision.Some critics of Valliant's book claim that discussing this matter is harmful as a diversion from the ideas of Objectivism. However,The Branden biographies were not merely biographies, but attacks on the philosophy itself, since Rand invited the comparison when she wrote \\"and I mean it.\\" Rand's ideas were deeply intwined with her personal life. When Nathaniel Branden writes that Objectivism is full of holes, and HE knows them, and justifies this claim with JUDGEMENT DAY, we've moved beyond mere biography. The Brandens have every right, if they disagree with the philosophy, to make their claims. But their claims were often unverifiable and emotional, relying on the reader's sympathy and not their ability to reason. PARC does not make the claim that Rand was a saint, but that the accusations of Rand's sins re the Brandens were simply false. The burden of proof lies with the accuser, and PARC reminds us not to accept anything on faith."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"If you'd enjoy being a member of the jury during a courtroom drama of gripping suspense, brilliant minds, and abundant, richly detailed evidence presented by a most competent, prepared, and forthright prosecutor determined to expose and thoroughly integrate the whole truth and nothing but the truth - for the sake of clear, unbiased, unbreached justice - then you will find this book extremely difficult to put down.On the other hand, if you hold even a shred of value for the good, you should be forewarned that the crime you'll be learning about (in the most objectively meticulous, laborious, precisely accurate detail) is so grotesque, so premeditated, so extensive and abjectly disgusting a violation of a victim so innocent, so extraordinarily generous and trusting, that you will have difficulty preventing yourself from being physically ill.Readers who also understand Objectivism will gain many new insights into the power of the emerging science of psycho-epistemology. Ayn Rand responds to her \\"friend's\\" calls for therapeutic help with years of detailed induction and deduction based on her revolutionary theory of consciousness to fully solve the problems. The biggest problem turns out to be the fact that her \\"friend\\" is conjuring incessant waves of lies to steal the unearned from her (in matter and spirit); but her Objectivist method is too powerful - eventually exposing perhaps the world's most clever psycho-therapist as a pathetic second-hander devoid of self-esteem.Those who don't particularly find courtroom drama interesting, or who think that the good consists in not distinguishing the good from the bad, probably won't get much out of this book beyond concluding that Nathaniel and Barbara Branden were imbeciles for getting caught trying to fool all of the people, including themselves, all of the time.Irrespective of your position, Valliant's 400+ pages (including dozens of passages of Ayn Rand's private, hand-written journals which, unlike the Brandens' books, were not written to fool anybody) set the record straight."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"Ayn Rand has been dead almost 25 years and yet here we are a quarter of a century later with this tripe as the latest sorry example of the state of scholarship dealing with arguably one of the more important and fascinating thinkers of the twentieth century. For those not familiar with the subject matter of this book it serves as a polemic against two of Ayn Rand's early admires and associates Barbara and Nathanial Branden and picks apart each of their memoirs dealing with Rand \\"The Passion of Ayn Rand\\" and \\"Judgment Day\\" respectively. The author's conclusion... (Skip this part if you don't want me to give away the ending) The Brandens are bad people - to which I ask the question - So what? Valliant's book reads like a court transcript having diligently researched every sentence of the Branden's testimony... I mean their books, and formulates his well-researched counter argument based on extensive study of the highly sacred Ayn rand archives. What unfortunate nonsense this has all become. Nathaniel and Barbra Branden Leonard Piekoff and the rest of the original disciples are getting old and this was their fight from a long time ago. What is most discouraging about this book, even more than the irrelevant topic, dry and rigid style is the picture of the author on the dust wrapper - he looks like a young guy.

That was this approach on this book and the metallic taste the book conjures up with its dull prose as you read.God! You have to have been a fanatic to write a book like this, and you do sure need some of the energy of a fanatic just to finish the book cover to cover!As a side note, I've read Barbara Branden's \\"Passion of Ayn Rand,\\" and I've read both of Nathaniel Branden's autobiographies (shades of Anais Nin's \\"House of Incest\\"), all when they first appeared in print. Mr. Valliant, in turn, sure can turn on the \\"proof\\" machine and make a case for the Brandens being total liars, especially Barbara in her biography of Rand. Nathaniel, well, Nathaniel really didn't need all that much \\"proving\\" to reveal he was a two-timing Romeo! Valiant gives it to him good, but a lot of the evidence against him was excessive!(But how can you really measure what's \\"excessive\\" in the middle of a full-blown obsession?)Nonetheless, I can tell you I can still love Barbara's well-written biography of Rand just as she can still love Thomas Wolfe's romantic novels even though Ayn Rand disapproved of him as a novelist for her to appreciate. It's easy because -- Valliant's prose never even comes near the status of art.After all that Mr. Valliant wrote, Ayn Rand, in the end, sure does seem \\"proven\\" to have been sincere, fair, and \\"objective\\" in trying to understand her lying, two-timing, worthless boyfriend. No doubt about that! But for 14 years!???!!!It took Rand 14 years (!) to confirm her lover was an effin liar?????? Does this make sense to anyone? Hello?I felt so very sad for Ayn Rand once I reached this chapter in Valliant's book.I once myself felt bad for having wasted my love-life -- twice, six years with one man (a self-proclaimed Objectivist) and six years with another (a cynical opportunist), both of whom were equally manipulative and lying unloving men, but Rand, with all her intellect and so-called (philosophical) knowledge of human nature -- (see Greg Nyquist's book on Rand's conception of human nature (\\"Ayn Rand Contra Human Nature\\") -- went a full two years more (than me) still clinging to an illusion of the right man for the right reasons!It pretty nearly broke my heart to have all this \\"proof\\" of Rand's earnestness before me with such sad consequences!Nonetheless, Rand's (often not extolled) ethereal sweetness is in full evidence in this section.All of Rand's brilliance couldn't stop her from wasting so much of her energies, affections, and precious attention on a project to be loved (by the right man for the right reasons)! Fourteen (wasted) years is way too long, folks! (No wonder Rand went into a huge depression afterwards! No wonder her rage at being so disappointed!)Have any of you gals out there ever sat that long with a honey-tongued two-timer with half of Rand's brain-power? No, I didn't think so.By book's end, I felt the book unintentionally but powerfully ironically demonstrated what pathetic limitations there are in emphasizing intellect over matters of the heart, both for Rand as well as for Mr. Valliant. A dull service and maintenance manual has been written by Mr. Valliant on the subject of love and ethics with an (unintentional) edifying moral tale or theme to tell and relate: Love is Blind.That's the book, and it's just plain weird.I still ask myself this unanswered question: Frank Sinatra sang \\"All The Way,\\" but Rand -- did she really listen?"},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"This scathing rebuttal to the commonly accepted version of the personal events in Ayn Rand's life is a much-needed work. It succeeds primarily by using the Branden's own published words against them - demonstrating (as only a prosecuting attorney could) their abhorrent exploitation of the very woman who provided the only success they could ever claim. It also lays bare the souls of the Brandens - and shows why it is not surprising that they still continue to profit from trivializing her legend long after her death.The personal lives of authors and philosophers are generally of little import in understanding their works and ideas. However in this case, the Ad Hominem attacks fueled by the Branden's deceptions have all but crippled scholarly debate on the subject of her philosophy.

The Passion of Ayn Rand and, imo, the better book \\"Judgement Day\\" are not the definitive last word on Ayn Rand's life in any case. They are simply memoirs of the author's, neither of whom claim to be perfect or that Ms. Rand was. This author seems to believe that Ms. Rand NEEDS to be perfect in order for her philosophy to be taken seriously. She doesn't. I found both Branden's books refreshing in their honest self-analysis of their own faults and the humanity they bring to an icon. I find this book full of hyperbole which makes it appear much less legitimate than the Branden's memoirs. Wonder why the author feels a need to defend Ms. Rand when she never felt the need to defend herself in such a base manner? She was human, as are the Braden's and the rest of us.

It makes Nathaniel Branden look like a manipulative, self-serving liar, and it makes Ayn Rand look like a weak, gullible woman who was too naive, too self-absorbed and too narcissistically convinced of her own greatness to see even glaringly obvious signs of being taken advantage of by a huckster. In this account, Barbara Branden seems to have almost no personality or mind of her own, and Mr Valliant, the author, who liberally uses his own voice in the text for play-by-play and colour commentary, comes off like a guy you would absolutely hate to watch a movie with because he would be so insistent on trying to dictate your reactions to it.It is somewhat interesting to read the included sections of Ayn Rand's personal journals, but only if you don't have any stake in believing that she was a hero, or that her \\"philosophy for living\\" is practical or workable in the real world."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"With \\"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics\\" James Valliant scores what may turn out to be Objectivism's biggest own-goal yet. An unprecedented combination of wiggy conspiracy theorizing and bug-eyed idolatry, the book has not only succeeded in dividing the struggling Objectivist movement for the nth time, but has the potential to scupper what's left of Rand's reputation for good. Noted Rand critic Greg Nyquist drolly dubbed it \\"manna from heaven\\", and you can see why. Valliant's \`case against the Brandens' amounts to nothing more than one vast, nutty, vexatious litigation, with page after page of innocent trivia tortured until it confesses its sinister intent. Valliant's targets, Nathaniel and Barbara Branden, are portrayed as such credulity-defying evil masterminds that the book might have been better titled \\"The Protocols of Ayn Rand's Critics\\". But the lasting damage comes from Valliant's rash decision to publish Rand's extensive personal notes about her romantic breakup with Nathaniel Branden. He presents these notes - just like everything else Rand ever did, incidentally - as compelling evidence of her genius. However, far from being what Valliant calls \\"MRI\\"-like insights into the human mind, I fear most people reading these lengthy pseudo-psychological ramblings will see an altogether different picture. Littered with private self-aggrandisements, tragi-comic emotional rationalizations, and miscellaneous philosophical crazy-talk, the revealing psychological insight they give us is not into Branden's mind but Rand's own.For example, when Branden, at 38 some 25 years her junior, breaks off with Rand for the luscious young Patrecia, Rand construes it thus:\\"I am convinced that the clearest and probably conscious fear in his mind was the fear of admitting that I was 'too much for him'...I was too much for him - in every sense of the phrase and in a deeper sense than would apply to the type of men he despises. I want to stress this: *I was and am too much for him*. This is my full conviction, reached with the full power, logic, clarity and context of my mind...\\" And so on in similarly excruciating fashion. In his prosecutorial zeal, Valliant fails to notice his new evidence indicts his client. I can't help but feel a little sorry for the old girl - she's surely rolling in her grave having stuff like the above dragged into the public glare by those who claim to be defending her.Ultimately \\"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics\\" is a classic alright, but not in the way the author wanted it to be. It actually stands as the unintentional companion volume to Jeff Walker's \\"The Ayn Rand Cult\\". The difference is that Walker's book was written by an outsider looking in, so could never be completely convincing. This, however, is the real deal."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"When you read the Brandens' biographies, there is simply no reconciling the portrait they paint of Ayn Rand with the giant it clearly took to write such towering works as The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. Having read not only Ayn Rand's novels (many times over), but virtually everything Ayn Rand has ever written and published, it was easy for me to discount the rubbish the Brandens were claiming. But it always irked me that it was even out there, and what was worse, that the average reader might actually be taking them seriously.And finally (FINALLY!) someone steps forward and (to put it mildly) tears their whole ridiculous case to ribbons. Top to bottom.James Valliant has done a temendous job in countering, point for point, every negative assertion made by the Brandens, and not only in their books but in their articles and recorded interviews as well. And how wonderful it is to finally read Ayn Rand's side of it, through her until now unpublished journals -- which carry all the more weight in that they were her PRIVATE journals, written even as it was all happening, and never intended for any eyes but her own.Valliant's case against Nathaniel and Barbara Branden is solid in and an of itself. Ayn Rand's journals seal the case. Resoundingly. Emphatically. Powerfully.Anyone with a clear mind and a clear heart, wondering about the character of Ayn Rand, need only read her novels. Who she was (and who she must be, to have created such heroic works of literature) comes through so clearly, the Branden biographies can be dismissed out of hand.But for anyone who has read the Brandens works, and for anyone who would like to see a true portrait of Ayn Rand rather than bother with the Brandens' lies and deceipts, The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics is an invaluable resource.Finally someone has proven -- with cutting precision -- what so many of us have known all along.Read this book. Buy it. Then share it. The first half constitutes Valliant's case against the Brandens. The second half consists of Ayn Rand's private journals. Both make for fascinating and engaging reading.

While author James Valliant provides insightful analysis of Rand's private journals, no editorial comment is required for Branden's unmasking - he does it himself, through his own words and actions, as recorded day-by-day by Ayn Rand. These personal journals were never intended for the public eye, and Rand's emotional and almost nave confusion in the face of Branden's manipulation is almost heartbreaking. Even as Branden's fabricated house of cards started to crumble, Rand continued to give him the benefit of the doubt, right up to the moment when his years of lying were finally revealed. The extent of his deception, and its nakedly self-serving purpose in riding on Rand's financial coattails, is truly disgusting. Everyone who has read Barbara or Nathaniel Branden's biographies should get this book, read Rand's heartfelt daily record of what was actually happening at the time, compare it to the \\"recollections\\" made by the Brandens so conveniently after Rand's death, and judge the truth for themselves."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"Recommended, but with serious reservations. The author's heart was in the right place, but his book's subject was too much for his head. Indeed, his subject deserved and would have benefited greatly from treatment by a stronger writer with a better mind. Valliant's writing lacks articulate, persuasive force as well as tight organization and analytical clarity. His illuminations and arguments have all the enlightening power of a firefly; Ayn Rand deserved a torchbearer's touch. This book's sole asset is the first-time-published private journal writing of Miss Rand, revealing a great mind passionately and precisely trying to understand the disturbing psychological vagaries of her closest colleague and romantic partner."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"If you are looking up this book it is probably because you have more than a passing interest in Ayn Rand. I've read all of her books and came to admire her philosophy deeply. However, after hearing about an affair, \\"excommunications\\" and what seemed like irrational behavior I found it very disquieting. That was a few years ago. After re-reading Atlas Shrugged, I had my doubts about these various rumors though the affair had happened. Valliant throws light on these events using access to Rand's journals and picking over the various editions of the Brandons' account of the same events (Nathaniel and Barbara.) Quite capably he decimates the Brandons' credibility over the account demonstrating multiple contradictions, faulty references and \\"private conversations\\" which cannot be verified. He then proceeds to refute their claims about Rand being a needy, controlling, humorless, disconnected to reality and cold. He does the same with the Brandon's portrait of Rand's husband. Additionally he also capabably shows Rand painfully trying to understand fully Nathaniel Brandon before making a judgment. My main criticism of the book was the author's writing style. I found him to be distractingly meandering and at times he would depart off in tangents or even revisit a similar point he had made earlier for no apparent reason. That problem made this book a difficult read thus the three stars. Rand had clearly wanted this episode to remain private and handled it with class, tact and sensitivity. Contrast this with the opposition and draw your own conclusions."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"Controversial philosopher and successful novelist Ayn Rand was the subject of posthumous biographies by Nathaniel Branden and Barbara Branden. These biographies gave misleading portrayals of Rand's life and character. Now in James Valliant's The Passion Of Ayn Rand's Critics: The Case Against The Brandens, a long awaited corrective is applied as readers are provided for the first time with Rand's own never-before-seen journal entries on the Brandens, as well as the first in-depth analysis of the Brandens' own works which reveal their profoundly inaccurate and simply unjust depiction of their former mentor. A welcome and highly recommended read (especially for those with an interest in the life, work, and thought of Ayn Rand), The Passion Of Ayn Rand's Critics debunks the myths promulgated by the Brandens and makes an informed and informative contribution to a truer understanding of the value and controversies of Ayn Rand's contributions philosophical legacy."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"What I enjoy about reading good detective fiction is the ability of the sleuth to \\"smell a rat\\" and the ruthlessly logical manner in which he or she pursues the criminal. While Mr. Valliant's work is not fiction - indeed he goes to great lengths to expose and uproot some pernicious fictions penned by the Brandens and their ilk - I found myself every bit as captivated by _The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics_. The same mixed horror and delight as the malefactor's misdeeds are uncovered; the same joy in experiencing a rigorous and rational mind as it tracks down the truth: this is what I found in Mr. Valliant's book, which I was unable to put down.I certainly didn't need this book to convince me that the author of works stressing the sanctity of the individual and the morality of thinking for oneself was no authoritarian monster or cultist. Nor did I give credence to the idea that a woman whose every example of romantic love states that it is the response to one's highest values in the person of another would behave like a stereotypical \\"woman scorned.\\" Until the publication of Mr. Valliant's book, however, I relied on my conviction that Ayn Rand, who developed \\"a philosophy for living on this earth,\\" meant what she wrote - i.e. she lived it - and that the Brandens seemed to have an axe to grind.Although Mr. Valliant has carried out a noble effort to clear the senseless, slanderous, often arbitrary debris from the field so that serious biographers may do their work, my greatest appreciation for his labor is rooted in his affirmation of Rand's sense of life, what she called the \\"benevolent universe premise.\\" Yes, I seethed with indignation as the Branden's treachery was revealed; yes, I felt compassion as Rand's journal entries expressed pain; and, yes, I was exhilarated by her undaunted search for understanding - but her refusal to grant metaphysical significance to evil even while it was being practiced against her is as impressive an example of integrity as can be found in any of her novels. For revealing and affirming Miss Rand in this light, providing a lucid and inspiring window into her soul, Mr. Valliant's book is worth every penny and then some."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"After over 30 years of uncontested distortions and outright lies by the Brandens, James Valliant has finally set the record straight and in the process achieved a profound act of justice toward the name and legacy of Ayn Rand. Using his skills as an ex-prosecutor, he point by point meticulously demolishes all of the self-serving and twisted characterizations by the Brandens which have been accepted as unquestioned fact because they supposedly knew Ayn Rand better than anyone. Actually of course they had a big ax to grind and their sorry reputations to salvage.Valliant had access to previously unpublished entries from Ayn Rand's own personal journals and finally we see her side of it - which the Brandens could only have hoped would never emerge since it entirely contradicts their distorted description of what happened.While a large number of people have re-evaluated their understanding of \\"the break\\" as a result of reading this book, there are still some people who have a deep vested interest in attacking it and who are obsessed with the need to discredit it.

He then references Ayn Rand's own personal journals to systematically demonstrate how Nathaniel and Barbara Branden deceived and exploited Ayn Rand for years for their own illegitimate aims.

I'm not an objectivist, but I have loved Ms. Rand's novels and studied her philosophy on and off since I was in my 20s. All Ms. Branden's account of events did was prove to me, once again, that dishonesty will always create pain -- usually in the liar but also to those who mistakenly trust him.While Mr. Valliant seems overly heavy handed in repeating his points (sometimes just one paragraph after making them), it may be justified given the decades-long acceptance of the Branden's accounts. If you, like I, have hoped the Branden's accounts would be answered, this is the book to buy.[...]"},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"Let's start with my context. I am not a member of any Objectivism faction. I have never met or had anything to do with any of James Valliant, Nathaniel Branden, Barbara Branden, or Ayn Rand. I'm just a guy who has read Ayn Rand's work with interest and enthousiasm, and read both Brandens' books on her. I don't know that I call myself an Objectivist, but I am in basic agreement with all of its core premises.And the most important of those, as Rand herself claimed, is reason. And so it was in accordance with reason that I wanted to read this book, to get the other side of the story and judge for myself.Sadly, reason is what this book is wholly lacking. I wasn't even able to get more than a few chapters into it before I was forced to judge it worthless and not worth my time. Paragraph after paragraph, sentence after sentence was filled with claims and assertions that simply did not meet the basic test of logic. There were very specific errors in logic, but also a broad one underlying (and undermining) the whole affair: the assumption that anything the Brandens say must be taken with great skepticism, but anything that Rand says is unquestioned Truth, to be taken at face value. The result is that this is not a scholarly work that objectively examines the evidence and draws negative conclusions about the Brandens' accounts. This is a deliberate hatchet job, determined to focus on any negative aspect it can find or manufacture, and ignore any possible positive evidence, inference, or interpretation. The Brandens never get the benefit of doubt on any point, while Rand never gets the detriment of even a single doubt.And it's a shame, because an even-handed examination of the veracity of the Brandens' accounts would be valuable. It is rather a shame that the main biographical information we have about Ayn Rand comes from two people who had complex personal relationships with her (in this case, leading to unpleasant breakups), which certainly has the *potential* to distort their account, even if unintentionally. As a parallel, consider the way that Schindler's biography of Beethoven is shown by later scholarship to be very flawed. But sadly, Valliant is no Thayer. I suspect that scattered about in Valliant's vitriol are some nuggets of truth. But it was just way too much effort for me to try to mine them.What's more, the book isn't even well written. I found it poorly organized, flitting somewhat jarringly between seemingly unrelated harping points. It is certainly tedious, belabouring its points relentlessly and in minute detail.But the main problem remains the poor logic. The unproven assertions, the drawing of conclusions not warrented from the evidence, the direct contradictions. I truly regret spending my money on this book."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"This book accomplishes the opposite of what it intends. The author is trying correct Rand's public image; the author seems to think that the two Brandens destroyed or damaged it. The first of half of the book reads like a prosecutor's brief against the Brandens, and it is a terrible read. The last part of it has a bunch of Rand's journal entries, analyzing them to prove how rational and brillant she was. I am truly stunned that Rand's estate allowed her previously unreleased journal entries to be used in this book. The entries make her appear to lack any self awareness, among other not so positive traits.I don't really care about the Brandens, and the great rift happened before I was born. Reading about it now makes all sides look bad, though that was not the author's intent. Any description of a break up of two adulterers makes both parties look bad. I hate to say it, but the book feels like it was written by a \\"true believer\\" type. As a result, it unintentionally reinforces many of the negative viewpoints that the author is trying to correct. And it tries so hard to glorify Ayn Rand's actions (and demonize the Brandens' actions) that it is too one-sided to be credible. Objective, it is not. If someone wants to counter the Brandens' portraits of Ayn Rand, then this is the wrong approach. A better approach would be to write a full biography of her, correcting any misconceptions or errors contained in the prior biographies and fully humanize her - place the Brandens in the context of Rand's whole life and achievements. Ayn Rand is the one everyone is interested in - she wrote the books, etc; the Brandens are just a side show. I just can't believe that Rand's estate would let her private papers be used in this trashy book!Now fun facts I learned from this book:1. The author speculates that Rand's husband might have enjoyed the fact that she was having an affair. Ewwww. And not believable.2. Throwing a surprise party for someone is evidence of an evil plan against that person!3. An affair with a married person 25 years younger than you is rational!4. The author actually states that Rand was totally open with her followers about the rift (in contrast to the Brandens), except for failing to tell them about the affair. Besides that minor detail, she told them everything!5. After looking at Rand's journal entries, it appears that she did not do a lot of introspection about herself or her emotions. Sad."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"Having loved Rand's novels when young, and failing to live up to the \\"standards\\" of her heroes, I have always been interested in the woman, her followers and what made us all tick. I enjoyed \\"The Passion of Ayn Rand\\" and although it might not be perfect and had some overly simple conclusions about her, I found Barbara Branden to be believable and humane. The same came be said for the other imperfect if sincere explorations of her life.The overlong persistence of this rant about the Branden's bordered on mental illness of the author. If you must read this, do not buy at full price!"},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"It is hard to know whether this assiduously cobbled, book-length smear of two former associates of Ayn Rand (there was a bitter parting of the ways in 1968) is more stupid than it is vicious or more vicious than it is stupid, and I regret having spent 14 seconds of my life pondering this question.I'll give you one example of the caliber of VAlliant's \\"analysis,\\" which I mentioned in a review that I did for the ISIL web site at the time the book came out.Barbara Branden reported in her biography, The Passion of Ayn Rand, that Rand as a young woman recently arrived in America had chosen the name of \\"Ayn Rand\\" in part because of a Remington-Rand typewriter that she was using when she and a relative talked about what name Rand would adopt. (Rand did not want to use her Russian name, perhaps in part to protect her family back in Russia.) Evidence later found in Rand's papers seemed to suggest, however, that Rand decided on \\"Rand\\" before she arrived in America and could have become acquainted with the Remington-Rand typewriter. Because of this apparent discrepancy, Valliant declares that Barbara Branden deliberately \\"lied\\" about how Rand came up with her name, and that this lying about a small thing was an all-too-typical manifestation of Branden's alleged equal willingness to lie about big things. Valliant's contention was obviously dimwitted. But now, a few years later, we have further confirmation of its dimness if any were needed. In the new Rand-Estate-approved book 100 Voices, which is a collection of interviews with people who knew Ayn Rand, the relative that Barbara Branden cited as her source for the typewriter story is transcribed repeating the exact same story about how the typewriter inspired the choice of \\"Rand.\\" In other words, if the story is incorrect, it's not because Branden \\"lied\\" but because the relative got it wrong or for some other reason.The above is a small example of Valliant's approach of assuming the very worst of his targets, and of scribbling his indictments in blithe disregard of facts and common sense--but it is very far from an isolated example of this modus operandi. The book is written by a cultist who has no desire to be judicious and objective. Any facts that got in the way of his purpose of vindicating Rand and indicting the Brandens had to be either ignored or selectively recreated, and not very artfully. Valliant will never be able to escape the reputation for deliberate and sustained dishonesty he has earned with this self-parodying screed."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"Kudos to Mr. Valliant. His new book The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics has made me proud to call myself an Objectivist once more. This thoroughly researched and readable book reveals the scope of the premeditated and self-serving dishonesty of Nathaniel (and Barbara) Branden against the person and character of Ayn Rand. These lies (made while she was alive and especially after her death) smeared the reputation of Ayn Rand to the point that a mere mention of her name or ideas in certain quarters is met with a chorus of ad hominem attacks.The book thoroughly exposes the Branden's and their motives, finally laying to rest all of the urban myths surrounding these private affairs, assisted by portions of the unpublished journals of Ayn Rand herself. I care little for the private lives of philosophers, but these matters have become an impediment to the serious discussion of Ayn Rand's ideas. Valliant's deft dispatch of the Branden's should clear the path for more rational consideration.More interesting, the book reveals the amazing focus and moral clarity of Ayn Rand; remarkable given the painful personal nature of the context. Few who are familiar with the consistency and systematic nature of her values will be surprised that she was able to discover, despite the evasions and misdirection of her psychotherapist business-partner/lover, the true nature of Nathaniel Branden. But her ability for rational introspection during difficult emotional circumstances, while still feeling the emotions, is truly inspiring.One the greatest contributions and innovations of Ayn Rand is her integration of the fields of Ethics and Metaphysics -morality based on reality, with \`life' as the objective standard of value for human beings. In an age dominated by mystics on one side and relativists and skeptics on the other, the philosophical alternative offered by Objectivist ethics is a desperately needed (and much more rational) option.Thanks to Mr. Valliant's efforts in The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics, the growing popularity for the ideas of Ayn Rand can enjoy a further renaissance of careful consideration and genuine debate, and we can put all that other rubbish behind us."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"In 2005, James Valliant published a book entitled The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics (\\"PARC\\"). PARC claims the alleged mistakes, fabrications, contradictions and hidden agendas of Nathaniel and Barbara Branden are so great as to render their books \\"useless\\" as scholarship. PARC was even more noteworthy because Valliant included, with Leonard Peikoff's permission, substantial portions of Ayn Rand's private journals concerning her relationship with Nathaniel Branden.Even on Valliant's own representations of the Brandens' books, many of the points he makes (roughly a quarter) are weak. For example, Valliant's attack on Barbara Branden's apparent mistake concerning the origin of Rand's name, or some of the alleged contradictions in the books (e.g., whether Rand liked physical activity or to cook) represent an unfortunate tendency on Valliant's part to nitpick and refuse to give the Brandens the benefit of the doubt. Valliant even turns a surprise party thrown by Random House to celebrate the publication of Atlas Shrugged into a sinister attempt by the Brandens to control Rand's \\"context through deception.\\"Quite often Valliant misrepresents what the Brandens say. On some occasions what the Brandens say is the exact opposite of what Valliant claims.For example, Valliant begins his attack with the above-mentioned mistake made by Barbara Branden concerning the origins of Rand's name (it wasn't taken from a Remington Rand typewriter after all). Instead of conceding that Branden made an honest mistake, Valliant uses this mistake to launch an attack on Branden, in particular distorting the reason Branden gives for Rand losing contact with her family in Russia. Valliant does this by the clever use of ellipses. He also refuses to tell his readers that the Remington Rand story was believed until relatively recently by scholars associated with the Ayn Rand Institute. Likewise, when Barbara Branden says that Rand's close friends Alan and Joan Blumenthal left Rand because they were tired of Rand haranguing them on esthetic matters, Valliant falsely accuses Branden of concealing the fact that it was the Blumenthals who left Rand. And so it goes for virtually every bit of evidence that purports to make Valliant's \\"case\\" against the Brandens. Valliant's distortions of the Brandens' books are so great as to render his book useless as a critique of their books.In 2009 two biographies of Rand were published (by J. Burns and A. Heller).

What struck me most about this book is that it is the mirror image of the William F. Buckley, Jr. book, \\"Getting It Right.\\"Along with the venerable Mr. Buckley's tome, this book is an obsessive crusade to wage once again long-since stale vendettas over Ayn Rand's *personal* legacy. Whereas Buckley painted himself into a corner with his ridiculous theme that the conservative movement was \\"rescued\\" from \\"fringe lunatics\\" like Ayn Rand and the John Birch Society (Rand would have called this \\"package dealing\\"), Valliant puts forth a valiant effort to demonstrate, once and for all, that Ayn Rand was a saint beyond moral reproach, and implies throughout that Dr. Leonard Peikoff was objectivism's most important advocate during Rand's lifetime.What a bunch of hooey! Even though both the Brandens' memoirs could at times be self-indulgent, Valliant's mischaraterizations of them could only be described as a smear job.This is muckraking quackery of the worst sort. It is sad to watch grown adults sweat blood trying to convince the world that a woman dead now for 25 years was either an infallible saint or a wickedly manipulative devil. This book has the \\"feel\\" that Mr. Valliant was \\"put up\\" to this unenviable task of playing Grand Inquisitor to the Brandens. Although I haven't any proof, this book seems to have the fingerprints of one Dr. Leonard Peikoff -- an incessant recycler and retreader of Ayn Rand's legacy, whose ability to squeeze every last penny from the ephemera bequeathed him by Rand would impress even Yoko Ono -- all over it.If you live in the real world -- and not within the Ayn Rand or Buckley cults -- don't waste your time on this fanatical tract."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"James Valliant, prosecuting attorney and graduate philosopher, aptly demonstrates a superior grasp of both professions with his book, \\"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics.\\" The prosecutor meticulously delves into the voluminous fabrications, misrepresentations and outright lies perpetrated against Ayn Rand by her former associates, Nathanial and Barbara Branden. The philosopher exhibits the insight essential to a proper analysis of the facts in a highly philosophical context.As an Objectivist on the scene when Ayn Rand denounced the Brandens in 1968, I can attest to the ensuing turmoil among her admirers due to the sudden necessity to face the distasteful fact of the Brandens' betrayal. In the confusion, they manipulated the unwary for years, strategically waiting until after Ayn Rand's death to unleash their main vitriol via \\"biographies,\\" which in turn created a never-ending onslaught of attacks by a bevy of Ayn Rand haters. These books, notably Ms. Branden's \\"The Passion of Ayn Rand,\\" are the primary source for virtually all the hatchet job op-ed misrepresentations that have appeared over the years of Ayn Rand, of her philosophy, Objectivism, and of her associates. The Brandens' fabrications have gone unanswered for decades.Now comes James Valliant to set the record straight. Every Objectivist should read his book in order to grasp the incomprehensible depth and breadth of the scurrilous injustice perpetrated against our heroine. Every skeptic with an abiding respect for ideas should read his book in order to free himself of falsehood. Every detractor (and anonymous reviewer) should read his book; then look in a mirror.Valliant's work is a tour de force. His is the dynamite to clear the logjam of deceit that has impeded the flow of Objectivism into the mainstream of popular thought; it will render the Brandens and their ilk just so much flotsam. As John Galt would say, \\"The road is cleared.\\""},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"Apparently written by an uncritical devotee of Ayn Rand (or, more correctly, of the Ayn Rand Institute) intent upon \\"clearing\\" her of any allegation of personal misconduct in her rather bizarre affair that she had with her \\"intellectual heir,\\" Nathaniel Branden, the author is faced with a dilemma that he cannot resolve- How is it that the world's greatest philosopher and proponent of rationality - and a novelist with heretofore unknown and penetrating insights into human conduct - could be so naive and taken-in by the deceit of her lover?To attempt this feat, the author must make Rand also appear as not only naive, but also completely innocent, with no personal responsibility for her own actions and the effect that her conduct had upon those that she cared for (including her husband). This requires a lot of intellectual acrobatics, revisions, and omissions of inconvenient facts and details. I would advise readers to also read both books by Nathaniel Branden and Barbara Branden, and then draw their own conclusions.An author's ideas and contributions to philosophy and literature should be judged on their own merit, not by whether his/her personal life was 100% consistant with their every view advocated. However, the author of this book and his allies at ARI apparently cannot handle the possibility that Rand was not a perfect exemplar in her private life of her publically-expressed views. Consequently, in an attempt to make her look the innocent victim, they end up with making her look very naive of human conduct, totally lacking in any insight into her own behavior, and by implication, rather dull and stupid.But Ayn Rand was definately NOT dull and stupid. What she was, however, is HUMAN. And that means not omniscient and not incapable of error. To claim that her philosophy is perfect and above and beyond criticism - and that SHE was also an equally perfect exemplar - make her more than human. Those characteristics define a god. This is a very curious claim to make for a philosopher of reason and atheism!Parenthetically, one devotee who reviewed this book here amusingly alleges that it may have caused a few to leave one Objectivist organization (because the Brandens have made presentations there??). This is probably a lot less than those who have left (or were purged from) the ARI, over its \\"anti-tolerance\\" policies."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"No matter how much effort Objectivism's official spokesmen invest in philosophical clarity and precision, their blind worship of the philosophy's progenitor will prompt outsiders to confuse evaluations of her with evaluations of her ideas. Their attempts to whitewash any and all blemishes have the opposite effect of what the spokesmen intend: outsiders see it as a lack of intellectual honesty on the part of the philosophy's advocates-and begin to wonder if this does not cast doubt on the truth of the ideas.This would be true for any intellectual movement, but the impact is compounded for Objectivism. Because its foundation rests on respect for the facts of reality, the whitewash gives newcomers good basis to dismiss the entire philosophy as phony without further study.When chief Objectivist spokesman Leonard Peikoff opened the Ayn Rand archives to the author of this masterpiece of convoluted, mind-numbing pseudo-analysis, he may well have set the Objectivist movement back 37 years, deflecting attention away from the crystal clarity of Rand's ideas and back on the self-defeating schism that has enabled him to rule with virtual papal infallibility over the Objectivist \`establishment' since Ayn Rand's death in 1982.Good move for Dr. Peikoff. Bad move for the future of Objectivism.Defenders of the book (hereafter PARC) will cite various reasons, their devotion to the memory of Ayn Rand being foremost among them. But no serious reader of the Branden books will put down this volume with any higher level of respect for her. Her admirers know full well that, whatever her faults, she remains the greatest writer and thinker of the 20th Century. Despite PARC's endless allegations, the truth is that the Brandens made no attempt to deny their own culpability or to detract from the glory of Ayn Rand's legacy. It is absurd to suggest that this book \`sets the record straight.' No one outside the triangle of Rand, her husband and Nathaniel Branden can possibly know the full truth about that notorious and tragically destructive affair. On that account, this book adds nothing but obfuscation and peculiarly vicious ad hominem.It is fascinating to read Ayn Rand's personal journal, but it is not necessary to read her words to empathize with her pain-and her pain does not exonerate her of blame nor diminish the suffering endured by her husband or Branden. (At one point, PARC's author asks us to believe that Ayn Rand's husband may not have been the least bit disturbed by his wife's love affair. Is it necessary to elaborate further on the author's \\"objectivity\\"?) For those who were not involved, it must remain a story without heroes or villains-or innocent victims.Others insist that it is important to make the case for the \`other side.' The author certainly does that. PARC insists that Rand was a saint and that Nathaniel and Barbara Branden were \`immoral'. Now there's a shock. Only a novice would not be aware that, from the perspective of orthodox Objectivism, this is scarcely a distinction. In his essay, \\"Fact and Value,\\" Dr. Peikoff branded most advocates of \\"inherently irrational\\" ideas (i.e., pragmatism, egalitarianism, et. al.) as dishonest and, therefore, immoral. So PARC's author devotes 400 plus laboriously footnoted pages to proving that the Brandens are, well, pretty much like everyone else. (Many Objectivists, needless to say, regard Peikoff's sermonizing to be rationally indefensible and blatantly counterproductive to the spread of the philosophy. The same could be said for this book.)A large part of PARC's indictment of the Brandens consists of tediously documenting various inconsistencies in their accounts. Yet the author glosses over some major inconsistencies that do not favor his case. Ayn Rand is eulogized throughout the book for never straying from her strict moral principles. Then why is it that, eight days after she first condemns Nathaniel Branden as \\"the most immoral person I have ever met\\" (July 4, 1968), she asked him to tell her exactly what she meant to him? (\\"We talked personally. Neither of us wanted to stop.\\") The author would have us believe that, when Ayn Rand is indulging in it, \\"tolerance\\" suddenly becomes a virtue.Another clue to the author's \`objectivity' can be observed in PARC's contention that Ayn Rand was absolutely devoid of jealousy in her actions toward Branden and that Branden made all the sexual overtures in the last year of their relationship. Rand supposedly \\"came to terms\\" with the end of their romance as early as January, 1968. If that's true, why do you suppose (as the author admits) Branden gave her the famous \\"letter\\" in July of 1968 in which he \\"rejected\\" her romantically? And why does Ayn Rand proceed to write a lengthy response in which she attacks his desires for her rival (Patrecia) as \\"silly, trashy, vulgar and juvenile\\"?Others have claimed that the book serves a worthwhile purpose by shining new light on a controversy that has not and will not go away. But it will not go away precisely because Peikoff and his flock do not want it to go away. The books authored by Barbara and Nathaniel Branden, whatever their flaws, were obviously written with the hope of trying to heal a very deep and agonizing wound. PARC not only reopens it but injects that wound with a vile and repugnant venom, spewing muck and mucous in everyone's face, insuring that Objectivism's internal squabbles will continue to fester and infect the movement for years to come."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"I experienced all the major players in this book in the 1960s before the break between Ayn Rand and Nathaniel and Barbara Branden. I saw Ayn Rand quite a few times in public over the next five years and have been friendly with both Brandens for over 30 years. I don't think much of this cultist book.Divided into two parts I found most of the second part, the words of Ayn Rand from her private journals, virtually unreadible. It was a very bad time in her life, but I am not courious to invade her privacy. I admit I still think of her as a living person. Mr. Valliant finally crashes and burns at the end of this screed when he tells us about Nathaniel Branden's psychology. Read the book and ask yourself how the prosecutor/author ended up making a fool of himself.This could have been a valuable monograph, not a book, analyzing Barbara Branden's \\"The Passion of Ayn Rand,\\" which has its faults. I never liked the way she interpreted Ayn Rand's old family photograph, for instance. It might have helped Barbara Branden do a better second edition or helped a future biographer a little. But the obvious motivation of the author is to destroy the Brandens and burnish up the Ayn Rand icon.--Brant Gaede"},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics","review":"Could not out this book down. Read the whole book in two sittings. Like watching Sherlock Holmes put all the clues together to find out what REALLY happened.

It also provides guidance for pursuing love and romance. It has definitely given me a new world. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"SEDUCTION FOR LOVE","review":"Overall, the author integrated social psychology and clinical psychology beautifully. The part I like the most is that there is no manipulation and exploitation of others' weakness. The author tried to help you become a chef instead of simply tell you how to prepare a dinner. The chapter \\"women's game\\" made me a bit uncomfortable (I am a feminist). However, as a psychologist, I can accept the author's analysis. Impressively concise and profound."},{"Title":"SEDUCTION FOR LOVE","review":"I was very disappointed after I received and read this book.There were only 90 pages - large space between lines. It was filled with mispelled words.The worst part is that there was no \\"thread\\" - it was spaced-out in thought and content. There was no clear beginning and end. In fact, I got to the end of this book and wondered, \\"Is that IT?\\"I saw no practical advice within the pages."},{"Title":"SEDUCTION FOR LOVE","review":"Don't get me wrong. I think this is a great book. But why, why do we need this kind of book? people ought to be able to love and earn love without learning to do so, right?

She seemed to really enjoy reading and planning using this book."},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"I thought this book was cute... really CUTE. There are others that are smart and others that are funny, this was cute and a decent choice for my little sister who is going to be my Maid of Honor.

I wouldn't want to be in a wedding without having the knowledge this book has given me."},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"A friend recently showed me a copy of this book because my daughter is getting married. I found the book to be wonderful and so infomative that I had to buy a copy for all of my daughter's bridesmaids. This book covers all the basic bridesmaids' duties and provides very creative, unique ways to make the whole process fun and successful. I highly recommend this book to everyone who is getting married!"},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"I found this book really enjoyable. I don't know much about weddings, the first one I'll be in is my own, so I wanted to get an idea about the bridesmaid thing. I thought that it does a pretty good job of explaining what the modern bridesmaid does. It was very well laid out, and easy to read (takes an hour and a half if you can sit down and go through it at once). I've already given it to one of my bridesmaids, and will be getting a copy for my other one very soon."},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"I ordered this book based mainly on cover design but was not disappointed by content. I was recently asked by my sister to be her maid of honor, but had no clue about what my duties were, having never been even a bridesmaid before. The book has general info about weddings, bridesmaid etiquette and duties, and special additional info for the maid/matron of honor duty. This book has style, humor, and a lot of great advice about being a bridesmaid. I definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"I bought this after being asked to be a MOH in the first wedding I'd been to in years. It was a fun read and laid out every step for a novice like myself - I bought another at the same time but barely read it. If you want to make the whole thing go smoothly, get points for being an awesome bridesmaid, and get some laughs all the while, this is the book to pick. I plan on keeping it in my purse all through my next bridesmaid gig!"},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"I picked up this book and a few others on similar topics. I think this is a good one as some of the others are a bit out dated. This one and Pocket-Poet's book on the same topic are my two favorite. I give the other book the edge over this one becuase it is more to the point than this one is at times -b ut this is a good buy."},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"I was looking for a small gift to send my bridesmaids and I came across this book. It is a fun little guide for those new to the wedding world, as some of my bridesmaids are. As a wedding novice myself, being the first of my friends to marry, it was a good heads up on what to ask of my attendants and what mistakes to avoid. The feedback from my bridesmaids has also been very positive, they enjoyed the light witty style mixed with the helpful guide. I am very glad I found this book and would suggest it to anyone who wants to treat their bridesmaids!"},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"I bought this book for my bridesmaids for Christmas and they loved it! It helped me by reading it also because now I know what bridesmaids' exact responsibilites are. Such a fun read!!"},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"My complaint about works in this genre is that they \\"feed the bridezilla beast.\\" Like wedding websites and magazines (which, are of course, products of the wedding industry), this book is eager to turn BRIDESMAID from the traditional way to honor special friends into a bona-fide occupation. Every shower hosted, bridesmaid's dress purchased, bachelorette thrown pumps more $$ into the industry. They've got a bottom line to protect, and a financial interest in turning the wedding into an entitlement. This book isn't as bad as some out there, but it still reads more like a job description.Brides, stop and think about why you chose your wedding party. It should be because they're your nearest and dearest friends...the folks you can't dream of making this milestone step in life without, not because of what you think they can or should do for you (remember that they have to spend THEIR money to buy those gifts and host those parties).Maids, use this book for its great and fun ideas, not \\"I have to do this, or I'm a bad friend.\\" Brides, remember what message you might be sending to your wedding party before you gift it.Great as a guidebook, though, and full of fun (though albeit sometimes odd) ideas for showers, bachelorettes, etc, so three stars."},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"Being a first-time bridesmaid (for my best friend's wedding in October), I am thrilled and at the same time I want to make sure I have all the important information that I need to know. While this book offers some broad strokes on bridesmaiding, I found a lot of the information to be impractical. It tends to assume that there are many maids in the party (I am one of only three) and it places emphasis on themes and games - both of which don't apply to a lot of today's less traditional brides. I feel like it needs an update to become more useful."},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"Great little book. in ok condition but a fair price. I received the book on time. Thanks much! I'll order from you folks again. Cheers!"},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"The book was very cute, fast read, but I was expecting just a little more information. It goes over very general basic knowledge with just a handful of pointers that I will actually use. Other than that, I loved everything about it. Seller was great, book was in fantastic condition even though it was used, quick, easy, painless transaction."},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"I actually gave this to my sister for my wedding. She is the maid of honor and hasn't been in a wedding yet. After reviewing the book she is now more confident and knows what to do. It thoroughly explains everything and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"This is a very good book for all those bridesmaids and mohs that have no clue what to do.

Great book!"},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"Great book for getting ready for a wedding that you have to play a big part in :) There are some parts I'm like....\\"ehhh...not sure why I would do that.\\" but....still a good book with helping tips."},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"I absolutely love this book! I decided to give it to my Bridesmaids as a cute way to ask them to be in my Bridal Party. Of course, I read it first, and I loved how fun and easy it was to read. There were a couple things that were a little weird (having a Pride & Prejudice bachelorette party - where the bride has to wear a bonnet out in public...?) But other than than, there were cute tidbits on each page with interesting terminology and a non-confrontational way to talk about money stuff :) All of my girls read it and they all loved it.

Overall I thought it was a cute little book for them to read through if they wanted and something to get them all in the wedding mood :)"},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"This book was easy to read and laid out the overview of what I'll be getting myself into over the next year. The quizzes were a little weird, but fun. Overall, entertaining and useful. Especially helpful were the many tips for maids of honor."},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"As a first time bridesmaid and maid of honor, I picked up this book for some party planning ideas. I found it to be pretty good and a fun read. It was also very helpful on outlining the duties of a bridesmaid, but some of the party ideas were a little dated--like 1800s dated. They suggested a Jane Austen-themed bachelorette party. While I think forcing my sister to go to bars in a bonnet would be hilarious to me, I don't think its how she wants to spend her night. So I would recommend this book, but I wouldn't use it for bachelorette plans unless you're looking for something really, really vintage."},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"A fantastic gift for the new bridesmaids and maid-of-honors! It really set the relaxed and fun tone for my bridesmaids. Even if someone has been one before I'm sure they would have fun thumbing through this book and getting great ideas. A must buy for all brides for their bridesmaids!"},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"This book offers a great overview of what it takes to be a bridesmaid.

It gives you all the basics you need to know."},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"The friend I chose to be my Maid of Honor had never been in a wedding party before, and so I knew she'd need a little help/instruction in knowing what her duties would include. This is a great little book that has helped her be an amazing Maid of Honor. In addition, the book has a great look to it, and really isn't very expensive. In asking someone to be in your wedding, why not give them this book and ask them in an inscription inside the front cover?"},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"As the bride, I thought this was the cutest book and very informative. I've never been a bridesmaid, so it helped me feel less over welmed because I realized I could ask my bridesmaids for help. I read all the reviews and everyone said it was so great and that the bridesmaids loved it too. The one review I never read is that although the book itself is great, you really have to be careful who you give this to. The book is pretty intense and although I certainly wouldn't expect my Maid of Honor or bridesmaid to do everything in it, some bridesmaids may find this sort of book very offending. I thought of it as a fun little gift when asking them to be my bridesmaid, whereas one of my bridesmaids completely flipped out and felt that it was rude, instructional and over welming, to say the least. Just be careful who you give this to."},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"This is a fun, light, quick read, but it got me into the right mindset: have fun, enjoy the ride, and prepare to be generous with your time, energy, and wallet. There is a budgeting page included in the book, which I love because I love making budgets. It's so much easier for a tightwad like me to shell out when I have a plan. With that out of the way, I'm really looking forward to spoiling her! This book will help you accept the dress she picks out for you, keep her from stressing out, have fun and not take yourself too seriously. I'm not giving it five stars because it's not very long and touches on each point briefly and lightly. But it's not very expensive, so take that for what it is."},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"OMG! I never knew a book like this was out there... it literally covers everything a BM needs to know or do. I gave this to my BM's as a gift and they all love it!

The book is also very fun to read!"},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"Was fun and enjoyable experience to read this book...great ideas to make the bride feel special!"},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"Although this is not the end-all etiquette manual (that would be by Emily Post) it is a cute little gift for your favorite girls.How to Give Them a Nudge, Not a Shove:I sent one to each of my bridesmaids and maid of honor and kept a copy for myself. Rather than insulting my best friends - (\\"Here. You need some help for MY wedding.\\") - I sent fabric covered memory boxes in my wedding colors filled with goodies: local letterpressed notecards with plenty of tear-jerking heartfelt sentiments, fabric swatches for the girls and their dates, a list of important contacts, and purse-sized leather journals in my wedding colors to go with The Bridesmaid Guide. I wrapped and packaged them by hand, and everything arrived in tact.They were awed. They were ecstatic. They were moved to tears. All of 'em.What Makes This Book Different:I loved the size, color and graphic design of this book. It is adorable. It is the friendliest, most informal way to introduce your bridesmaids to a simple set of social rules. It just feels fun!Buyer Be Aware:I checked out The Guide in person at a local bookseller, so I knew what I was getting myself into. Make sure you utilize the Search Inside feature on Amazon. If you are looking for the etiquette encyclopedia, I highly suggest Emily Post's Wedding Etiquette. It has everything, but it's in a huge reference manual format, not in a hip and girly guide format. As long as the bride (and her mum) has her serious-people etiquette book at home, this relaxed little charmer will provide a solid foundation for your maids.Did You Say Creative?The book is worth it's price just for the party ideas! I won't spoil the fun, but there are more ideas in this book than a girl can use in one wedding! There is something for everyone - wild and crazy ideas, youthful ideas, and my personal favorite, clean and proper ideas - for everything from showers (even if you don't want them to be centered around gifts) and the more innocent variety of \\"bachelorette\\" parties, both events of which I did not want to partake for fear of anyone doing anything in bad taste!This book has helped quite a bit in ironing out some of my tastes and ideas for my girls. Let's just say it has communicated on my behalf and inspired some of my wildest girlfriends with ways to leave their mark in a setting I can enjoy!Useful:One of my bridesmaids was a maid of honor for another friend of hers this past weekend and was able to use a lot of the information this book provided. In fact, the wedding coordinator herself was impressed by my bridesmaid's knowledge! And when speaking with my maid this afternoon about veils, SHE told ME the veil I was referring to was called a blusher!This little guide is an investment that has already paid off, and I've still got a year till the big day!"},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Guide","review":"Got it for my maid of honor.

When studying Paul's letters I didn't know much about the context or situations of that time. These books (there's three or four in the series so far) help with lots of background and little snipets that would otherwise be unknown to people like me. When you read a passage in your translation then you pick up a book in this series and read about that same passage, lots of issues get cleared up. Also works great for small discussion groups. I hope they continue to print more on other books of the Bible."},{"Title":"Exploring Galatians and Ephesians (Devotional Commentaries)","review":"I love all of the author's commentaries. I am not a theologian, however his material is interesting, readable, clear, seems true to scripture and I am convinced that other writers often use his work without necessarily referencing him.

The main sections of the book covering computer architecture, cell phone architecture, and peripheral systems is very professional and brings out the topics that engineers in these areas face now in order to develop next generation hardware, firmware, and software. From shrinking lithographic dimensions to valley control of buck converters this book is a must read for those working in this field. The book is well supported with technical data sheets, application notes, and design criteria needed to apply the electronic building blocks available from Fairchild Semiconductor."},{"Title":"The game cock: being a practical treatise on breeding, rearing, training, feeding, trimming, mains, heeling, spurs, etc: Together with an exposure of ... rules governing all parts of the world,","review":"Interesting book on what has recently become such a trendy topic of outrage.

Nonetheless, I am glad that in this nation, founded on freedom, particularly of information and knowledge (the only way a democracy can function), I was able to read about the subject to satisfy my curiosity about the outrage towards the sport.It occurs to me that most reviewers here have probably little to no firsthand knowledge of much that occurs with our domesticated animals, be they for meat or dairy or laying...they certainly display a close-minded and hysterical attitude in their reviews towards 'cruelty' that is obviously mired in ignorance.I wish that before screaming their self-aggrandizing, high-handed moral biases...people would at the least read the book.

Most has spawned from a misunderstanding of the discipline or the misuse of the term. The authors, all of whom are long-time experts in the field and members of the Medinge branding think-tank, realize this; and rather than addressing the definition of the term (that is better done in a more rudimentary text), they have taken a higher ground by showing the possibilities of branding for the good of humanity.In effect, Beyond Branding brings together knowledge of the world's leading branding authorities - and their most pressing issues - in one volume.It is a &quot;call to arms&quot; for branding and business in general: the authors argue that the changes can take place immediately in any organization, beginning with the individual. To help their mission, there is a web site at www.beyond-branding.com, which features a regularly updated blog, which serves as both an appendix to the book and a way to interact with readers to effect their changes."},{"Title":"Grammar in Context Bk 1","review":"This book can be quite confusing at times, and is best used with a teacher in a class.

It is a large scale map of the Colorado Sangre de Cristo mountains printed on good quality paper. But... it doesn't even show the northern 30 square miles of the Sangre de Cristo wilderness despite claiming to show the \\"Northern Sangre de Cristo\\" mountain area. It doesn't differentiate between public and private land. It doesn't accurately show where motorized vehicles are prohibited. The trail desciptions are very brief and basically just summaries.For the price of this one map you could do about as well getting maps from the US Forest Service (San Isabel National Forest) and the US Bureau of Land Management (Canon City and Blanca Peak), although they aren't as large a scale and not as thick paper."},{"Title":"Sangre de Cristo Wilderness & Great Sand Dunes National Park Trail Map 3rd Edition","review":"We've used this map extensively as we've explored Great Sand Dunes and vicinity, and found it to be accurate, easy to read, and durable.

This seemed, and still seems to be, more or less a duplication of that previous guide. If you don't own the 'Handbook', then definitely check this out, I really like Chris' open-minded writing and hiking style.The only new information in 'Advanced Backpacker' is brief; and can be found on the internet or in your library for free. But if you really want a wholesome guide to carry with you, then this should be the one."},{"Title":"The Advanced Backpacker: A Handbook of Year Round, Long-Distance Hiking","review":"I disagree with the other reviewer who compares this book to Townsend's \\"Backpacker's Handbook.\\" The Handbook covers the basics of hiking equipment - in this book, Townsend assumes you know the basics, and covers only the adjustments to gear necessary for a long hike. Even with that caveat, there are some simply excellent discussions here - for example, its got the best breakdown of boot fitting I've come across.More importantly though, Townsend uses this book to discuss at length topics aimed at, for lack of a better term, \\"advanced backpackers.\\" Things like how to prep and plan for a thruhike. How to plan an extended route through an area where there are no trails, based only off the information available on maps. How to do menu and resupply planning for a multimonth hike. Snow camping and travel in early season mountainous terrain. It is discussions like these where this book shines. Townsend's expertise comes through to differentiate this book from the many others targeted to weekend hikers. I first picked this book up after my PCT hike in 2000, and immediately recognized it as the book I was looking for before my hike. It would have saved me unnecessary pain.With that being said, the book is somewhat dated today. While much of Townsend's advice still holds, these days, its much easier to access information. Hundreds of former thru-hikers are immediately available through discussion forums to answer questions, and incredibly detailed posts are freely available on any bit of hiking minutiae you can think of. Like the other \\"advanced hiking\\" books by Roland Mueser and Karen Berger, this book is sadly somewhat of a relic these days.

His clear writing style and effective way of illustrating important points gives the reader a pleasant break from the more technical books on the topic of seed evolution and dispersion. But don't be deceived by its ease of reading, the book is full of facts about early native agricultural practices in North and Central America, contains warnings about our loss of natural vegetation, especially rain forests, and tells of our rapid loss of plant diversity.Dr. Nabhan is the cofounder of an organization called Native Seeds and is currently Assistant Director of the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix, Arizona. In these dual roles he has had ample opportunity to observe what is happening to our natural vegetation and to record how the diversity of plants in our world continues to shrink at an alarming rate.His book is divided into a series of chapters each with names intended to draw the reader's interest. Examples include: &quot;Turning Foxholes into Compost Heaps,&quot; &quot;Drowning in a Shallow Gene Pool,&quot; and &quot;Invisible Erosion.&quot; Each of his 12 chapters focuses on an important point. The first one presents an interesting history of plant evolution from the earliest Paleozoic times through the late Cenozoic and explains how the large, plant gene pool created the wonderful diversity we have all come to enjoy. In the next several chapters Dr. Nabhan first addresses the great diversity of plants found in forests of the wet and dry tropics and next speaks about how this great diversity led to the emergence of many cultigens we now depend upon for our staples. He also points with alarm to how rapidly this diversity is being lost as large areas are converted to agricultural lands or are clear cut for their lumber. Other chapters focus on the need for saving examples of seeds from plants that are becoming extinct and the advantages in tropical areas of using local plant species and local farming techniques instead of introduced hybrid plants and &quot;modern&quot; agricultural techniques. In later chapters Dr. Nabhan chronicles the demise of wild rice in the Great Lakes region, the near loss of a species of rare gourd in Florida, and why the production of maize in many areas of the northern Great Plains is not nearly as great today as it was in past generations. Finally, he offers a word of caution to plant geneticists saying that they could learn a lot from looking at the problems associated with the raising of domestic turkeys.The main theme of Dr. Nabhan's book focuses on the need for plant diversity and how the maintaining of a wide gene pool for each species is critical for the survival of each species. All of this, he cautions, has direct effects upon mankind because many of these plants form elements of our primary food supply. Throughout the book the author inserts brief warnings for the reader to ponder. On page 27, for example, the author notes the prevailing attitude among many plant geneticists. He quotes one of them as saying, &quot;If we need rare strains to breed a stronger variety of grain in the event of an epidemic, we go out and collect them.&quot; The problem, as Dr. Nabhan notes, is that already for many plants there are no longer wild strains to use."},{"Title":"Enduring Seeds: Native American Agriculture and Wild Plant Conservation","review":"Enduring seeds is a facinating read. The author, Gary Nahban, writes about the frigtening loss of diversity in crop varieties, their wild relatives, and the native cultures that once grew them. He explains why seed banks are not the answer to loss of diversity."},{"Title":"Enduring Seeds: Native American Agriculture and Wild Plant Conservation","review":"This book presents an enjoyable, thought-provoking and evocative series of essays on prehistoric and modern Native American agriculture. I recommend it to anyone interested in plant foods, how they are grown, and how they were grown before the industrialization of agriculture."},{"Title":"Enduring Seeds: Native American Agriculture and Wild Plant Conservation","review":"I enjoyed reading this collection of essays and am happy to have purchased it at Amazon. It introduced me to some new thoughts about the underpinnings of Amerindian agriculture and the implications of our present-day course in American agriculture and the probable outcome if it isn't changed or at least altered. It also introduced me to an unfamiliar author: his discourses were enjoyable because they were written by presenting the evidence for his particular line of thought and yet not preaching but rather allowing the reader to accept or reject on his own initiative rather than on the writer's bias. I am intending to buy other books written by him."},{"Title":"Enduring Seeds: Native American Agriculture and Wild Plant Conservation","review":"I will disclose at the start that I have met Gary Paul Nabhan and that Miguel Altieri (who wrote one of the two forwards) was a graduate student at the same time I was a postdoctoral student at the University of Florida. Both of us were being directed in our work by the late Willard Whitcomb. I spent some time at Miguel's agricultural plots and was impressed by his work. I have read or skimmed a few of Nabhan's books and was equally impressed by his depth of knowledge of native plants. \\"Enduring Seeds\\" is certainly up to his high standards.We really don't hear much of native agriculture, apart from corn, and yet the Native American cropping system was much more complex, including not only maize (corn), but its companions beans and squash, as well as amaranth, sunflowers, cranberries, blueberries and pecans, and a number of crop plants now lost to us. As Nabhan points out the Hohokam had probably the most complex agriculture in North America with large irrigation systems and many crops, including some now not seen north of Mexico. The irrigation system they developed worked well for about 150 years and then drought and salting out, followed by floods, caused serious disruptions. Within a few hundred years they had abandoned their land. Snaketown, where Phoenix now stands, went from a thriving community of over 1000 to dry desert. Now Phoenix is copying Snaketown in an even bigger way as probably one of the least sustainable cities in the United States.In \\"Enduring Seeds\\" Gary Paul Nabhan has delved deeply into the history to which we should pay more attention, instead of the emphasis on wars (although they certainly had their impacts). It is the history of the systems that sustain civilization that is at least as important as which general won which battle. It is also a fascinating story and Nabhan has captured it well in his book. He has also explained why, from a number of standpoints, we need to maintain the biodiversity of the planet, especially in crop plants. I urge anyone who has a stake in the future (and that is all of us) to consider reading this important volume. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"A Change of Climate","review":"When asked, rhetorically, by his sister, &quot;Whatever happened to the dinosaurs?&quot;, Ralph, the main character responds, &quot;Their habitat altered...A change of climate.&quot; In his rebellion against his parents, their closed, religiously fundamentalist point of view, and his father's financial blackmailing regarding his career choices, Ralph intentionally changes his physical habitat and his climate by escaping to South Africa with his bride.Working as a lay person at a mission and vigorously opposing apartheid, Ralph and Anna eventually are imprisoned, then banished to Bechuanaland, now Botswana. It is here that the savagery which creates a permanent and terrible climate in their marriage occurs, a savagery not limited to one race as Ralph and Anna had perceived in South Africa.As the story bounces from the present in England back twenty years to Africa, the reader lives through the vivid and terrible African experiences and simultaneously sees how they have permeated the lives of these good, but often nave, people. Both Ralph and Anna have rejected the traditional religion of their parents in favor of doing good deeds in their family lives and through a social service trust. But as Ralph's uncle James points out, &quot;There is nothing so appallingly hard...as the business of being human.&quot;While the reader cheers as James grows and eventually embraces life, s/he also fears for Anna, who remains emotionally closed, despite her good deeds, fearful that she &quot;should lose everything, one of these days.&quot; As the events resolve themselves and the &quot;competition in goodness&quot; comes to an end, we see real humans trying to put aside the petrified past and to change the climate of their lives, and we will, perhaps, evaluate our own lives. Can we accept change, or are we dinosaurs at heart?"},{"Title":"A Change of Climate","review":"I didn't discover Hilary Mantel until two weeks ago when I read a July 2005 New Yorker magazine (I don't remember the week).

And why, I demand to know, hasn't she won a Booker Prize?Anyway, in the two weeks since my discovery, I have read \\"A Change of Climate\\" and \\"Fludd\\". I now have before me \\"A Place of Greater Safety\\" which I hungrily look forward to. In fact, I plan to read all of her books. I even considered becoming one of those nuts who dedicates a web page to his or her favorite author. I won't, however, but not because Mantel is unworthy of such adulation, but because, well, I am not a nut.Finally, please allow me do the reader of \\"A Change of Climate\\" a great favor: do not read the back cover, as it tells way too much of the story. Instead, trust Mantel to tell you the story. You won't be disappointed. Great writing and great story."},{"Title":"A Change of Climate","review":"Instinctively, people know that when a pain is too great to be endured, it is appropriate to wait until it can be more rationally confronted. But there is always the danger of pushing the pain so far away that it becomes inaccessible, if never, ever forgotten. \\"To some people great grief is an indecency...They blame the bereaved.\\"After a stunning tragedy in Africa, where Ralph and Anna Eldred have gone as missionaries, they return home, cautioning their family never to speak of the horror they have endured. It is relegated to the past, where it will stay. The Eldred's are compliant people, particularly Ralph, a man of good intentions who works for the family charitable trust, providing necessities, such as food, clothing and shelter for those less fortunate. But for their brief years in Africa and the trauma they suffer on the Dark Continent, the Eldred's personify the spirit of missionary life.Once again residing in England providing for the downtrodden, Anna and Ralph live out a self-effacing routine. As a Christian, Ralph believes in service, so compassionate that he cannot turn away from those in need. Covertly, Ralph is concerned that people will mistake him for a man who loves mankind in general, but not persons in particular. However, this is exactly how he is perceived, soldiering on for over twenty years after the tragedy, burying himself in the trivia of everyday obligations. His endless pursuit of virtue in hopes of atonement can never be realized.Meanwhile, Anna suffers grievously for Ralph's neglect, enduring a constant ache, her own survival defined by the ever-present needs of her four children. Anna has paid a terrible price for her silence all these years. Ralph grows more distant and preoccupied, Anna more edgy and neither expects the emotional eruption when Ralph falls into a romantic entanglement with a local woman.Mantel is gifted writer, dissecting her character's motivations with elegant precision, especially their great missionary hubris, the vagrant self-congratulatory thoughts that creep into even the most well-meant acts, as the couple seeks to bury the past under the weight of the present. Layer upon layer, the author builds a structure that appears sturdy but ultimately collapses under the weight of grief and silence. Whether the couple recovers will be determined by their spiritual strengths and human weaknesses, the delicate balance between expectations and reality. Luan Gaines/2004."},{"Title":"A Change of Climate","review":"A lot of American readers may be put off by the rather dryly literate writing style of this British writer, but I would urge them to stick it out for a deep and true read, with an ending that is uplifting, but as painful and complex as life itself. As one who grew up with the benefit of an idealistic liberal education and travelled the world widely and deeply, and like the protoganists of this book found that the almost diefied third world races are no less free of the capacity to do evil than white westerners, this novel had a brave ring of truth. In fact, it is so against the grain that I'm surprised it wasn't condemned by the liberal elites who write most of the book reviews. A different view of the missionary experience, as well as Mantel's classical prose and subtly unfolding plot make an interesting antidote to the simplistically politically correct and gimmickally narrated bestseller, Barbara Kinsolver's &quot;The Poisonwood Bible.&quot; This is one of the few books I've read in recent years that had something new and original to say."},{"Title":"A Change of Climate","review":"This is the first novel of Hilary Mantel that I've read, and I'm eager to read more. Her style is her strength: she is a keen observer of human character, human fraility, human environments, and she describes the environment, emotions and atmospheres with a crystal clarity. For example, her paragraph about the end of a semester caused me to relive those times: \\"only dogged by that usual feeling of anticlimax the end of exams brings. After this, you think, after my papers are over, I will do, and I will do ... and then you don't. You are a shell, enclosing outworn effort. You expect a sense of freedom, and yet you feel trapped in the same old body, the same drab routines; you expect exhilaration, and you only feel a kind of habitual dullness, a letdown, a perverse longing for the days when you read and made notes and sat up all night.\\"Mantel's characters are muddlers. They muddle through life with good intentions, but feel displaced and unsatisfied. Yet you care for them, and say to yourself, \\"I know these people!\\" There are many robust characters [Ralph and Anna, missionaries in Africa; their children, searching for their place in the world; Ralph's sister Emma] and threads interwoven through the basic story. The main characters are Ralph and Anna, missionaries who go to Africa to \\"do good\\". Evil events there haunt their lives when they return to England.The novel is written as an \\"entertaining read\\", in a page-turning style -- you are interested in the characters and events. Yet it is a substantial work, addressing important themes: good versus evil, do our choices make a difference, the cost of cultural misunderrstandings, the loss of faith, how any sense of security is an illusion. While entertaining, Mantel is not afraid of the artist's obligation to tell us unpalatable truths about ourselves.My one complaint is that the ending was too predictable; I felt that the novel was \\"wrapped up\\", rather than allowed to find its own ending."},{"Title":"A Change of Climate","review":"&quot;A Change of Climate&quot; begins like a Jane Austen comedy of manners: close observation of the social rituals which enable people to not speak the through. Even some of the characters (Ralph's and Anna's parents, for example) seem taken from a 19th century novelistic description of religious fanatics. It is not long, however, before th novel leaves Austen in the dust--and blood. I found the novel to be intellectually stimulating--is it possible to be good?--and profoundly disturbing. I think the novel is perfect for bookclubs. I am looking forward to reading &quot;The Giant O'Brien&quot; and &quot;An Experiment in Love.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Change of Climate","review":"I'd read Hilary Mantel's Bring Up the Bodies and [please insert title of first Tudor book] and had been enthralled with her use of the English language to bring characters and settings to life. I wondered whether her grasp of dialogue was limited to historical subjects. Not so. Even in a contemporary setting, her characters speak as real people do. And her ability to place the reader in the scene, seeing, hearing, smelling, and tasting the elements of the setting is extraordinary. I can't recommend the book enough and look forward to reading the remainder of her work."},{"Title":"A Change of Climate","review":"In A Change Of Climate Hilary Mantel presents what is essentially a family saga, but in settings that add extra dimensions to the expected dilemmas. The family in question is the Eldreds. Ralph and Anna have shared an unusual if not an altogether unconventional married life. They have spent time in Africa as missionaries. They have devoted their time to helping others less advantaged than themselves. Ralph runs a charitable trust in Norfolk in the east of England. But they have also found the time and energy to raise children of their own and experience the day-to-day pressures of any family's life. But there has been more, more that has not been voiced.Volunteer missionary work took them to South Africa, to a township called Elim near Johannesburg. It was during the era of toughening Apartheid, a time when new powers threatened whole communities with eviction and resettlement to \\"tribal homelands\\". Ralph and Anna begin to identify with their community and deal with certain people who held particular opinions about the way South African society was being organised. Their activities catch the eye of the local police and, as a consequence of their contact, Ralph and Anna are arrested and imprisoned.For them there is a way out of jail, and it is a way that is not available, of course, to the others who had been associated with them in Elim, those who have to continue living with the injustice that seems to affect the lives of the Eldreds. Hilary Mantel's novel, however, doggedly follows the Eldreds to Botswana, where the family apparently gives up thinking about those they have left behind. Known then as Bechuanaland, Botswana provides the family with an opportunity, but they are offered a posting that the previous incumbents did not appear to like. By this time Anna has been through a pregnancy and has been blessed with twins. It seems, however, that the mission's previous occupants were correct about the undesirability of the posting. Problems ensue for the Eldreds. What happens to the couple in the latter days of their stay in southern Africa is crucial to the plot of the A Change Of Climate. But there are two or three aspects to these events, not just one relating to a child. Perhaps sometimes overlooked is the fate of the others involved with the tragic events at the end of the family's time in Botswana, a fate that returns to haunt via an almost passing mention towards the end of the book. Guilt, it seems, has many manifestations, mostly ignored.Back in Britain, the Eldreds devote themselves to assisting those less fortunate than themselves. Thus Melanie appears on the scene. She is young, self-abusing, antisocial and in need. But then all these characters find themselves in need - in need of comfort, reassurance, something that might salve the conscience, replace the loss, turn time around and allow a different path to be taken. Devoted to alleviating the suffering of others, neither Ralph nor Anna can cope with their own traumas. These have to be lived with and relived every day, the guilt they engender colouring most of their lives. Ways out of the impasse of coping are always at hand, however. When Ralph and Anna's son takes up with the daughter of a local single mum who ekes out a living from standing markets and trading junk, an opportunity burns suddenly bright and new suffering and guilt is wrought in the furnace.In the end, no matter what life throws at us, we all depend on one another and need the succour of others to survive. This remains the case, even when our ideals lead us blandly towards avoidable tragedy and our ensuing suffering impinges on the lives of others.Hilary Mantel's novel invites us to empathise with the suffering and guilt of Ralph and Anna Eldred. But what the book fails to examine in depth is their motives. Given the consequence of some of their actions, whether intended or not, these could surely have come under greater scrutiny."},{"Title":"A Change of Climate","review":"Having read about some of the atrocities committed in the Rwanda wars between the Hutus and the Tutsis, I didn't expect to be shocked by anything in this novel. But reader beware: this novel contains some appalling violence. It is so shocking, or was to me, that it overbalanced the story, and I doubt if that is what Mantel intended to do. But then again, maybe she did. A theme of the book is evolution, and from the events depicted, it is clear that not everyone has evolved all that much from the days of the dinosaurs [not that they co-existed anyway, Alley Oop notwithstanding]. I have asked around a bit, to try to find out if such practices actually happened, but I don't know anyone who knows the tribal practices that well. So in this novel you see English middle-class gentility juxtaposed against the mores of the bush, and one man's determination, despite what he knows of \\"the evil that lurks in the heart of man\\" to do what he can to help others, however futile, whatever the cost to his own family.

A CHANGE OF CLIMATE revolves around the lives of Ralph and Anna Eldred, two British missionaries who, in their endeavor to make living easier for others, endure tremendous cruelty and heartbreak through the same grace of God. The story spits in the face of compassion. It is a fable with the moral &quot;no good deed goes unpunished.&quot; Though Mantel is obviously a gifted writer, I did not find this book to be enthralling.

I liked how it dealt with some big issues, such as how teens and young adults react to parents' expectations with respect to education, careers, and marriage; good versus evil; cultural differences and their impacts; the loss of faith; and the question of whether people have choices and how they deal with them. Can they change?On the other hand, I didn't find this book a page turner except for the parts in Africa.One reviewer thought the ending was too predictable and \\"wrapped up,\\" but I felt it was not. I thought there were many loose ends. I suppose life is like that though.The characters of Ralph and Anna were well developed. One of the daughters, Kit, struck me as odd. I could understand her desire to return to Africa where she was born, but she often acted very immature as if she were still a teenager.

Or, if you need to spend it, buy plain yogurt -- you will find the bland white stuff much more exciting than this novel.

In the course of the book, there are love affairs, savage beatings, and a kidnapping or two, and all these incidents unfold without an ounce of passion, desire, or emotion.

Much of the book is spent discribing the war itself, including strategic maneuvers and battle details, and although sometimes these things affected the generals' relationships with the CSA government, most of Eicher's battle depictions don't touch on this. Way too much time is spent on the generic \\"what happened\\" and way too little time was spent analyzing it in the context of the book's stated theme. Further, when a war event was analyzed, it wasn't synthesized; for example, much time was spent describing Congressional debates as, \\"Again, much talk and no action with nobody winding up happy,\\" but no time was spent on proving how any such occassion actually ruined the Confederate cause. In short, all Eicher proved was that the CSA acted like a country with a central government that debated amongst itself, but he totally failed to prove not only that this doomed the CSA but also that it even hurt the short-lived country in the slightest bit.BUT, it was not a totally horrible book. In fact, I found it to be rather entertaining and well-written in terms of following the war from the CSA government's perspective. Personally, I would still recommend this book, but only to those who understand that what it gives is a very readable Southern-view synopsis of the war with some rather interesting stories that I haven't found elsewhere about what happened inside Richmond. I picked up this book originally hoping to learn a lot about the inner CSA government and the relationships between Davis, the Congress, the governors, and the generals, and I suppose I did get some of that goal accomplished. However, I still cannot give more than 3 stars, which is a stretch in itself, since so much of the book is devoted to the war itself rather than the politics."},{"Title":"Dixie Betrayed: How the South Really Lost the Civil War","review":"Eicher's book is an excellent account of the political turmoil which affected the Confederacy during the Civil War, but I think his thesis, which blames the Southern failure to achieve independence on \\"betrayal\\" and the subordination of national concerns to the philosophical alter of states' rights is wrong. The question is not why the South ultimately lost the Civil War, but rather how it came so close to winning its independence.The answers are in the end quite simple. The North won because it had the ability, in terms of manpower and material, to withstand the failures of its military leaders during the first two years of the War and because Lincoln was able to prevent the peace movement in the North from gaining a foothold. The South lost because it was unable to capitalize on its early military successes by sufficiently undercutting Lincoln's home front support and, as a result, it failed to obtain foreign recognition or support. Had the North not been saddled with military commandeers like McClellan Burnside and Hooker, the War should have ended with the Peninsula campaign of 1862 or Federal victories at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville. The North's superiority in manpower and materials enabled it to survive these military disasters until Grant proved his value as a commander with his victories in the West. If the South had been able to follow up on its early miliary victories, the political sniping which Eicher argues betrayed the Confederacy would not have occurred or would not have poisoned Davis' presidency. . The Civil War was won on the battlefields; it was not lost as a result of political blunders of Souther politicians."},{"Title":"Dixie Betrayed: How the South Really Lost the Civil War","review":"I agree with others who label this book as a misdirected bit of poor analysis. It's hard to find a book on the Civil War with less support for its thesis than this one. Every nation has political divisions. The author does not explain why those divisions were the reason why the South lost. The South had a variety of disadvantages that could not be overcome. The war was indeed won by the side that had four times the amount of people and much stronger industrial resources. When the North found good leadership, it was only a matter of time before the South would lose.Another really annoying thing about this book: The author discusses the military campaigns too much. If you're writing a book about how political divisions doomed the South, why talk about the Battle of Gettysburg for four pages? Chickamauga and Chattanooga for four pages? Why discuss the many divisions in the North? Why didn't political divisions doom the Yankee war effort?I think the author is using this book to try to sell his other one about the military history of the war. He sells this book as a groundbreaking discussion of the problem of states rights in a nation trying to win a national war, but I'm not convinced that he even develops that argument much.This book of elementary analysis offers little that students of the war wouldn't know. Not worth your time."},{"Title":"Dixie Betrayed: How the South Really Lost the Civil War","review":"Some information presented in this book is interesting and informative. It is at the very end of the book that Eicher shows his true stripes.He uses his conclusions to criticize Southern historians for historical revisionism and Southerners in general as living in a fantasy land of Confederate heroes and dreams of the \\"Lost Cause.\\" This is typical patronization of the Southerner who is proud of his heritage and history. Save you money and purchase a history written to present facts and not to forward an agenda."},{"Title":"Dixie Betrayed: How the South Really Lost the Civil War","review":"The author tries to prove that the South did not lose due to lack of men, and material, but from dissension within. In this he fails miserably. Another reinvention of history."},{"Title":"Dixie Betrayed: How the South Really Lost the Civil War","review":"This book is a huge dose of fantasty and political correctness. He could have written about the war crimes committed by the Lincoln government. Lincoln held his nation together by suppression of the press, imprisonment of innocents and various and numerous war crimes. To say the South was not defeated by overwhelming military and industrial might paints one as a sheer nutcase. If he author cannot write the truth he should just label his books what they are....fiction."},{"Title":"Dixie Betrayed: How the South Really Lost the Civil War","review":"Once again we have to endure another book where the concusion was arrived at prior to any research being done. I admit that it is not the worst book I've ever read....but it comes mighty close. The author's prejudices prevent him from being fair and objective. Let's put this book where it belongs and lael it as fiction."},{"Title":"Dixie Betrayed: How the South Really Lost the Civil War","review":"Eicher offers his own significant analysis of what he views as the central issue: I don't need it and I want buy it!Would someone please tell me any war in any country that has not, does not have disputes, factions and all the rest that Eicher's describes in his Analysis.It is obvious that the winners of these wars are alkl about stiking terror into the hearts of the people, who they deem their foes. They are terriorist, demanding, cruel and want to win at any cost (ex:LINCOLN, HITLER), they should be judged by their actions and not what they say.The South lost the War because they were too Civilized!"},{"Title":"Dixie Betrayed: How the South Really Lost the Civil War","review":"David Eicher has a difficult premise to prove but makes a good logical case for it. The short form is that the Southern mentality contained the seeds of the South's defeat. In saying this, he upsets all the Lost cause Mythology types, the new crop of Political Correctness types, in addition to all those that will disagree with his premise. This is a very heavy load for one book to bear and with all the naysayer's, I'm not sure a fair review is possible. One problem is the to lurid title, promising more than the premise can possibly deliver. However, with 120+ books on the American Civil War being released in 2006, I can understand wanting a \\"grabber\\" tile.What this book contains is an intelligent description of CSA politics during the war. Detailing the waste of time, petty feuds and nastiness that the President, Congress and the state governors engaged in opens a window into a world that most histories ignore. Jefferson Davis often bears this alone. The book shows how much help he had from Stephens, Wigfall, Cobb, Brown and a legion of others. Their preference for obstructing, debating and endless obsession with \\"State's Rights\\" ended whatever small chance the South had for victory.The war plays out in the background as Richmond and the states fight it out on center stage. The \\"CSA government\\" often is the President vs. the Vice-president with congress back stabbing both. The other option is the CSA congress unable to produce anything but endless debate. The sovereign state governors, see little reason for a central government and bicker with it over everything, until a Union Army appears on their borders. This leads to endless agreement over state regiments, where they are stationed and who commands them.At the heart of the problem is the life experience of these men. They are the \\"opposition\\", a role that they can not abandon when they become the nation. All of them had spent their political life fighting the United States of America, if their party was in power or not. Proud to a fault, ready to argue the smallest point of order and used to obstructing legislation they carry these traits to Richmond, damaging their cause and reducing any chance of winning the war.The chapter \\"Peace Proposals\\" and the Epilogue are worth the price of the book. The Epilogue contains as good a short history of the development of and Northern response to the \\"Lost Cause\\" as I've found. \\"Peace Proposals\\", shows how the years of silliness finally cause an almost total breakdown of the Confederacy. David Eicher is a very good writer but this is not an easy nor quick read. If you stay with it, you will gain a valuable insight into why the CSA government didn't work and the impact this has on the war effort."},{"Title":"Dixie Betrayed: How the South Really Lost the Civil War","review":"Eicher presents his view of the downfall of the Confederacy, based on internal political dissent and the failure of Jefferson Davis and the Confederate Congress to resolve their many differences. He raises good points, although William Davis addresses many of these issues, in Look Away, in a somewhat more cohesive book. Eicher is strong on character sketches of key Confederate politicians, some of whom are not well known. The book drags at times, with long, somewhat tedious, quotations filling up more page space than is needed. However, the final chapter, his Epilogue, does an excellent job of explaining why the South lost the military aspects of the war but won the subsequent intellectual history of the conflict."},{"Title":"Dixie Betrayed: How the South Really Lost the Civil War","review":"Dixie Betrayed (How the South Really Lost the Civil War) is a fascinating look at the government of the Confederate States of America. David J. Eicher explains why the Confederate States were doomed from the start, despite so many early victories on the battlefields. His revealing look at how the Confederate Congress functioned, and the battles that it fought contains all the intrigue associated with modern politics.Eicher claims that the Confederacy was \`born sick'. His thesis is that the states that succeeded from the Union were too strongly in favor of state's rights to form a new government strong enough to rule. He goes to great length to find first source historical records to prove this. He pieces together private correspondence from Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy, Congressional leaders, and state governors to show a government in complete disarray. But he never probes into any other aspect of the Civil War.He could have just as easily made a very similar case against the United States government. Like Davis, Abraham Lincoln had few friends in his Congress. Lincoln also suspended the writ of habeas corpus, declared martial law in major cities, jailed citizens for months for flimsy reasons allowing them no legal recourse. Lincoln was just as guilty as Davis of micromanaging the military, putting incompetent men in positions of power, and playing favorites through out the government. Both Presidents were also stubborn and refused to listen to anyone that disagreed with them.The book is one of the few times that a major historian has looked beyond the battles to the inner workings of the Confederacy to find a reason for their loss. In doing so Eicher reveals the power struggles and back biting that prevented the Confederate government from being able to capitalize on the South's military victories. He illustrates the difficulty in waging a war when the central government does not have clear power to assert itself over the individual state governments. As the war progressed, he argues, the states became more focused on themselves and less willing to contribute troops, materials, and monies to the war effort; all the time expecting more and more from the Confederate Congress.At times it seems as if Eicher is repeating himself when he writes about the dealings of President Davis and his Congress. This is because so often they covered the same ground, never coming to a real conclusion. While that was indeed the case many times, it does cause the book to drag towards the end. Readers that are not historians may well wish Eicher had used few (or at least shorter) quotes to make his points, and that he would have kept the plot moving a bit faster.This is not a comprehensive look at the Civil War. Eicher has chosen not discuss any battle or skirmish in detail, except to point out a particular failing of the Confederate Congress or President. He also mentions none of the problems the war created in the North, or the difficulties Lincoln faced in his own Congress.It is a compelling thesis written in clear, easy text making it accessible to today's readers. Southern Traditionalists are going to be bothered that there is none of the romanticisms of the South in Dixie Betrayed, and military buffs are going to be let down by the lack of attention paid to the battles. But readers looking for something new on a very well documented topic are going to be pleased with this book, even if it seems a bit slanted at times."},{"Title":"Dixie Betrayed: How the South Really Lost the Civil War","review":"I've just started reading this book. I was curious to see the reviews that had already been posted. My impression on reading them is that they are the epitome of \\"Lost Cause\\" romanticism (the idea that \\"Johnnie Reb\\" and his peerless leaders were only beaten by sheer weight of Yankee numbers). If you read the \\"one star\\" reviews, you'd get the impression that the author's thesis is that the South lost because of incompetent leadership and that its materiel disadvantage did not matter at all.While I haven't finished this book, I have gone through the prologue and epilogue, and I can safely say that this is not the case. Rather, he seeks to debunk the notion that the Confederate military and political leaders' mistakes did not play a role in the Confederacy's defeat.I don't think anyone who has read about the Civil War and is objective about it, can dismiss the fact that sometimes Confederates made grotesque mistakes. What about Pickett's Charge at Gettysburg? What about the inept Confederate leadership that led to the fall of Vicksburg?So I'd advise people to give this book a chance to make its case. Don't let \\"partisans of the Lost Cause\\" distort perceptions of what really happened."},{"Title":"Dixie Betrayed: How the South Really Lost the Civil War","review":"As Eicher eloquently points out, notable men such as John Calhoun and Louis Wigfall wanted secession desperately for years before it finally happened. Most of the politicians and more than a few Confederate officers saw secession as a way to win personal glory and a brilliant future in a new nation for themselves.... remember that they had grown up with Grandpa's glorious tales of fighting for liberty in the American Revolution. And, as usual, it was the common man who had to actually fight and die in the war.There were many causes of this war.....states' rights, tariff issues, slavery, agrarian economy vs industrial, a sense of personal honor and duty to defend one's home state...and yes, unfortunately, greed and EGO also played a big part for some.I gave this book only three stars because Eicher does refer with derision to \\"lost causers.\\" The south DID lose the war...but that doesn't mean that the honor and courage of southern soldiers was all in vain. The average citizen was defending his home and family, and saw his whole way of life destroyed. THe southern armies WERE overwhelmed by numbers (as well as the lack of proper supplies) and not by lack of personal courage.This book will undoubtedly raise hackles despite its many harsh truths. Worth a read by historians, War Between the States buffs and scholars, and political scientists."},{"Title":"Dixie Betrayed: How the South Really Lost the Civil War","review":"DIXIE BETRAYED: HOW THE SOUTH REALLY LOST THE CIVIL WAR analyzes the Confederate government and how its decisions caused it to lose the war. The Confederate politicians have long been applauded as fighters but in fact were divided by conspiracy and dysfunction. Previously unexplored sources are used to document in-house battles that even evolved to threats and physical violence. With military decisions coming more from political influence than skill and years of unresolved debates evolving over government setup, the South was doomed to lose.Diane C.
