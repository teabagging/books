I love old medical books in general and this one in particular. The history of medicine is a complicated study and a fascinating look into where we have been and how we got to where we are today. Older text such as this need not be avoided by nonmedical individuals; although a bit of a background will certainly enhance the reading pleasure greatly. Some of the bits of information we pick up in this particular volume are as pertinent today as they were in 1906, when this particular book was published. Other offerings of advice and items of complete fact, as perceived at that time, will make you absolutely shiver and wonder why mankind has survived as long as we have.\\"Never, except in emergency, operate on a woman who is menstruating - a week after it has ceased is the best time.\\"\\"The operating-room of a good modern hospital is, of course, the best place to operate, but you may have to improvise sometimes. Make sure the room is well lighted and remove unnecessary furniture.\\"\\"Do not forget that epilepsy in a child may mean congenital syphilis.\\"\\"Fat persons are especially bad risks.\\"\\"Surgical services have no fixed costs; they are without value in that they are invaluable. Remember, as a general rule, large fees have a tendency to elevate the surgeon and the profession of surgery in the eyes of the laity.\\" (I just loved this one).\\"It is possible that chronic arthritis may be due to absorption of poisons from a sluggish bowel.\\"\\"You must know the anatomy of the part and the pathology of the condition, or you will never have lasting success.\\" (Go figure).\\"Never plunge a trochar through the skin - always incise first.\\"\\"Remember that idiots, insane persons, or perverts very frequently insert a foreign body in the rectum.\\"In reference to rest for the surgeon: \\"Rest secured by means of poison injected into the human organism is apt to do more harm than good. I am convinced that the administration of such drugs as belladonna, cocain, (Cocaine), morphine, strychnine, veratrum, digitalis and other poisons by even our most highly educated physicians who uses these drugs, overestimates his own knowledge of the action of the drug.\\"Quite a number of surgical conditions are described in this small 281 page work. Each of the operations are a story within themselves. Now you must remember when reading this work. this was written over 100 years ago. We should not laugh as this was state of the art at that time. There is no doubt of my mind that many eyebrows will be read 100 years from now when they look over our procedure books.If you enjoy history, you will enjoy this work. If you are a healthcare professional you will enjoy it also.It is a wonderful little book to have around just to read bits and pieces here and there."},{"Title":"CLEP History of the United States II w/CD (REA) - The Best Test Prep for the CLE (Test Preps)","review":"I just took the CLEP exam today and I scored a 47.

The format of the questions was not the same (the study guide had zero long quotations to read and answer questions about, but the real exam had many) and the material covered was not remotely distributed the same way. The bulk of the material covered in the study guide was mentioned little or not at all on the exam; the exam contained many many many questions about things that were mentioned little or not at all in the book.

The questions on my CLEP were very similar to the practice test, not word for word or anything but very similar. Sure, 10-15% of the questions were on material that in no way could be deduced from the text of this book, but you could not answer any of them and still pass. People who are looking for a complete representation of the test from 75 pages of review text are kidding them selves. The test covers a hundred and fourty five years for goodness sake. If all you are looking to do is pass then look no further. This is all I studied (read the review section twice and took each practice test) and I got a 60.If you are looking for a all inclusive knowledge of US History II look elsewhere.

The test in on US history everything: civil rights, tons of authors of articles and book, a lot about the progressive period. I have never written a review but I thought a recent review was necessary for this CLEP test and to help people in the future. I passed with a 56 which I thought was pretty good for not taking a history course in six years and have been studying nursing for the past three years. Good luck!!

The practice tests are accurate representations of the actual test as well. The only problem is that the software overestimates your scaled score, but it's easy to get around this. Just take the raw percentage the software gives you and use it with the chart in the book to get your real scaled score.

Not only did this book not prepare you for the true clep, it disallusioned me into believing that I was more prepared. However, upon receiving a 42, I realize that is not the case.

The book was great and definitely assisted me in passing this test, however as another review noted, there are a handful of questions that are not mentioned in the book. I think one other reviewer mentioned the question \\"what river was Mark Twain a river boat boat captain on?\\" I still don't know even though I attempted to look it up before the test so that was a pretty obscure question. There are also many questions about authors and famous literary works of the time. I thought it was a relatively easy test though, I only studied for approximately two days. I read the book once and took both practice exams twice.I passed the test with a 54, not great but I passed and that was my goal. Had I studied more of course I would have scored better but I only needed a 50 for credit as my University does not assign a letter grade and it is pass/fail. For the amount of time I put into studying...I was satisfied with the outcome.I have passed 11 clep exams in two years, while taking full time classes by using nothing but the REA clep books!!

Though U.S. History is one of my favorite subjects, I only scored a 51 on the online practice test before I picked up the study guide. Indeed, the REA study guide was a welcome refresher for things that I'd forgotten. It's important to remember that there are different versions of each CLEP exam, with equally different levels of difficulty, so it's tough (if not impossible) for any one guide to cover everything that could possibly be on a test. Nevertheless, I'm confident that the REA brand of CLEP study guides WILL help get you that 50 and above when used properly.PFC Madu, A.J.United States Army"},{"Title":"CLEP History of the United States II w/CD (REA) - The Best Test Prep for the CLE (Test Preps)","review":"The book is good, but you need to memorize every single work in there to pass on the exam.

Seriously, people, only two questions.When I got home, I grabbed the book just to see if I had missed some small print that stated questions weren't related to CLEP test (actually, the book claims to draw it's practice questions from the actual CLEP exam, which is a flat-out lie), only to notice that the author of the book is no other than Lynn Marlowe, who, coincidentally, happened to be one of my college professors. Now it all makes sense to me. If you think this book was an irrelevant mess, try taking one of her classes. I'm tempted to email the woman and ask her for my money back for this book.So I'm telling you now (as a 4.0 honor student who cares about this kind of stuff), do not waste your money on this junk.

ILM has formed the cornerstone of LucasFilm Ltd. a company that has spawned more spin-offs such as THX Sound, Skywalker Sound, all held neatly under the Lucas Digitial banner. Back in the days of Star Wars it was mostly using what was already known, and inventing everything else. ILM has been at the forefront ever since, from the early days of motion control cameras controlled by Apple computers the latest CG marvel like Galaxy Quest, Phantom Menace or Mission to Mars.The Art of Special Effects deals more with the older films-those before 1986, illustrating a time when computers were not so large a part in the film-making process. It gives the reader a great look at the sheer amount of detail that went into the models, the props, costumes from Star Wars to Explorers, from Raiders of the Lost Ark to the some of the Star Trek films, ILM constantly and consistently proven to innovative. The book as a whole is on a level lower than, say, Cinefex magazine, assuming that the reader doesn't know how blue screening and rotoscoping works or how miniatures are lensed. It is light reading without getting itself bogged down in too much technicality, for those who want that, read Cinefex.It also strikes me that this book is also best at presenting a dying era. A time when model makers kit bashed hundreds of plastic models just to build a Super Star Destroyer - few companies bother with that any more when everything can be rendered on a Silicon Graphics box and Maya and Soft Image software. Such films as Star Trek: Insurrection used few practical models and a completely CG Enterprise-E. The time of the supremely detailed, hand crafted model or set may be at an end, and I think the industry will be sadder for it. Partially because when I read Cinefex, a lot of what I see is the same-different movie, different space ship, but they're all rendered the same way and most use the same software, with only minor modifications or original code going into it to get a certain look or solve a certain problem.I suspect the Digital Realm of the movies, while producing better special effects, lacks the mystique of knowing that several people labored for months to build that model. That instead it was modeled by a few people over a period of a week. (Though it should be noted that a lot of films, including the Phantom Menace, used practical models). I suspect their days are number."},{"Title":"Industrial Light & Magic: the Art of Special Effects","review":"Thomas Smith was general manager of Industrial Light and Magic a year before he came to write this impressive book. The book is centred around the film special effects creations of ILM between 1975 and 1985. This includes the then &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy, two Indiana Jones movies and other lesser known projects. For the Star Wars fan theres plenty to learn about one of your favourite movies. This book is lavishly illustrated with full colour photos including triple page or gatefold images. The focus though is on how the effects are done and who did them at ILM. From the art work in developing concepts of storylines, through modelling, creature creation, the actual filming methods and matte image creation to the finishing touches of animation and optical compositing this book gives a gradual demonstration of the work of a special effects company. For someone with no knowledge what so ever of special effects this is a good introduction and to those involved it must be fascinating as well. As Thomas Smith points out, while film fans still love the movies from this era (1975-85), movie goers constantly seek new visions on screen. The digital era has brought movies like Toy Story etc but these were just figments of imagination at the writing of this book so its worth noting Thomas Smith's far-sightedness in the final chapter on digitized movies. The format of the book is to take each department of the special effects process and show what it does and where its part comes in the crafting of a movie. In each chapter there are short biographies of the leading people in each area of effects, this is a nice touch as it can serve as guide for those interested in getting involved. Its worth noting, many of those profiled have a long interest in their specialty going back to their youth and through the various twists and turns of working in an industry knew of other members of the ILM company before actually joining this now esteemed organisation. Thomas Smith by no means is setting out to sell ILM's considerable expertise though he tells the story of a company making dreams into reality, itself moving from an idea to a serious business proposition. (As a final note another book on movies of this period Paul Sammons &quot;Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner&quot; contains insightful descriptions about the crafting of a movie not least its special effects.)"},{"Title":"Industrial Light & Magic: the Art of Special Effects","review":"Years ago I longed for this book, as it sat on the shelf in the local book store(it was not cheap).

I must own a dozen 'Dummies' books, and this is by far the least instructive and useful.That said, who would benefit from reading the book?- An absolute beginner who needs encouragement to start exploring scanner settings.- A scavenger who wants a full chapter on how to connect a SCSI scanner that he/she obtained for free on Craigslist.- Someone who wants instruction on Paint Shop Pro (and not Adobe photo applications).- Users who have no interest in retouching or restoring older photos.The author, it seemed to me, had little interest or experience in scanning, retouching and restoring older images. To be more specific, the Histogram setting is not even mentioned and the info on adjusting Highlights, Shadows and Gamma settings is so superficial as to be of little or no help. However, the author does excel when discussing hardware issues.I have since read and recommend as vastly superior 'How To Do Everything With Your Scanner.'

If you are an experianced player who is satisfyed with the way they aim, pass on this book and use your money/effort/time to invest in something else. On the other hand, if you are just starting out, or an intermediate player who wants to learn how to aim properly, by all means get this book. However, this book requires ample work and concentration on your part for his methods to take effect.P.S.Be prepared for a dry read. . ."},{"Title":"Answers to a Pool Player's Prayers","review":"This book has not only showed me knew things (Especially the subtleties hidden from the average shooting eye) but has verified the things which I learned but could not explain. This is not a common book. By the way, this is the ONLY BOOK EVER TO BE ENDORSED BY THE GREATEST NAME IN POOL --MOSCONI!!"},{"Title":"Answers to a Pool Player's Prayers","review":"I've spent years on the pool table, both practicing and playing. I've learned a lot over the years, but I still struggle with that age old problem of being able to communicate what I'm seeing to where I'm aiming. If your a &quot;natural&quot; to the game of pool(who is?), this book may not be for you. I am not a natural and to me the game is so hard. This book taught me about myself and how to properly align myself to the table, the cue ball and the cue. The alignment starts with the eyes and extends through the chest and arms, ending with the cue. Learning about the relationship of my entire body to the cue has given me the confidence I've been missing to become the player I've always dreamed of. This book teaches the most important aspect of pool, how to aim. It seems odd that no one has ever taught this. It is basic and at the same time, revolutionary. An absolute must for anyone that wants to enjoy the game."},{"Title":"Answers to a Pool Player's Prayers","review":"Hi!I've just purchased this book. Despite the good reviews, I did not enjoy this book at all. Yes, I admit that the information contained in this book is quite useful, since it explains quite a lot of physics behind aiming and a few other issues.However, I'm afraid I will have to agree with the contributor of the previous review. Like him, I find that the author of this book has over-analyzed the aiming process. Pardon my poor English command, but what I'm trying to say now is, he is \\"thinking too much\\". No offence intended. He makes the topic of aiming so scary, as well as profound. I feel that should I follow his instructions, I will not be able to enjoy the game.I strongly suggest that you guys think of other ways to improve your game (such as getting a coach) instead of getting this book, unless you have such a serious problem with your aiming that nobody can help you (including a coach).I guess the only useful topic in this book is alignment.To end my review, if you are only interested in physics, by all means get this book, as it contains tons of physics explanations. However, if you are finding a way to improve your game, please, consider other ways before you have to resort to buying this book.Once again, no offence intended, but I'm just sharing my thoughts about this book."},{"Title":"Answers to a Pool Player's Prayers","review":"I found this book overanalyzed, making the aiming process quite complex (opposite as it should be). Even though the AIMING section of the book offers some good stuff, I'll suggest that you take the time to read it only if you find yourself having REAL trouble pocketing balls.Personally, I found myself focusing too much on technicalities rather than making my aiming process the easygoing part of my game.You might find most of the subjects easier explained and far more understandable in other books.Perhaps this book is better intended for beginners, and it would be a good idea to make a notice on the book."},{"Title":"Answers to a Pool Player's Prayers","review":"This book might work if the cue ball would travel on a straight line which it hardly ever does. In order to aim properly you have to understand the compensation required for the shot at hand. Deciding factors are squirt, spin and glance of angles that change with speed and length of shot.I bought this book and it is a total waste of your time!"},{"Title":"Answers to a Pool Player's Prayers","review":"This book should come with a pair of long floppy shoes and a red nose, because if you think it really will answer your prayers you will feel like a clown once you've read it. As a snooker coach I like to keep up with any new ideas but i was extremely dissapointed with this book's overcomplication of aiming.Save your money spend half an hour pocketing long straight diagonal shots and you will learn more than this book will teach you about your aiming. Also because of throw the true angle of a shot is not the point on the object ball farthest from the pocket. The only way to get accurate is to look at each shot see where the object ball has to go to make a clean entry get down with the object balls line of travel in mind and when you are sure your going to send it there shoot.Trust yourself. If you have played for any length of time your subconscious will know the right angle.

In addition, the anthropomorphic, sensationalistic style with which the authors portray supposedly \\"dangerous\\" animals assigns the natural world a false and malicious attitude that simply does not exist.

Every year an average of about two hundred proverb collections appear worldwide, spanning the spectrum from smallpopular books to major national collections to important comparative works in two or more languages. As scholarly interests become increasingly global, it is the international collectionsthat are gaining in value not only for paremiologists but for anthropologists, linguists, folklorists, cultural historians, and foreign-language instructors as well. Several years ago the reviewer noted the need for more polyglot collections (MIEDER19 90); Metin Yurtbasi'smassive and impressive A Dictionary of Turkish Proverbs is a prime example of such a work.The title may not do justice to this proverb collection, suggesting as it does that the book is simply a compilation of Turkish proverbs in English translation. This book is, in part, precisely that, but it also contains much other information that makes it unique among modern bilingual proverb collections. While Turkish-English proverb dictionaries havebeen published before (e.g., DAGPINA1R9 82; MUALLIMOGL19U8 8) they fade in comparison to Yurtbasi's argantuan undertaking. His new collection contains more than five thousand Turkish proverbs with English translations, cultural explanations, and, whenever possible,an equivalent proverb from English. References to major proverb collections are also included.The following example illustrates the author's lexicographical procedure:A1 elmay tas atan cok olur. Many will throw stones at red apples. [There are always those who will be jealous of a good thing and try to do it harm.] OAA 184, AVP-I. It is only at the tree loaded with fruit that people throw stones. Oxford p. 837.Many entries list several equivalents going back to classical times, not only from the English-language proverb stock but also from that of other languages. Such entries give both the general reader and the scholar an idea of the interrelationship of proverbs on an international scale. Some proverbs have exact parallels in Turkish and English because of acommon early source; others exhibit quite different metaphors and structures while retaining the same meaning. In any case, comparative paremiographers will find the rich materials listed in this book most useful.The collection is organized into 172 categories with such headings as \\"absence,\\" \\"adversity,\\" \\"advice,\\" \\"age,\\" \\"agriculture,\\" etc. This lexicographical methodology, along with the humorous illustrations at the head of each section, serves primarily those readers who use this book as an entertaining way of getting to know the wisdom of Turkish proverbs.For the serious student, Yurtbasi as included voluminous Turkish (411-540) and English (543-654) indices, with the actual proverb collection occupying pages 1-406. The author himself contributes only a one-page \\"Word to the Reader\\" at the very beginning of the book, and has enlisted Steven E. Hegaard - former Fulbright scholar in Turkey and current consultant on Western relations with the new Central Asian Turkic republics to write a comprehensive introduction (i-xvii). Hegaard discusses problems of definition, surveys earlier Turkish proverb collections, and analyzes the structural and linguistic featuresof Turkish proverbs. Yurtbagi supplies English (xviii-xlx) and Turkish (xx-xxi) lists of the categories and an invaluable bibliography (xii-xxv) of the sources he used. Finally, there is a two-page (xxvi-xxvii) list, \\"Proverbs about Proverbs,\\" that indicates what people fromvarious cultures and countries around the world have had to say about the usefulness, importance, and wisdom of proverbs. Altogether this is a most accessible and user-friendly bilingual proverb collection that will serve as a model for others to follow. People interested in proverbs now have a solid introduction to the rich proverbial wisdom of the Turks. Yurtbasi spent close to ten years compiling this book, and his labors have not been in vain. Since its publication in 1993 this large and valuable compendium has become the standard work on Turkish proverbs. It has also been translated into German (YURTBASI 3), with an introduction by Professor Wilfried Buch. In view of the importance of the role played by the Turkish people in Germany over the past few decades, thisis indeed a welcome development. It will give German readers the opportunity to acquaint themselves with the rich cultural heritage of the Turks, their codes of human behavior, and their worldview. Such knowledge might help bring about a better understanding of this influential minority in modern Germany.According to Yurtbasi, other translations are scheduled to appear, and I can well see this book becoming available in French, Japanese, Russian, Spanish, and other languages.By all signs so far this is a successful scholarly work, and one that deserves a place on the shelves of libraries and of all individuals interested in traditional Turkish language, folklore, and culture.REFERENCES CITEDDAGPINAAR,y din1982 Turkce-ingilizce ingilizce-turkce atasozleri ve deyimler soslugu / A dictionary of Turkish-English English-Turkish proverbs and idioms.

You won't find flowing prose or stylish eloquence here, but you will find concise, to the point, factual accounts of America's most distinguised military man of the 20th century.Patton is not romanticized, nor is he criticized, but he is looked at in a most objective account which accurately and succinctly illustrates the full realm of Patton's many extraordinary qualities, as well as the personal attributes which caused him great personal setbacks.Essame clearly illustrates at least 4 different occasions when, had Eisenhower listened to Patton, the war in Europe would have most certainly been brought to a close in less time and with less loss of allied life.For the devout Patton reader, this volume will contain much 'old hat', but for students of history with little knowledge of our greatest General, Essame gives a brilliant reflection of General George Smith Patton. The book has long been out of print, but was widely published and many good used volumes are available."},{"Title":"Patton: A Study in Command.","review":"For whatever reason I dearly like old British authors (I'm an American). There is something about the way they write (or maybe it is the way I read) that makes their books fly by.I think this is a fine book about Patton in WWII. It isn't a full biography, it is exactly what the authors says it is: A Study in Command. The history is good, even if he blows past the unfortunate slogging match outside of Metz, and he gives a great feel for what made Patton the legend he is today. Very highly recommended for anyone interested in Patton or armored warfare in WWII."},{"Title":"The Balanced Company: A Corporate Integrity Theory","review":"I had to read this book for a class, and found it very useful. The beginning does a good job of outlining various ethical frameworks. Later, various types of problems faced by businesses are described and then placed into broad fundamental categories. Finally, these categories are then analyzed using the various ethical frameworks described earlier in the book.Each chapter has an ethical case study, where the principles of the chapter are highlighted for discussion and analysis. The authors have an obvious pro-business bias (of course), so the importance of business as a social entity is just assumed.Overall, this book does a pretty good."},{"Title":"The Bacchae of Euripides: A New Version","review":"While I haven't read much Greek tragedy, and this is my first Euripides play, the Bacchae is the most aweful I've yet to read. The fury of a god spurned by his family and city had me entranced in awe. I still can't quite understand it. I just had to be still and let its terrible beauty wash over me -- to experience it. I imagine that the audience at its first performance was full of fear and trembling.These feelings of attraction and revulsion seem appropriate for a god like Dionysus, a god who seems to embrace opposites. The surging, green life of the vine which dies and is cut back, only to send forth green shoots of new life. The joys of his revels which can slip into madness. . .The danger and messiness of life. While you don't neccessarily have to embrace this verity, it must be acknowledged or you will slip into madness and death. These are the gifts of the god to those who deny him.\\"Then, at last,he'll know; Dionysus is a god.Dionysus is the son of Zeus.Doinysus is, for humans, fiercest and most sweet.\\"After this declamation the god leaves the stage and the chorus expands upon it in some of the most beautiful and appealing language I've encountered in Greek tragedy:\\"On, will I, some-time, in the all-night dances, danceagain, bare-foot, rapt,again, inBacchus,again?Will Ithrow my baredthroatback, to the coolnight back, theway,oh, in the green joysof the meadow, thewaya fawnfrisks, leaps,throws itselfas it finds itselfsafely pastthe frighteninghunters, past thenets, thehoundsmenurging ontheir straininghounds, freenow, leaping, tastingfree wind now,BEING windnow as it leapsthe plain, thestreamand river, outat last, out fromthe human,free, back,into thegreen,rich, dapple-shadowed tresses of theforest.\\"Freedom, joy in nature, and giving onself over to these things unreservedly are indeed most sweet for humans. I suppose the hunters who threaten these things are what bring out the fierceness of the following lines:\\"What iswisdom?Whatthe fairestgift the godscan offerusbelow?Whatis noblerthanto holda dominatinghandabovethe benthead ofthe enemy?The fair, thenoble, howwecherish, howwe welcomethem.\\"From freedom and frisking to dominating your enemy, and this is wisdom! It is certainly fearsome. How do you contain it? Who knows. Perhaps it is not to be contained. Perhaps trying to contain it is The problem. It sure does not seem to be any way to run a civilization. And round and round we go, and I'm not sure if the play presents us with any answers except . . . maybe . . .Don't deny the gods. Give them their due. Give them their due or you will be ripped to shreds. Whew. Hard stuff indeed.Part of the reason for the extensive chorus quote was to show how this translation deals with the chorus lines. I first read the Nicholas Rudall translation of this play and I just went galumphing along through his chorus sections. The way Williams strings out the words forced me to slow down and really chew on the words, and I finally saw the beauty of the play's chorus in this translation.Besides having a translation that sings to my ears, this book also features an informative and extensive introduction by Martha Nussbaum that I found to be most interesting and enlightening."},{"Title":"The Bacchae of Euripides: A New Version","review":"This version of The Bacchae is not only beautiful, but the printing of the words of the chorus and the style and breaks in the lines of the text catch a perfect mood and speed as well as rhythm. The pages have the text spaced nicely, and it seems to breeze quickly and chaotically because of the rate that the pages need to be turned. In this way a mood is captured that is not always seen in translations of ancient texts. Besides that, it is a compelling tragedy that raises many questions."},{"Title":"The Bacchae of Euripides: A New Version","review":"This is a fabulous version of The Bacchae. The feeling is completely tragic, but insightful into how the Greeks saw and explained life. Appearances are not always what they seem in The Bacchae.

I don't think the Tree of Life was mentioned once. This is more the essence of Kaballah, or, as the title states, the power of Kaballah. While listening, one will learn things like:The universe is always talking to us, trying to teach us lessons. We can ignore and avoid the message, but that makes it more difficult to connect to the light of creation and invites chaos into our life. The next time the universe tries to teach the lesson, it will be less subtle.We are never presented with more than we can handle.Satan is nothing more that our greatest opponent, tempting us away from enlightenment with instant gratification and self doubt. If we are able to realize that we can use adversity as a springboard to growThe physical world is only 1% of the universe. The other 99% is the spiritual world. When we are attracted to something or desire something, it is really the 99% that is drawing us in.When faced with issues, we can react, which invites chaos into our life, or we can be proactive, and act in a way that is in harmony with the light of creation. Being proactive requires one to stop before reacting, and think about their actions. It always requires work on our part to stay proactive, the natural instinct is to be reactive.Our goal in life is to become a better person, and that is relative to where one is starting out. If a thief can stop stealing, he has become a better person.There are astrological forces that we can try to live in harmony with. An example given is that it is unwise to start a business venture or marriage the last 2 weeks of Cancer and the first of Leo. The analogy is that of a farmer not planting seeds in the winter.All in all, I really enjoyed listening. I think I'm living my life a little bit better.

This airy little comedy is filled with fairies, spells, love potions and romantic mixups, with only the bland human lovers making things a little confusing (who's in love with whom again?).As Athens prepares for the wedding of Theseus and Hippolyta, the fusty Egeus is demanding that his daughter Hermia marry the man he's chosen for her, Demetrius. Her only other options are death or nunhood.Since she's in love with a young man named Lysander (no, we never learn why her dad hates Lysander), Hermia refuses, and the two of them plot to escape Athens and marry elsewhere. But Helena, a girl who has been kicked to the curb by Demetrius, tips him off about their plans; he chases Hermia and Lysander into the woods, with Helena following him all the way. Are you confused yet?But on this same night, the fairy king Oberon and his queen Titania are feuding over a little Indian boy. Oberon decides to use a magical \\"love juice\\" from a flower to cause some trouble for Titania by making her fall in love with some random weaver named Nick Bottom (whom his henchman Puck has turned into a donkey-headed man). He also decides to have Puck iron out the four lovers' romantic troubles with the same potion. But of course, hijinks ensue.\\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" is another one of Shakespeare's plays that REALLY needs to be seen before it's read. Not only is it meant to be seen rather than read, but the tangle of romantic problems and hijinks are a little difficult to follow... okay, scratch that. They can be VERY difficult to follow, especially if you need to keep the four lovers straight.But despite those small flaws, Shakespeare is in rare form here -- the story floats along in an enchanted haze of fairy magic, forest groves, and a love square that twists in on itself. And Shakespeare's lush, haunting poetry is absolutely lovely here (\\"With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine/There sleeps Titania sometime of the night/Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight...\\").But he also packs it with plenty of hilarity -- not only is it funny to read about the haughty fairy queen fawning over a guy with a donkey head (Nick Bottom = \\"ass's head\\", get it?), but there's plenty of funny moments in the dialogue (\\"Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet...\\").The four main lovers are relatively bland and interchangeable, and we never find out much about them except that Helena is kind of stalkerish and not too bright (she tips off the guy she likes that the girl HE likes is eloping so he can stop her?). The real draws are the fairy creatures -- Titania and Oberon are proud alien creatures filled with both cruelty and kindness, and Puck is delightfully mischievous and.... puckish.\\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" is a shimmering little concoction of magic, romantic mayhem and fairy squabbling. Absolutely stunning."},{"Title":"A Midsummer Night's Dream (Oxford Shakespeare)","review":"This play by Shakespeare has had a tremendous influence. First it was trasnformed into an opera by Purcell under the title of The Fairy Queen. Second it was widely known in Germany at the time of Goethe, but under the title of The Walpurgis Night. Goethe himself alludes to it in Faust and composes his Walpurgis Night at the end of the Faust as the prolongation of the end of Shakespeare's play. What is interesting in this play is the fact that the world of spirits, the night in the forest are used as elements to create a marvellous and light comedy. No witchcraft in all this. An entertaining though slightly grotesque tale. The Queen and King of the fairies use their powers to make fun of simple men, even providing Bottoms with the head of an ass (an old practice from the Middle Ages when the bishop of the pope were shown as being asses in the Masses of Fools or of Asses, some carnival rites authorised by the Church). But what is most important in this play is the fact that the fairies, with all their antics, make three marriages possible, and that is the end of the play. Three marriages, two times three people, three men and three women, the sacred number of Salomon. This ending is a christian ending. And when we add to these three marriages the couple of the Queen and King of Fairies, we come to the number of four couples, which is the sign of perfect equilibrium in Shakespeare. We find such a umber (four marriages) in As you Like It. Finally the whole play, or nearly it all, takes place in the night, the realm of Selene, the goddess of the night and the moon, who is only one of the three facets of Diana, the goddess of forests, animal life and hunting, whose third facet is Hecate, the goddess of death. This threeforld nature of Diana is constantly present in the play. It is the very symbol of the fairies. We must understand that for Shakespeare three is the number of disruption, chaos and the fairies bring chaos, though, in the end perfect equilibrium is achieved. The last element concerns the style of Shakespeare. He adapts his style to every character, moving from the highest and most perfect poetry with the King and Queen of fairies or with Theseus and Hippolyta, to a very simple language with the six (six again) craftsmen who prepare a play for Theseus and Hippolyta's wedding. In other words it is a light comedy that carries Shakespeare's whole art in its lines. A perfect introduction to this art, and with a lot of fun, thanks to the pranks fo Puck, a light-headed fairy of his own.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"A Midsummer Night's Dream (Oxford Shakespeare)","review":"I loved this book so much.

On one of those trips, he taught my wife how to fly fish in the Smokies and she caught some nice trout on dry flies. So he doesn't just write about fishing - he really fishes. If you are looking for a guide book that will tell you precisely where to fish and gives away all the prime spots; this isn't it. The author tells you where the streams are and how to get to them. He tells the equipment you need and some techniques. If you already know a little bit about trout fishing this is a perfect guide book. It has enough information but it isn't a kiss-and-tell book.

Indeed, he's widely regarded as a leading expert on the Brook Trout of the park, and even helps the scientific teams gather data about the range and recovery of the native Brook trout.Adding a love of fly fishing to that level of knowledge - and wrapping it up in a direct, friendly writing style - and you've got a winner.

I did like the area maps and the symbols above each stream indicating fish species present and access type, i.e. drive in, canoe through, hike in, camp on, etc. Ian Rutter, the author, and his wife, Charity, have some useful info on their website (R & R Flyfishing Store), as well as some informative YouTube videos on the Internet. I would suspect that the publisher, Frank Amato, limited Ian to a set number of pages, so the book could be moderately priced. Without such limits, I believe Ian could easily write a book about fishing in the Smokey Mountains that would appeal to more experienced freestone anglers like myself."},{"Title":"Great Smoky Mountains National Park Angler's Companion","review":"This is a good book on trout fishing the GSMNP.

They are the real deal - guides that spend their time in the water, this week, no matter what time of the year it is. There are lots of books out there about fishing in the GSMNP - but the one I find most helpful is Ian's. Yes, it's not very long, but don't let that fool you. I own other books with more pages but much of those pages are spent in the author's self indulgent memories of 30 years ago and arcane appendices. Some of the authors make me wonder when was the last time they actually fished instead of writing. Not what I am after. Ian breaks down each major system and stream and lets you know the crucial info. if you have any other questions after reading, call them or reach out to them on the web. They respond and let you know what they think about the trip you're planning, regardless if they will be guiding you or not.

One by one, each has had his name or reputation besmirched. A few, John Adams, and George Washington seem to survive the exposure and remain adored by millions. Benjamin Franklin is another founding father who has weathered modern day examination and is still beloved by his countrymen.Benjamin Franklin: In Search of a Better World will not disappoint the reader and it will not take a cheap shot at a man who lived more than 200 years ago. Organized with chapters like The Life of Benjamin Franklin; Benjamin Franklin, Printer; Benjamin Franklin, Civic Improver; Benjamin Franklin, Pragmatic Visionary: Politician, Diplomat, Statesman, etc, the book will shed new light on to a life that was well lived and well enjoyed.Well reseached with lavish illustrations and photographs, Benjamin Franklin will be a terrific addition to your personal library."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin: In Search of a Better World","review":"The Ben Franklin Exhibit is at our Museum at the moment and this is its companion book.

If you are interested in Ben Franklin and don't want to read a long biography, this is a worth while purchase. For those who know more about Ben, it has good biography as well as photos of artifacts associated with his life.The artifacts in the exhibit (presented in the book) have been gathered from many sources and probably will never be collected together again - so it is a historical reference as well."},{"Title":"Japanese names and how to read them;: A manual for art-collectors and students, being a concise and comprehensive guide to the reading and ... as of dates and other formal expressions,","review":"Excellent, authoritative & easier to understand reference guide to this very difficult subject.

Gardner covers Egyptian history from predynastic times to Greco-Roman, mentioning even the most obscure pharaohs and figures. The plates are exquisite even some forty years after the original photos for them were taken. One's only complaint might be that, since the format guidelines were somewhat different in the 60's, there aren't two spaces after each sentence, but this only takes a couple chapters to get used to. For a closing statement, I recommend you obtain this book so that you may read Gardner's own, for its closing statement rings with the charming chivalry that Gardner and many of his contemporaries practiced."},{"Title":"Egypt of the Pharaohs: An introduction","review":"Sir Alan Gardiner's &quot;Egypt of the Pharaohs&quot; was reprinted by the Folio Society in 1999 as &quot;The Egyptians&quot; in a beautifully bound hardcover edition.

I read them as soon as they came out in the early eighties, and then looked for Plante's books everywhere. David's French Canadian enclave in Providence had much in common with the Woonsocket and Pawtucket of my youth. He nails the intensity of the French Catholic Church. Plantes' family, like most French Canadians, had an Indian ancestor. Naturally I was drawn and intriqued that he was also part Blackfeet. What was the Blackfeet, French Canadian, Rhode Island connection? The Northern Plains of Montana and Alberta Canada are worlds and thousands of miles away from the urban milltowns of New England. Yet when I traveled there the women looked like my grandmother Mimi and the men like her brother mon oncle Leo. They knew about the Lamberts and welcomed me into their homes and tipis. Mothers and grandmothers sent us home with gifts of pemmican and sweetgrass and pictures to show my grandmother and matantes of me and my toddler standing in front of the tipi they taught me to raise. Years later I met Tchin, a stately Blackfeet/Narragansett silverworker who said that many Blackfeet, who were legendary travelers like the French Canadians, had gone East in the eighteen thirties during a famine and many marriages had resulted. And then there were the Voyageurs who traveled West from the time they arrived in Canada in the 1500s returning with Indian brides, so that nearly every family had Indian ancestry shown in the chisled faces they bent over factory looms and in the straight black hair they kept braided and wrapped in kerchiefs to keep it from getting caught in the textile machines. Plante's lyrical and haunting FRANCOEUR NOVELS will feel queasily familar to those millions raised with \\"foi, langue, et famille\\" in French Canadian mill towns in New England, and reveal a little known culture to everyone else. I can't wait to read Plante's new AMERICAN GHOSTS."},{"Title":"Spider-Man: Revenge of the Sinister Six","review":"I have been waiting to read this book for a while. I wondered what was going to happen in this book, and I was waiting to see what questions from the first book were going to be answered. I definitely was not disappointed. The book answers some questions while raising others. Adam Troy-Castro is one of the best writers for the Spider-Man novels. He has the ability to mix strong action scenes with wonderful humor. There are several movie and television references in the book. I leave those up to you readers to discover. This book is a whirlwind of emotions. You experience humorous moments (when Mary-Jane kicks the tar out of the Chameleon) to moments of anxiety and despair. Adam Troy-Castro is really able to show the inner strength of Spider-Man and delves into his psyche. He also gives us some insight towards the end of why Jonah might obsess over Spider-Man. This was a fantastic book and I highly recommend it to any Spidey fan."},{"Title":"Spider-Man: Revenge of the Sinister Six","review":"Finally we receive the second installment in the Sinster Six Trilogy. This novel furthers the story begun in THe Gathering of the Sinister Six. As might be expected, there are many fight scenes between Spidey and his enemies. Especially good to read is the day-long series of battles orchestrated by the Six to occupy Spidey and SAFE while a peculiar theft is committed.Castro gives us an excellent read. He manages to capture the spirit of the comic book universe quite well, as good as any of the other Marvel Novel contributors.Especially interesting is the search Peter Parker undertakes to verify the possibility of his having a long-lost older sister. The reader is led to believe that she is in league with the Six (being, in fact, their sixth member) via association with the man who killed Peter's parents and psychologically dominates her. This so-called Gentleman is a nice addition to the rogues' gallery of Spidey foes.I really enjoyed this book, and for any Spider-man fan it should not disappoint. There is my standard complaint that the events in the novels do not affect the course of action in the comic books, but there will always be such discrepancies. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Spider-Man: Revenge of the Sinister Six","review":"It was a very good book. After the first one, I had some questions, but the 2'nd one answered them, for the most part.

The true plan is for four of the Six to keep Spidey busy, while the other two conduct a robbery of a sort.As entertaining as Revenge of the Sinister Six is (and boy do they get their revenge on poor Spidey), the book is hampered by some flaws. One, it is overwritten and reads as rather talky at times. Two, there are numerous errors sprinkled throughout the BP paperback edition, the proofing was quite poor. Three, there are several pop culture injokes that detract from the story, rather than enhance it.Those problems aside, fans of Spider-Man will no doubt enjoy the two hundred page slugfest that is the Sinister Six's Day of Terror."},{"Title":"Spider-Man: Revenge of the Sinister Six","review":"From www.DeCandido.NetSpider-Man: The Gathering of the Sinister Six by Adam-Troy Castro Quite simply, the best Spider-Man novel ever written. Adam wrote &quot;The Stalking of John Doe&quot; in Untold Tales of Spider-Man, which is one of the ten best Spidey stories ever, and he doesn't disappoint with his first novel-length tale, which is the best use of Mysterio I've ever seen (certainly better than Kevin Smith's overrated twaddle in the Daredevil comic). Adam does right what every Spidey comic lately has done wrong. The rest of this trilogy will be published in 2001 by BP Books, and you should definitely keep an eye out for it.

Castro really explains Spidey well from his corny jokes to his stressful day in this book. There can really funny parts in this book, like when MJ is beating up Chamealon or when Spidey is fighting Doc Ock and he is saying that Doc Ock's sayings are getting old... Also, there can be sad parts, like in one of the last chapters in the book, when he finally &quot;rescues&quot; the hostages at the Daily Bugle.So, I recommend this book to every Spidey fan that's out there!

Lusseyran lost his eyesight as a young boy through an accident at school, caused by a bully. But instead of sinking helplessly into darkness he gradually developed his other senses to extraordinary capacity.When seventeen,while interviewing volunteers, willing to join the Resistance, he perceived colors when they answered questions. These colors revealed to him whether they could be trusted or not. Once, however,his friends disagreed with his recommendation. They all were taken prisoner and sent to the Concentration Camp.It was there, that the 18 year old found his second calling: Poetry. Reciting poetry by heart, he assembled the prisoners daily. The imagery had life-sustaining quality for them and a moment of renewal to all that participated.

Keep in mind that this book has been translated from french. The semantics and verbage is somewhat awkward at times, but the message remains clear. This meling pot of personal experiences encompass: blindness as a youth, minds-eye interpretations of a blind individual, internal strength, the occupation of France during WWII, the French Underground, detailed brutality of the Nazi Party, prison camp conditions, and repatriation. Once again, I will stress that the themes are broad and this is a translated text, yet it still succeeds in painting a well orchistrated picture of each theme. Most importantly, the theme of hope and strength solidify the foundation and triumph in the end."},{"Title":"And There Was Light...Autobiography Of Jacques Lusseyran...Blind Hero Of The French Resistance...Second Edition,Revised 2005","review":"Jacques' experience as a blind person living through, and participating in, the French resistance was amazing to follow with him through his autobiography; I find no fault in what he presented. I did, however, feel that something was missing from it. There was a painful depth that I knew had to exist within Jacques somewhere that I did not see. What he did do is tell us how beautific the experience was (generally) of being blind for him; he went to great lenght in the first half of the book to let you know that he did not really suffer from his loss; that it was not really a loss to him but actually a lovely thing. I do not doubt that this was true for Jacques but it seemed a bit too sweet for me. Perhaps this is because of my own experiences with loss in my life I wanted to be with someone that expressed more psychological dimension.Again, no fault to this story; it was well presented and I am glad that I read it; the man was remarkable. It's just something to keep in mind about reading someone's life experience and if you are looking for how someone dealt with the pain of their loss, their struggles with daily life, this book does not go very far toward giving you much of a picture because he did not express much about it at all related to his blindness."},{"Title":"And There Was Light...Autobiography Of Jacques Lusseyran...Blind Hero Of The French Resistance...Second Edition,Revised 2005","review":"I found Jacques Lusseyran in 1969 when he became my teacher and advisor in the graduate program of French at the University of Hawaii. He also became one of my dearest friends. I lost him two short years later when he and his wife were killed on a lonely French country road in a car wreck. The terrible irony of having survived the Nazi occupation of France, as well as his betrayal, capture, torture and the final years in Buchenwald becomes self-evident as one reads this book. But more than the irony, this book portrays Jacques' great capacity for joy and hope and faith.He taught me to have faith and hope, in God and in others, as well as in myself and in those gifts which each of us possess. I have shed many tears because I lost him. I loved him and his wife, both for what they taught me and what they gave me: joy in life and living; faith that even in the worst of human pain and suffering there is still always hope.I have also shed many tears since then of gratitude for those two brief years of my life. And I continue our conversations about all things good and joyful through reading And There Was Light.

Jacques Lusseyran was blinded in an accident at the age of 8, yet was a major force in the French Resistance during World War II, was betrayed and spent time in a Concentration Camp.This is NOT anotherholocaust memoir. Insteadit is an odd, inspiring, beautifully and simply written story, detailinghow one man lived a full spiritual life despite blindness and the presence of great evil. Blindness was not a &quot;handicap&quot; to Lusseyran, instead he reacted to the world in amazing ways. It was a mysticism born out ofcircumstances, not theology. Few books can overwhelm the cynic in me.For a time, this one did.I have sent this book to friends and relatives, who were as surprised and moved as I was. And There Is Light may change you."},{"Title":"And There Was Light...Autobiography Of Jacques Lusseyran...Blind Hero Of The French Resistance...Second Edition,Revised 2005","review":"&quot;in 1935 in a lycee in Paris..our work was divided into two equal parts: the world of today and the world of yesterday, the dreams of the ancients and the dreams of the modern man. I can't believe that was a bad thing. At least we were not in danger of falling into absurdity, so common nowadays, of confusing the era of Sputniks and Polaris rockets with the era of Genesis&quot;.It is hard for me to categorize this book; it is a spiritual book, illuminating one man's relationship with the Spirit; it is a profound meditation on the nature of truth, morality and friendship, and it is a priceless analysis of human nature. Blindness was no impediment to Lusseyran - on the contrary, he learnt to use his senses with an uncanny precision to represent facts by creating visual imagery, to identify the motives that drive people and countries and to establish contact with the transcendental essence of all Being. &quot;People were not at all what they were said to be, and never the same for more than two minutes at a stretch. Some were, of course, but that was a bad sign, a sign that they did not want to understand or be alive, that they were somehow caught in the glue of some indecent passion. ... It is strange that when laws men make are so ticklish in matters concerning the body, they never set limits to nakedness or contact by voice. Evidently they leave out of account the fact that the voice can go further than hands or eyes in licit or illicit touch.&quot;This book is very valuable for its insights on the nature of blindness and sensory-emotional reorganization that accompanies it. &quot;Blindness works like dope, a fact we have to reckon with. ...Like drugs, blindness heightens certain sensations, giving sudden and often disturbing sharpness to the senses of hearing and touch. But, most of all, like a drug, it develops inner as against outer experience, and sometimes to excess&quot; (p.49).I just cannot help myself from quoting from this book, it is so full of unforgettable passages. This is from the time he was caught, as a member of the Resistance, by the Gestapo: (p. 245): &quot;One small piece of advice. IN a spot like this, do not go too far afield for help. Either it is right near you, in your heart, or it is nowhere. It is not a question of character, it is a question of reality. If you try to be strong, you will be weak. If you try to understand, you will go crazy. No, reality is not your charaqcter which, for its part, is only a by-product - I can't define it, a collection of elements. Reality is Here and Now. It is the life you are living in the moment. Don't be afraid to lose your soul there, for God is in it.&quot;As you can see, this book was written by a remarkable man, who could &quot;see&quot; life and truth and humaneness better than many of his fellow men. Now, when our times in some ways resemble the late 30ies and we again seem to be descending into the darkness of ignorance, when the world is run by corrupt, greedy and cynical men who value their comfort above and beyond the dignity of their souls and happiness of their fellow men, Lusseyran's book provides a ray of light and a courage. I salute this amazing man."},{"Title":"And There Was Light...Autobiography Of Jacques Lusseyran...Blind Hero Of The French Resistance...Second Edition,Revised 2005","review":"'AND THERE WAS LIGHT:'A REVIEW OF AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY BY JACQUES LUSSEYRAN,BLIND HERO OF THE FRENCH RESISTANCEby Penny ReederImagine living in France during the 1930s. Imagine yourself as a high school student studying German, tuning across the radio dial and finding a live broadcast of Adolph Hitler, spewing forth an invective of hatred, vilifying enemies of the Reich, exhorting fellow Germans to recapture hegemony and to rid themselves and all of Europe of all their enemies. How chilling it would be to hear these rantings and the crowd's enthusiastic approving responses in real time. How frightening then to witness the surge of Hitler's armies, trampling on the civilization and heritage of one European people after another. How desperate it must have felt to furtively tune one's radio to the forbidden BBC broadcast of the fragmentary French government in exile, to understand that one's activities in opposition could lead to betrayal and capture at any moment. How desolate it must have felt to travel for days and nights, without heat, or water, or hope, in a cattle car packed with human beings destined for starvation, torture, forced labor, and death; and then to lose one's friends, one after another, while barely hanging onto life or hope during the long, tortured years of war.I was taken to those times and those places as I read the words of Jacques Lusseyran, who refused to be indoctrinated or intimidated into silent acquiescence. I felt the chill he felt, experienced his premonitions of suffering, and as a reader of his personal account, was transported by his words which recalled the memories of one of the youngest members of the French Resistance. Lusseyran, at 16, led a movement of young French men and women who wrote, published, and distributed the underground newspapers which let ordinary men and women know what was happening in their occupied country and in the rest of the world; the papers contradicted the lies which were spread by the occupying powers, and these truths paved the way for the return of France's true patriots, the defeat of the Axis, and the triumph of a free France and, ultimately, a free world.Information is power. Even a young boy of 16 knew it, and despite his youth, and a disability which prevented him from reading even a single printed word in the newspapers he and his compatriots published, despite a fear of dire consequences, and a premonition of the same, Jacques Lusseyran accepted the challenge of recruiting others to the resistance movement and of telling the truth about the Nazis in newspapers which at one point in those early years of French occupation were openly distributed by his courageous friends at the doors to cathedrals and on the cars of the Paris Metro.Lusseyran and his friends paid dearly for their courage and their refusal to suffer the occupiers' invasion in silence. Lusseyran was one of the very few who survived, but his suffering was great. Nearly all his idealistic friends were killed, and he emerged, against all odds, from Buchenwald, where he endured most of the war years, with scarred body and spirit. You can read his story, conveyed in his own words, written to honor the memory of all who suffered and died, and to renew our faith in the courage of men and women who refuse to surrender to hatred or tyranny or malevolence, who believed in the light of truth and bravery and the triumph of the divine, in the pages of his biography, \\"And There Was Light,\\" published by Parabola Books, and available on audiocassette from the same publisher.Although many readers may be intrigued by Lusseyran's descriptions of how he became blind at the age of eight, how he and his family adapted to his disability, and the concept of a young man with a severe disability leading a movement of hundreds of able-bodied French citizens in their struggle against tyranny, it was not Lusseyran's descriptions of blindness or how he coped with a lack of sight that intrigued me. Rather, it was his descriptions of his commitment to truth, and to humanity, and to survival of the human spirit that kept me reading this book and continue to inspire me, on virtually a daily basis, weeks after I turned off my cassette player as the third tape came to an end.We live in troubled times. Wouldn't it be easy to just separate ourselves from screaming headlines, fluctuating levels of terror, and hard questions about the rights of minorities, the advisability of going to war, the consequences of \\"more guns and less butter\\"? Why bother to vote in an election whose outcome seems pre-ordained by powers outside our control? With wars and rumors of wars, an uncertain economy, and real worries about which among us might be friend or foe, a person could be tempted into silent acquiescence when confronted by threats of retribution, or worse. Why bother to stand up for what is right in a corporation, or a community, or a nation or a world when what is right is called \\"wrong\\" by some of the people in charge?Let Jacques Lusseyran remind all of us of the importance of standing up for truth, and morality, and the worthiness of human beings and democratic values. At this time of Thanksgiving, we can be thankful for heroes, like Jacques Lusseyran, who summoned the courage to fight against tyranny, and whose stories reaffirm for each of us who know about them, the value of staying involved in life even when the challenges seem insurmountable.I thank the publishers of Lusseyran's memoir for sharing the audio version of his story with \\"The Braille Forum,\\" and, without reservation, I recommend this excellent autobiography to every American, sighted and blind, as we confront our own daily struggles against fear, hopelessness, intolerance, or tyranny.Order \\"And There Was Light: Autobiography of Jacques Lusseyran, Blind Hero of the French Resistance,\\" which is available in print and on (two-track) audiotape..."},{"Title":"And There Was Light...Autobiography Of Jacques Lusseyran...Blind Hero Of The French Resistance...Second Edition,Revised 2005","review":"This is a first and foremost, a book about life, _real_ life. Blunt, profound and absolutely inspiring, Lusseyran has written an exceptionally luminous account of living with and learning from adversity. While the content of this book is itself interesting, (WWII, the French resistance, blindness) the book's real value is the majestic picture of human potential it paints. Lusseyran guides us into the subtle depths of the human being and does so with a writing style that is neither cryptic nor patronizing.

It's unavoidable. It's the DNA of the book. You don't want to feel hopeful? I won't say: \\"Then don't read this book.\\" I will say: \\"Then you won't be able to read this book.\\"For Jacques, early childhood was heaven. He ran. He played. God was \\"just there,\\" as he says --- \\"Behind my parents there was someone, and my father and mother were simply the people responsible for passing along the gift.\\"Then he had an accident in school. The shaft of his glasses stabbed his right eye and tore away the tissue. The left eye had sympathetic damage. The happy-go-lucky Paris schoolboy woke up, his eyes bandaged.He was eight years old.He was totally blind.And he was completely happy.Despair, he realized, was simply a matter of \\"looking the wrong way.\\" In fact, he could see --- \\"radiance [was] emanating from a place I saw nothing about.\\" He could see light, after all. It only faded when he was afraid.The world was still beautiful --- indeed, more beautiful. Waves were \\"arranged in steps.\\" Voices could be caresses. Metaphor was everywhere: \\"Before I was ten years old, I knew with absolute certainty that everything in the world was a sign of something else....\\" So blindness was an obstacle, but it was also like a drug --- it made other senses intoxicatingly intense.High school. Academics. Friends. Girls. Happy days. But we know what was coming: the Nazi occupation. Jacques was a patriot. At 17, he decided to organize his friends into a resistance unit. Wisely, they appointed him head of recruiting --- his hearing made him a great judge of character. Later he and his friends started an underground newspaper; it would become France-Soir, the most important daily newspaper in Paris.His luck ran out. After spending 180 days in a cell in France, he was transferred to Buchenwald. Two thousand other Frenchmen were sent with him. Fifteen months later, when the Nazis were defeated, only thirty of them were still alive.Lusseyran writes that he has \\"not a single evil memory\\" of his 330 days in the camps: \\"I was carried by a hand. I was covered by a wing.\\"Goodness at this level makes commentary superfluous."},{"Title":"And There Was Light...Autobiography Of Jacques Lusseyran...Blind Hero Of The French Resistance...Second Edition,Revised 2005","review":"Possibly the most remarkable book ever written by someone blind.

His life's story shows that we can train ourselves to &#34;see&#34; without the physical sense of sight. There is much more happening in the brain and the mind of the blind person (or at least this particular blind person) than just the other four senses compensating for the loss of sight.Even those of us who do have physical sight see a very limited portion of the spectrum of light waves. This book shows clearly the development of a different kind of sight in one who has the lost that particular physical sense.Very inspiring and thought-provoking. I would recommend it to anyone with an open mind."},{"Title":"And There Was Light...Autobiography Of Jacques Lusseyran...Blind Hero Of The French Resistance...Second Edition,Revised 2005","review":"The author insists that his blindness (a result of a freak accident after which his eyes were removed) was the best thing that ever happened to him. He tells the story of his life before and during the French Resistance, in which he was an important leader. Being blind hardly seemed a disability at all. This isn't a book about the limitations of blindness.

The book was out of print at the time and members of my spiritual group had to resort to copying it for study. I'm grateful that it's back in print and Jacques Lusseyran's life and work are receiving more attention. Regarding the subtitle, I wonder what Jacques would say about being called a hero? Perhaps he would just laugh and shake his head since he conveys so clearly in And There Was Light that he was just an ordinary person who trusted his heart in a world gone mad. I think the best compliment I can pay the book is it makes me long to be better myself.As others have said it's a book about blindness, coming of age, WWII, the Holocaust, the French resistance, etc. What is truly unique about it though cannot be easily described, and is best appreciated in the reading.

I have only one thing to add to the excellent reviews already written here, and that is that this book can also serve as a powerful antidote, specifically for adolescents, to the apathy,narcissism, disconnection, and despair that currently plagues our culture. It is the most unique, surprising, and riveting \\"coming of age\\" memoir I have ever read.I used it as required reading for a senior English class I taught a few years back. The majority of students in this class were bright enough but unmotivated in the extreme. This was the first book I was able to find that engaged and inspired even the most reluctant of these students. Students who had stubbornly refused to read anything else of the literature I tried to tempt them with actually read and expressed real appreciation for this book. It engaged them right away, in the first chapter.No matter what age you are, read this book. If you have an adolescent child or friend, give them this book as a gift. If they don't read it on their own, read it aloud to them and talk with them about it. If you are a high school English or History teacher, first read it and then consider including this book in your syllabus.

Geez! If I have read this book first, I would have stopped there. This book is poorly written. It is an attempt at an old style romp which falls far short. The \\"hero\\" is quite unpleasant and ultimately unlikable. We are to believe that the mere sound of this heroine's voice is enough to make this guy change behaviors and attitudes that he has developed over a lifetime. Throughout the book the silliness builds until you think it can't get any worse. Then it does. The ending is supremely inane.

Seven years later, Hope lives up to her first name as she optimistically searches for her two siblings and somewhat pessimistically her parents.Hope works for a telephone service in Boston, but knows she needs a better paying job to finance the expensive search that is her obsession. When CEO Zach Givens calls for his messages, he acts so cold and aloof, Hope concludes he has to be the business mogul's butler. He continues the masquerade and when they finally meet, the attraction lights up New England. However, neither trusts in love so anything permanent seems out of the question.Though a kidnapping sidebar slows down the tale, this is a charming, often humorous, romantic romp with moral and social questions to serve as a strong base. The lead couple is a fine pair needing each other in every way one can imagine yet unable to put faith in love or their beloved.

Tragedy strikes Hope Prescott at her sweet sixteen when her minister of a dad and mom disappear in Texas - and the fate of her siblings including a foster brother Gabriel are decided by a bunch of folks. The four of them are separated and dispatched to different orphanages; seven years later - Hope works for an answering-service company operated by the kind Mdm. Nainci while getting her computer-science degree.With her impoverished past, Hope believes in compassion and loves her clients but knows pragmatically that money is the only route to bring her to her lost siblings. She meets Boston wealthiest business whiz Zach Given when his company employs her service and mistakes him as his butler Griswald. He continues the charade when the friendship blossoms into passion, but lacks trust in Hope because of a past betrayal.This tale of a mixed identity gaffe is robust with humor and banters with the excellent supporting cast of Griswald the butler, the wise Aunt Cecily and Zach's parents. It is a schmaltzy romantic tale with the two characters in charged symmetry when they cower from love because of their past. Zach and Hope shares chemistry that sparkles emotionally - and Ms. Dodd adds tenderness with Zach as the shining knight to rescue Hope from a mafia-mob boss and launch a search for her siblings. Ms. Dodd's courage to burst into a whole new world pays off handsomely - and we the faithful readers like her just the way she is - regardless of the times."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"After reading this book, I'm surprised that Mrs.Dodd has taken this long and had her doubts on writting contemporary. This book exceptional.It has been a long time since I actually read a book that I could NOT, and I mean NOT put down.Hope has had a very hard life since her parents died. She was separated from her family in the worst, most hurtful, possible way.Seven years after the brutal removal from her family, Hope is in Boston working for a answering service, where she takes messages for the clients of the agency.Enters Zach. A very prestigiuos, rich, powerful and heartless business man, who happens to hate technology (I found this hilarious). He becomes a client of this agency since he cant work an answering machine, voicemail, computers, etc.The minute he hears Hope's voice he feels his body react to her. The minute he calls she assumes he is Zach's butler.So they stablish a relationship through the phone (non romantic). Then they meet and that's where it all gets hot.They are extremely attracted to each other, but Zach keeps the farse. Hope opens up, for the first time in seven years, to Zach and Zach finds himself feeling extremely possevive of Hope.There's plenty more to the story, but I cant give you the whole enchilada. That's part of the beauty and appeal of the book.I loved this book so much, I HAD to finish it ASAP. It is my favorite CD's book and it surapssed all my expectations (and beleive me they were high already).Go buy this book, you wont regret a minute of it!"},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"This is an overly simplistic story that reuses, reduces, and recycles romance novel stereotypes to their lowest common denominator.Hope Prescott, our one-dimensional heroine, has had a rough life. At the age of 16, her family was torn apart and sent from Texas to different locations. Hope ended up in an orphanage in Boston. She grew up to be a good and caring person, even though fate dealt her a losing hand. Scrimping and saving, her one goal was to get her family back together. To that end, our still pure heroine attends college classes, lives in a slummy neighborhood, and works at a wacky phone messaging service, complete with a wacky owner, and a wacky gal pal, so she can get a good job, make money, and find her siblings. She takes care of so many other people, and hardly spares a thought for herself. Her name is Hope, she is filled with Hope, and fills others with Hope. She is practically a saint who practically makes you want to [throw up] with how saccharinely sweet she is.Enter Zack Givens. He is a multi gajillionare who always gets what he wants. But he is so lonely as no one has ever loved him for himself. He has hardened his heart against love and women. When he calls the messaging service and talks to Hope, his world changes. The two begin a whirlwind courtship based on lies and filled with dull ... scenes. He misleads her into thinking he is his own butler so he can test to see whether a woman will like him for him. She thinks that he is a big strong man and she likes that he takes care of her. He is a poor carbon copy of the jaded rake we have seen time and time again..Does all this sound familiar? It should. It's a poorly executed basic plot of the worst kind of romance novels lightly brushed off and given a modern look. It is so beneath the incredible talent of Ms. Dodd, whose Regency stories sparkle with wit and originality. The ending of this book even incorporates the cast of wacky secondary characters in a wacky plan to save our heroine. Unfortunately, Hope is completely unlike the heroines in Ms. Dodd's other books like Samantha in \\"My Favorite Bride\\" and Jane in \\" That Scandalous Evening,\\" who are well-developed and multifaceted characters. Even in the short story platform, such as \\"Once Upon a Pillow,\\" her heroines are ladies whose romances with their heroes are endearing and memorable. I should have left \\"Just the Way You Are\\" just where it was."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"Since this is Ms. Dodd's first contemporary romance, I would like to give her a good recommendation, but unfortunately I cannot.The basic idea behind this story isn't bad but it plays out poorly. The story and the cast of characters lack depth. Some scenes don't make sense.Zack is self-involved and sometimes nasty. Hope lacks charm. Her sarcasm has too much bite to be amusing. Both characters are immature.I wish Ms. Dodd well in her future endeavors into contemporary romance, but this one misses the mark."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"It's quite obvious that Ms. Dodd is making her first foray into contemporary romance. This one reads like a historical--innocent virgin meets stormy, older man who teaches her the ways of love. The dialogue is stilted and archaic; I had to keep reminding myself that the story takes place in the present. Only the continual mention of computers, the Internet and cell phones kept me in the 21st century. The characters are two-dimensional, the situations unbelievable (especially the kidnapping by the local mobster). I'd never read Christina Dodd before and don't think I will again."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"Christina writes enjoyable books. Very easy to read and enjoy.Sometimes the characters are weak or just the opposite, strong.I will continue to read future books."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"I am a great fan of Christina Dodd, mainly because she writes books in the historical regency type genre that I adore, BUT - because she writes with such feeling, freshness, and pure genius I decided to give her first contemporary a try. WOW - I am so glad I did!JUST THE WAY YOU ARE has a sweetheart of a heroine who is caring, honest, earthy and so very \`real'. She is Hope Prescott, orphaned daughter of a Texas minister and his wife who was then cruelly ripped away from her siblings - two sisters and a foster brother. It is part of that mystery of what happened way back then that shaped Hope into the person she is today. Hope works for an answering-service company operated by the kind Madam Nainci as she works feverishly to complete her computer-science degree. Growing up poor, has shaped Hope into the compassionate champion of underdogs and also drives her to earn the money to finance a search for her lost siblings.She meets Boston's wealthy corporate raider business whiz Zach Given when his company employs Madam Nainci's Answering service. Hope mistakes him as his butler Griswald and after she thoroughly commiserates with the man she thinks is a butler over having to work for such an \`old fart' of an employer, Zach doesn't correct her assumption as he is intrigued with the \`voice'. Zach begins to enjoy the telephone friendship, as does Hope, and when he came down with a cold - Hope brought the poor \`old dear' some chicken soup - surprised that the \`poor old dear' turns out to be drop dead gorgeous. Zach posing as Griswald - is also taken back as he discovers that the middle aged matron he assumed Hope to be was a young, intelligent and very attractive female he decided then and there to seduce thinking how surprised she'd be when he told her who he really was.True to her talents, Ms. Dodd's tale of misinterpreted identities is rife with humor and feelings as she introduces a delightful supporting cast of characters from the very real butler, Griswald, to Zach's witty and wonderful Aunt Cecily, eccentric and kind Madam Nainci and all the diverse and zany characters that subscribe to the answering service. The romance is quick and the passion extremely sensual. This is a wonderful romance in spite of being contemporary when it is done by an author whose deft hand at dialog and passion is unsurpassed. Bravo Ms. Dodd - you continue to amaze me with your gifts to engage and entertain your readers! --- Marilyn, for www.romancedesigns.com ---"},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"The problem with Christina Dodd, is that all her heros are the same. With other romance story I read, most I would fall in love with the hero as well as the heroine. But for Christina Dodd, I have a hard time doing so, because she is too focus on physical needs that she left out the real plot of how the main characters fall in love. Yes..I know this is a romance novel, and it involves many sex scenes that we all enjoy, but it's still all about romance, and I would love to see what love really is. Books from Lisa Klapas or Mary Jo Putney, and many other authors, you can see the love built between the characters, love that are so simple and sweet that you can't help wanting to marry the hero yourself. This is what Christina Dodd lack in most of her books. I do like some of her books though, but lately she been to focus on creating dominating male character and female character who would let them do anything they want, because they are too lustful to stop them. She can't create heroine who is strong will in the beginning then become weak because they are not experience enough to stop the hero from taking want they want. Even though lust is a powerful thing, it is not what love, and she can't replace love. All I see is the pain the hero done to the heroine, then later on the get a lecture from either their family members or their friends about how much of an idiot they are, so they went back and apologize to the heroine...and that's it. If Christina Dodd is reading this...please please please...help me fall in love with the hero and don't make lust as the power to subdue the heroine."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"well, since plenty of people have already written the whole story/plot line i won't do that....but i will tell you that this book i not all that great, it sounds promising and cute or just good for a weekend read, but it's not.... the romance/love story is pratically non-exsistent....they meet and w/in a week she's giving up her viginity to him, and he doesn't even seem that great of a guy! i just..didn't like this book....don't waste yourtime on it"},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"This is the type of book that gives romance novels a bad name.

The characters, Zack Givens &amp; Hope Prescott were people I would like to call my friends.This is a case of mistaken identity, and the author asks us to accept some pretty far-fetched stretchs (a preacher's daughter giving herself to a man that she knew by only one name...within a week of meeting him...), but they all work. The secondary characters were wonderfully rich, themselves. You will not be disappointed in this story.As far as I was aware, prior to this novel, Ms. Dodd only wrote historicals. This is a great jump into contemporary!Please, keep them coming!"},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"This is Christina Dodd's first attempt at contemporary romance and I have to say, she scored big. Just The Way You Are is a great story and if it is any indication, Dodd has a great contemporary future ahead of her.This book is about Hope Prescott who lived in Texas until she was 16 and her parents were arrested for embezzeling, a fact which no one in the Texas town wants discuss. Her younger sisters and brother were seperated from her and put into foster homes and Hope drifted for 7 years until she decided to get her life back together. She came to Boston and enrolled in college and got a job as a telephone switchboard operator where she &quot;met&quot; Zach Givens.Zach was enthralled by Hope's voice from the first moment he heard it, and being a rich man who always got what he wanted, he went after Hope, pretending to be his own butler. They got to know each other and fell in love. Unfortunately, events outside of their control pushed them apart.The romance was the best part of this book. Zach and Hope had instant chemistry and it was great fun and very romantic to see their romance evolve. The owner of Hope's switchboard operation provided a wonderful secondary character, as did Zach's Aunt Cecily and Sven.The only part of this story that put me off was the embezzelment storyline and the absurd &quot;kidnapping&quot; attempt at the end of the story. It just kind of ruined the buildup of the romance and all that had come before it.But besides this minor story problem, I have to say this was a great great story. There will be a second one, and hopefully a third. Though I have always admired Dodd's historical romances, it takes great courage to break out of habit and Dodd's breakthrough into contemporary romance is a great one. She has a great future in both historicl and contemporary romance. This book is a keeper."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"Zack Givens is used to barking orders and having people fall at his feet. A corrupt raider, he's used to bullying his weight around, but he's not prepared for the lady at the other end of his answering service, orphan Hope Prescott. She assumes when he calls in for messages that he's the butler and strikes up a conversation, immediately making fun of wealthy people, Zack in particular. Zack is completely enchanted by her candor, and decides to keep up the charade. Part of what keeps her working her odd jobs is her quest to reunite her sisters and brother. Thinking that she's carrying on with a man named \\"Griswold,\\" Hope is enchanted with him. When she finds out that he's sick, she shows up on his doorstep with homemade chicken soup. Zack is shocked that such a nice person exists; she's surprised to find that a butler can be so young and sexy. His infatuation soon turns sexual (and of course she's a virgin), but he foolishly continues the charade, which can only come crashing down on him. Circumstances surrounding Hope's background, business enemies, scheming servants, and Zack's inability to trust conspire to keep them apart. Zack will have to be quick on his feet to get her to forgive his sins.About the only thing that detracted from the story was the whole accounting scheme - it just did not fit, and the standoff was kinda dumb. I was also disappointed that the Prescott family was not reunited. I felt a little cheated that I will have to read two more books (also song titles: \\"Almost Like Bring in Love\\" and \\"Close to You\\") to find out how it all turns out!"},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"What can I say? I'll start with the high points since it is always good to start with a compliment. Dodd retains her sense of humor that you expect from reading her historicals, and that is good. The book moves fast so it can be read in one sitting (If you chose to finish it, that is) I don't however, believe that most people upon hearing that a child's parents had been accused of embezzlement would blame the child for the crime, especially in a modern city like Boston. That is just too unbelievable for words. Combine that with an irrational contempt for Wal-Mart (Hey, dosen't Wal-Mart sell her books?) and community colleges, and you have a reciepe for alienating most of your reading public. I think this book was a good attempt to write a contemporary, but you cannot use the same formula for a modern story as you do for a historical -times and values change and they will not ring true, which sadly is the case here."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"This is my first Christina Dodd book and first review. While shopping, I noticed this colorful cover and title. I picked it up and, did my usual, read the first page. After a few minutes, I found myself on Page 8. I couldn't put the book down. I returned home and finished the book in one evening. JUST THE WAY YOU ARE is a great summer read. You laugh, cheer and shed a few tears. I just hope that Christina Dodd continues writing about Zack, Hope, Gabriel, Pepper and Caitlin. Please make this into a trilogy. I highly recommend this book. It's a feel good book, that leaves you smiling for all the characters."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"Of course we knew Christina Dodd could do Historical, but who knew she'd do Contemporary so well in her first try?For seven years Hope Prescott has been separated from her siblings after the mysterious death of her parents. Hope's dream is to make enough money so she can track down her family. Working as an answering service operator may not seem the way to fast cash, but it keeps her head above water while she works on her degree.Zack Givens, both a self made man and from old money accidentally let's Hope believe that she's his butler. He's been badly burned once before and enjoys the sensation of knowing that he is liked for himself and not his money.He's colder than a snow cone at the Zoo and she's as warm and stimulating as an Irish Cream Coffee and they compliment each other beautifully.This is the beginning of a series about the separated siblings, and I hope that the rest are as good as this one is."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"The only Christina Dodd books I have read, is this one and the next one on the series, Almost like being in love, and if these books are \\"bad\\" compared to normal, then she has a fan for life. I thought they were great, ergo, can only get better, right? The two totally different plots did not bother me, I loved both stories and men and plots and supporting characters. I could not put it down and got very upset with any disruptions. Because of these books, I will read much more of her. I loved it.

It woulndt be cold for long."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"Seven years ago, under suspicious circumstances, Hope Prescott's parents disappeared and were declared dead. Hope was sixteen at the time with three younger siblings. All the siblings were separated and put in foster care homes across the country. Now Hope attends college, and works for an answering service to fund her ongoing search for her brother and sisters.Boston CEO, Zack Givens, who takes over other companies, is known for his cold, calculating and ruthless demeanor. He's also a technophobe. His secretary sets him up with an answering service to take his calls. Hope is the first person he speaks to when checking his messages, and he's immediately drawn to her sultry voice. Hope doesn't believe for a minute that Zack would lower himself to retrieve his own messages, so she believes him to be the butler. He decides to continue the charade, even when she shows up unannounced at his home. Once Zack realizes Hope's beauty goes further than her voice, he's determined to make her his mistress. Noting she dresses in rather worn clothing, he decides to shower her with what his money can buy, while she's warming his bed.After things heat up between them, Hope is mistakenly accused of embezzling and arrested. But Zack's distrusting nature kicks in and he doesn't initially believe in her innocence. Realizing his mistake, he plans to set things straight, but before he can do this, Hope is kidnapped by a crime lord. Will Zack ever be able to convince Hope he now believes in her, especially after his deception?I believe this may be Ms. Dodd's first foray into contemporary romance. She did have a very early book called \\"The Lady in Black\\", which I haven't read, but it may have been a contemporary.I don't have overwhelming feelings about this story one way or the other, which is unusual, because I'm a big fan of this author's work. It started off really well, and I enjoyed the character of Hope and the secondary characters. The love scenes were quite sensual, which I've come to expect in her stories. My two problems were with Zack's character, and the kidnapping by the crime lord with subsequent rescue. Zack's decision to make Hope his mistress was a little bothersome to me, especially since his plan to share his wealth felt like he was making her his personal prostitute. Also, it was difficult to read his treatment of her when he thought she was after his money, even though he had deceived her. The kidnapping and rescue was not really funny to me, but rather silly and awkward. It just didn't flow with the rest of the story.I believe this is the first book of a new series, and even though this wasn't her best work, in Ms. Dodd I trust. I have every confidence the next story will be better, and I will keep reading her books."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"I have loved almost all of of Christina Dodd's books--and the ones I didn't love, I at least liked. I have to confess that I mostly read historical fiction or straight non-fiction, and that I thought that I would work my way into contemporary fiction via an author who was a known entity to me. I don't know if it was the characters (who I couldn't identify with), or the story (which didn't grab me) or the setting, or the time period, or whatever--I wasn't impressed. I wanted to stop after the first half-hour, but I gave it another 100 pages, &amp; finally gave up.

The 1956 Broadway version garnered a Best Actress Tony for Holliday plus a Best Supporting one for Sydney Chaplin (in the role Martin later played in the movie) and a satisfyingly long run. The well-known classics &quot;Just In Time&quot; and &quot;The Party's Over&quot; came from this show.The storyline of &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot;: an beautiful, warm-hearted but naive answering-service operator gets involved in the woes of her clientele, especially a dashing handsome man-about-town. After her unwitting participation in a shady business situation lands her in trouble with the police, her appreciative clients rally 'round and save the day. Sound familiar? &quot;Just The Way You Are&quot; is a novel from that story.I have no problem with remakes, tributes and revivals -- some of the best movies have been from Broadway hits, and occasionally vice versa. The fifties-flavor of this novel becomes much more understandable. It's not really a &quot;contemporary&quot; in the twentyfirst century sense. This is a story, hearkening in some measure back to roots in the Cinderella fable, where the sweet sunny-hearted heroine meets her dream prince masquerading as a humble workingman. The heroine is whisked away into high society and lives happily ever after. Oops, did we overlook &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;'s storyline, as well? Themes from Cinderella (true love sees past humble circumstances) and Beauty And The Beast (true love redeems and transforms a man) are romantic staples forever because they satisfy our desire for virtue-triumphant and love-conquers-all.Nonetheless, I've adored quite a few Christina Dodd historicals, starting with Candle In the Window as well as Castles In The Air, both from the early 1990's. Also, her later governess series (&quot;Rules Of ...&quot;) are all much stronger than this novel.This one is fine as a beach book, a pick-up-and-lay-down amusement, but don't let it color your impression of Dodd's other works. In fact, if you do find this novel amusing, take a look at the video of &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot;, or listen to the original Broadway cast album. Judy Holliday singing, &quot;I'm Going Back&quot;, a lament about her misadventures with men and her plan to give up her answering-service job to return to her old job at the Bonjour Tristesse Brassiere Factory -- is a treasure in itself."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"I've been reading Christian Dodds books for years, I really like her first modern book.

I enjoyed the beginning, getting to know the characters. About halfway through though, I was disconcerted by the lack of contraception. For a rich man who must have been wary of being trapped by a paternity suit he was very unconcerned with the possibility of a pregnancy. Even though she was unexperienced she should have been aware of the need for protection as well. Not once in the whole story did the subject of contraception come up. This bugged me tremendously. It also bugged me that she was just a little too quick to forgive and he didn't grovel enough to make up for her humiliation. Granted he was hurt by the misunderstanding as well but he still could have groveled a bit more. Hopefully the next one in the series will be a little smoother."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"Dodd's book is fun and engaging!

It was wonderful. I stayed up late to finish it. There was some confusion as to how old Zach was with his mother being 59 and his father 81. There's no way Zach's father could have been a father by the time he was Zach's age unless he had other children which were not mentioned.

As a first attempt at contemporary fiction I think Christina Dodd gave an excellent effort. Personally, I don't think it was a horribly written book...but is it the finest? No...the characters are so embittered with their pasts (aren't they usually?) that it seems to affect their every waking move. I also feel that not enough background information was given about the characters - and as someone else pointed out, the kidnapping scene was ridiculous. And I definitely feel that Hope did not make Zack crawl enough after he acted like such a horrible ass to her. Hope isn't a very believable character - I really can't stand the perfect, do-gooder, churchy types.So survey says: If you're looking for a quick read with a familiar plot line that is decent then give it a shot."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"I have read a lot of Christina Dodd books, and I have to say this one is good but not great. I love the Characters and hate the final page..."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"Not a perfect book, but a very good effort and a lot of fun. The storyline concerns two people from very different walks of life: Hope was separated from her siblings at the age of 16, when their parents supposedly embezzled funds from their church (her father was the minister) and then died in a car wreck; Zack was the ultra-rich \\"Mr. Corporate Takeover\\" type who displayed no emotion, ever. How they meet is fun and I won't spoil it.I enjoyed both Hope's and Zack's characters, although the upfront setting of the scene to establish that Zack was like an automaton - no feelings - went on for far too long, as did the charade as to his identity. His growing admiration and caring for Hope, the heroine of the story, made me like him a lot. The sex scenes were very sensual, simply luscious. On the downside: Toward the end, the mobster kidnapping and confrontation were ludicrous. I loved the phone service folks -- a great bunch of characters -- as was Zack's Aunt Cecily.Overall, Just the Way You Are was enjoyable and kept me turning the pages. I certainly want to see Hope's siblings reunited. But the second book - about Pepper - was very strange. Pepper's character left me cold, and the author's ignorance about military affairs was quite unfortunate. Will try the third book in the series and hope it's as good as book #1."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"This book was very good. It is about a family of 3 sisters and a foster brother who get split up by corrupt church member. The story keeps you interested through out the entire book. However, I didn't like the way it ended. The first child, Hope, found her foster brother. But there is only one chapter about them together. Besides that, I would recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"Hope Prescott and her 3 siblings were separated after their parents where killed in an automobile accident while leaving town with the church funds. This is the story that was given to the children and the town, but it becomes clear that there is some sort of cover-up. The children are scattered throughout the US, which is another reason to question the actions of some of the town's people who allowed a family to be separated even under the questionable circumstances of the parents death.Seven years later Hope, a caring and socially conscious adult, is working at an answering service contracted to take message for the cold hearted, untrusting and very wealthy Zack Givens. Zack calls in to get his messages and is mistaken as the butler, Mr. Griswald, by Hope. Zack is so taken by their telephone conversations that he continues to mislead Hope by not telling her that he is really Mr. Givens. Because of Hope's dislike for the wealthy Zack is sure that she wouldn't be so open and caring if she knew that he is the wealthy Mr. Givens. The two meet and Zack continues to pose as his butler, always delaying when he will inform her of his true identity.Their relationship develops into something beyond friendship and Zack is afraid of losing the one person who isn't after his money and out to use him. Throughout all of this Hope's main focus is to finish school, so she can earn enough money to fund the search for her brother and sisters.This is a good read the characters are likeable, throughout the book you are introduced to Hope's sometimes odd friends, Zack's eccentric Aunt and likeable parents. There are several odd characters in this book, which sometimes makes for funny exchanges. I gave this book 3 stars and not 4 because I did feel that the middle seemed to have dragged, which slowed the story, but in all an enjoyable read. This book definitely made me want to know what happens next in the series as the search for the Prescott children continues."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"I really enjoyed this story. I would highly recommend. Hope Prescott has had a very tough life. When she was 16, her family was torn apart when both her parents were killed. Her brother and sisters were split up and placed in different foster homes. Hope survived, but today as an adult she is still struggling. She barely makes any money, and is trying to work her way through college. She finally has a job she enjoys though working for an answering service. Zack Givens is rich and very hard nosed. His secretary leaves on vacation for two weeks and Zack is stuck using an answering service for his messages. Zack meets Hope on the telephone and is immediately attracted to her. There is only one problem Hope believes Zack is actually his butler. This is a beautiful \\"Pretty Woman\\" type romance."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"I have always enjoyed Christina Dodd's books and this one was no exception. She combines all the elements for an entertaining book, lots of laughter and spice.Hope is a sweet, too trusting girl searching for the family, her siblings, she was separated from when she was just 16. She is a very poor struggling student who always seems to find time to help all the customers of the answering service where she works as an operator. Zack, a super rich business tycoon, was originally attracted to Hope after hearing her sexy voice over the phone but later realizes he cares more for her honesty and caring spirit.Ms. Dodd fills the story with a collection of strong secondary characters, like Aunt Cecily, that will keep you laughing.I liked the book a lot and look forward to the it's sequel."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"It was my very first book by Christina Dodd and I loved it!

This book is funny and sad with interesting characters and a mystery surrounding the death of Hope's parents and the theft of thousands. It's a story that holds your interest all the way to the end. I certainly hope that Ms Dodd intends to finish the story about the Prescott siblings because I simply have to know what happens!"},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"What great fun! I've always enjoyed Ms. Dodd's historicals and it's great to see her voice translate so well into contemporary. Zack was so much in need of the joy Hope could bring into his life. I liked the fact that Hope was an innocent when she met Zack. And I love books where the two main characters are a little flawed, but grow during the course of the book. To me, that's the sign of great fiction! JUST THE WAY YOU ARE is definitely my favorite contemporary of the summer. It was both sweet and hot!"},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"I enjoyed this book. It's a very easy read. Throughout, however, it definitely reminded me of a historical. Hope is a virginal maid...oops, girl...and Zach is a lofty lord..oohh, oops, businessman. There were parts of the story that were just completely unbelievable - the kidnapping comes to mind.The romance between Zach and Hope was an enjoyable one, and let's face it, it's a romance novel. It was mostly all the other inconsistencie that made me give it only 3 stars.My biggest disappointment...her entire goal in life is to find her siblings...and exactly HOW many pages of this book were devoted to that?? I was truly disappointed that there wasn't more of the search, explanation and payoff on the sibling front. When &quot;Jake Jones&quot; came on to the scene, I had to flip back through the book to remember who on earth he was supposed to have been. That avenue was clearly left wanting in this reader's opinion.I didn't as much appreciate the cliffhanger, either. I will look for the next book for what I HOPE will be the stronger focus on the family and sibling issues, but I would have preferred to see this story brought to a complete and satisfying close, and I did not get that."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"Hope Prescott is a minister's daughter. At 16, her parents were killed in an auto accident. After their deaths, they were accused of stealing money from the church. The \\"good\\" people of the town that Hope had always considered her friends turned their backs on her. Hope and her two sisters and foster brother were ripped away from each other and sent to different parts of the country to live with no word where the others were. Seven year's later; Hope's biggest goal in life is to find her brother and sisters. Hope has forsaken a personal life to work long hours as a operator at an answering service and go to school so she can get a high paying job when she graduates and find her family.Zach Givens was born wealthy. Early in life he learned a hard lesson about people only befriending him for his money. Although he could live off his family wealth, Zach is dedicated to the family business, Givens Enterprises. He is somewhat of a corporate raider who is ruthless. Zach is also a technophobe. When his secretary goes on an extended vacation, she sets Zach up with the only answering service left in Boston, the same one Hope works at.From her dealings with the wealthy townspeople who turned their backs on her, Hope has preconceived notions about rich people so she assumes Zach Givens is an arrogant jerk. When the caller ID at the answering service reveals that the Givens residence is calling to pick up messages, Hope assumes she is talking to the butler, Griswold, because the great Mr. Givens would never stoop to picking up his own messages. Zach is however on the other end of the phone. Although initially offended by Hopes rude comments about himself, he quickly warms to her sexy voice and charming manner so he lets her keep thinking he's Griswold. Hope really cares about the people who call into the answering service and her goodness comes through. When Hope brings Zach/Griswold chicken soup when he's sick and the two see each other for the first time, Zach knows he has to have Hope for his own.I thought the story was very interesting and well written. Zach was a good romantic hero even though he was a bit to overbearing at times for my taste. Hope was the perfect heroine of the story, she was not overly pretty like so many romantic heroines but because of her personality she was the most beautiful woman Zach had ever known. With the relationship between the two main characters starting out just talking over the phone, they were able to develop a relationship based on the inner person before looks got involved."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"Hope Prescott has a problem...she's a terrible bigot. She decides immediately that Zach is an evil despot because of hearsay and (it seems) because he's _rich_...which we all know means he must be evil because he employs 100s of people and doesn't give all his money away. She never took the time to make up her own mind about him. Not only that; she bad-mouths him to someone she thinks is in his employ (like her). I don't know about you, but in my experience that's not professional behaviour and her intolerance made me dislike her. I don't blame him for not telling her who he is after she jumps in insulting him the first time they talk. As it turned out, he was kind of a jerk sometimes, but that's besides the point. I think it was supposed to be a funny misunderstanding, but it just made me read her as shallow."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"I was a little apprehensive about reading a contemporary book by an author whose historical novels i love. but i must say that Christina has done it again with another wonderful book. I am anxiously awaiting Pepper's story and must say that this book has hit my keeper shelf. Christina has written a contemporary before and having not read it i was a little curious about her contemporary style but it's excellent. I picked the book up on the first day it was released and read it a few days later. It kept calling my name, just the fact that it is a Dodd book is enough to make me want to read it right away. The mistaken identity theme was well written but we have seen that in her books before this one. Definately recommend this book to anyone that is a fan of Christina's writing whether they like contemporary stories or not."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"This was my first Christian Dodd book and it was a mixed bag!I truly fell in love with the story of Hope...how could you not! Hope Prescott is a young woman trying to make a life all the while searching for her siblings after they were all separated after their parents died. She works at an answering service, does odd jobs and takes college classes. She lives in a crappy area of town and keeps the story of her past a secret....Her character was so soft and kind and good hearted and sweet....Then there is arogant Zack...big business owner and so very wealthy everyone falls at his feet....But when Zach calls to get his messages he &quot;hears&quot; Hope's voice and wants to know more so when he is mistaken for the bulter Griswald he doesn't deny it.....This book was a mixed bag for me because here you have Hope...although very sweet and caring is not at all stupid or naive...She has seen the heartless ways of the human race and knows how to take care of herself...So...why was it that when she gets involved with Zach (Griswald) she turns into this little mistress bowing down and going along with everything he tells her to do?? I didnt' have a problem with her being a virgin and inexperienced but Hope's character was not weak! Some of the love making was borderline nasty and not romantic and the ending (the gang) made me laugh out loud....a little stupid to me but very entertaining!!I enjoyed this book I guess mostly for Hope's character and her strong sense of self...."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"I'm a big fan of CD and i really enjoyed this book I didn't really want to read this book because I didn't like her last one but she didn't let me down.

However about half way through it starts seeming like someone else is writing, they style and the way the words had been written changes dramatically.

Maybe there will be a sequel in the future?"},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"This was a fast read! I had never read one of her books before and the title caught my eye. I'm not really into historical romances, but after this book, I'm going to be looking for one! It was highly enjoyable.

Great turn of events and great characters."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"I've always thought Christina Dodd could write a kicking contemporary and this book proves I was right. Her way of telling a story is SO well-suited for a sexy, sassy modern day adeventure. I LOVED it. Zach and Hope have definite sizzle!"},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"I was a big fan of Christina Dodd's in the days of Candle in the Window and A Well-Pleasured Lady. But as far as I was concerned, her last good book was That Scandalous Evening, as all the books since have been cheap ripoffs of hit movies (The King and I, Sabrina, etc.). But with her first contemporary, Dodd has reminded me why I loved her so much a decade ago.Zack Givens has never known anything other than wealth and privilege. At 35, he is used to getting what he wants, and to smiting whoever displeases him with his ubiquitous wrath. No one stands up to the powerful billionaire, and accordingly he is as obnoxious and authoritarian as can be. One day, his new answering service rep mistakes him for his butler, and shares her very unflattering opinions of Mr. Givens with him. Since he cannot fire her (a bet he made challenges him to go without firing anyone for a period of time), and since he finds a strange pleasure in not being catered to (for once) Zack comes to look forward to his daily talks with Hope.Hope Prescott is living on the edge of poverty, determined to rise herself up out of penury and find her three siblings, who were suspiciously scattered to the four winds by the town fathers when they were children. For someone who has found precious little good in this world, she still manages to be caring and empathic, and takes genuine interest in her callers' lives. She enjoys in particular her conversations with Griswald, Mr. Givens' butler. She imagines a stuffy, grey-haired old man, who once in a while needs to be reminded to consider other's feelings. Little does she expect, when she stops by with some chicken soup, that the butler will turn out to be a magazine-cover-worthy hunk who looks at her the way a starving man looks at a buffet.The sensuality in this book is riveting, not gratuitous as in so many other books these days but compelling, with so much emotion weaved in that you couldn't help but fall for Zack, even knowing that he can be an autocratic jerk.As I said before, this book reinstated my belief in Christina Dodd. Hope is optimistic (forgive the play on words), but not sickeningly sweet as she could so easily have become. Zack's insufferable haughtiness rings true as a result of his upbringing and past experiences, and I loved his genuine perplexity at being found annoying by so many people.So why not 5 stars? 1) because of a completely unnecessary kidnap/rescue scene, and 2) there is one pivotal moment in the story where Zack has yet again been an infuriating jackass but, contrary to all the other times, he realizes his mistake almost immediately and admits whole-heartedly that he is in the wrong. This just didn't ring true, not when Dodd had done such a thorough job acquainting us with Zack's point of view and the reasons for it. It was too abrupt an about-face, and felt like the author wanted to hurry up and finish the book instead of taking more time to show a gradual change of Zack's attitude.The unresolved mystery of what happened to Hope's family, as well as her continuing seach for her siblings, is a sure guarantee that there will be future additions to Hope and Zack's story."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"I really enjoy Ms. Dodd's writing and I finished this book in no time. However, the main character, Hope, really \\"rubbed me the wrong way,\\" and was so close to being TSTL (to stupid to live). So many things about her character made no sense to me:a. Although she said over and over and over that she was \\"a minister's daughter,\\" she had no qualms about her unprotected, premarital sex with a man she had only met a few days prior. But, golly gee, she really wondered how was she going to make time for the relationship.b. I never remember her doing a lot to search for her siblings which was what her obsession was supposedly.c. Hope was so annoying when she was spouting her political diabtribes such as: how Americans really know nothing about their own country/geography, much less that of the rest of the world, and how if they tried to learn more about the rest of the world we would be better off, blah, blah, blah. This coming from a character who was trying to make her way to Texas, ended up poor in Ohio, and ends up going back to Boston. Hello, why not buy a bus ticket to Texas instead of Mass.? Her comment about someone dying because they couldn't get cough syrup was really over the top. If you are in such sad shape, I don't think Vicks Formula 44D is going to do you much good.4. And having lived in an orphanage you would think she'd be a little more street wise.Overall, I enjoyed this book, finding Zach's character making up for Hope's annoying tendencies."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"\\"Just the Way You Are\\"by Christina Dodd is truly a masterpiece!!!!

JUST THE WAY YOU ARE was an interesting read, had fun side characters and, until the last two or three chapters, was intriguing enough to keep me reading. BUT, there were some elements that I suspect are the hazards of switching from one romance genre to another. Dodd has essentially written a regency romance in modern America, complete with the fabulously wealthy lord of the manor and owner of all he sees, and the virgin in need of rescuing. For the most part, this works. But the flaws show themselves. What seems protective in a regency lord seems oddly domineering and harassing in a modern businessman. When Zack physically forces Hope to do his bidding (albeit in her own best interest), and stages her seduction along the way, there is something that chafes at my modern sensibilities. What I accept as a historical reality of relationships between men and women in the Regency period is beyond ungentlemanly today. Perhaps because Zack is so ridiculously rich, he can get by with some truly abyssmal behavior -- like leaving Hope frightened and alone in jail after he says horrible things to her, because he decides she was using him for his money. And of course she will forgive him and all will be well. That was hard to swallow. Also the intrigue in this novel is thin, obvious, and at the end, downright ridiculous, culminating in a scene out of a bad gangster movie. Despite that, there was a lot to like in this book, and I believe it was a worthy effort. I suspect the more modern romances that Christina Dodd writes, the better she'll get at it. She is clearly a talented woman, but JUST THE WAY YOU ARE wasn't quite as seamless as some of her Regency works."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"I loved this book... and the desire it gave ME to feel that kind of instant attraction and love again.

It left me wanting more of Zack and Hope!"},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"This is definitly Christina's best novel ever!! I absolutly loved her historicals, and I never expected her first contempory novel to be as good as her historicals. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The book begins from the viewpoint of Zack Givens's secretary, who sees Mr. Givens, CEO of a worldwide corporation, as a coldhearted uncaring man. From the beginning, we see Zack's fascination with Hope Prescott, who he only hears as the voice of his answering service. When Hope mistakes Zach for his butler, he doesn't correct her. Zack revels in the fact that Hope seems to like him and wants to be with him not because of his money but because she sincerely likes him. Hope is intrigued by Zack as well, but she is hesitant to let herself feel anything for hm because she feels she must devote herself to her studies so that she can one day make enough money to look for her siblings, who were separated when their parents died. As the novel progresses, it is clear that Zack is not as cold and unfeeling as he seems, and Hope needs love and someone to care for her much more than she'd like to admit. The story is profoundly touching and is one of the best romances I have ever read, historical or otherwise. I could no put it down and finished it in a single day! I would recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"Fun book and easy read!The characters are likable and well developed.This is the first Christina Dodd book i've read.I'll be reading more of her work for sure."},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"This is my first Christina Dodd romance and I was happy to find that Ms. Dodd's story \\"Just The Way You Are\\" is a sweet tale of first time love for its two main characters. Hope and Zack meet via the answering service where Hope works. She is a friendly, caring and giving young woman despite the horrible and questionable circumstances of her youth. Zach, millionaire businessman, with a heart of ice, happens to speak to Hope, who mistakes him for Zack's butler. Zack is surprised by sweet Hope's honesty and friendship and does not correct her assumption. What follows is the story of how Hope and Zack find love for the first time in their very different lives. Between the lovely dialogue, is Hope's background of becoming an orphan, the loss of her sisters and brother and the disappearance or her parents under suspicious circumstances.

Her sense of pride, and her drive to better herself, are to insure that she find her sisters and brother. This drive makes her a very admirable person. The hero starts out as an arrogant rich man who only wants to have sex with her but soon finds himself falling for her. This is a love story but it also talks about the anguish children feel when they have no answers to how they lost their families. I think Dodd did an excellent job in how the h described her life as a foster child and the sorrow and anger she feels over her losses. I liked this book very much and give it 5 stars"},{"Title":"Just the Way You Are (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 1)","review":"Hope Prescott is a ministers daughter and Zach Givens is a corporate raider to the core. She's friendly, charming, and goes out of her way to help people; he is an egomaniac, uncaring, and rude to the point of being mean. The virign and the bad boy.The book begins with the moment that shapes young Hope and her siblings lives- she and her siblings are being separated and sent to foster homes/orphanages around the county because their parents were killed in a car accident. Her parents were also accused of embezzling church funds and were on the run when they had their accident.Seven years later Hope is employed at a answering service and studying for a degree that she thinks will enable her to find a job that pays enough for her to search for her siblings.\\"\\"Money's the most important thing in the world. You have some, so you don't realize that without money, you're dirt on the streets. Without money, you depend on compassion, and there's not much in this world.\\"\\"It's through the answering service that she first \\"meets\\" Zach who's company had contracted their services- except Hope thinks that Zach is really his butler Griswald. Zach does nothing to correct Hope because his fondest wish is for someone to like him for himself and not his last name or portfolio. And Hope does treat him like a normal person. Some of the comments that she makes about Zach are not very flattering and not something that I would say about a client to his employee.\\"Just the Way You Are\\" is a good story at the core but I got a little lost and discouraged along the way. At the beginning Hope comes across as a very bright, hard working girl who has been down on her luck for too long and is afraid to have good things happen to her. She spends all of her time working and studying but during the story you never seen her actively looking for her sibling; just talking about it. Zach throws himself into his work and only has relationships that fit his needs at the moment. Even his friend thinks he can't go a day without making someone cry.Hope says, \\"\\"An affair involves body parts. A romance is of the mind and heart.\\"\\" I felt like Hope was having a romance and Zach was only after an affair.The romance they develop does showcase the intense chemistry they have together though. There is a realistic feeling on Hope's end of emotions that are new to her but I did feel like Zach was a little too demanding. The steady stream of thoughts about how to bed Hope made me feel like he was too cold and calculating. He is so sure that once he has Hope that she will forgive him for deceiving her and it never really occurs to him that she wouldn't. It took me a long time to warm up to him. Their first time together and Hope's first time ever feels a little fast after the circumstances that bring her to his mansion but at the same time happen in a very Zach-like way; he sees an opportunity and takes it. He does wait until she has recovered and is no longer in shock though. You wonder when the big reveal of Zach's identity is going to happen and whether her will have a chance to tell her himself or someone else will.The hardest part of the book came at the very end. Hope was broadsided by an embezzlement scam that the rest of us could see coming. Her arrest and abduction by the bad guy who was scammed was out of left field. It was nice to see all of Hope's clients rally to save her but it was a little off that Zach would choose to take them to save her instead of going alone or making a phone call to get it done (he makes a lot of phone calls to get things done though out the book).Their reunion was sweet and orchestrated by the wonderful secondary characters of the Givens family. Zach pulled out a wonderful surprise for Hope that showed how far he had come. I adore Zach's fathers advice:\\"\\"Crawl, boy.\\" \\"Women like to see a man crawl.\\"\\"Ultimately \\"Just the Way You Are\\" was a good read and a intriguing beginning to the Prescott family mystery. It makes me want to read the rest of the series to find out what happened to the parents and see all the siblings reunited. It is a good read for readers who enjoy romance with a little mystery and happy endings."},{"Title":"Memories Of The Manger","review":"This is a delightfully told and well illustrated children's story of the birth of Jesus.

And his sister was looking for him.Carmen leaves Rachel with her baby girl, and Vincente stays to keep an eye on the woman he now loves.Only she holds him at arms length because of his certainty that her brother is guilty of robbing him.It took Vincente having a horse's hoof to his head for Rachel to let him know she does love him.From the back of the book: '\\"Doesn't your job ever make you yearn for a child of your own?\\"Rachel Ellis had come to Spain to find her brother and, instead, discovered a tiny niece she hadn't even known existed. Rachel longed for a baby of her own but, since there seemed little chance of her finding Mr. Right, looking after Luisa seemed to be the next best thing.But little Luisa came equipped with a self-appointed guardian-Vincente de Riano. A man who was husband material by anyone's standards, and Rachel found it all too easy to imagine being married to the charming widower. It was a dangerous dream, for Vincente had turned his back on love and Rachel was too much of a romantic to settle for anything less.The baby business had always been fraught with hazards. Rachel was used to growing too attached to her small charges-it was her feelings for Vincente she couldn't control!'"},{"Title":"Academic Life: Hospitality, Ethics, and Spirituality","review":"At last a book that tells it like it is in the world of academe, a world described by John Bennett as characterized by \\"persistent and possessive individualism in which self-promotion and protection become central values.\\" Quite the opposite, in fact of the values suggested by the word \\"collegium,\\" values such as connectedness, reciprocity, mutual purpose,and community. But, says Bennett, there is an alternative scenario what woul result in enhanced teaching and learning and in greater personal satisfaction for students, faculty, and administrators alike.For Bennett the better path is grounded in the practice of hospitality. Ub the broadest sense, hospitality connotes welcoming, civility, sensitivity, and communication. Deemed an esssentail virtue, hospitality demands the cultivation of reciprocal relationships between groups and between individuals. We learn in this fine book how institutions and their constituents can become more hopsitable through, for example, altruism, philosophic inquiry into the self and into our professional calling, and establishing a balance among \\"...rights, responsibilities, and prvileges.\\" Conversation, we learn, promotes listening and sharing and leadss to connectedness, empathy, and participation. Conversation and debate with students and colleagues foster mutual inquiry and break down the barrierss that exclude, thereby reducing \\"persistent individualism\\" and building community founded upon a covenant of mutual purpose and responsibility.Bennett, it must be stressed, is neither an idealist nor a dreamer. He acknowledges the campus realities that make change so difficult - finances, reward structures, institutional size and complexity, protectionism. Nevertheless, under strong leadership, change can occur and a better path adopted, leading to the esstablishment if a true collegium This is a beautifully written, thoughtful, and important book. It should be read by all who care about the future of higher education in the United States.Janice S. GreenIndependent consultant to higher education"},{"Title":"Academic Life: Hospitality, Ethics, and Spirituality","review":"This book has rekindled my faith in the humanizing potential of academic life. Bennett seeks to move beyond the \\"insistent individualism\\" that so permeates faculty and administrative life in colleges and universities, with its competitive, performance oriented, and self-protective focus. He offers instead a vision of hospitality. Grounded in covenantal relationships of mutuality, respect, open conversation, and genuine support, hospitality is a virtue that can foster communities of trust rather than fear. At first, this kind of vision might seem \\"soft\\" and ineffective, but the research Bennett marshals suggests otherwise--teaching can be enriched, scholarship empowered, curriculums enhanced, leadership energized.The use of the word \\"spirituality\\" in the title, however, might be misleading to some readers. While religiously affiliated colleges and universities will find much in Bennett's argument that resonates with their own mission statements, the basic argument of the book does not rest on \\"faith claims\\" of one sort or another. The discussion of spirituality mainly stresses personal life-philosophy, a way of seeing one's self in meaningful relation to others and the cosmos. This is a strength that makes the book relevant to all readers, \\"religious\\" or not.Perhaps more might have been said about problems of gender and racial equity, freedom of expression, and power structures in academia. For, as the author knows, hospitality is not merely an easy cover to \\"leave things as they are.\\" It can and should be a vehicle for critique and resistance, for transforming distorted systems of communication (pp. 101, 110-12). And yet there are real socio-economic pressures that run counter to this ideal.Overall, I highly recommend the book. The writing is clear and the argument balanced. It will provoke many fruitful discussion in the academy."},{"Title":"Academic Life: Hospitality, Ethics, and Spirituality","review":"Academic Life: Hospitality, Ethics, and Spirituality is a page-turner, a description I most often reserve for fast-moving books of fiction. However, even before I turned the first page, I knew this was a book I was not going to be able to put down. Bennett's conceptual framework of academic life is as captivating as it is sound.While reading Academic Life, I remembered how excited I was during my early career as a professor, actually believing that I - along with other scholars - could help solve some of the pressing needs of humankind. My enthusiasm was short lived. I quickly discovered the obstacles that Bennett describes, particularly the \\"significant proclivities toward individualism.\\" And I soon saw how \\"healthy academic ethics and spiritualities struggle for breath.\\" As Bennett writes, \\"Insistent individualism promotes the isolated self - it advances disconnection among faculty and staff as well as between faculty, staff, students, and institutions. It works against internal integration and separates personal from professional lives. It encourages exclusiveness rather than relationality, self-protection rather than openness to the other. It celebrates instrumental rather than relational knowledge. Insistent individualism encourages disciplinary and specialty boundaries, isolated departments, and fragmented institutions.\\"Bennett is a gifted writer and a profound thinker who engages and challenges all of us who care about higher education. He makes a strong case for relational individualism where leaders \\"model the importance of conversation by practicing hospitality and honoring covenant.\\" Bennett explains: \\"Being a hospitable leader means recognizing that colleagues and students have different contributions to make to each other and to the classes and groups of which they are members. Practicing this kind of leadership means modeling and enabling contributions that are thoughtful and sensitive to the humanity of the other - that are respectful of individual dignity, even though that respect may not be initially returned.\\"\\"Only when education leaders and all who participate in higher education allow themselves to be truly formed as well as informed by conversation and hospitable teaching, scholarship, and service, can the academy remain true to itself. Only when we see ourselves as members of a covenantal collegium can higher education stand against the elements of anti-intellectualism that threaten our work as educators - reducing education to the transmission of information and credentialing. When pursued with genuine openness, learning makes a difference in who we are,\\" Bennett advises.If I were to recommend only one book on higher education this year, it would be Bennett's thoughtful and profound book, which examines hospitality, ethics, and spirituality as a part of academic life. It is indeed a page-turner."},{"Title":"Voices of Babylon","review":"Notwithstanding that the author, Ken Jasper, is my brother-in-law, this is a great book. I thought I'd give it a cursory read to be polite. But, after the first chapter I was hooked and put aside my other reading until I was finished. It's a fast-moving tale about an intrepid hero, Cameron Gilly, who stumbles onto a cabal of former college classmates who use new forms of psycedelic drugs to get rich and act out their racial fantasies.The group attempts to dissuade Cameron from learning more and thwarting their plans by attacking him and his teenage daughter. Like all good heros, this only increases his zeal to drive forward. Each chapter becomes more intense than the last as the novel builds toward an exciting and surprising conclusion.Voices of Babylon is accurately subtitled \\"A techno-Thriller of Wayward Genius and Consummate Evil\\".

I recently found the book along with several others from my youth-all unread-in my mother's basement and, figuring I should really not let my mom's long-forgotten purchases on my behalf go to waste, brought them home for some light bedside reading. Leo was around the fourth or fifth in the stack, and turned out to be the best of the bunch. Greene tells a great story about a girl, Tibb, on the brink of fourteen, who is wise beyond her years and has an aversion to \\"phonies\\" that would make Holden Caulfield proud. She doesn't understand the sudden obsession with boys that has consumed her sister and best friend, nor how her role model, Carla, could fail to live up to the lofty expectations she'd set for her. Tibb is smart, funny, self-deprecating, insightful and refreshing. She also spends considerable energy contemplating everybody's words and behavior in relation to their star sign, and can thus explain, for example, why her sister who is a Gemini has a split personality. The book spans the length of one summer and Tibb does a little growing up along the way, adopting an outlook on life that is both more realistic and optimistic. Leo the Lioness had me laughing out loud in several places, and nodding as I turned the pages the rest of the time. A smart, amusing story that is as relevant today as when it was published 35 years ago. I'm glad I read it after all these years. Better late than never, I guess."},{"Title":"Leo the lioness","review":"In Leo the Linoness, you can really relate to the book. The book is about a girl named Tibb, who loves the Zodiac. She is a Leo, and she decides that that is the strongest sign in the zodiac. She has a sister named Nina, and the best mom ever. But in summer, her ex-best friend turns into a boy [lover]. And her sisters attitude is ridiculous. On top of that, her old baby-sitter is getting married. It is a humerous story of a thirteenth summer. It is a must read. It is geat for kids 9-15, I personaly think. It is a very good book, and I think that you would enjoy it."},{"Title":"Ring of Intrigue (Dance of the Rings, Book 2)","review":"A month after the destruction at Boreton Turnout, the Rhomandi brothers Deymorin, Mikhyel, and Nikaenour along with Deymorin's companion, Kiyrstin, return to Rhomatum only to be immediately arrested on entering the city. It is feared that they might be impostors wanting to make mischief now that the Ley-web has become damaged, or that the real brothers have returned with the machine that can harness lightning and so cause even more damage. A night passes, and Nikaenour, upon his release, demands that his wife, Lidye, have the others set free, too. Mostly, the arrests have been a nuisance, but Mikhyel has fallen victim to the prisoner Ganfrion, who forces him to perform sexual acts and which Ganfrion uses to blackmail Mikhyel into promising future favours.The brothers discover that Anheliaa, the ringmaster, is slowly dying. And the city council are demanding an explanation regarding the state of the Ley-web, and what is intended to be done about it. Mikhyel and Kiyrstin set the council's immediate fears to rest. But it falls to Mikhyel and Deymorin to attend to the outer nodes' confidence in the Rhomandi, and rally the troops in case of attack from their old adversary the Mauritumin, and their Northern Crescent allies.Like its predecessor, Ring of lightning, this book concerns itself ( even more so now that the number of direct associations have increased), with how the principal characters see themselves in relation to one another and the outside world; human, and non-human; politically, familially, and magically. This makes for an interesting mix of romance, and vested interests, which I found to be gritty, subtle in its development of plot line, and at times, appropriately humorous. So anyone who likes their fantasy more involving than usual, should find this book, along with its stablemates, good reading."},{"Title":"Ring of Intrigue (Dance of the Rings, Book 2)","review":"When I read and reviewed Ring of Lightning (the first book in the Dance of the Rings) I wrote that it was flawed, but had a great deal of promise. I liked the interactions with the brothers and thought that there was a good set-up to an intriguing new fantasy world. I had a lot of hope that Fancher would outgrow the flaws in the first book and turn in a spectacular second series entry.Unfortunately, Ring of Intrigue does not even live up to the flawed standard of Ring of Lightning. The interaction between the brothers, which was a lot of what was good about Ring of Lightning, turned into melodramatic mush in Ring of Intrigue. If a character said, \\"Dammit, Khyel!\\" (or its equivalent) one more time I was going to hurl the book out the window. Although the plot was interesting and again promising, it was so long and drawn-out that I forgot quite a few bits by the time that I got towards the end of the book. There is also something about the pacing that was not quite right. There are huge parts of the prose spent on small moments while major plot elements can be missed if you blink.Unfortunately, I would not recommend this book. I would particularly not recommend it if you were as lukewarm about Ring of Lightning as I was. If you found the first book perfect, then this may well be more your cup of tea than it was mine. If I find the third used, I may well give it a try. My hopes won't be very high, however."},{"Title":"Ring of Intrigue (Dance of the Rings, Book 2)","review":"Again, solidly-plotted with plenty of action and adventure and introducing more memorable characters who mesh well with the lead characters from the first book. Particularly, we see more of the nonhuman population of this planet. Plus, Fancher's world-building skills are as good as her character developing skills are! (One of my favorite aspects of sf/f!)--Margaret Adamson Fincannon"},{"Title":"Ring of Intrigue (Dance of the Rings, Book 2)","review":"The title does not belie the content; this book is full of nasty plots, less-than-polite deals, and heart-wrenching compromises by more than one character. It's very refreshing to see a fantasy novel not only get outside the standard (and tired) formula, but bring the reader characters who are very memorable (and human). The not-so-human characters have interesting powers, but they aren't all-powerful and they even have &quot;power failures&quot; at inopportune (for the humans) moments. This is _not_ the usual medieval fantasy setting, and it definitely doesn't have the usual medieval fantasy feel to it. That may make certain fantasy readers cringe; if so, I suggest they go find something else. Flexibility of mind is required here, and if one is willing, the journey can be extraordinary!"},{"Title":"Ring of Intrigue (Dance of the Rings, Book 2)","review":"The story of the newly telepathic-linked brothers continue in the midst of disasters in form of a city's infrastructure breakdown and political coups. The reconciled brothers struggle to find balance between the sharing of thoughts and emotions and walled privacies. As in Ring of Lightning, this book is in a heavy perspective 3rd person type of narration, opinions of the characters and the readers can change in a heartbeat depending upon the ruling emotion of the moment. In one sense this can be an exhausting book to read since the characters' emotion and thought process are very much in the present. Has this type of narration been in a hand of a less competent writer I think I would have lost patience and been disgusted with the story i.e. Mikhyel's casual admittance that he would had entered into an incesteous relationship if that is what it would take to keep Deymorin in his life. I think Fancher has a serious affinity for really messed up people. But what is admirable about Mikhyel is he never wants pity from others and continues to serve the needs of the city and his brothers before his own. Fancher knows how to weave a tight spell upon a reader new to this type of writing style and while it is fascinating and addictive, I'm glad most books are not like this for it would be exhausting."},{"Title":"Ring of Intrigue (Dance of the Rings, Book 2)","review":"The first book made me long for this one and I was not to be dissapointed. the characters are so lifelike that I felt like an eavesdropper on their story. Exspecially the sibling-fights made the whole thing so real. What makes this book great is that the maincharacters are not of searching for unreachable goals like how to be a saint, the glorious knight... they are actually driven by human ambitions...hate, greet, power and not to forget love. It is fascinating to watch the plotline develope and to see that everytime you think you can predict the outcome there is some unexpected twist that leaves you stunned. The only thin I have to complain about is that this great plotline leaves you sometimes, and it is partly hart to follow. Nevertheless I must say....its at least as good as the previous one.. and I'm really looking forward to the next one."},{"Title":"Ring of Intrigue (Dance of the Rings, Book 2)","review":"This book could have been a lot better. Its predecessor was an OK fantasy book, and I expected at least as much from this one. Unfortunately Ring of Intrigue doesn't live up even to its mediocre promise and ends up being rather annoying and dull.Mikheyel is the central point of the book and its best part. His emotional tangles are the most interesting portion of the tale and we are drawn into the book, if only at brief times. Plotlines from the first book are left hanging. Instead the book gives us pages of Khoratum dancers who want to dance again (please!), rulers making idiotically simple plots, etc. Its all played out and dull.If the rest of the series is going to be this lackluster, I wouldn't advise anyone to pick it up. Let's hope that the final volume does better with these themes and improves on both the mediocre first and the disappointing second."},{"Title":"Unusual Old World and American Recipes","review":"love book.been looking for it a long time amazon is the best place to look for books you can not find thank you"},{"Title":"Paul Scofield","review":"A very old, vintage book with lots of stellar photos of Paul Scofield during the prime of his career on stage.

The foreward in this book was great though! The again I do not read too much supernatural books that are under the non-fiction section, so that could be why. I found the foreward in this book to be a great way to open up the arena to this book and give me some information about what I am about to read.To learn that Sean Manchester is a authentic vampire hunter was a little surprising. Also, I was not sure whether to believe it or not. We are surrounded by a society that tries to play tricks on us with movies like the Blair Witch project and Paranormal Activity, but when I began reading this book I wanted to leave my mind open, especially since this book was written in the 1980's.Now, the introduction of this book really draws you in, I think that because it is written by an English man that it takes a little getting used to, especially when it comes to the lingo. Basically the introduction is him explaining himself and what he does and why he does it.Soon we come to the first chapter, which is great because he explains what he believes a vampire to be. I don't want to give too much away but he makes lots of differences between people who think they are vampires, vampiroids, and actual vampires that rise from the grave. I think what is most interesting though is to find that he is a descendant of Lord Byron and once lived on his property. However, one of the things I hated about this chapter is that he kept relating back to what happened in Highgate Cemetery but the reader is yet to know what happened. Just a tad irritating. There is a lot of great information on the history of such people like Countess Bathory and Ceausescu, which get me hyped up to find out more information on some of them.In the following chapter is where it gets really good. He goes into detail about a woman named Elizabeth who is plagued by a vampire, or so he thinks. By definition it is a vampire, but like I said before the definition of a vampire in this book is a little different. On page 58 it states from the Dissertato De Vampyris Serviensibus, 1733:\\"They come out of graves in the night-time, rush upon people sleeping in their beds, suck out all their blood and destroy them. They attack, men, women and children, sparing neither age nor sex. The people attacked by them complain of suffocation and a great interception of spirit; after which, they soon expire.\\"The chapters to follow give more information to fake vampire slayers and how they can really mess up the business. Then there is another vampire that comes around and you won't believe who it ends up being. Though it was kind of obvious. This part of the book is the reason I kind of wonder if it is true or not. Or maybe just how true it all is. Of course I am a child of my environment and the world around us trains us to be weary of such stories. But it is also the fact that if there is good in this world there must be evil too. I will leave this decision up to you though.BTW if you go on amazon.co.uk the book is cheaper.Liz ^_^[...]"},{"Title":"Highgate Vampire","review":"It is fairly obvious that this book was written by a nut!!!

The lithographs reprinted on the pages of &quot;Moonlight in Duneland&quot; are wonderfully rendered in the style of such illustrators as Maxfield Parrish and the Prairie Deco artists of the day. Each poster illustrates one of the many activities in different seasons. One could see Notre Dame football in the fall; relax on the Lake Michigan beaches in the summer; or snow ski on the Dunes in winter.

Yes, it was a simpler time; and No, the artists were not on the forefront and fringes of experimentation. But the posters do not pretend to be anything other than what they are--railway advertising--and they are superb examples of that, comparing favorably with the contemporaneous works of the Big Four in Britain, who were themselves experiencing a Golden Age at the time.

The majority of the book is general and relates more to picking a major than information on a major.

The last two chapters (22 and 23) are missing. Also, and more importantly, the Genealogical Record (pages 578-1007)which, according to the index follows Chapter 23, is missing. My primary purpose in ordering this book was to get the genealogical information that the title page promises. Mr. Stearns first book, The History of Rindge, NH, contains a genealogical record, and I assumed that since the title of this book included \\"Genealogical Record\\" that the same type of information would be available in this book.

This book puts between two covers a wonderful series titled &quot;Heartbreak Soup,&quot; set in the mythical Central American village of Palomar, stuffed full of unforgettable characters, tough-minded stories, startling narrative technique, crackerjack cartooning, and far-reaching, sometimes alarming, social commentary. Smart, funny, the kind of thing that will turn you on your ear if you give it enough time to sink in. Comprised of short stories, vignettes, longer tales, even one novel-length tale, PALOMAR is a gift, a hefty, breathtaking chunk of American comic art. Lovely, and a long overdue collection."},{"Title":"Palomar: The Heartbreak Soup Stories (Love and Rockets)","review":"I came to the Love and Rockets bandwagon late. I first read both Gilbert and Jaime Hernandez a few years ago when I picked up this collection and the \\"Heartbreak Soup\\" collection by Gilbert and tore through each in turn.This is a review for both, which is perhaps a bit unfair. But I feel that both brothers possess a deep, amazing skill for expressing deeply life in all of its pain and joy. The incredible thing is that, so often, the situations the characters find themselves in seem completely absurd, fantastical, surreal...yet the \\"realness\\" and vitality of both brothers' work cannot be overstated. I've been reduced to tears by the struggles and successes of Maggie and Hopey, of Heraclio and Carmen; but to mention only these characters doesn't do justice to the power of experiencing the different choices and consequences of each and every character in both series alongside them.Please pick these up and read them--it is so worthwhile."},{"Title":"Palomar: The Heartbreak Soup Stories (Love and Rockets)","review":"There is a reason that this is in Time's top ten graphic novels of all time. I discovered Gilbert Hernandez while reading \\"Best American Comics 2007\\". I loved his piece, \\"Fritz After Dark\\" and found his style to be quite interesting. So then while doing research on what else he had written I came across his Palomar stories. Brilliantly written with complex characters and varied themes - it is hard book to put down. This is hard to get a hold off these days since it is no longer printed by fatagraphics but I was lucky enough to be able to buy a brand new copy last week. Would highly recommend this to people new to graphic novels, such as myself, as well as people interested in mature themes and subjects."},{"Title":"Palomar: The Heartbreak Soup Stories (Love and Rockets)","review":"This story was indeed heart breaking, and loving, and it felt real. I felt a connection with these characters and I wish that I'd held on to this book so that I could read it again. A great buy, and I would suggest it to anyone who's looking for a graphic novel without a superhero, just a good story.-It's based in Mexico, and incorporates spanish, but gives the reader a small index defining spanish words thrown in so you don't have to look them up on your own or feel lost. It's very reader friendly and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Palomar: The Heartbreak Soup Stories (Love and Rockets)","review":"I didn't read these tales in order, and it didn't really matter. I came to know Palomar as anyone comes to know any community: through rumour and gossip, little stories told in whispers that slowly piece themselves together. Gilberts' ruggedly elegant linework doesn't get him the same kind of attention that Jaimes' masterly draughtmanship attracts, but to my mind the better writer of the two is Beto, hands down. 'Human Diastrophism', included in this volume, about a serial killer who wreaks havoc on the hearts and minds of the residents of Palomar, is by far the best story published under the 'Love and Rockets' banner, a 120+ page yarn that represents one of the high points in comic art. And thats just one of the many, MANY brilliant moments in this massive 512 page volume. Personally, I wish Palomar had of included 'Poison River', the collection chronicling the the early life of Luba, the central character in the Palomar oeuvre, and one of the most complex and ambiguous women in modern fiction... but thats a minor quibble.

Well, it's some matter of taste. You can like it! Maybe you can hate too... Maybe, like in my case, you can just say: &quot;it's an ok book, couldn't be better? Sure the art isn't that attractive...&quot;. Or, perhaps, &quot;is this supposed to be a great achievement in the medium?!!&quot;.*I really don't think these stories are great or exact the comic books I would give to a non-comic book fun (actually, if the guy is a non-comic book fun, it doesn't matter the book you give to him, he will continue to not like comic books! Isn't he a non-comic book fun? :) I hope you get my point).*Indeed, I think that the comics are a powerful medium, where you can (and maybe must) use elements that are not easy to made in the cinema without expending millions and millions with especial effects, and are quite impossible to be achieved with the same impact in written books.*I mean, just for an example, in comics, you can afford to have, like in Cerebus, a main character that is not an human, he lives normally with other people, and even manages to be a leader. People would say, &quot;but why couldn't Cerebus be just a normal guy like all the others?&quot;. Maybe this is explained by Scott Mccloud in &quot;Understanding Comics&quot;. The fact of having a caricature inside of a representation of a &quot;real world&quot; makes people get identified with the caricature, and produces a rich tool to express ideas.*A Cerebus movie would be very expensive to do, and since its public wouldn't be children (like a Scooby-doo, or a disney movie) maybe it wouldn't pay itself. On the other hand, a written book about Cerebus would never get the same effect than the comic version.*I think that as a comic fan I have the right to make this critique to guys that make a comic book and don't use the resources of the medium! I think this makes Palomar a bit poor!*Outside of this point, I really don't think this is an enjoyable experience. Palomar makes me remember of that tradition of some (mexican?) melodramatic stories... People here is always enduring a lot of difficulties, people suffer a lot, people is always ugly, they seem to be cursed by god, etc... Man, why can't these guys make something happy just to change a bit?*That's it folks. What I recomend to you is that you visit a comic shop near you (or a book store), take a glance at this book, read some parts and see if it is in your taste... For me, as I said, it quite was, there was a lot of good reviews, then I decided to buy... but I really don't know if it was a good idea...

Gilbert Hernandez, who created the Love &amp; Rockets universe with brother Jaime, has focused much of his attention on this small Latin American town and its people, and over the years it has grown into a living, breathing town. Now, the many tales of Palomar have been collected by Fantagraphics in a new hardback edition that brings its simple joys and tragedies together.The stories aren't always linear, and characters gain solidity as Gilbert leaps back and forth in the timeline, introducing some as children, some as adults, and filling in various romances, breakups and acts of violence along the way. Key friendships hold firm from start to finish, and it's fascinating to watch them evolve as some characters go their separate ways and others grow closer than ever.Gilbert's black-and-white art is crisp, clean and realistic. His people are believable; some are beautiful, some ugly, others average -- like those you'd find in any town. Their personalities are also highly defined, and it's fun to see them change as the years roll along."},{"Title":"Palomar: The Heartbreak Soup Stories (Love and Rockets)","review":"I didn't read these tales in order, and it didn't really matter.

When a new issue of L&R; comes out, I always read the Jaime Hernandez half first. I admit it, his art is much more atttractive to me than Gilbert's, and I identify with his characters a lot more, too. But then I settle down and dig into the Beto half. Whereas Jaime's Hoppers sagas could be described as Latino-punk soap operas, it is Beto that is creating new folklore. As much as I love Jaime's clean lines and cute-as-hell females, it is obvious whose craft shows the most depth, the most texture, and the most care, not only between Los Bros Hernandez, but between them and nearly every other comics creator ever. Earthy, sublime, funny, absurd, horrific, romantic, pornographic (in a good way), and honest are only a handful of inadequate adjectives to describe aspects Gilbert's work. This volume represents a large portion of his life, both in terms of time spent creating the contents, and what I'm sure is inside him. To read this is to see a competely new world, one that is the pure encapsulation of one part of the real world.Now, when is the Complete Maggie & Hopey coming out?"},{"Title":"Palomar: The Heartbreak Soup Stories (Love and Rockets)","review":"I've loved the Palomar stories ever since a friend handed me &quot;Heartbreak Soup&quot; (an earlier compilation of a few of the stories).

I totally agree with the reviewer who said that now Jaime Hernandez should follow suit, and release &quot;Locas: The Maggie and Hopey Stories&quot; (or whatever title he likes, as long as it's the complete Maggie and Hopey)."},{"Title":"Palomar: The Heartbreak Soup Stories (Love and Rockets)","review":"I have been reading Love and Rockets for nearly 20 years and have always been rather partial to Beto's Palomar stories - although I do enjoy Jaime's stories as well. I have always hoped that all the Palomar stories would eventually be compiled into one volume, and here at last they are - and in this beautiful hardcover edition no less. Even though these are comics, the quality of the writing (including the artwork)is as strong as some of the best latino Literature (Beto's work is often compared to Gabriel Garcia Marquez). As such, I always felt that without the benefit of having the entire series contained in one volume much was lost in general continuity - and as a result the weight and depth of the work not entirely accessible or apparent. Now, the full depth and outstanding quality of Beto's masterwork is all contained in a single volume for anyone who might appreciates a quality piece of literature in a completely different way (with pictures)."},{"Title":"Palomar: The Heartbreak Soup Stories (Love and Rockets)","review":"I started reading Love & Rockets when I was in college in the mid 80s. It blew me away in terms of writing, style, layout. Gilbert is not the best technically, but he more than makes up for it in his storytelling and pacing. I continued reading the stories of Palomar until the mid 90s when other life issues took up most of my time. It was wonderful rediscovering this magnificent work in a single volume. Likewise, Locas by Gilbert's brother Jaime is a superlative body of work (700 pages!). Both volumes should take their deserved place on any comic book lovers shelf."},{"Title":"Palomar: The Heartbreak Soup Stories (Love and Rockets)","review":"Whoever complains about comics not being compiled into complete books upon their release has obviously never taken on this 9-by-11-inch, 522-page, 5-pound hardcover. This collection has every issue of the \\"Palomar\\" series, written and drawn by Gilbert \\"Beto\\" Hernandez from 1982 to 1996. The story follows an extremely well-endowed bathhouse owner, a female sheriff, and a dozen other characters as they meet their fate over the course of 20 years. This is a whole lot of ground to cover, with stories going back and forth from past to present while keeping track of each character and his/her traits. Also, \\"Palomar\\" mixes the Latin American experience with social commentary like any other work of its kind, except that it adds soap opera clich&eacute;s and even sexual gratification and miraculously, it all comes together flawlessly--assuming you don't get loss while reading. On top of that, not only is the story populated by strong and independent (but charismatic) female leads, but we get to see them grow and age over time, a recurring trait in the other stories of the Hernandez Bros. My hat goes off to Hernandez for mastering such depth and complexity. \\"Palomar\\" wouldn't compare to, say, \\"War and Peace,\\" but it sure is a \`heavyweight' in its own right.This comic is unrated: Violence, Nudity, Adult Language, Adult Situations, Strong Sexual Content."},{"Title":"Palomar: The Heartbreak Soup Stories (Love and Rockets)","review":"Palomar follows the lives of residents of Palomar, a fictional (I assume) town somewhere south of the US in a Spanish speaking country.The most striking thing about this story was how massive it is. The story goes into detail over a twenty year period, with backstory that goes a bit farther back. Characters copulate and procreate and every once in a while something really bizarre happens, like serial killers or fires or Olympic athletics. Since its a small town, all of the characters know one another and know one another's business. I assume it's a bit like a soap opera, although I don't follow soap operas. I suspect the series would grow on people, a bit like soap operas do.Palomar is worth a look and worth taking time to track down a copy. This would be a good buy for public and university libraries, since references to the series pop up from time to time in books which analyze comic books, so I suspect the series has been influential on modern comics."},{"Title":"Palomar: The Heartbreak Soup Stories (Love and Rockets)","review":"I thought I'd over extended when I bought it a coupla years ago.

It took some time to get into the habit of employing phrases and terminology such as \\"word\\" instead of \\"you are correct\\", or \\"dope\\" instead of \\"high quality\\". I also needed to learn derogatory statements regarding my acquaintances' mothers and this book was also a slight help there. I thought it was funny but I just got strange looks when calling brothers' moms inconsistent or sluggish.Once I got those details down I put on some blackface and went to visit in the \\"hood\\", which is sort of a slang term for \\"urban locale\\". I even put on a name tag with my adopted pseudonym (\\"Karim Inyo Khofi\\"). At first I was able to blend in reasonably well, especially considering that my hair isn't very relaxed, so to speak. I covered that up by \\"axing\\" questions of the \\"brothers\\" about how to keep it \\"real\\".But the \\"brothers\\" eventually did find me out at the basketball game. I made a jump shot but afterward I was way too quick getting back on defense, and that of course aroused suspicion. Once I refused the collared greens at dinner I was toast.

Let's dispense with that up front. However, he did write an incredibly high quality one, the first high quality English Dictionary actually, and he did it practically singlehandedly. (For the details of the effort, please see &quot;The Making of Johnson's Dictionary,&quot; by Reddick, also available here at Amazon.)Johnson wrote his Dictionary at a time when people read Dictionaries, not just referred to them. Knowing that, Johnson pursued his goal of putting a stake in the ground as to the meaning of words while developing and promoting a point of view; he was very careful about the quotations he used to illustrate his words, and the choices he made have been the subject of numerous books.Johnson knew, in writing a Dictionary, that any attempt to cement the language was due to failure, and he said as much in his famous Preface. However, he felt obliged to make an effort (heck, he'd already received some advance money, and had to make good!), and over the course of years produced a volume that reigned supreme until the advent of the Oxford English Dictionary.(You may already be aware of amusing definitions found within, such as oats, pensioner, etc., but it would be a shame to let the amusement distract you from the achievement that this represents.)McDermott has included both the 1st and 4th editions on this CD-ROM, thus providing the two major editions Johnson produced (other editions are either skeletons, sans quotations, or very similar to these here), and its presence on CD-ROM makes it mcuh handier than pulling two heavy volumes off the shelf (which would cost you thousands of dollars anyway). I only have two regrets, neither of which should stop you from buying this. One, the CD-ROM does not include Johnson's Preface (it is easily available in paperback Johnson anthologies, but the absence seems pointless). Two, unless I haven't figured the interface out, it's a bit clunky: words are not searchable, one must click sections open.That being said, I am still very glad I have my copy, and I bought a second for my alma mater."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of the English Language on CD-ROM Manual","review":"My copy of this product ran wonderfully on Windows XP, but will not install on Windows Vista."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of the English Language on CD-ROM Manual","review":"This huge reprint of Samuel Johnson's great English language dictionary (1st edition of 1755) was published in 1979 by Arno Press and is long out of print.If you love the English language, consider adding this remarkable work to your collection.

The unexpurgated, NC-17 truth of the matter is that the author committed suicide shortly after the publication of this book, apparently overcome by the enormity of what had happened to her and what was taken away from her by this horrible encounter with a bear. I felt that the end of the book, with its strenuous and somewhat fake-seeming efforts to find a 'silver lining' in her misfortune were perhaps the result of pressure from the editor/publisher to end the story in an upbeat way. The bottom line in the publishing biz is that downers don't sell. Sorry, all you 'smile button' types: sometimes the unvarnished truth is that you cannot turn the page, because the page weights a ton."},{"Title":"The Bear's Embrace: A Story of Survival","review":"I believe that this story was a great description of a persons will and determination to survive.

After chapter two which was the attack and rescue I wondered how the author could fill the rest of the book with the recovery. In moving prose, with bare honesty, she takes us on her harrowing journey. Through it all is her Homeric husband(demanding work, chronically ill/incapacitated wife, growing needy children AND building his own home - whom we come to love and admire, too). Yes, this story is an unwitting condemnation of the Canadian socialized quality of medicine, but it is ultimately the strength and perseverance of the human spirit.

As someone who lived in Canada for 20 years, I believe that Patricia's critique of her medical care is NOT a critique of the Canadian system of health care funding, but of how little was understood back then about trauma, and how to rebuild one's life after such horror. This is a deeply spiritual book, in spite of its graphic descriptions of her facial damage, and the clumsy surgical attepts to fix it.

Sadly, for violinists who wish to learn more about their heritage, the New History is instead a mish-mash of opinions, misrepresentations, distortions and unanswered questions.The author makes it clear in the introduction that he allowed no proofing of his manuscript before publication, even though he is not a native speaker of English. Accordingly, the book is full of spelling, grammar, usage, punctuation and style errors. He manages to negate almost every point in the introduction at some other place in the book. He attempts to give technical explanations and definitions to musical/violinistic terms currently in use, and the result is misinformation and confusion. Perhaps the most disturbing error of the book is the lack of citation, which the author dismisses by saying that anyone can find the sources, websites and recordings if they search hard enough, like he did. The bibliography is not consistent with what is quoted, and contains a scant handful of primary sources. The suggested list of important recordings consists of a list of single pieces copied onto cassette tapes (which he admits is illegal) without formal titles, dates or recording numbers.It is obvious that the author only chose reference materials that he agreed with, thus saving him the labor of having to defend his position against differing views. The thesis of the New History centers around five letters that Fritz Kreisler wrote to his last teacher, Lambert Massart. The author contends that these letters by themselves prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that Massart invented the modern vibrato and that he is the founder of modern violin technique. This information is buried in some 40 pages near the middle of the 433-page book, and is the only proof the author offers to substantiate his claim. Since the author chooses to interject his opinion instead of factual research to make his claim, these letters end up proving nothing except how fond Kreisler was of Massart. Similarly, the author states early on that he is choosing to survey only the most \\"superlative\\" violinists. As any person (with or without brains) knows, \\"superlative\\" is a relative term. As a result, much of the biographical information included on other violinists, some of whom are obscure with forgettable careers, is colored by personal opinion.As questionable as the scholarship is, the New History nevertheless has a few redeeming points. It presents a considerable amount of difficult-to-find information on Lambert Massart, L'Abbe le fils (Joseph-Barnabe Saint-Sevin), Gaetano Pugnani, and Henryk Wieniawski. The New History also provides more than enough new research topics to keep a bevy of music historians busy for years to come. It is quite disappointing that what could have been a very useful book (with a little proofreading and a lot of documentation) turned out to be so opinionated and subjective in its views of the multifaceted history of violin performance and pedagogy. In my opinion, if you are a &quot;music lover&quot; who is interested in learning about the violin and its history, there are many books available which are cheaper, factually correct, objective and written in proper English. If you are a professional, unless you are looking for new &quot;theories&quot; to disprove, the New History isn't worth the effort."},{"Title":"A New History of Violin Playing: The Vibrato and Lambert Massart's Revolutionary Discovery","review":"For violin junkies, Silvela Zdenko's fascinating collection ofmemorabilia about the violin and those who have mastered it is an important addition to any music lover's library. Without the benefit of an editor (the book is&quot;vanity press&quot;), and though his first language is Spanish, the author, in quite comprehensible English, touches on a seemingly endless variety of aspects of the violin and its history, quite apart from his view of the development of the vibrato. Indeed, the book is a journey through the mind and collection of someone who plainly adores the violin and who, in pursuit of his devotion, has mined information which most readers will find both new andinteresting.The book's format is unconventional. In one instance, it consists of a list of great violinists. Elsewhere, he reproduces letters and other primary sources which shed light upon the evolution of virtuosity in performances of music written for the violin. Zdenko's unique volume is a potpourri of information about the violin that could have been sub-titled &quot;all you ever wanted to know about the violin and more.&quot;Once idiosyncracies of format are absorbed, the book will delight both professional musicologists and amateurs such as Zdenko himself, who plainly think of the violin, not the organ, as the &quot;King of instruments.&quot;"},{"Title":"A New History of Violin Playing: The Vibrato and Lambert Massart's Revolutionary Discovery","review":"There is a definite link between historians &amp; reviewers. Both express their opinions, preferences etc., about the subject matter.

Bearing this in mind how brave of Mr. Silvela, whoever he is, of Madrid to write &amp; publish his book for the English speaking world where there are probably the greatest number of classical music lovers constantly wishing to learn more about their musical inheritance.Once a reader has mastered Mr. Silvela's style of writing, the work becomes fascinating. Some of the content may be provocative.However, this is a plus as it raises possibilities for deliberation, conversation even argument thus widening the subject for all students and lovers of the violin. History has always been distorted - any publication which triggers discussion is good.My advice is to read the book. Read it a second time when the finer points will materialise. Sombreros off amigos to Senor Silvela for giving us this book."},{"Title":"A New History of Violin Playing: The Vibrato and Lambert Massart's Revolutionary Discovery","review":"I'm quite interested in music in general, but knew little about the violin until reading Mr. Silvela's book.

As a professional violinist from the Paris Conservatoire I must say how much impressed have I been to read the New History of Violin Playing. It is fantastic! Bravo mille fois for Mr Silvela. I would like to emphasize several things.1) The cohesion and unity of the whole work.2) The extension accorded to every violinist exceeds all precedents and make the work the most complete in existence. Many more names you could find in Van der Straeten but it is rather a telephone guide, all names but little history.3) The manuscript letters of Kreisler, touching and conclusive, I would buy them all had I the money.4)Massart is brought into light with enormous strength, a violinist almost forgotten until Mr Silvela replaced him at his just place. Despite that he was a teacher of my Conservatoire, we new very little about him, Mr Silvela's investigation is impressive.5) The unity of the work is such that in the end Anne Sophie Mutter is linked directly to Corelli. that is the proper way to write about history, to show how it evolves, and not to put just one name after the other like in Van der Straeten.6) The enciclopaedia. Very original idea, no other history contains such a thing. It is very interesting indeed.7) I feel very proud to see how Mr Silvela rates my Conservatoire as the first in the world.A must for the library of all professional musicians and music lovers alike.

I am accustomed to the formatting of text being used to clarify ideas not obscure them as it does here.My hat off to the author for attempting to write in English (there is no credit for a translator) and he does a far better job that I could do in a foreign language, but really, some advice from a native English speaker really was necessary here.Also, I have never seen a better illustration of why authors use editors to clarify their ideas (and check their spelling) - as a side note, a book on violins and violinists and their teachers should at least be sure to spell &quot;Juilliard&quot; correctly.Buy it for its eccentricities, but check out the information before sending it on to your students."},{"Title":"A New History of Violin Playing: The Vibrato and Lambert Massart's Revolutionary Discovery","review":"As a violin player of some decades I would like to say how intersted I was to see the rewiew of the reader form Chattanoga and would like to ask him to give me three or four examples of \\"those books available, which are cheaper\\" with their titles, authors, publishers and where could I buy them?

Very refreshing."},{"Title":"how nature works: the science of self-organized criticality","review":"Per Bak, sadly now deceased, in How Nature Works wrote a book of considerable intellectual strength, but one quite accessible to the general reader. The basic notion of the book, that self-organized criticality underlies the world we live in and does so at multiple levels of organization, is clearly developed and supported with examples from geophysics, from evolution, from brain science, and the list goes on, and this is done with clarity and force.For me, personally, what is most effective about this book is the ability it gives thereader to make comparisons between such disparate natural events as earthquake occurrences and the occurrences of extinction events of differing magnitudes; they both obey simple power law relationships. Further, Bak is masterful in the way in which he approached an explanation of 1/f noise. Finally, the book is well referenced so that readers who are equipped with some math and scientific insight may pursue chosen concepts in more depth.In closing, for the reader who might be a bit math-phobic, Bak is one of those researcher/authors who empowers his readers to take risks, go beyond their perceived limitations, and enter a new world of knowledge and inquirey. If you are one of those, take a leap of faith, buy the book, and open your eyes and mind to a new world.With respect and gratitude to a great scientist, Per Bak,Tony Harper"},{"Title":"how nature works: the science of self-organized criticality","review":"If you believe in Occam's razor, you will probably like the idea of self-organized criticality (SOC). It is simple enough to be understood and appreciated by non-mathematicians, yet profound enough to make us look at phenomenons in nature and society in a different way. Per Bak presented SOC in a highly readable fashion. It is not the difficulty of the subject or the writing that makes the reader stop and ruminate, as is the case with many science writings, but the simple yet intriguing nature of the idea itself.Is the author overreaching in some of his assertions and conclusions (as some people took exception to his choice of title)? Perhaps. But this book is short and highly enjoyable, and I think it is worth spending a few hours of one's time reading it."},{"Title":"how nature works: the science of self-organized criticality","review":"Per Bak's ideas (and ideas of others that are occasionally presented without quoting the original sources) are remarkably interesting, but the book itself seems to be a product of an uncontrolled avalanche in author's brain.

I first heard of the late Per Bak and his sandpile theories when I a year ago or so read an article by Koubatis and Sch&ouml;nberger (1995) on Risk management of complex critical systems. At that time I had just discovered the International Journal of Critical Infrastructure, and I was perusing their archives for articles I could use in my research on transportation vulnerability. Koubatis and Sch&ouml;nberger actually consider Per Bak's \\"sandpile\\" model to be as relevant to business and society as Adam Smith's legendary \\"invisible hand\\". When I read that I was simply compelled to investigate more.I looked up Per Bak on Wikipedia and was intrigued by his theories, but I put it aside as not particularly relevant to me at that time.Currently I am writing a book chapter on risks in Virtual Enterprise Networks (VENs), as described by Ken Thompson inThe Networked Enterprise : Competing for the Future Through Virtual Enterprise Networksand it was as a background for VENs that Per Bak came into my mind again.A VEN is a collection of loosely coupled businesses, self-organized and more efficient than traditional businesses, and it's the self-organizing concept that I needed to understand more about. How nature works provided me with that understanding. Chapter 11 on economics was particularly helpful here. Actually, every economist should read that chapter. It has certainly widened my horizon.Reference: Koubatis, A., & Sch&ouml;nberger, J. Y. (1995). Risk management of complex critical systems.

Neat! But, uh, so what"},{"Title":"how nature works: the science of self-organized criticality","review":"Per Bak has a record as one of the best, most stimulating physicists of our age. However, I am not happy with the idea of SOC and do not count it as among his best work. The weakness is that universality classes for sandpile models (and complex adaptable systems) have never been defined. Without universality classes one cannot claim that an arbitrary mathematical model (like a sandpile model or a 'complex adaptable system') describes or explains anything in nature. One or a few scaling exponents do not define a universality class for systems away from criticality. There is no evidence, to date, that turbulence, economics, and most other phenomena that occur in nature or society are critical phenomena. Socio-economic phenomena surely do not obey any invariant laws of motion. I suspect that the best that one can hope for is a model that maybe works temporarily and then fails because moods and behavior change, like the Black-Scholes option pricing pde."},{"Title":"how nature works: the science of self-organized criticality","review":"Per Bak came up with a nice theory for complex systems. Potentially it has wide ranging implications, however it remains speculative at the moment. I think SOC will in time come to be a useful tool for describing a broad class of complex systems however I doubt it will ever reach the hyperbole given in this book. Unfortunately Bak's turned this book into a sales pitch for his theory, forgotten any pretense of reasoned arguement and so spoiled what could of been a good popular science book on what is a extremely interesting are.If you are of a slightly mathematical bent get Jensen's book. There you will get a reasoned account of what SOC has given us and what is has not even if you skip some of the derivations. Balance is something you won't find in Bak's book."},{"Title":"how nature works: the science of self-organized criticality","review":"Science often progresses when physicists open their lab windows and look at the real world. Bak's book is a fun popular read for everyone.His intent on being the man who extented Newton's laws is self evident. Not a scholarly text, not probably intended to be so, Bak is quite unaware of intellectual activities other than his own.Other reviews point out the complete lack of reference to fundamental advances in what he claims to be HIS invention.We in geology welcome Bak's discovery of the real world."},{"Title":"how nature works: the science of self-organized criticality","review":"I have read a large number of books on complex systems but this one is by far the worst that I have come across.

Given Bak's obnoxious reputation, I should have expected this but I had my hopes before I started reading. Unfortunately I put the book down completely unimpressed. Skip this book and pick up anything by Stu Kauffman (try &quot;Investigations&quot;)."},{"Title":"how nature works: the science of self-organized criticality","review":"Prof. Bak weaves a rather uncaptivating tapestry with threads of fact, leaps of faith, fragile arguments and plain conjectures. He is repetitive, argumentative, anecdotal and at times abrasive (giving me the excuse to reply in kind).One-size-fits-all theories have fallen flat on their faces, more so when trying to unify physical phenomena with those involving deliberate human actions. An example of a &quot;leap of faith&quot; is his idea of labeling the act of human intervention on an existing system as coming from a slightly modified system', leading to similar dynamical behavior as before. The treatment of &quot;chaos&quot; is weak and dismissive - when a distinction between &quot;criticality&quot;, &quot;chaos&quot; and &quot;randomness&quot; would have helped get rid of baggage the author wants the reader so desperately to forget.In the first half of the book, Prof Bak has quoted Al Gore. This could not be more apt, since the book is much like the former Veep - (a) it is rambling, boring and tries to overly belabor a single point, and (b) you wouldn't miss it much if it weren't around."},{"Title":"how nature works: the science of self-organized criticality","review":"I couldn't let the previous reviewer's comments stand without comment. I can't believe the reviewer read the same book that I did. Bak's treatment is detailed, clear, and balanced. When he is enthusiastic he let's you know exactly why, leaving you free to make up your own mind. The fact that most of the studies he describes were published in Physical Review Letters might tell you something about their quality. The book provides wonderful examples of the role of models in science, much better than any I've come across in rather extensive search for materials for a course on the Nature of Science I help teach. I'm reading the book for the third time (not because it is difficult to read, but simply because it repays rereading) and I admire it more with each reading. If you want to understand models that display Self Organized Criticality, this book is without question the place to go."},{"Title":"how nature works: the science of self-organized criticality","review":"Per Bak's book How Nature Works is about the theory of self organizing criticality and its applicability to a variety of questions and problems in several sciences. It is an interesting and quick read for the most part. I have read other books on self organized criticality that were far less understandable and more limited in their scope of applicability.Although there were portions of Bak's work that were a little belabored-I found my interest in sand piles began to sag after the initial discussion, for instance-much of the rest of the book was enlightening. The discussion in Chapter 1 of the contrast between the clarity and simplicity of the laws of physics and the complexity and unpredictability of nature was particularly interesting as was the discussion of the difference between chaos and complexity. His explanation in Chapter 2 of the theory of self organized criticality and the history of its development is far clearer than I found Stuart Kauffman's to be. It might make a better starting place for anyone wishing to understand the theory a little better before going on to Kauffman's and other books on the subject.Essentially the theme of the book involves the self organization of much of the universe, from stars and volcanoes to traffic jams and economics, into critical states sustained as stable systems until they evolve through cascade events or what Bak calls avalanches (after his sand pile paradigm) or catastrophes. Bak explains that the system maintains itself along a critical line, above which chaos rules and nothing can be predicted and below which nothing happens so there is nothing to predict!Chapter 5 which deals with earthquakes and volcanic eruptions interested me in particular because of my own study of geology. Here Bak suggests that geophysicists' attempts at prediction of events is a lost cause. He believes it to be based upon the mistaken human habit of looking at random events for patterns and periodicity where none exists. While the history of a given event can be studied in some detail after the fact, the information derived is useless in predicting the future. In Bak's opinion, the variables involved are so legion and are interrelated in so convoluted a way as to be impossible to monitor before the fact.In chapters 7, 8, and 9 the author attempts to model Darwin's gradual evolution, Gould's punctuated equilibrium, and the Santa Fe Institute's fitness landscape to see which fits the facts better. In general Darwin's theories are vindicated---no real surprise there---while punctuated equilibrium is also found to have it's place in a complete theory of evolution. Chapter 11 contained a section on the unavoidability of catastrophes and fluctuations---and by their extension, one supposes, biological evolution-which casts light on the boom and bust character of economics among other things. This chapter extends the use of the theory of SOC to human activities as well as to human evolution.The author's style is very chatty, which makes it readable and personable. By filling in the human details of the discoverers, he makes the book more personal. In all, though I found myself occasionally losing the thread of the author's theme, I nevertheless found the content of each chapter well worth."},{"Title":"how nature works: the science of self-organized criticality","review":"This is both a wonderful book and an awful one with two interleaved narratives. I've read the book cover to cover and some of the key chapters several times over. I've also replicated some of the key simulation results on a personal computer. Much to the credit of Per Bak's clear explanations designed to simplify he eminently succeeds at his task of making his point: complexity in nature can be simple to understand. Bak points out the existence of power laws in self-organized critical systems occurring in nature and he gives the reader the ability to model them using simple numerical methods. We could call them &quot;back of the envelope calculations&quot; if the were analytic. All of this he manages to do without the need for the reader ever to go to the published literature. In the process of doing that, he does not completely strip off the plausibility of the models. In some sense it is quite a tour de force.So what could be awful about such a wonderful book? It would be a great world if those who make significant advances in science were magnanimous. While one narrative in Per Bak's book is all about self-organized criticality, the &quot;other&quot; narrative comes out all but too self-serving. Per Bak relishes in his moment in the limelight of science as he uses every bit of it as a platform to offer judgmental and patronizing opinions about every other field of science (including his own physics) and many colleagues he's worked with or benefited from the insight of... When convenient, reductionism is good but when not convenient, reductionism is vile. Big Science is mindless, except perhaps for this or perhaps for that... A lot of this &quot;other narrative&quot; really sounds like small talk around the departmental coffee pot with a few smirks and some wry smiles. Perhaps the editor might have suggested it all stayed there. If all this was really meant to be tongue in cheek or said with a kind smile, consider rewriting the prose.The &quot;real reality&quot; about science is that it benefits from advances on all fronts, both the microscopic and the macroscopic. Both the linear and the non-linear. It is men and women who do science, not machines, and unfortunately they sometimes bring in hubris with an inch gained here or there.

My students really enjoyed Bak's book. It gave them a whole new perspective on the nature of physical and biological systems and on the nature of scientific models.

But: he says he insisted on the title of his book, not the editors (permit me to doubt this)and then says not one word about how he came to the conclusion that power curves, fractals, 1/f distributions and Zipf's law apply to ALL of nature. Has he any evidence of natural processes that don't? Is anyone working this side of the problem? He has a refreshing view of what good science consists of, but does not display a scientist's attitude of disinterested pursuit of truth. This may be editorial inspiration to avoid qualifications in order to make stronger statements. I hope so, because I genuinely like the way he thinks, and find his ideas stimulating.

The sandpile is a great baby model for that.Some people are critical of Bak's approach, some even suggesting that we may not get power laws in these \\"sandpile\\" effects, but something less scalable in the tails. The point is :so what? The man has vision.I looked at the reviews of this book. Clearly a few narrow-minded scientists do not seem to like it (many did not like Per Bak's ego). But the book is remarkably intuitive and the presentation is so clear that he takes you by the hand. It is even entertaining. If you are looking to find flaws in his argument his pedagogy allows it (it is immediately obvious to us who dabble with simulations of these processes that you need an infinite sandpile to get a pure power law).Another problem. I have been ordering the book on Amazon for ages. Copernicus books does not respond to emails. I got my copy at the NYU library. Bak passed away 2 years ago and nobody seems to be pushing for his interest and that of us his readers (for used books to sell for 99 implies some demand). This convinces me NEVER to publish with Springer."},{"Title":"how nature works: the science of self-organized criticality","review":"Per Bak claimed to have invented a fundamentally new way of looking at nature by ascribing an almost mystical significance to \`\`power-law'' distributions (for the non-technical reader, that simply means one quantity is proportional to another quantity raised to some power; the power, typically a number like 1.8, is a constant). There are two things wrong with this claim:1. There is no deep significance to a power law distribution. All it means is that there is no natural scale of the phenomenon. (No power law runs from zero to infinity, so at best it means that there is no natural scale in the range in which the distribution is a power law.)2. There is nothing new about this conclusion. It was understood in the 1940's by Kolmogorov in his theory of turbulence and Fermi in his theory of cosmic ray acceleration. The only thing Bak added was the application of these old ideas to the artificial and uninteresting problem of sandpiles.There is nothing wrong with taking old ideas and applying them to new problems. However, Bak never admitted where the ideas came from. He never cited this earlier work. For example, models identical to his \`\`Self Organized Criticality'' were published by scientists working on earthquakes (Journal of Geophysical Research 90, 1894 [1985] and 91, 10412 [1986], building on earlier ideas by Knopoff). Although Bak was aware of this work, published before he ever began working on \`\`SOC'', he didn't acknowledge it. To a scientist this is an unpardonable sin, equivalent to a banker cooking the books.There is a striking resemblence between Bak's How Nature Works and Wolfram's A New Kind of Science. Each author claimed to have made profound and original insights which explain not just one phenomenon, but almost every aspect of the world around us. In each case these supposed insights are essentially mathematical, based on models which ignore the actual physical, chemical or biological processes involved. And in each case closer examination shows that the work is almost trivial, and irrelevant to real scientific problems. You get out what you put in, and when you don't put any science in you, don't get any science out.Each of these authors has also claimed credit to which he is not entitled by failing to acknowledge the prior work of others. They suffer from a would-be-genius syndrome, in which someone is so infatuated with his own supposed brilliance that he both exaggerates the slight significance of his work and fails to give credit to those who actually did it earlier...."},{"Title":"how nature works: the science of self-organized criticality","review":"One of the most original concepts of modern times is pulled together in this book. The named a whole new science because of Per Bak and his many friends: complexity theory. I think he hasn't grasped the whole of it yet, but this book gives an overview of where he has gone following fractal and chaos down the road to practal physics. From entropy and Zipf's law to piles of sand that fall when overloaded, a picture of a differential physical geometry that influence the great and the small is set forth in terms that are understandable. Self-organization of a critical nature is the clock work of a Godless universe with a purpose."},{"Title":"how nature works: the science of self-organized criticality","review":"Per Bak has made a glitzy try at explaining a number of natural phenomena. The idea of &quot;self-organized criticality&quot; is one that many disciplines grom geology to taxonomy to economics have had as a &quot;dance partner.&quot;Unfortunately, the idea of spontaneous order requires rigorous argument, not just clever analogy. For an elegant statement of the relations among the processes and components of the Universe that interact to give us stability and instability, basic arguments and a history of ideas can be found in Prigogine and Stengers' &quot;Order Out of Chaos: Man's New Dialog with Nature.&quot; In collaboration with Stengers, Prigogine has updated his arguments for the role of the structures and behaviors in Nature in &quot;The End of Certainty: Time, Chaos and the New Laws of Nature.&quot; Incidentally, the Nobel Laureate work of Ilya Prigogine seems not to have been discussed in Bak's cute little book. Even though this book is clearly written, there are enough omissions and errors to make a reader nervous.For two instances of many problems. 1-Many examples are drawn from paleontological and evolutionary phenomena. Data on life spans of fossil genera (a Sepkowski compilation of data) are the source for one of histograms and are incorrectly transferred to Bak's book as a &quot;kill curve.&quot; Kill curves are an important part of evolutionary/extinction theory. Bak might also have cited Van Valen's mechanism for disappearance by predation: the Red Queen's Hypothesis (roughly put, predators snarf up the most convenient meal, not always the slowest member of a species). This is an interesting variation on natural selection and one which Bak's cleverness could discuss to good effect. 2-Linear log-log plots appear without error bars and might have been done by the old Mark One Eyeball Method. How is a reader to know if the data reflected in the points were sloppy or tight fits? This is a crucial point in pattern matching. A shaky pattern makes a less convincing argument than a rel! iable one. Why aren't major intellectual contributions to the idea of self organization and critical conditions from Van Valen (1973), G. U. Yule (1987), D. Raup (1991) and Prigogine (1984, 1996) given some discussion?I mention the above examples because argument by analogy is centered on Pattern Matching. Pattern can be defined for mathematical purposes as &quot;a template, motif, design which may be repeated&quot; (see Gr&uuml;nbaum and Shephard, &quot;Tilings and Patterns&quot;). But Bak does not say WHY pattern in mathematics (created by mathematical rules) should match pattern in Nature (created by rules which we are still working out). A quick answer would be that the pattern/analogy is only as good as the elements of the items being compared are comparable. Clearly, mechanisms of creation of the compared patterns are different. Use of analogy is a creative, useful way to probe the unknown by the known, but Bak does not lay even this foundation for the arguments in the book.Because mathematical pattern (as survival curves, radioactive decay and the like appears in nature does not mean that the pattern match alone is &quot;proof&quot; for general a natural process as explanation for diverse observations. Bak's &quot;avalanche behavior in sandpiles&quot; is only as good as a master pattern if the transfer of data and mathematical information from other sources is impeccable. For an example of careful argument using understandable mathematics to understand processes in nature I recommend David Raup's witty &quot;Extinction: Bad Luck or Bad Genes?.&quot;In closing, I cannot recommend this book in spite of its occasional cleverness and clear writing. In the spirit of the Red Queen's Hypothesis, it is not quite quick enough to avoid the predator/critic."},{"Title":"how nature works: the science of self-organized criticality","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in understanding how Nature works. Nature by far is bursty, intermittent, diverse, highly inhomogeneous both in time and space. This ubiquitous non-uniformity includes natural shapes, human behavior, dynamics of macroevolution, economics, distribution of galaxies, etc. In contrast, we all are very familiar with \\"bell curves\\", describing the statistics of the homogeneous-ordered-normal-boring. No theory can account properly with the prevalence in Nature of in-homogeneity and diversity. This book it is dedicated to propose a physical mechanism to generate all of that at once!. Starting with the 1987 Per Bak work on toy models, the book conveys the idea that there is hope in finding a few (instead of one for each phenomena) common (\\"universal\\") mechanisms from which the diversity (complexity?) seen in Nature emerges out of the interaction of the parts.The theme of the book is: how to write the equation that generates complexity, and -importantly- without including complexity in the recipe. I usually recommend this book (long with Buchanan's \\"Ubiquity\\") to novice students eager to read the first things about this question, and the majority found my suggestion useful. The book contains a detailed bibliography helping the newcomer to check further the breadth and validity of the author' claims. The reader could disagree with some bold claims, but should be assured that there is not frivolous thinking wasting pages: all the material in the book was published in the most prestigious scientific journals and quoted by thousands of scientists who found inspiration in this perspective. That alone, set this book apart from recent ones claiming to have a theory for everything."},{"Title":"From Soup to Nuts : How to Badda Boom, Badda Bing and Find Your Inner Mobster","review":"Perhaps if you are into redundant jokes about Mike Tyson and Jefferey Dahmer you'll find this book witty.

In fact, the author of &quot;The Phosphors of Dreamland&quot; and others has found her form (the short story) and created a perfect little &quot;pillow book.&quot; This book is at once sacred and profane-- rich and poor and a potpourri of languages real and impossible and peoples'--mythological, desirable--of crimes heinous and miraculous. It's unfortunate I am not in a position as an individual to more than extol &quot;The Word: Desire&quot; as one of the best &quot;english language&quot; books written in contemporary times-- certainly one of the single best examples we have of the fable of the avante garde and a meditation and tome so vital that in this pluralistic millenial time Ducornet has succeeded in producing a form of synthesized manna in the desert of postmodern literature.This author has finally come of age and this book is pure art. I suggest young poets and writers read her earlier books as companion pieces to this one if only to plunder the spoils of a rich capacity to enrich and drench language, and to know when to mean, and to know when to refrain, and when to not mean. This approaches and engulfs the poet's art yet never stops being rife with stories and fairy tales for the 21st century.A book one must own."},{"Title":"Of Fiction and Faith: Twelve American Writers Talk About Their Vision","review":"This excellent collection of interviews is a wonderful contribution to both the literary and Christian communities. Each of the twelve subjects deserves a greater audience within these two groups, and most of them discuss the difficulties of crossing the divide between them. For readers familiar with the subjects' work, this collection offers a much needed focus on the spiritual themes and influences of their fiction. For new readers, this collection is a perfect introduction to writers worth reading. If you enjoy this book and would like to continue along similar lines, try The Christ-Haunted Landscape:Faith and Doubt in Southern Fiction. This is a collection of interviews with contemporary Southern writers. Susan Ketchin (who is, coincidentally, the wife of Faith and Fiction subject Clyde Edgerton) is the interviewer/author."},{"Title":"Of Fiction and Faith: Twelve American Writers Talk About Their Vision","review":"The twelve authors interviewed for this book seem to have, with few exceptions, certain things in common:1. None of them, with the exception of Garrison Keillor and, possibly, Water Wangerin are huge sellers. In fact, I had never heard of eight of the twelve writers in the book.2. Although having some connection to the Christian faith, none of them are what you would call &quot;conservative&quot;, &quot;evangelical&quot; or &quot;fundamentalist&quot;.3. None of the authors want to be pigeonholed as a &quot;Christian author,&quot; or be exiled to the &quot;Christian Bookstore&quot; ghetto. Yet they run into the problem of being too religious for the secularists, and too secular for the religious.Probably the best thing about this book is that it has turned my on to some authors that were previously unfamiliar to me. The downside of that is that the books mentioned that sound most appealing to me are out of print. This book never fails to be interesting, and althought there are recurring themes (the influence of Flannery O'Connor, etc.), there are some suprises along the way, such as seemingly mild-mannered Garrison Keillor's vitriolic attack on the GOP. One drawback is that some of these interviews are more than a decade old. Nevertheless, this book is a worthwhile purchase."},{"Title":"Something fresh ([Methuen's half-crown novels])","review":"In P.G. Wodehouse (Thames and Hudson Literary Lives Series), James Connolly offers this advice: \\"Relax and reread Wodehouse; he's the boy to restore a sense of proportion.\\" Absolutely good advice. I find rereading Wodehouse is more enjoyable than most first reads of other authors, and he's quite easy to reread, even if you don't intend to, because his stories appear in various collections and his novels were often published under various titles.Something Fresh, officially the first book in the Blandings Castle saga, was published as \\"Something New\\" as a serial in The Saturday Evening Post in 1915, and then as a book with the same title in an American edition. \\"Something Fresh\\" is a slightly altered British edition of that book. Ashe Marson, the unknown author of the hard-boiled Gridley Quayle, Investigator series of paperback pulps, answers an ad: \\"WANTED--Young Man of Good Appearance, who is poor and reckless, to undertake delicate and dangerous enterprise. Good pay for the right man.\\" Poor and reckless is a formula in Wodehouse for a good-hearted, down on his luck guy, about to be smiled upon by a beneficent Providence. It's a carry-over from his work in musical comedy and as a struggling writer, but he is one of the few authors who make his leading characters writers, and one of the very few who throws them any of the good parts.This book is a double bonus, with not only Ashe, but a female writer, Joan Valentine, who knows even more of the hard-bitten life of the streets, and is therefore even poorer and more reckless, as a stellar second in the personnel. Throw in all sorts of millionaires and mix-ups, maids and butlers, a loveable, old, potty Earl, and the beginning of the crime wave at Blandings, and you have the makings of either a rollicking musical comedy or a long series of delightful novels. With Wodehouse it was both. He alternated between the two worlds and if Something Fresh were a film or a musical, Ashe and Joan would no doubt break into song and start dancing about the parlour, as do Gracie Allen, George Burns and Fred Astaire in the Gershwin Brothers' film adaption of Wodehouse's novel, A Damsel in Distress. Why four stars? You can't give everything five, and in my view, as good as Something Fresh is, some of the later Wodehouse novels (such as the Jeeves, Mulliner and Drones Stories) are even better."},{"Title":"Something fresh ([Methuen's half-crown novels])","review":"I'm a big fan of Wodehouse. In fact, this is the only Blandings novel or story I've yet to read. So I was really looking forward to digging into it. However, the small print in my Penguin edition was proving a bit too tiring for my middle-aged eyes to read in the late evening, so I thought I'd download the Kindle version (only a dollar!), increase the type size a bit, and happy reading! A few nights later, a few chapters into the book, I was settling down in bed to read a bit more and I realized that I'd left my Kindle in another room, so I decided to squint my way through my Penguin copy for the evening. I started leafing through the early chapters, looking for my place, and I noticed some material that i didn't remember having read on the Kindle. So, I got up, went to my office, retrieved the Kindle, and started comparing the two versions. Lo and behold -- the Kindle version is missing whole paragraphs! And not just a few.I ask you, who in their right mind would abridge a Wodehouse novel?"},{"Title":"Something fresh ([Methuen's half-crown novels])","review":"The Kindle edition entitled \\"Something Fresh (with linked TOC)\\" is not _Something Fresh_, which was the British version of the book whose American version was entitled _Something New_. There are significant differences between the two versions, visible even in the free sample, e.g. three of the main characters are American rather than English; see Terry Mordue's excellent annotations on the web for more details. Spastic Cat Press's Kindle edition of _Something New_ is fine, however, and I'll be reviewing that later."},{"Title":"Something fresh ([Methuen's half-crown novels])","review":"Having read many of the jeeves stories 20 years ago and watched again recently the ITV Jeeves and Wooster starring Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie, I thought it was time to get back to Wodehouse for some good cheer. But, I wanted to start on something different, so I decided to start with the first of the Blandings novels. As someone who struggles to get a night sleep because of pain, it was a sheer delight for me to have the tonic of reading this book peopled with its ecentric characthers and its zany plot. Lord Emsworth is the most striking characther here - he is completely potty, not realising he has stolen an american collector's egyptian scarab. The book is about the collector getting the scarab back and it really is hiarlous at times. I will say though that having just read \\"Leave it to Psmith\\" that, if anything, the series gets better with its more complex and convoluted characthers with impersonation being a key theme. Anyway enjoy to your heart's content!"},{"Title":"Something fresh ([Methuen's half-crown novels])","review":"Very funny book.

The visualisation of that scene isn't hard to do, since Wodehouse is an amazing artist with words.... and it's rewarding.Too funny!You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Something fresh ([Methuen's half-crown novels])","review":"This is my 3rd book of P.G Wodehouse &amp; I'm simply hooked!! P.G Wodehouse is one of a kind! Any body can write a story, but it takes real talent to write something which will make people laugh. I liked this book not so much for the story as for P.G Wodehouse's style of writing. The plot is well-made &amp; skilfuly woven.What happens when a scarab gets stolen? 'A scarab?' you think. Yes, a valuable scarab from Mr. Peter's collection &amp; an offer of 10,000 dollars for it's retrieval. This has caught your attention. So has it caught Ashe Marton &amp; Joan Valentine in a web of lies, confusion &amp; humour. Both of them vye for the reward, posing as impostors in Blandings castle. Ashe Marton, as Mr. Peter's valet &amp; Joan Valentine as Aline Peter's maid. The Efficient Baxter, Lord Emsworth's seceretary, gets to know of the plan &amp; spends many sleepless nights hoping to catch them red-handed. But none of them know that somebody else is interested in the scarab too, &amp; will very soon take it away right under their noses! The side characters who contribute a lot towards the humour situation, are Mr. Beach, the butler, who 'Suffers from His Feet, From Nervous Disorders', &amp; 'whose Stomach Lining is not what a stomach lining should be.' I'm sure you'll all love this hilarious story."},{"Title":"Something fresh ([Methuen's half-crown novels])","review":"The next time your strolling in a peaceful wood where the birds are singing, the squirrels chattering, the brook babbling, and your heart fills with joy, you'll know exactly the type of experience you get when reading a Wodehouse novel. Wodehouse writes about a happy world, where pratfalls rule and coincidences are the norm. This is world where your not in tune if you don't fall in love at first sight. Something Fresh is all of this: happy, filled with pratfalls and coincidence, and brimming with lovers. What should a person recommend more? The wonderfully convoluted plots? The large cast of absolute eccentrics? Wodehouse's command of the English language (and how to use it humorously and dramatically)? Since I love all of the above, it is not difficult to imagine giving this book anything but a glowing review. And what is more amazing is that this is not even his funniest book!! But Something Fresh is a great place to start if you never have read Wodehouse before. It is a good introduction to those wonderful folks of Blandings Castle. And you'll know that having a cheerful &quot;tra-la-la!&quot; on your lips will get you a lot further in life than a frown and a lawsuit. Having Wodehouse in my life has improved things immensely."},{"Title":"Something fresh ([Methuen's half-crown novels])","review":"Another great installment in the Wodehouse canon.A lot of this is exactly what you expect. The usual great expression and wit - that's the reason we're here. There's a typical range of peers, whether dotty, surly, benign, clueless, resolute, whimsical - or whatever combination. Light comic mix-ups and interactions. And a romance to tie it together.But there's also some enjoyable peculiarities in this variation (ones I was more aware of soon after reading the book - I really must try to get to these reviews quicker).Spoilers.There's perhaps less of a focus on proto-Bertie (Freddy in this incarnation). Rather we tend to centre on a more classically heroic couple, a damn plucky gel, and, gracious, an Adonis of a boy. But fear not - he may have good abs, but he's way more Hugh Grant than Arnold Schwarzenegger. Interesting that some of their heroism relates to their poverty: they rise above their circumstances, rather than merely swim though them, like some of Wodehouse's later independently wealthy characters. And this may relate to the relative earliness of publication - this book came out in 1915 - before Wodehouse himself was established (or, perhaps, while he could still better remember times of living on a shoestring). Indeed, a glance at the unimpeachable wikipedia suggests that this book was his big break, the book that helped him escape the wolf at the door, previously barely held off by freelance journalism, contributions to musicals, and his more traditionally formulaic (but still enjoyable) schoolboy novels.But this brings me to my postmodern bit. No surprises to have an author drawing on his own experience in creating characters. But Wodehouse is so self-aware of this in this book. Sure Derrida et. al. came up with some insightful points, but I do more and more cringe when hearing scholars treat this sort of thing as some utterly new concept. So here we have as our lead character a public school graduate who has to scrape by by writing fodder for the market - material that he himself finds absurd (no surprises that Wodehouse never returned to the Ripton stories once he could afford not to). We have the fun of the irony of a gushing fan - within the text - who loves the stories a world more than the author. But there are deliberate similarities between Ashe and his over the top hero - similarities that Ashe acknowledges in his final gambit. Moreover Wodehouse kicks around issues of feminism as Joan must navigate the tricky course of somehow maintaining independence without losing romance (but this is a sacrifice she's very prepared to make). Yeah, but how postmodern is this exchange in the last few pages of the book, as Joan and Ashe try to make sense of the story, to find a plot, a resolution:\\"Do you ever get moods when life seems absolutely meaningless? It's like a badly-constructed story, with all sorts of characters moving in and out who have nothing to do with the plot. And when somebody comes along that you think really has something to do with the plot, he suddenly drops out. After a while you begin to wonder what the story is about, and you feel that it's about nothing--just a jumble.\\"\\"There is one thing,\\" said Ashe, \\"that knits it together.\\"\\"What is that?\\"\\"The love interest.\\"Their eyes met and suddenly there descended on Ashe confidence. He felt cool and alert, sure of himself, as in the old days he had felt when he ran races and, the nerve-racking hours of waiting past, he listened for the starter's gun. Subconsciously he was aware he had always been a little afraid of Joan, and that now he was no longer afraid.\\"Joan, will you marry me?\\"Her eyes wandered from his face. He waited.\\"I wonder!\\" she said softly. \\"You think that is the solution?\\"You could pull this apart in ten different ways, but if nothing else it just hammers that Wodehouse was as capable asCalvinoof sharing a wink with his readers about what is or isn't \`beyond the text'.This aspect doesn't drive the story, and most of the fun is in Wodehouse's peerless narration, and evocation of characters that are at once both ludicrous and recognisable. There's also plenty of material if you wanted to discuss class: is, for example, Wodehouse an inexcusable snob because his servants are usually boorish and/or narrow-minded and/or unintelligent ... yet no more so than any of his aristocrats! I suppose this has been kicked about a lot with the whole Jeeves/Wooster dynamic: just who is in charge here (and there's no question who is the smartest). For all the silliness of the midnight confusions and relationships, the story framework does actually hang together effectively. And the self aware bits aren't half as laboured as, say,McEwan's: this little excerpt incorporates postmodernism (or is that prepostmodernism?) with perfect restraint, wit, and to effectively dovetail with the plot. A lovely bonus to an already thoroughly enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Something fresh ([Methuen's half-crown novels])","review":"Wodehouse continues with his wonderful recipe of decadent peerage, hopelessly-in-lovers, imposters and theft plots in another Blandings Castle book. To this delightful mix, is added an American dash in the form of Mr.Peters, a multimillionaire with poor digestion and poorer temper and his sweet wisp of a daughter Aline Peters, engaged to be married to Freddie Threepwood. Ashe Marson (author of Gridley Quayle, detective fiction and avid practicioner of the Larsen exercises) and Joan Valentine (ex-chorus girl, former paramour of Freddie and always ready to take life by the bull's horns)bring in even more flavour to this already succulent mix. What's really interesting is how the lead characters come and go but Blandings Castle and its inmates remain part of the unchanging, everlastingly witty backdrop.

It is about a person named Lord Emsworth who accidentally steals a millionaire's scarab. The millionaire also happens to be his son's future father-in-law. The millionaire hires a man to find it, while the man's friend also gets information on the scarab. So both try to steal, while the Lord Emsworth's secretary, not knowing that it is the millionaire's, tries to prevent them from recovering the scarab. The encounters between the man,his girl friend, and the secretary will keep you laughing. Not only I, but also other people, who have read this book after I recommended it, share the view that Something Fresh is an extraordinary book. Get your hands on this book as fast as you can, and soon you will be famished for more books by P.G. Wodehouse. It will, and I am totally serious here, make you laugh until you have laughed all the laughs you can laugh, and cried all the tears you can cry. Hope you enjoy!!!! Cheers!!!!! : )"},{"Title":"Something fresh ([Methuen's half-crown novels])","review":"I first came across this book in a bookstore when I had about 3 hours to kill. I picked it up from the shelf expecting an average and rather boring reading session. How wrong I was! Something Fresh is the first book in the Blandings castle series written by Wodehouse. Although it does not introduce the famous 'empress of Blandings'(Lord Emsworth's prize pig), it is still remarkable. Imposters and thieves are very common at Blanding's castle. However, there is nothing common about their activities. Each and every character is well portrayed. The simple minded Earl of Emsworth decides to get his erring and irritating son (Freddie)married to an american heiress(Aline Peters) in order to make a man out of him. The Earl visits the American millionaire and anxious to promote the match, agrees to see the latter's famous scarab collection. In the process, the Earl flicks a priceless scarab(an act of absentmindedness and a true characteristic of Earl Emsworth). Mr. Peters believes that the scarab has been stolen deliberately. This starts a series of events that lead to humourous situations. The drama ends in Blandings castle but not without some hilarious situations. Other characters include the two thieves competing with each other to steal the precious scarab, Baxter, the suspicious and efficient secretary to Lord Emsworth, the butler Beach. The list is endless and the reader is well warned that he/she may dislocate a rib laughing. Something fresh is a wonderful way to begin Mr. Wodehouse's works. It is truly marvelous the way he weaves a web of excitement,fun and comedy. The book keeps the reader engaged and at every point, one is kept guessing. Mr. Wodehouse's works are well known for their dry and subtle humor. The narration (in this book) corroborates this and the tale is told without any serious attempt on the author's behalf to make the reader laugh. The reader will laugh anyway. In a world filled with harsh realities, Mr.Wodehouse's books come as a refreshing change. A spot of sun on a gloomy day. His language is excellent(in these days of slang)and his plots are fabulous. A must read for re establishing sanity in an insane world."},{"Title":"Something fresh ([Methuen's half-crown novels])","review":"This book was first published as \\"Something New\\" in the U.S. on September 3rd, 1915 by D. Appleton and Company, and then in the U.K. on September 16th, 1915 by Methuen & Co., and this is the first of the Blandings Castle stories. As far as Wodehouse stories go this is not his best, but it does introduce characters which appear in many of his later works.The main two characters of the story are Ashe Marson, a writer of cheap detective novels, and Joan Valentine, a woman who lives in his apartment building who laughs at his morning exercises which results in their meeting. Neither of them is satisfied with what they are doing in life, and both are in the need for money.The story moves to different characters from time to time, in typical Wodehouse fashion. Important characters include Aline Peters, Jane's friend who is engaged to Frederick Threepwood, who is the son of the Earl of Emsworth who is the lord of Blandings Castle, and is a very absent minded individual. Jane's father is J. Preston Peters, an American business man who collects scarabs and suffers from digestion problems.Other characters included are Baxter, the Earl's secretary, and R. Jones, a less than honest man whom Frederick has hired to recover love letters he wrote to an actress (Joan Valentine) in the past which might contain evidence for a breach of promises suit. There are also the many guests and servants of Blandings Castle.It would be impossible to cover all the twists in a Wodehouse plot, but many of his usual devices are here. Characters pretending to be someone they are not, misunderstandings galore, and love, of course. Some of the scenes which I liked the best included Baxter's attempts to catch someone trying to steal the Scarab, and the servant scenes where the hierarchy of servants comes into play. I have yet to read a Wodehouse book which wasn't enjoyable, and this one is no exception. However, there are many of his stories which are better than this one.This edition is part of \\"The Collector's Wodehouse\\" series being published by The Overlook Press in the U.S. (in the U.K. it is \\"The Everyman's Wodehouse\\" series being published by Everyman's Library)."},{"Title":"Something fresh ([Methuen's half-crown novels])","review":"This is the first Blandings Castle novel, and the first novel in what we now think as the true P.G. Wodehouse style. For the first time, the interplay between absent-minded peers, quick-to-anger relatives and friends, and those amazing good-natured yet good-for-nothing younger sons come together in a comic dance of quick assumptions, identity switches, flirts with embarrassment, and, oh yes, love.If Wodehouse wasn't so widely admired by the critics, I would have to claim him as a guilty pleasure. Although I can quote style and form with the best of them, the real truth is that I read Wodehouse because he amuses. In Wodehouse's hands, the sly wink equals the over-the-top exaggeration, and only one will work in the place that he puts it.I tried to slow my reading speed down on this book, to gain an understanding of the flow and the way the language worked. I failed miserably--before I realized it, I was caught up once again in the action of the story and I wasn't observing but enjoying. I'm thinking that to truly study a novel, I am going to have to force myself to retype it."},{"Title":"Something fresh ([Methuen's half-crown novels])","review":"\\"Something Fresh\\" is the first of P.G. Wodehouse's Blandings novels. It was first published in 1915 - as \\"Something New\\" in the USA and \\"Something Fresh\\"in the UK. There are a few differences between the two, though the main plot remains the same.The book opens with Ashe Marson, a 26 year-old graduate of Oxford University. (Ashe had been intending to read for the church, but was a significantly better athlete than he was a student. Although he eventually scraped through with a degree of sorts, he had to abandon his religious calling. However, he still adheres to Larsen's Exercises...they make him look somewhat ridiculous, they keep him in excellent shape). Ashe now works for the Mammoth Publishing Company in London, churning out \\"The Adventures of Gridley Quayle\\"...although very popular, Ashe finds his job absolutely soul-destroying.Ashe is in the middle of his exercises one morning when he encounters Joan Valentine for the first time...they don't get off to a great start, as she bursts out laughing at him. However, she soon calls round to apologise and Ashe is (unsurprisingly) smitten. (Love at first sight tends to happen in Wodehouse novels, after all). Joan is 23 and has been making her own way in the world for 5 years - like Ashe, she's currently an employee of the Mammoth Publishing Company. However, she has worked as a lady's maid, a governess and even on the stage. After talking to her, Ashe is hopeful he'll find a new career in the newspaper ads.Meanwhile, Lord Emsworth and his wayward son, the Hon Freddie Threepwood, are paying a brief visit to London. Lord Emsworth hates the city as much as his son loves it - unfortunately for Freddie, he's been more or less under house arrest for the last year. (Lord Emsworth cut off his allowance following a string of gambling debts and made his stay at Blandings Castle, deep in the countryside). Father and son have different appointments however - Lord Emsworth is visiting J. Preston Peters, an American millionaire and the father of Freddie's fianc&eacute;e, Aline. (The Peters family have been renting the estate next to Blandings since the previous autumn, but J. Preston keeps an impressive scarab collection in his town house). Meanwhile, Freddie pops round to see R. Jones, his very shady ex-bookmaker. He's hoping to \\"recover\\" some love-letters he sent to a chorus-girl. (One of Freddie's cousins recently lost a court case, involving some love letters and a claim of breach of promise. Now that he's engaged, he's hoping to prevent the same thing happening to him). For 500, Jones promises all will be fine...Naturally, nothing goes according to plan. Lord Emsworth, a largely harmless but absent-minded old buffoon, accidentally wanders with one of Peters' very valuable scarabs. Later, he fuzzily (and incorrectly) recalls that that Peters had given it to him as a gift. J. Preston is furious and promises a reward of 1000 to get it back. Joan hears about the reward from Aline - the pair happen to be old schoolfriends. (Coincidentally, she was also the chorus-girl on the receiving end of Freddie's letters). Meanwhile, Ashe is hired by Peters himself - who's placed an ad in the newspaper. Jones also hears about the reward, through a little snooping and lurking in dark corners...and sees a way fo screwing a little more money out of proceedings. It's only a matter of time before all roads lead to Blandings and all hell breaks loose.An easy and enjoyable read - and the beginning of a series that just gets better and better. Absolutely recommended."},{"Title":"Something fresh ([Methuen's half-crown novels])","review":"Wodehouse continues with his wonderful recipe of decadent peerage, hopelessly-in-lovers, imposters and theft plots in another Blandings Castle book. To this delightful mix, is added an American dash in the form of Mr.Peters, a multimillionaire with poor digestion and poorer temper and his sweet wisp of a daughter Aline Peters, engaged to be married to Freddie Threepwood. Ashe Marson (author of Gridley Quayle, detective fiction and avid practicioner of the Larsen exercises) and Joan Valentine (ex-chorus girl, former paramour of Freddie and always ready to take life by the bull's horns)bring in even more flavour to this already succulent mix. What's really interesting is how the lead characters come and go but Blandings Castle and its inmates remain part of the unchanging, everlastingly witty backdrop. 'Something Fresh' uses standard Wodehousian plot ingredients but manages to keep you laughing all along, nevertheless."},{"Title":"Something fresh ([Methuen's half-crown novels])","review":"I particularly like the very smooth prose, it is very easy to read and if you can ignore the plot or lack of it thereof; it is an enjoyable read. I dismissed Wodehouse many years back but am pleasantly surprised to enjoy it now. I do find myself comparing this book with Anthony Trollope's Barchester Series."},{"Title":"The Dolls' House","review":"Rumer Godden, the author of those absorbing novels about nuns of yesteryear, \\"Black Narcissus\\" and \\"In This House of Brede,\\" both successfully filmed with Deborah Kerr and Diana Rigg respectively, tries her hand here at a book for younger readers. This is the tale of a doll \\"family,\\" not related by biology but the simple fate of being thrown together. Although there are nominal mother and father dolls, the real head of the household is Tottie, a wooden farthing doll, wise beyond her childish appearance. The dolls' relative happiness and the way it is threatened by the appearance of Marchpane, an expensive, arrogant and, as it turns out, really malevolent interloper, makes for surprisingly gripping drama. Indeed, the tale of Marchpane's machinations and the tragic climax of the story may be too intense for younger or more sensitive children, for whom this book needs to be introduced with care. For the rest of them, and for adults who simply like a good story, \\"The Dolls' House\\" still exerts its considerable spell. Tasha Tudor's illustrations are a notable contribution as well."},{"Title":"The Dolls' House","review":"Fortunate to have read this book at the age of ten, I never forgot it. Having recently read some of Rumer Godden's adult books, I decided to purchase a copy. The money I paid was well worth it. The book is still a wonderful read. If you are an adult who read it as a child, re-read it. If you've never read it, you will enjoy the drama about a family whose home and happiness are threatened and how they dealt with it. This is a must-read for all Godden fans. All her storytelling skills are used, deft foreshadowing, proper use of detail and strong dramatic scenes. It was written for children but it can be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys fine writing."},{"Title":"The Dolls' House","review":"Quite affecting. A very rich story of the \\"family-dynamics\\" in an antique doll-house. Perhaps best read to the younger child (under 10). There are some very complex emotions at play. My 7 year old burst into tears at Birdie's \\"sacrifice\\". Still it's important for young readers to experience a full range of emotions when reading, espcecially as they move into chapter books"},{"Title":"The Dolls' House","review":"Have you ever gotten something as a present but then something/someone takes it? That's what happens in the fantasy where dolls talk, The Dolls' House, a book by Rumer Godden, who's also the author of Listen To The Nightingale.In The Dolls' House, a family of dolls owned by Charlotte and Emily Dane, two little girls who love to play with dolls, get a present. The present is a huge deluxe dollhouse that Tottie, a wooden farthing doll, used to live in. Tottie Plantaganet (the oldest child), Birdie Plantaganet (the mom of the family), Mr. Plantaganet (the dad), and Apple Plantaganet (Tottie's little brother), move into the dollhouse. Later, Marchpane, a nasty little stuck-up doll that thinks she is too delicate to be played with by those \\"silly little children that don't know how to be careful\\", moves into the Plantaganet's house and takes over.My favorite part of The Dolls' House is when Tottie goes to an exhibit for dolls only because it's funny-one of the many elements mixed together to form this wonderful book. There is also lots of anger, happiness, and action in this book. The ending is a little sad, but I love The Dolls' House anyway-I would rate it a 9.2 out of a full 10.The Dolls' House is perfect for 3rd graders, 4th graders, and 5th graders."},{"Title":"The Dolls' House","review":"I am 8 years old.

It's incredible, a very grown up tale , yet it can be read at any age. Rumer Godden is a wonderful author, and this book will capture your heart like nothing else - except maybe The Mouse and his Child. It is the story of a family living in The DollHouse, and learning to come to terms with themselves, it is both happy and sad........but ultimately rewarding."},{"Title":"The Dolls' House","review":"Although I read this book for the first time when I was seven, it has stayed with me as one of my favorites. Reading it again as an adult adds a new layer of depth to the plot that so enthralled me in second grade. It is not just a story about dolls."},{"Title":"The Dolls' House","review":"The Dolls' House is a very lovely, but adventurous book written for little girls from ages 6 through 10. The author, Rumer Godden does a remarkable job of narrating and explaining the time period of England and uses great detail to make the young readers feel part of the story. A family of mixed matched dolls is owned by two sisters living in England in the 1940's. The children's imagination and creativity bring the dolls to life in the story, but the dolls seem to come alive by themselves, too. The dolls are unhappy with their current living arrangements and are thrilled to receive a new, but very old doll house. Many life lessons and relations are learned and tested by the dolls and the children as they try to make the house a home. The children and the dolls restore the dolls' house in the end, but not without sacrifice."},{"Title":"The Dolls' House","review":"...although I last read it over 20 years ago! There is pure MAGIC in the story. When I first saw TOY STORY, this book came to mind right away. Just great descriptive writing of a make-believe world that almost seems real, set with those lovely illustrations that help tell the story beautifully! In fact, I'm getting this for my 8 year old niece - a perfect book for a doll lover her age! Yet, also, a story that is SO good, I can still remember it well...Just get this book, your daughter will love it!"},{"Title":"The Dolls' House","review":"While I have always loved some of Rumer Godden's other books (including \\"Miss Happiness and Miss Flower\\", which is also about the \\"lives\\" of old dolls), I had mixed feelings about this book each time I read it as a child. The book is about a doll family, made up of several different types of dolls. The little girl doll, Tottie, is a wooden \\"farthing\\" doll of the type Queen Victoria played with as a child; the mother doll, Birdy, is cheap celluloid and a bit rattle-pated as a result. There is also a father and a little boy doll. As in \\"Miss Happiness and Miss Flower\\", the dolls long for a house of their own, but just when their dream is coming true their little-girl owners receive an elegant, haughty and expensive doll named Marchpane who looks down on the doll family and threatens to take over the dollhouse herself. This has the makings of a good plot, but unfortunately, it wasn't developed in a way that satisfied me as a young reader.Aside from just describing what the dolls do each day in their house, the theme of the book is that the most expensive and most beautiful doll is not necessarily the most worthy or lovable doll. The author makes this point by describing a doll exhibition visited by the Queen, who is happiest to see the little \\"farthing\\" doll that reminds her of her childhood, not the expensive Marchpane. The author makes this point again when a tragic accident occurs that makes the little girls realize that the most beautiful and expensive doll may not be the one with the best, most lovable qualities. This is a common theme in children's books, including other books about dolls (\\"The Best-Loved Doll\\" for example) but in \\"The Doll's House\\", it doesn't work as well. Perhaps this is because in books like \\"The Best-Loved Doll\\", it's the child who sees that beautiful and expensive toys are not necessarily the best or the nicest ones, but in this book, the little girls who own the dolls are actually bamboozled by Marchpane's beauty while adults (like the Queen) see the inner beauty in the cheaper dolls. I also was disappointed as a child to see that one of the \\"good\\" dolls was \\"killed off\\" in the course of the story and that the evil doll did not seem to get punished for her very bad attitude. In fact, she ends up in a situation that's actually preferable! If a doll had to be harmed or destroyed, I would have liked it to be the \\"bad\\" one.I think this might be a nice book for older readers with a sense of whimsy who are interested in the history of different types of British dolls, which the book gets into a little bit, but it just fell flat for me as a child. I know I tried several times to enjoy it because I liked \\"Miss Happiness and Miss Flower\\" so much, but it just ended up alternately boring and frustrating me every time, because nothing much happened till the \\"bad\\" doll showed up, then she disrupted everyone's lives and walked away without a scratch. Not the way children like to see the world."},{"Title":"The Dolls' House","review":"The Doll's House, by Rumer Godden, written in the era of my childhood & published 1948, as a work of great value, has taken my heart soaring into whimsical places and joy. This British Author has done a splendid job of bringing her characters, who are mainly dolls, into life with quite different personalities! And somehow, in the magic, a tale of what is truly important to the human heart comes forth ... and is learned by Emily and Charlotte, the two little girls who play with, love, and bring their dolls to life. After reading this book for the first time this week, I am glad to be passing it on to my granddaughter. The dolls in this story were passed on to generation after generation, for over 100 years.[...]"},{"Title":"The Dolls' House","review":"This is THE definitive book about dolls in a dolls house. Most of the books that come after it are pale imitations by comparison. The children and dolls are sympathetically drawn characters, each with unique personalities. The main thing you will remember about this book is how the characters interact with each other, try to understand each other and care deeply for each other. When the evil china beauty Marchpane threatens the dolls cozy existence, the one doll makes an extraordinary sacrifice to save their decent lives. I have reread this book many times and never tire of making the dolls acquaintance.

I read it when I was already in high school. It looked cute and I wondered what it was about. It was actually very twisted and disturbing. I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewer who wishes she could give it a zero. The murder scene stayed with me for a long time. If you are looking for sweet, interesting stories about \\"living\\" dolls, I would recommend THE BEST LOVED DOLL for a picture book and HITTY, HER FIRST HUNDRED YEARS for a read-aloud or chapter book."},{"Title":"The Dolls' House","review":"This book was purchased for grandchildren.

Mr. Plantaganet (one of the dolls) wanted a house so badly. One day, Great Aunt Laura gave Emily and Charlotte her old dollhouse. Emily and Charlotte entered Tottie (their servant doll) into The Doll Exhibit, where Tottie saw her old, mean roommate, Marchphane. They were talking about how Tottie lived in Marchphane's old house. Marchphane was mad and jealous that Tottie was living in her old house. Marchphane said she would get her house back. When Tottie got back to her house, Marchphane was there. Emily and Charlotte made The Plantaganet family Marchphane's servants to make Marchphane happy. However, Marchphane was still mean and rude to them. One day, Emily and Charlotte said, \\"Marchphane is too pretty to live in a doll house\\", so they sent her to a museum. The Plantaganet family was much happier after Marchphane was gone, and they all lived happily ever after.My favorite part was when Tottie and Marchphane ran into each other at The Doll Exhibit.

To the family's amazement, Emily and Charlotte become heirs to the dollhouse; however, they also inherit Marchpane, a porcelain and haughty doll. The family must overcome Marchpane's attempts to keep them out of the house, so they can live as they have always dreamed.The book appeals to young girls, rather than boys, because contains dolls (two of which are male) and dollhouses.

The US is the home of violent cartoons and other children's films that include agressive behaviour, so I expected readers from there to be a little tougher than they are!I read this book when I was seven, I read it with my daughter and have read it to my classes of 7 to 9 year olds. None of us have been traumatised by it. My pupils found the scene from the film Toy Story, where the creepy little boy 'kills' the toys, far more disturbing. I discussed the death scene with several groups over the years and, perhaps British children are less sentimental than their US cousins, but they always came up with stories they'd seen/heard on the News or parts of childrens' films that were at least as violent. As one bright 8 year-old said, 'Dying is the end of living and it happens to everybody. I'd rather think about it happening to a doll than to my Grandma.'Take out the death scene and there are other issues dealt with in this book to talk about with children. There is sharing and kindness. There's an introduction to the fact that the grown-ups, in the guise of Mr Plantagenet, are not always the most knowledgeable members of a family. There's the different attitudes to life and that being beautiful does not always mean being kind or pleasant. etc.On the negative side, this book is now a little dated and some areas need explanation to modern kids. Also, children do not depend as much on reading for entertainment as they did in the 1940s, so a modern young child may not read as well as in earleir generations, so, by the time the text is appropriate in terms of reading skill, the child may have developed a sense of being too old for doll stories.Tottie: The Story of a Dolls' House"},{"Title":"The Dolls' House","review":"I am a doll lover and love reading about dolls.

In fact, I'm researching this book online today because just now (in my early 30s) I suddenly had a flashback to the horrible scene of Birdie's burning. I read this book when I was in 4th or 5th grade and, like others have said, the sickening feeling it gave me-- not just the burning scene, but the ugliness of the whole moral universe of that book-- has stuck with me all these years. It's *not* that I believe in coddling and sheltering children from the harsh realities of life. I read plenty of books as a child that featured cruelty, heartlessness and violence, and *none* of them disturbed me as deeply as this one did.

There are better choices."},{"Title":"The Dolls' House","review":"I read this book when I was in grade school, and I have to say that it is pretty warped. This isn't just about children playing with toys that come to life when they are not around. Despite the impression you might have gotten from other reviews, this is NOT like \\"Toy Story.\\" The dolls have their own personalities, yes, but they are not all nice. Marchpane is not just spoiled and \\"delicate\\" she is evil. She is a sociopath who goads the little boy doll into literally playing with fire. The boy's mother, Birdie, sacrifices her own life to save her son. The book plays it up as some great moral maternal thing, but for all intents and purposes, Marchpane murders her. The death is gruesome, with Birdie burning alive into a pile of dust while her husband and son look on with horror and Marchpane remarks remorselessly that if Birdie had been made of more quality materials, like Marchpane herself, she would not have died. This book really affected me as a child, and not in a good way. I scarcely remember the rest of the plot, but Birdie's death is an image that will always stay with me.

The Input Hypothesis attempts to account for the processes in which languages are learned. According to Krashen, the only way in which learners can acquire language is through comprehensible input which is slightly above the learners level. One surprising point he makes is that formal learning never leads to acqusition. The primary method of getting comprehensible input is through listening or reading. In other words, it is not so important for learners to practice speaking to acquire language.While some of Krashen's claims are interesting, in the end his hypothesis doesn't hold water. Several of his terms aren't well defined and his theories prove impossible to experiment with. The studies which he claims support his hypothesis either don't really support it or only support it indirectly. A final complaint is that some of the assumptions he makes rests on faulty concepts. For example, he misapplies the concept of Chomsky's Language Acquisition Device (LAD).In the end, the input hypothesis proves to be less than promised. However, students of applied linguistics may find this book interesting as it illuminates some of the assumptions that we take for granted.

The author takes us to Axl Rose, whose megalomania and power-trips wreaked havoc to almost all of the people he dealt with professionally and personally. He fired roadies on a whim, and severely beat up fans, while his thug cronies restrained them, in several instances. Rose would start a show up to 3 hours late for the fans who paid their hard earned money to hear the music from the band they loved. I have seen GnR a couple of times, all over the world. I have always loved their music. It is the music that matters, but the stories on how the frontman perceived the world made me believe that some of GnR were just scumbags who got lucky. There is recent knews of Duff, Stradlin, Sorum and Saul gigging together, while Axl still owns the rights to the GnR name. Hopefully Guns will get together with some material from most of the original songwriters...If they can stand to put up with Roses' Histrionics and personality disorders. This was a good read, and well worth it, not just for the GnR fan but the modern rock fan in general....Come and get me Axl!!"},{"Title":"Over the Top: The True Story of Guns N' Roses (Classic rock reads)","review":"this book is good for fans who don't know much about the band trying to pick up information on them.

He won't disappoint the Guns n' Roses fan who seek for information about the once called &quot;most dangerous band in the world&quot;.Guns n' Roses became famous for the music, but also for the destroyed hotel rooms, the overdoses, the raw lyrics, and the chemical substance abuse that each and every member has gone through on the rock n' roll road. It's all in the pages of &quot;Over The Top - The True History of Guns n' Roses.In a very detailed book, Putterford manages to tell how the once small Hollywood &quot;glam-metal&quot; band became the biggest - and for some the best - band in the world. But he doesn't forget to tell the whole story, the true story, and also explain why a great band became a hoax.He goes deep on his research, and find a lot of information not available anywhere else. There are only two major problems in &quot;Over the Top...&quot;: the lack of fresh words from Axl, Slash and Duff and the small number of photos. But there's a lot of new information, given by Izzy and early Guns n' Roses collaborator Chris Weber, that MTV and Rolling Stone have never dreamed about.The effort that Putterford put to write the book paid off. Maybe you could say that only a handful of guys could write a better piece about Guns n' Roses: the band itself."},{"Title":"Over the Top: The True Story of Guns N' Roses (Classic rock reads)","review":"It was a complete but not very detailed overview of Guns N' Roses. It was a good introduction to the band but if you're a hardcore Gunner's fan it just wont satisfy your craving.

He describes people little-known in the North, but who are making enormous differences in shaping the future of Christianity. These include activists for democracy, female church leaders in Shanghai, prophet-founders of African \\"new religions\\", and preachers of the worldwide Pentacostalist movement. Many of these leaders have unique versions of the Christian message. Some are reactionaries for Christian theocracy. Many blend ancient beliefs with a passion for justice. In Brazil, Freston shows a rising evangelical movement coming up the middle between the old camps of conservatives and progressives. One preacher he cites calls for a \\"spiritual warfare\\" against evil spirits, for the sake of compassion toward the poor:\\"Demons must be expelled from social life in the name of the vote, justice, organization, and democracy, by the power of the name of Jesus. ... We desire Brazil free from spiritual oppression such as hunger, misery, unemployment, inflation, corruption, organized crime ... No demons can stand against our faith.\\" (p.39-40)As Freston shows, the political implications of these movements will be important.-author of Correcting Jesus"},{"Title":"In Search of Authenticity: Existentialism from Kierkegaard to Camus (Problems of Modern European Thought)","review":"Jacob GolombIn Search of Authenticity:From Kierkegaard to Camus(New York: Routledge, 1995) 219 pages(ISBN: 0-415-11946-4; hardcover)(ISBN: 0-415-11947-2; paperback)(Library of Congress call number: B105.A8G65 1995)Authenticity as found in the thought of:Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Sartre, & Camus.Academic rather than existential,but an important contribution to the very slim literature on Authenticity.If these thinkers' versions of Authenticity interest you,you will want to read this volume.If you want to read other books on this existential theme,search the Internet for: \\"Authenticity Bibliography\\".James Leonard Park, existential philosopher"},{"Title":"The Days of His Presence","review":"I found this book inspiring and full of hope from an author that hears God and shares Him with all who have ears to listen.The Days of His Presence"},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"From the first sentence, Twilight Of Fury grabs and takes you on a whirl-wind trip through yesteryear.

You rarely see that. I was totally fascinated with the precision of the detail. I had no idea about rationing in Europe. I have heard my parents and grandparents speak of what it was like here but never about how it was in Europe. The descriptions of the air combat (forgive my lack of sophistication) are really cool! They just draw you into the action. You almost feel like you are there. It was quite impressive.Watching the evolution of Tom from a womanizer to a sensitive and compassionate man was a refreshing change. What can I say? I like to see good triumph over evil. Also, I really enjoyed Molly's feisty nature. I liked that Mary was so sweet and yet strong enough to stand up to her overbearing mother.THis is a five star book"},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"I was so excited by the end of this book I felt I had to come here and write a review. I have so many questions about why Twilight Of Fury is not among the bestsellers and I can only guess that it is because it is a mainstream drama and not a thriller like The DaVinci Code. BUT, Twilight Of Fury is the kind of book that is a thriller but not like a mystery. It is a thriller about life and living it to the fullest.

But I started reading Twilight Of Fury and could not put it down. Not only have I read the whole novel but I have read almost everything on Mr. Matlock's website- I didn't care about the recipes though. Most of the sound files are good too. I think what I really appreciate is the way Mr. Matlock writes details. They're blended into the story without getting in the way. I like the way the story pulls you along and creates a mini-movie in your head as you read"},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"I finished a borrowed copy of Twilight Of Fury a few minutes ago and ordered my own just now for my personal library. After perusing the reviews here, I recommend considering them all before passing judgment. Yes, I highly recommend Twilight Of Fury."},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"One bogus review after another. Matlock's grammar is borderline while the story structure is marginal at best. And the British syntax is not even close, according to a British friend. She said Matlock's British verbage is akin to something out of Disney.As for the historical accuracy, the HISTORICAL NOVEL REVIEW insist they have never heard of of JOE MATLOCK, nor Hilliard & Harris, whom happens to be a PRINT ON DEMAND PUBLISHER (aka vanity press!)"},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"42 reviews? In your dreams, I'm NOT giving a credit card number as I, like so many here, have not written a review before. I think there is something to be said for Matlock in that respect. Still, there are many of us who are/were compelled to say something.So, okay, my review isn't going to win any awards but since I'm so emotionally wrapped up about this book I'm going to write it. I have read many, if not all, of the reviews here and I see a few people will roll their eyes if I say Matlock's is now on my favorite authors list. However, in my opinion, he's very underrated. This book is just simply amazing. Even with my own personal pile-to-read always getting higher, I have read this book several times.So, have you been slapped by a book- figuratively? I have been stunned and shocked but never slapped! Matlock does it twice in Chapter Nineteen. He slapped my girlfriend too. She cried. More than once. We both laughed too.First and foremost, Twilight Of Fury most definitely consists of an impressive and clear theme, which is an important characteristic of a good novel. Characters in this novel show an incredible range of emotion, and their characteristics depend on their surrounding environment. Nearly every action they make has a cause and the action itself influence future actions, whether their own or other people's. Call it predictable, I call it clearly written characters.If you choose to take a day off and sit with Twilight Of Fury, it will hijack you into another time and you will never look at people the same way again."},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"First off don't let another reviewer (2 or 3 below this review) fool you - this is not a book about jerk guys, okay so Tom starts off as a jerk but it's far deeper than that!Next, Joe Matlock has some of the best characterization I have read in awhile. Mr. Matlock does not waste any of his time on fluff. The author uses his pages wisely to develop realistic characters and plot. Mr. Matlock does a great job in weaving these characters into a very believable and real plot. There are only two things that I'm sad about, one that I didn't read this book sooner and that it ended. I really wanted it to continue for a few more chapters. It begs for a sequel!This is a life-changing read, BUT it is also entertaining and you find yourself engrossed into the wee hours of the morning. I'll be looking for more Matlock novels in the future."},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"I found it to be a nicely crafted book. I liked the book and can't think of anything better to read if you have a few spare hours to kill or simply relax with. After 3 readings (yes, I've read it three times) I couldn't find any real faults in the plot or development.I very rarely give fiction five stars- most are so watered down (probably for those who read one book a year) that it takes a little of the enjoyment for me but \\"Twilight Of Fury\\" is definitely NOT watered down.Matlock has written an EXTREMELY readable, if not POWERFUL, novel - in fact I finished the book in less than two days. He scores well with a nice mix of light humor, memorable and believable characters, action, and plot.A very exciting story and full of drama while a number of side stories keeps you guessing at what's coming next. And there was a twist at the end that I found especially interesting, but still very satisfying."},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"What a sexist pig Tom is! Is this Matlock's idea of a man? Meek women and macho men, drinking and more. I'll give it three stars only because it is reputed by the Historical Novel Review to be \\"well-researched\\" and the historical passages are interesting. Matlock's writing is somewhat above average but it is regretful that he could not direct himself to write something more meaningful and contributary to society."},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"What if journalist/producer/director Sam Fuller (Park Row, Fixed Bayonets, Steel Helmets and BIG RED ONE) met up with Author John Grisham? You would have Joe Matlock and his novel TWILIGHT OF FURY, which presents a scandalous truth underlying war and those who struggle to survive this horror.I understand at a book signing of Matlock's that he interviewed many of those who lived at that time and set their stories with his novel. It is difficult to surpass that!If you desire to take in a World War II novel that portrays the unvarnished truth of surviving war then this is the story for you."},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"And what a wonderful trip into history this story is. Joe Matlock simply knows how to write a great novel and even though this book is squeezed down in print for the price, but as far as I'm concerned, he could have doubled it. What was unique about Twilight Of Fury was that the depth of love story(s?) was/were equal to the detail of the setting. I've never been to Europe, but after Twilight Of Fury, I really want to go. I could feel the struggle of those living life to fullest while they could. Mr. Matlock sucks you right into each and every scene.As for the \\"lovers,\\" Molly had fewer flaws than some of her other female characters but she's a strong, independent woman who can truly take men or leave them. It seemed that Molly probaly pitied Tom. He certainly was a pitiable soul.And if there were two things that dropped this review from a 5 to a 4 star, it is based on two things: (1) I still felt sorry for Molly when the book regrettably ended and (2)as a few other have commented, the love affairs grew a little too quickly, but perhaps that's situation with wartime relationships.Will I invest in another Joe Matlock book? You better believe it, pal!"},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"I enjoyed reading Twilight Of Fury since I was a B24 navigator with the 15th Air Force in Italy."},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"When I finished reading this book, I thought: \\"Well, that was one hell of a book!\\" Fabulous. \\"Twilight of Fury\\" rang so true that it seemed like a non-fiction book. All the references to the WW II period added credibility and make the reader wonder if even the love interests are based on true stories. The principal characters and all the supporting characters are well developed and believable.This is a great book. The two appendixes and the availability of the Web site are wonderful and add immeasurably to the reader's enjoyment. This is the best fiction book based on history that I've ever read. The book rings true, so true that I kept looking for an index to look things up!Matlock respects the reader by doing his homework and research. His writing style is outstanding. You'll love the little touches that took this reader back to this era. The characters are totally believable. \\"Twilight of Fury\\" is a thoughtful and fun book to read. Joe Matlock has hit a homerun. Let's hope he follows this book with more of the same!"},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"I met Mr. Matlock at a recent signing and he convinced me that Twilight Of Fury was a worthy read. He was not wrong! I just finished Twilight Of Fury and it was awesome. I have been away from reading for sometime and this I have to say, if the broad scope of Mr. Matlock's book does not draw you into his book, his lucid writing will."},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"Like chocolates on a shelf, Twilight Of Fury tempts you to take in more. I need to say more than 'Don't miss this story,' but it's hard say anything without giving away something important!Appropriately divided into four parts, the novel's Book One begins with two separate stories. You can see the characters clearly and feel the atmosphere as the stage is set. You find yourself being towed gently by the story as it weaves its way into your heart. It's more than boy meets girl. It's another world, and another time.By Book Two- you are gripped with anticipation knowing the two will meet, but how will they react? Where will it go? Will they survive? How much more can a person take?Book Three will shock you, but you are mired too deep to get away now. The twists and turns come abruptly with a surprise. This could be anyone's life!Book Four will give you the redemption you will seek by the tales end..."},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"I was very surprised. The cover art is disceptive. A university friend loaned me her copy and said it was set during the World War II, was about the war, yet not a WAR story. I think better books are always when they have human dynamics regardless what their subject matter.The novel chronicals a person's trial and tribulation in war's fury's. The protagonist evolves from pettiness after suffering functional insanity and coming to grips with terrible disfigurement. By conclusion we learn the value of a person lies within the depths of the heart and the character of their soul."},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"A couple of weeks ago Twilight Of Fury was among a stack of minor 'galleys' made available to my S-II journalism class assignment, so I grabbed a few and checked out the Amazon reader reviews.A couple of reviews challenged the worthiness of Twilight Of Fury on a professional level (one from an alleged English professor and the other of a book review editor- both are now missing) but readers raved its merits and I decided to accept Twilight Of Fury as my assignment. Now I understand why the 'professional' reviews were deleted.I finished my class 'review' a minute earlier and I am still completely awed by this story. Matlock has done an excellent job in bringing World War II Europe to life. First, Matlock has written not a single one-dimensional character, and has created some of the strongest characters I have read into print: not just Tom, Molly, and Mary, but other minor characters like the dignified Englishman, Graham Higgins, or the motherly but slightly nosey Scot/Irish woman, Mrs. Buchanan. You will see by the middle of Book (part) Two that a pattern of personal evolution is emerging (that is all I'll say here) making the novel excellent drama. Matlock retains his structure while not allowing the plot threads to get too formulaic and boring. His narrative is strong, compelling and active thus creating thrilling action sequences of aerial combat. The period dialogue is excellent and clearly yesteryear, (WWII American and British) though Matlock stumbles once or twice.Matlock published with Hilliard and Harris- a new POD press- and like the 'English professor' and the 'book review editor,' I am guilty of judging authors by their publishers, until I recalled an essay by Maurice Sendac in which he described how hard it is to be published.There are a few production errors and the cover-art is a tasteful but hastily conjured computer creation. Also, enhanced editing would have put Twilight Of Fury over the top as I have the distinct feeling that the manuscript was shortened, but it is nothing that takes away from the story other than a couple of fast-forwards. I think the novel deserves better but it is good for us all that Matlock was able to publish Twilight Of Fury by any means possible.Sadly, publishing prejudices will still prevent this novel from receiving the literary recognition it deserves."},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"Well! Now I must say something. I can't believe that critics get paid to write such drivel like below. I guess since literary critics are not common men or women maybe they are not equipped to absorb and enjoy an endearing story like Twilight Of Fury, or maybe they just have to say mean things to justify being a CRITIC. Contrary to Mr. Bennett I can't find anything to say except this story is AWESOME! There are no words to describe how I felt when I finished this book except that I told all my friends they HAD to read it. It is kind of funny in places, a few parts will shock you, some parts are tear-jerkers and the airplane flying and fighting are easy to understand. In particular, one of the fighting parts I certainly didn't like because of the detail of an act, but my beau thought it was okay because it was exceedingly correct and Chet happens to be a history major. Also I didn't like what happened to the spy, Kevin, or the nurse, Molly. But I guess like it says on the blurb 'life isn't fair.' The ending was perfect and couldn't end any other way. I haven't stopped thinking about the story so I guess I'll read it again to get it out of my mind."},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"Okay, so Mr. Matlock won't win any awards from his literary peers- as the english professor wants to stress- but Twilight Of Fury is written for a mainstream audience. As an history major from the USAF Academy and a active duty Blue Suit, I consider Twilight Of Fury is a winner. Got that, professor?"},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"I first \\"met\\" Joe Matlock when we both belonged to a graphics webring.Over the years, our online friendship has grown through our mutual love of writing.

Molly becomes Tom's first true love, a reason to fight his way home after every mission and to escape the Nazis after he is shot down over Belgium.But life is not fair and surviving an evil war is only half the conflict. . .Twilight Of Fury is a story of how relationships and terrible events change the lives of people who struggle to survive them. Where compassion, understanding and love must take a stand against hate, treachery and bitterness and discover that honor and sacrifice are the true saving graces of humanity."},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"I took the advice of one reviewer here and read all the reviews. Twilight Of Fury is getting mostly good reviews. There are a couple of bad reviews, however, and I'd like to address some of the criticisms during my review of the book.I firmly believe that the most of the negativity directed at this novel stems from the POD (print on demand) issue. The print is too small, the price is too much (except for Amazon) and buying the novel in a bricks & mortar store is near impossible.Now, there has never been a bigger fan of historical novels than me but you have to give the devil his due: the Historical Novel Review gave Twilight Of Fury a big slap on the back for a job well done! I agree wholeheartedly. However, one bone of contention with a critic in which she states the book is politically incorrect, but I ask \`Was World War II politically correct toward women?' Ask any WASP her opinion.Twilight Of Fury is exactly what the Historical Novel Review claims: a riveting page-turner. The characters are very believable and real. All the historical references of the period are accurate and credible. Matlock's writing style is outstanding.So I conclude with this is the best fiction book based on history that I've ever read!"},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"I usually dump a book by Chapter Three if it's not good. Not the problem here! It hits ground running and never stops.This is my first Joe Matlock book, loaned to me with a couple of others. I expected something war-like with blatant inaccuracies, especially after perusing the cover- an American WWII bomber blasting St. Paul's Cathedral in London! But I guess it's wise to not pay too much attention to the artsy covers companies put on books to sell them.This book may not have been the typical 'war-book' I expected it to be, but it sure has been an exceptional pleasure to spend my spare time with. Great characters, believable dialogue, engaging situations, humor, even memorable social interaction.It is fast-paced read and very engaging. I would recommend it for those in-between times when you're taking a break from the meaty, heavy literature or heavy non-fiction history.Matlock's website is a god-send as well. Loaded with history, such as period music, radio shows and recipes! A must see."},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"I read mostly mysteries and thrillers. Dramas, particularly historical mainstream, tend to be too slow, artsy and full dull information and talk. Twilight Of Fury surprised me. Matlock wasted little on useless data and the story proved to be exciting if not, at times, a thriller. It has love interest but not romance in the strictest sense. It has military conflict but it's not a war story. It has drama but it's several notches above social ho-hum. The aerial combat is exciting and I loathe manly 'motor' books. Last part of the book was wonderfully thought out. Several men I know need to read this book; my boyfriend is one of them! Matlock's website was a little boring for my taste since I don't care about history."},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It had everything that I love in a book - action, drama, and a little bit of romance. I will definitely buy his next book. I had the pleasure of meeting Joe Matlock in Cozumel and really enjoyed speaking with him about the history of WWII."},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"This book was recommended to me while I was at the video store. Being a history buff and avid reader I was intrigued and immediately bought the book. The clarity and attention to the smallest details of living during those difficult times was very engaging. I wasn't just reading the story, I could picture it and feel it. The fear and urgency of life in England at that time became very real. At first I couldn't believe that a love story could move so fast but given the way Mr. Matlock brought the circumstances of war into focus it became very believable that many people of that time probably fell in love just that way. The only thing that threw me off was the jump in time between the books. I felt like I might have missed something but was very pleased to see it all came together. When I finished I was disappointed that there wasn't more. I also enjoyed the information in the appendix. Again, the detail was very helpful and enlightening. I look forward to reading any future novels by Mr. Matlock. Maybe I'll go back to the video store to get more recommendations!"},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"I won't even mention any of the plot points here because I don't want to ruin even a part of a great story for anyone.

I just couldn't get away from it for more than a few of my waking hours. Why? Well, I'm glad you asked. First of all, the most pleasantly surprising thing about the book is its realism. I just loved their characters and their actions.Secondly, the book won me over in how the characters are portrayed. I felt I really knew them.

Twilight Of Fury makes you see and understand why guys and girls have different perspectives."},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"Matlock tells a great story. Twilight Of Fury is so interesting, you can't stop turning pages. From page one, you'll find yourself totally engrossed. Believe me, you can read 200 pages in one sitting. I started at four in the afternoon and didn't stop until I finished at four-thirty the next morning. Twilight Of Fury is an incredible book there will always be a place for it on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"The cover has little to do with the story. It is NOT a war book! I regret that I cannot give better particulars on this book. There is a great deal of reality to the story. I like good literature as much as the next person and the small details that make this story so believable are excellent. On the other hand if there were two things that could drop this review from a 5 to a 4 star, it is based on two things: I still felt sorry for Molly when the book regrettably ended and both love affairs grew a little too quickly. Will I invest in another Joe Matlock book? You better believe it!"},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"Once I settled into the character development I became curious as to what the outcome would be, especially after Book Two, which blew me away! The rising action and climax are great, as well as the character description, and that makes for a pretty good read. The narrative about combat flying is concise, especially for me, who doesn't know anything about airplanes. Joe Matlock does not overstate excessive detail and explains what he needs to succinctly.Twilight Of Fury focuses on different points of view in a chronicled account set during World War II. Even the Nazis and their associates have a voice in this novel. It is a well-written book, so that once you start it you don't put it down till you finish. (At least, that's what happened to me. I read it in a weekend and finished the second read today.) At first I didn't like the ending, then I read it a second time and I've changed my mind. I realize that I was shocked by what happens at the end of Book Two and came to grips with it during the second reading.So how can I give an overview without giving away the story... Okay, Tom is a typical boy and I identify easily with Molly. By typical male he has one thing at the front of his mind and we girls know what that is. It's easy to understand why though. Everyday for Tom is a fight to the death. On the other hand, Molly is a stiff British nurse of that time. You can see the clash coming when they meet, but after a time a mutual respect develops and a relationship blossoms. I can't say any more without giving away the story. There are three sample chapters and research on Joe Matlock's website. The research is extraordinary and you can lose yourself in there for hours."},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"Geez, I don't know why I should bother reviewing a book that has 27 other reviews. Not like anyone will find my review to be anything more than some positive feedback, unlike the \\"English Professor.' So I guess I'll write this assuming I'm gathering a small loyal following of review readers.This is another great book. I was going to give it 4 stars but man, Book Four of the novel ends up being a big payoff.This book is another example of good story-telling where the journey is as much fun as the destination. Joe Matlock sucks you in Book One and wallops you in the Epilogue. What a ride! A must read, especially if you enjoy action novels with strong human interest themes."},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"The review below, I am not sure what that English professor's problem is but I think Twilight Of Fury is a very good tale and a fast moving one. I dont hide behind titles with no name. I met Joe Matlock at a signing this past weekend and he seems like a fine fella too. I also checked him out with the Historical Novel Society and their praising review about Twilight Of Fury is bona fide."},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"The number of pages is deceptive because the font size is small, but I enjoy reading so this is a good thing. There is a plethora of history info far removed from today. Still, someone who is not a history buff will enjoy Twilight Of Fury. It is a good drama alternating with action/adventure to draw in the reader. It would even make a good movie."},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"It's not an action story. It's a drama with action that works for the facet of the story. The action is for an emotional reasons ... absolutely brilliant assembly of pacing and structure!"},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"Excellent descriptive reviews have been given below so I'll write this as an opinion.This novel shifts gears like a sports car moving through varied driving situations. Life is fluid dynamics and Twilight Of Fury lives those dynamics. Matlock does not tell a story, he helps you live it.Five stars is something I'd give to a classic, like A Christmas Carol, and while Twilight Of Fury is probably a contemporary classic worthy of five stars, I just can't do that."},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"This novel defies categorisation. Is it a war story with a romantic subplot, or an historical romance set before a backdrop of World War Two? It is a story of a USAAF man and two civilian women whose lives are changed by each other and by extraordinary circumstance.The balance between fighter pilot's tale and romance is uneasy in places. Sometimes the book reads like gung-ho pulp war fiction, at other times as a wise cautionary tale. There are some elegant, moving passages too. Matlock's attention to period detail is extraordinarily skilful, resulting in a rich evocation of life in wartime Britain. He is most surefooted on matters military, where his authenticity rivals that of Tom Clancy.Matlock could be criticised for having too many characters with too little to do, though considering the attrition rate of a front-line squadron and a bombed populace, a rapid cast turnover may be necessary. Other minor characters are sharpely drawn and credible. There is a repetition in the nature of some of these which at first irks, but may be intentional, in order to indicate a Priestleyesque second chance at happiness for the protagonist.Overall: a decent and ultimately uplifting novel whose theme is brutal scarring within and without by violence and fear, but also the redemptive power of love."},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"This is a suprising book. It's actually quite a pleasure to read. In fact, I found the characters in this book to be more substantial and memorable than usual. A great read!"},{"Title":"Twilight of Fury","review":"Twilight of Fury is a brilliant mainstream drama of personal evolution, set during the Second World War. Twilight Of Fury is required reading for all my classes.A reluctant fighter pilot, Tom MacMillan is plunged into the eye of the tempest, despite his self-admitted cowardice. While recuperating from a wound, this vain, self-indulgent womanizer falls beneath the spell of his severely dutiful, yet lovely, nurse. For a few months he experiences what it is to love a woman selflessly and fully, only to have her torn from his life by the violence of war. He descends into a hellish existence. Though he inflicts more damage on the enemy than any ten men he grows more and more dysfunctional in his dealings with ordinary people. To prevent his possibly disastrous return to civilian life, the top brass arrange to have Tom shot down by a fellow pilot. He does not die, however. Horribly scarred, he is sent to a veterans' hospital in Missouri, where a young volunteer, Mary Schuster, accidentally becomes his caretaker. The work of drawing Tom back into normal life, and into an emotional and spiritual state capable of giving love again, forms the conclusion of the novel, illustrating the quelling of war's fury and the transformation of the twilight into the daylight of a healed and whole man's life."},{"Title":"Scientific facts in the Bible","review":"This book says that evolution cannot be proved or tested, therefore it can't be true. However, it does not state proof for creationism, therefore creationism cannot be scientific. The written word of someone can't be counted as proof. He clearly states that science requires proof, therefore the Bible needs scientific proof if he is to continue with his title of \\"Scientific Facts in the Bible\\". The book blindly believes in the Bible like it were a book meant to be literal. Scholars and historians agree that the book was written by four different groups. For more into this, watch \\"The Bible's Buried Secrets,\\" a video by PBS.The author redundantly says that evolution cannot be true because it is absurd. He has a distorted and perhaps oversimplified view of evolution and science in general. He thinks humans were formed from \\"a mess of slimy goo.\\" This, and many similar quotes, show his complete ignorance of biology.In the sections about the solar system, the universe, earth, and geological formations, he takes quotes from the Bible out of context and uses it as \\"proof\\" that people in the Bible knew this before the respective scientist that made planetary and stellar discoveries. For example, he claims that since Job said \\"height of the stars, how high they are\\" in Job 22:12, it means that the starts are far and this is further proven by the creation of the telescope. Really, genius?The section on medicine claims how Moses knew of medical practices of today. However, he clearly contradicts himself when he says he obtained this information from the Egyptians. This means that it didn't really come from the Christian god after all. He claims that the cleansing rituals in Leviticus are to be used for medicine. However, these are nothing but ceremonial practices, not medicinal procedures. He took the quotes out of context again.Bob Boyd takes nearly all the Bible verses out of context and uses it to \\"prove\\" that science mimicked the Bible. In reality, it is the Bible that is adapting to science so it does not look archaic in front of it. Most of his proofs consist of his opinions on the subject. He also favors myths of other cultures when it favors his exaggeration of the Bible. He also uses exclamation points at the end of many paragraphs, as if an exclamatory statement settles the matter.However, this was a funny read. If you're looking for a comic book that shows ignorance of some religious fanatics, namely Christian, this is the book for you. Einstein was right, human stupidity truly is infinite."},{"Title":"Living Alphabet","review":"I loved this book. It's beautiful. So refreshing for children to see the alphabet presented with such life and beauty. My 3 year old wanted to learn the alphabet. Although Waldorf education, which we integrate into our lives, doesn't recommend learning it this early, I knew I had to start him somewhere...lest he begin to use the free alphabet cards he found in a magazine that came to us in the mail (\\"free\\" cards which featured a minivan add on the other side)!! I digress....the one downer for this book...the letter *I* features a Native American as an \\"Indian\\", and it's the primary focus of the page. There are also Inuits on this page. Why couldn't they be the focus?? My son is confused about people from India and Native Americans (\\"Indians\\") anyhow. And to top it off...this is also, in my opinion, the only truly UGLY illustration in the whole book. The \\"Indian\\" is sulking, standing stiff as a board....Please, if this page could be fixed, I think it's a near perfect book. It is worth buying, if you can overlook the \\"Indian\\"....and your children will learn from it (and you may too)."},{"Title":"Living Alphabet","review":"We used this book as a fun time for our family. We look at the pictures and told stories or just pointed different images (which was fun for my 18 months old) we made the sounds each picture start with, before the end of the month my five years old daughter learned (not memorised) her alphabet. More important she can tell stories about each letter to her baby sister and we still use the book as a family story book. I would highly recomend it."},{"Title":"Living Alphabet","review":"The most inspiring alphabet book. Waldorf style learning method. Could be an example for classroom teaching, or home schooling, or simply complement what the child is seeing in school."},{"Title":"Southwest Indian Design Stained Glass Coloring Book (Dover Design Stained Glass Coloring Book)","review":"As a stained glass artist, I'm always looking for new ideas. The Tiffany style, curvy Art-Nouveau is beautiful, of course, but it's just been _done_ to death. Here, the reader is shown the beauty of simple geometric forms and given a whole new world of stained glass design to explore and play with. These designs are reminiscent of Frank Lloyd Wright's or Mr. MacIntosh. I had never consciously drawn a relationship between these two revolutionary artists and the native art of America before seeing this book. This is a great idea book for an artist looking for new designs and new ways to play with shape and color."},{"Title":"Carly Patterson: Olympic Idol","review":"This book is basicly a compliation of all the articles that have been written about Carly Patterson up to the 2004 American Cup.As a long time gymnastics fan, I found this book included no information that I had not already heard.That being said...it is a good book, dispite the fact that it was written before the Olympics. It includes some fine photos, and for people who like to collect Carly memorbilia, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Carly Patterson: Olympic Idol","review":"As a Carly Patterson fan, I picked up this book at the library when I was bored and finished it in about 25 minutes. It doesn't, as other reviewers mention, go up to the 2004 Athens Olympics- it goes up to the 2004 American Cup.Also included are some information about Carly's early life, start in gymnastics, earlier meets, etc. Most of the meet information was compiled from articles already written about Carly.It also has some photos, but not that many; if you're looking for a lot of pictures, this book probably wouldn't satisfy you. The few photos included, however, are really good.So, overall, if you haven't heard much about Carly and are looking for a brief read to tell you more, than go ahead and read this book. If you already know enough about her, you probably won't find any new information in here."},{"Title":"Carly Patterson: Olympic Idol","review":"Unless you know next to nothing about gymnastics or are under the age of 10, don't waste your time on this book - it was too simplistic for those of us who have followed the sport for 30 years."},{"Title":"Carly Patterson: Olympic Idol","review":"I have not read this book yet, but I just want to let you all know that this book was listed and published before the 2004 Olympic Games even took place! So it was just a guess that Carly would win/do well at the Olympics and become an \\"idol,\\" and pure luck for this author and the publisher that she actually did! Or maybe the author is psychic or something (if you believe in that kind of thing). I wonder what would have happened if Carly did really badly at the Olympics (glad she didn't). Carly is very talented, but you can't determine in advance who will really win, because anything can happen in a sport like gymnastics; you can predict, but it might not come true.Since it was created before the Olympics took place, this book most likely won't include information about what took place during the Olympics competition, and after Carly won (the benefits and rewards of being an Olympic Champion, future plans, etc). Since it was released in June, it also may possibly not have the information from Olympic Trials and Nationals or the actual selection of the team, since those competitions took place around the time of this book's release.I don't really have a rating for this book, but amazon.com makes you give a rating, so I just chose one star because this book was released before the competition took place. That really surprised me and other fellow gymnastics fans. I'll have to be on the lookout for the book in a store or something to see about its contents.So if you want information about the Olympics, and just before and after it, you might want to get another book that was actually published AFTER the Olympics, or wait to see if this book will be updated sometime soon."},{"Title":"Mathematics and the imagination","review":"Wonderful Service! Your customer service is very much appreciated ... from the description of the condition to the packaging of the product ... all very top shelf!"},{"Title":"Mathematics and the imagination","review":"My only complaint is its lack of rigor and the fact that it is getting rather out-of-date; besides that, this is the sort of book that everyone interested in math should read while they're in high school."},{"Title":"Mathematics and the imagination","review":"Book given to Grandson, a junior in high school who has a passion for Mathematics and how it can be applied.

However, the quality of the writing renders those defects to near irrelevancy. Popular descriptions of mathematics are differentiated by the quality of the writing rather than the distinctiveness of the mathematics, and this one shines.I like this book, starting with the title. It takes an enormous amount of imagination to do mathematics, something unappreciated by the public. It is easy to understand the use of linear segments to approximate the length of a curve. However, it requires an enormous leap of abstraction to believe that if they are made of zero length and then summed up, the result is the true length. Calculus students dutifully record and apply this, but in most cases don't appreciate the significance of the idea. In nearly all cases of major mathematical advancement, a fundamental change in thought processes was necessary. Those changes require imagination and the advances explained in this book are well documented and described.Mathematicians are containers of some of the greatest concentrations of imagination that humans possess. Their leaps of abstraction often include descriptions of objects that cannot be visualized. Kasner and Newman capture this essential ingredient, serving it up in palatable portions."},{"Title":"Mathematics and the imagination","review":"Having had this book around the house for ages, I picked it up and to my surprise within a few minutes really understood (not just enough to use, but actually understood) what logarithms really are, where they come from. The chapter on e, pi, and i is another great one to get the story behind the story, as it were. For me the book could better have continued in this vein of explaining concepts we've seen before but never really grasped intuitively, and perhaps because I'm not terribly interested in mathematical games I found that segment less fun. But in fairness, they've done a good job getting away from textbook math and into some interesting themes. I don't know if it's all still valid, as it is so old--references to Fermat's last theorem are at least outdated!"},{"Title":"Mathematics and the imagination","review":"My school teacher gave me this book to read when I was 13 years old, based on the interest I showed in Mathematics that went beyond the curriculum at school. In many ways it was way beyond my comprehension at the time, but little did I know that it would have such a lasting effect on me. Reading about concepts of infinity, that you could only describe to a fellow teenager as &quot;different sizes of infinity&quot;, I realized that there really is a philosophy of mathematics that transcends all other subjects and that there is also an art to working with the subject. I can't recommend this book enough, and I never did give it back to my teacher!"},{"Title":"Mathematics and the imagination","review":"This book came to me by chance.Instantly got my attention.It is written in such a way,that makes interesant to travel through different chapters.In each one you have the mathematical theme mixed with stories , mathematicians histories and puzzles.You learn about people with the greatest imagination.Their personality and a lot of other things,that make you enjoy the reading,no matter if you love mathematics or you have hated it all the time.I've enjoyed specially the chapter about Mathematical Analysis,with the story about rivalry between the egocentric Newton and the humble Leibnitz. This book is the opportunity to learn that mathematics are not the boring thing we have learned at school."},{"Title":"Mathematics and the imagination","review":"This book is for very few as it is not for the following group of readers:a) only peripherally interested in math;b) interested in math but wanting to learn more in a concise manner and readily bored with exhaustive math history and early 20th century verbosity;c) mathematicians who already know that stuff;d) interested in math but requiring well organized and structured material.If you do not belong to any of the above four groups of readers, you probably will like this book. You may even love it. To improve the probability you will like it you should not read chapters sequentially. This will bore you. Instead jump in directly to the mathematics domains you are familiar with and you like best. For instance, chapter VII covers Probability and chapter IX covers Calculus. If you like Geometry, you are in luck as the authors dedicate two chapters to it (IV and VIII).The chapter on calculus covers a lot of grounds including not only derivatives but also definite and indefinite integrals, calculus and the laws of motions, and trigonometry. Your head may spin after this broad and deep excursion into calculus. And, this may be one of the authors' most successful chapters.The authors divulge a lot of fascinating information even though the latter is not always easily extractable. This includes very intuitive explanations of the discovery and calculations of Pi, e, i, and logarithms. They explain how mathematicians leveraged those discoveries. The numbers Pi and e have so many applications that they suggest our civilization in terms of mathematical understanding and its practical application would be truly primitive if not for them (Pi, e). Similarly, they show how the invention of logarithm essentially powered math and physics forward by rendering complicated calculations simple (replacing exponents by multiplication, multiplication by addition, etc...). They also make fascinating connections between algebra (equations) and geometry (visual representations of the same equations).Their narrative on large numbers is pretty interesting. It taught me that even though Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page are very successful billionaire geniuses, they apparently do not know how to spell math terms. Indeed, Google refers to a very large number consisting of 1 followed by 100 zeros. But, it is spelled Googol! At least, Brin and Page got Googleplex right when naming the company headquarter (Googleplex equals 1 followed by a Googol of zeros). Those numbers are gigantic as The Harper Collins dictionary of Mathematics discloses there is only 10 to the 85th power number of atoms in the universe (less than a Googol that is 10 to the 100th power and obviously a lot less than a Googleplex).In the appendix of the calculus chapter, the authors open the door on upcoming mathematical developments. Indeed, they introduce Pathological Curves which will become a foundation for Mandelbrot's Fractal Geometry as explained inThe Fractal Geometry of Nature. In turn, the latter will leverage this concept to develop a new theory of finance inThe (MIS)Behaviour of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin, and Reward. And, Taleb will turn the same concept into a bestseller inThe Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable. In the same appendix, the authors also introduce the Criscross Curve. Stephen Wolfram will leverage this concept and develop cellular automata as explained inA New Kind of Science. As you can see, ultimately everything is related.However, if you want to learn math basics in a more effective and efficient manner, I recommend instead the series:Forgotten Statistics: A Refresher Course with Applications to Economics and Business,Forgotten AlgebraandForgotten Calculus. Those will give you a pretty good foundation on which to build upon. If you want to deepen your knowledge of statistics I also recommend the excellentIntuitive Biostatistics."},{"Title":"Mathematics and the imagination","review":"My Granddad was a great engineer, and loved puzzles and games.

It's very late in Alleyn's career because he and his renowned artist wife, Agatha Troy, have a grown son, Ricky, who has traveled to an artist's retreat of sorts to write.Ricky mixes with the locals which include a family of equestrians. The daughter, a concupiscent gal of local popularity with all the young men, is killed in a horse-riding episode. Ricky suspects that her death may not have been an accident based upon feedback from local residents.Ricky also gets involved with a sarcastic aspiring young artist who appears to be involved in the drug trade. Subsequent to Rickey being involved in a near drowning, Alleyn and Fox show up to look into the drug allegations and the possible murder of the girl... then Rickey goes missing!The scenario here is not the most believable cozy murder that Marsh ever wrote. Still I enjoyed it and can recommend it to fans."},{"Title":"Last Ditch: Library Edition","review":"This is one of the very latest Marsh books, written in 1977. (43 years after her first book!)The story centers around Ricky Alleyn, the son of Roderick and Agatha Troy. In this book, he is twenty-one and striking out on his own for the very first time. Despite the best effort of both parents to keep him away from the world of crime, Ricky gets drawn into a local murder. Although Roderick is eventually sent to help his son out, Ricky remains at the center of the piece.I actually did not mind Ricky as the central character. He has some interesting tensions and I could have seen him go on in later works to follow in his father's footsteps despite the wishes of his parents. That said, these tensions are not well developed in Last Ditch and Ricky remains betwixt and between with Roderick still shouldering most of the responsibility for the crime.It would also have been interesting to see an aging Roderick less able to cope with the modern world of drugs and promiscuity. But Alleyn seems surprisingly unchanged, despite having a 21 year old son. He adjusts to the junkies and smuggling with ease.Unfortunately, the world of drugs and junkies described here fails to ring true. It reads like second-hand stereotype rather than something from reality.All this makes it sound like a bad book. It is not. Particularly for Marsh fans, there are still those moments of brilliance that characterize so much of her work. Julia Pharamond is a brilliant character, for instance. Her dizzy complexity and cold kindness makes her a classic Marsh character. I would not begin here if you haven't read any other Marsh, but if you are already a fan I would not be afraid to pick it up either."},{"Title":"Last Ditch: Library Edition","review":"I'm a big fan of cozy mysteries and I picked this novel up because I thought that it would be similar to Agatha Christie's work. I'm in my mid-40's now, but I can remember my mom reading Ngaio Marsh novels as a kid in the '70's. This is the 1st Marsh novel I've ever read and, based on what others have stated, perhaps it shouldn't have been. The characters are very simple and 2-dimensional. Inspector Alleyn and his wife Troy are like Ozzie & Harriet (Nelson). Their son, Ricky, is like...well Ricky Nelson. The characters are so predictable that there is never any mystery as to what they're up to (drug smuggling). I kept waiting for plot twists and turns that never came.

As a reader I felt gypped that he wasn't found out due to clever sleuthing."},{"Title":"Last Ditch: Library Edition","review":"I am an avid Marsh reader. I truly think she's one of the all-time greats. Her characters are delicately and consistently portrayed. Roderick Alleyn, his wife Troy, his sidekick Inspector Fox---sublime. I really love her books because each one stands alone as a sort of mini-novel: a member of the mystery genre, but with creative detail and insights that you're not usually going to find outside serious novels.Having said that: this book sucks. Ricky Alleyn is one of the most annoying and deadly stupid characters ever depicted anywhere. And since the book revolves around him, it's hard to skim the bits he's in.Skip this one and read Overture to Death instead."},{"Title":"Last Ditch: Library Edition","review":"Pretty good book.Marsh usually starts us off with characters who are not Alleyn, but here we have his son Ricky, on a writing holiday. As Alleyn's progeny, Ricky is rather tiresome in his endlessly correct behavior. He falls for a local married woman several years his senior. Meanwhile, there's a murder!I like how the author is ambitious in changing scenery between books, and here she gives us a coastal village with a French-speaking populace.She is fairly successful with the villains in this novel, but there are not too many surprises. I don't read Marsh for the \\"denouement\\" - I read for the story itself and her amazing writing and dialogue."},{"Title":"Last Ditch: Library Edition","review":"As of this date, the previous (three) reviews of the book seem to have been for one of the printed copies, not the audio copy which I heard. I have not read the book and cannot comment on how it reads. As an audio book, excising the technical problems I had, which have nothing to do with the reader (Nadia May, one of the names taken for audio work by British actress and TV personality,Nadia Sawalha), was a good mystery with an interesting cast of characters, given distinct voices and considerable appeal by the Reader. The details of the action have already been spelled out by Amazon and previous reviewers, but their reception to the book's content is difficult for me to reconcile with what I heard. To what extent this is a personal matter not a difference between reading a text and hearing a text performed, even though word for word a duplication of the text, I cannot say. There is probably research on this intriguing problem in the literature but I have no inclination to seek it out. Suffice it to say, that my recommendation, that it will probably be enjoyed by any Marsh fan and most detective story readers, is based on the audio edition alone.I refrain from comment on various points made by reviews of the \\"reading\\" group except to suggest that placing the work of Dame Ngaio in the recently devised \\"cozy\\" category doesn't fit in with my conception of \\"cozy\\" (many series within which group I enjoy) or my conception of Marsh's books."},{"Title":"Sonatas, Vol. 1: Nos. 1-15 (Urtext Edition, for Piano)","review":"In a snobby music world, where editions like Durand and Henle are too quickly deemed top dog, it's very nice to be able to find an edition like this one for so cheap. It's the urtext, so one has a lot more confidence in this edition than say, the Schirmer edition. (NEVER buy a Beethoven Schirmer if you ever want to play REAL Beethoven!)Beethoven is always a joy, and the top sonata in this volume is the Pastorale, of course! Get volume 2 if you want to enjoy op. 78 (a favorite) and the Waldstein."},{"Title":"Sonatas, Vol. 1: Nos. 1-15 (Urtext Edition, for Piano)","review":"I ordered both this and volume II and ended up returning both. The printing was poor and difficult to read--the worst I have seen in any edition of printed music. The music was skewed on the page and parts looked distorted. The paper looked cheap too. Urtext aside, even my Schirmer edition is better, in terms of readability. I not only would never buy these again, I would think twice about buying any Kalmus edition.For about $50 I bought the Henle edition, which is just beautiful and a pleasure to read.

This is a lifetime investment so it doesn't pay to go cheap."},{"Title":"Sonatas, Vol. 1: Nos. 1-15 (Urtext Edition, for Piano)","review":"This Kalmus-Alfred score is reprinted from the \\"Beethoven Werke, Serie XVI\\" which was first issued in 1862 (in 3 volumes) by Breitkopf und H&auml;rtel, Leipzig. This is an early example of what is now referred to as an \\"urtext\\" edition, and the names listed on the editorial team for the series include important figures like Johannes Brahms and Carl Reinecke (among others). Scholarship on Beethoven has naturally advanced quite a bit since 1862, which is why most performers today prefer new editions like the Vienna Uretxt or Henle. Even so, this is certainly a serviceable edition overall and still compares favorably with many out there. Considering the obvious drawbacks mentioned above, the text presented is pretty much just what Beethoven wrote - nothing more. Not all reprints are created equal, and this is a good example of what happens when scores are reprinted over and over again. Instead of finding one of the actual 1862 volumes (which measured nearly 10 x 13 inches) to photograph as source material, the reprint publisher (a major concern located in California) instead used an earlier generation reprint as its source, which in turn used an even earlier reprint as its source - and so on. That's how you end up with bizarre warped music - which can be clearly seen in the \\"Look Inside the Book\\" feature."},{"Title":"Sonatas, Vol. 1: Nos. 1-15 (Urtext Edition, for Piano)","review":"The book came swiftly in good condition. It would be nice however if these texts had an index showing the first bar of the sonata."},{"Title":"McCartney","review":"This is one of the most poorly-written books about a Beatle that has even been published. A major McCartney fan, I was sorely disappointed in it. The writer tries to be hip by using British idioms and inside jokes that few Americans will even understand. He skips over, with merely a sentence, major portion's of Sir Paul's life or explanations of what happened. He teases you with just a small portion of a story, with inadequate detail. It seems to contain few, if any interviews or original documentation; it's all excerpts of previously written stuff. If I hadn't read other bios, I wouldn't have a clue what he was talking about half the time. Almost any book out there will give you a much better picture of this musical genius than Sandford's, which seems to be no more than an extended article in a cheap magazine. He's more interested in style, than in providing the proper biography that Paul deserves."},{"Title":"McCartney","review":"The genius of the Beatles is that all 4 contributed to their success -- it needed Lennon but it needed McCartney too. It needed Harrison and it needed Ringo -- Pete Best wouldn't have worked. But time has a way of sorting out the survival of the fittest. And it is Paul McCartney -- genius songwriter, versatile singer, creative bass player, great piano player, guitarist and drummer, and innovative production and marketing man. Founding rock'n'roller and show biz ballad writer/singer. The first Beatle to get his girlfriend pregnant (way back in 1962); the last bachelor Beatle in swinging London; the Beatle who impressed Beat writer William Burroughs with his adaption of the 'cut-up technique' to music loops; the Beatle who hung out in the clubs with Keith Richards and Brian Jones, and turned Mick Jagger on to marijuana; the Beatle who was into the artsy crowd while his fellow Beatles, including John Lennon, led a suburban life; the Beatle who Yoko Ono approached first with her work; the Beatle who in 1969 conceived the notion of the famous band hitting the clubs under an assumed name and blowing everyone's mind; and the first rock star who in 1965 both experienced and embraced stadium rock when the Beatles played Shae Stadium. This book fills in a lot of the gaps in the story of McCartney and the Beatles......it helped to convince me that McCartney was an much a music innovator as Lennon ever was. Takes us through the 70s (when McCartney hosted parties with Dean Martin and Led Zepplin and Bob Dylan in attendance) through the 80s through the 90s to 2005 when Paul played the Super Bowl half-time. As a Beatle fan from 1964 who has read every biography on them (including Lennon's)...... A great book worth getting."},{"Title":"McCartney","review":"The editorial review for this book points out Paul McCartney's Mozartean gift for melody. A pity then it didn't also point out two other Mozartean traits that McCartney shares; a preference for expressing his feelings in music rather than words, and a great love of performing for an audience. Much like this review, Christopher Sandford patronises his subject by failing to understand the essence of McCartney's character leaving him vulnerable to accusations of superficiality. He has gathered together an assortment of acquaintances and associates from the Beatles and post-Beatles era whose embellished recollections are no more reliable than those of the Beatles themselves. True, Paul McCartney can be gauche; he may well lack the middle class sensibilities of a Lennon or a Dylan if that is important to people. But Sandford, like so many before him, never really grasps that it is for these very reasons that McCartney has had such an impact on so many people. The music itself resonates because it doesn't rely on easy words to tell his story and because he refuses to package his numerous personal tragedies into some commodity to be enjoyed. McCartney is no fool, it is to his credit that he won't pander to the pious gravitas expected of him by his detractors. For this, and to remain true to himself, he pays the price by having scorn and derision heaped upon him. The pleasant affable nature protects not only the intensely private man he is but also those close to him. This is a book, like most books on Paul McCartney, for those who want their opinions of a \\"showman\\" confirmed and who are not prepared to look any further."},{"Title":"McCartney","review":"Of the dozens of books I have read about the Beatles, both individually and as a group, this is one of the most glaring examples of unreadable drivel I have seen. Another reviewer lauds this book for not containing any factual errors, when, in fact, it contains many, all easily verifiable through other reliable sources. Sandford's writing style is obnoxiously self-absorbed and annoying, and his reviews and opinions of the Beatles' music are totally unnecessary and expendable. There is little here that hasn't been hashed over dozens of times in other, better books. I opened this book with high hopes, but closed it with a sense of sad disappointment."},{"Title":"McCartney","review":"This snide little book purports to be pro-McCartney, while digging up every nasty little rumor and innuendo ever spoken by a \\"source.\\"Taking the tone of a knowing insider (we get the drift when he first mentions \\"Eppy,\\" the Beatles' nickname for Brian Epstein, and used as though the author were \\"Eppy's\\" best friend, EWWW), the author unaccountably starts the book in 1980 when Paul was detained in Japan for possessing marijuana. Then it jumps around, meanders, uses lots and lots of slang words (just in case we think Sandford isn't hip) and finally ends with a triumphant attack on Paul's marriage (which was not over when the book was published).Don't bother."},{"Title":"McCartney","review":"Paul McCartney is the enduring remnant of The Beatles. Surely the other three have assured legacies, but McCartney represents the continued flourishing of the Beatles' success story. Christopher Sandford's biography 'McCartney' is excellent for bringing The Beatles' (and McCartney's) legend thoroughly to the reader. After having read the groundbreaking 'Shout' by Philip Norman, an insider's account with Peter Brown's 'The Love You Make,' and John Swenson's primer 'The Beatles Yesterday and Today,' Sandford's story is still a find. The content is formidable, chock-full of quotes, accounts of bickering and reconciliation, his love life, and any backstage summations of touring and recording.Taking some familiar paths, the author manages to break new ground mostly by being comprehensive and exhaustive with his research. The greatest merit of his book is his ability to vividly show McCartney's childhood and the historic meetings of the other three of the fab four. Sandford visually and almost audibly transports us to that primitive time and place before they were famous. His details of McCartney's musical father and his heartwarming mother are fascinating. To his credit even the familiar stories don't feel like retread. Later the format changes for most of the solo career. He gathers press conferences, anecdotes, and reviews to stock up his presentation. Overall, I believe he is fair to a point. He injects both enthusiasm and criticism for the superstar Beatle, but he always gives him his due. Even when the text gets highly critical, he cleverly lets others do most of the talking. (This is no small factor given the fact that most writers are hyper-critical of the most commercially successful Beatle.) Admirably, Sandford does a yeoman job of separating rumor from fact and dispenses evidence on every claim and counter-claim he makes.Although mainly a lucid and fascinating read, Sandford at times becomes unnecessarily convoluted. At times he will make statements that require one to reread a passage, making it unnecessarily opaque. (For the grammarian, tracing pronouns to their antecedents is sometimes a chore. In other words it's occasionally difficult to keep track of those for whom he speaks.) However, this is the exception rather than the rule. Capturing the enthusiasm, the thrills, and the chasms, Sandford creates a comprehensive and engaging read for Beatles and/or McCartney fans."},{"Title":"McCartney","review":"I thought this was an extremely interesting book about Sir Paul's life. A tremendous amount of information in the book was a rehash that a loyal fan would of already known. It was nice to read it again though. If you are a true fan of Sir Paul, like I am and have been for 40 years, prepare yourself. The author doesn't always paint Sir Paul in the best of light. Then again we tend to put Paul up on a pedestal and sometimes forget that he is just human. Basically, he is a good, honest, caring, loving and devoted family man. He also cares about animals and the environment....but he really cares about his fans too!!!! He likes their approval of his work very much. He devotes his time and money to charity without bragging about it. He does get critized for some of the things he does, like patting himself on the back too many times, or losing his temper, but like I said before he is only human. This is to be expected of this rock era icon. This book did give me info into his private life, and his life on the road that I never knew before, I appreciated the book for that information. Also there are some really nice photos.I highly recommend this book. I hope this review was helpful to the Sir Paul fans out there!!! Makes an excellent Christmas gift."},{"Title":"McCartney","review":"It's not that book is bereft of any literary merit, as some have asserted. It's that it just functions better as a chronology of events, rather than a narrative, which, by this point, everyone knows anyway. What's interesting here is just how the author charts the four Beatles' projects, and ties them together, giving their combined history a sense of confusion and tension. This book also delves more deeply into the biting acrimony between Paul and John in ways the polished Anthology and other biographies simply haven't. An essential read? No, but it'll take its place in the canon."},{"Title":"McCartney","review":"Sandford takes a clear path between the often too visited extremes on McCartney. He writes a clear and engaging book that comes across as honest and insightful. I don't know what predisposition the other reviewers had, this is the best book on Paul to date. Most books on the Beatles clearly bear the authors personal feelings.The book is not a linear history or a simple American gloss of Paul's life. The \\"smarts\\" of this book come in how the material and style both support a better understanding of Paul. This is unfortunate for some reviewers. The book is clearly much greater than the sum of it's chapters. A great read!"},{"Title":"McCartney","review":"The editorial from Publishers Weekly that appears on this site was obviously written by someone who either did not read this book, skimmed it,or half listened to it on tape while driving. Nowhere in his book does Sandford insinuate that McCartney isn't 'profound of character', in fact he goes into detail about the musician's good,and yes, profound character, using many examples. He also is not afraid to show Paul as a flawed human being,capable of pettiness,and fits of temper,if the situation warrants it. I will admit, it took me a year to buy this book. I kept passing it up because I've been burned by Beatle bios in the past, especially a horrible, book by someone named Chet Flippo. Also, I read Sandford's book on Kurt Cobain and I found it biased and unfair. By chance I happened to read an interview in Daytripper Magazine with Mr. Sandford where he reveals that before he started the McCartney project he wasn't a huge fan. He thought McCartney was too cutesy(I'm paraphrasing). However, once he began his research he started to understand the complex dichotomy that is Paul McCartney. In reading this book,it is easy to see that Chris 'gets' Paul McCartney. He understands that everything this man is, is the result of his upbringing. The product of a very close knit,clannish,Liverpool Irish family; a childhood on a council estate where money was very tight,and Mom had to work as well as take care of the family. This shaped his attitude toward women at an early age,and it also explains Paul's legendary feelings about money. Another result of his childhood, is Paul's formidal work ethic, and his insatiable need to improve himself culturally. In the past, in some lesser bios,people have attributed these traits to male chauvinism,stingyness,pushiness, and shallow social climbing. But Sandford knows better. He's definitely done his homework. Sandford also recognizes as most people finally do, that Paul along with Lennon was the driving creative and musical force behind the Beatles,not George I'm afraid,or only John, as some revisionists would have you think. Without BOTH Lennon and McCartney, there would have been no Beatles. The only complaints I have about this book are:1)the writting style: he starts off with a beautiful,vivid,telling of a shining night in the budding musical career of Paul's father,leading the reader right into WWII. Great way to start the book, but he doesn't stay with this style. By the second chapter his writing gets sloppy, and choppy. It also would have been nice if he would explain what such Liverpool expressions like \\"baccy\\", and \\"wotcher\\" mean. How about a chart or something? He also has a habit of only giving you a little bit of info as soon as he gets to a juicy, personal part. ie: who exactly IS Judy Flanders? She seems to be the (underage?) girl who was caught in Paul's motel room in Milwaukee during the 1964 tour. It seems that Sandford must have interviewed her, although you have to try and guess this, because he then implies that she and Paul seem to have continued their relationship...in England. Did she follow the tour and then move to England to carry on the affair? You get this impression although it is not explained. I'm not into guessing games. If you're going to mention something at all, then go into more detail, or don't even bother. He does the same thing later on when describing a fling with a certain Winona Williams at the Beverly Wilshire in 1968. After their tryst, Williams catches Paul in the lobby with none other than Linda Eastman. Words are exchanged and Paul smooths things over by saying he's \\"about to become a father\\"(?)Doesn't make sense.This remark is not explained and it's very confusing. Who's father is he about to become? Linda's unborn child? Since they had only recently consumatted their relationship, how is that possible? Again,this is not explained either. Was this the editor's fault? Very annoying. Also Sandford reveals little about Paul's personal relationships,especially with John. He reverts to the style of those lazy Beatle authors,describing John in ways that make him seem like a nasty,vindictive,jerk who only has jealousy for McCartney. Every biographer worth his salt has gone into detail about the complex,symbiotic relationship between these two. A pairing based on mutual respect,admiration, and love. Chris should have known better. And they did write together after 1964. Why do people keep insisting otherwise when Paul has described their writing sessions many times, song by song, well into 1967? These are the reasons I gave this book only 4 stars. But aside from The Anthology,there are really almost no true Beatle bios that would warrant 5 stars. There is always something wrong with them. I'm not talking about the marvelous books about their music. I'm talking about the bios on their lives. These always seem to come up short. Anyway this book is still worth getting because it is one of the better ones."},{"Title":"McCartney","review":"I am not saying you should avoid this book at all cost, but it is by far not the best Bio on McCartney.

It will not give you a deeper insight on the live of McCartney."},{"Title":"McCartney","review":"I think for someone who has been in the public eye for 45 years 'Macca,' has been the epitome of grace under pressure. The book could have used less sarcasm and pointed out more of what has been an incredible career by any measurement.

He has always shown incredible class and dignity-qualities in increasing short supply unfortunately, replaced by a genre of \\"tell all, grab-a-buck-today-while-you-can\\" individuals. Even in the most difficult, private circumstances when one party chose to make them very public, he is a rarity. By remaining silent and dignified-knowing the best interest of his child trumps all,this says more than anything else."},{"Title":"McCartney","review":"Excelent book.

Try Cynthia Lennon's new book John, much more interesting."},{"Title":"McCartney","review":"Yes, I know the Beatles warrant an absolute infinity of books about them, but why so many mundane ones? There must be at least a dozen biographies on Paul, and another two dozen on John. Even Ringo and George have had more than a couple each. There are only so many ways to regurgitate the same facts and musical career highlights. If you MUST read a new Beatles book, then I advise that you choose something a little bit different. Andru Reeve's TURN ME ON, DEAD MAN (all about the infamous \\"Paul-Is-Dead\\" hoax) and THE BEATLES: 365 DAYS by Simon Wells are two recent titles that have something new to add to the Beatles conversation. And if you MUST have a biography, then may I suggest the former Cynthia Lennon's new one? At least she has a connection and an insight that many of these other biographers lack.Okay, having said that, let's look at Sandford's book. I have to admit that it gets a very solid 3 stars from me, as this journalist is a very skilled writer and a very thorough fact-checker. I found nary an error in his text, and he does lay out a servicable life history of Sir Paul (well, except for the aforementioned \\"Paul Is Dead\\" story -- barely a mention of the episode which, as Reeve's book demonstrates, deserves some in-depth exposition.) Still, you could do worse -- very, VERY much worse, as there are some very shoddy bios out there on the marketplace. I'd suggest that since Christopher Sandford's book is the most recent, it would probably be a reader's best choice at this time."},{"Title":"McCartney","review":"Chris gives a brilliant look into one the of icons of pop music.

It continued in Geoff Emerick's book Here, There and Everywhere. Now this. They all follow the same pattern: Paul good, John bad. Add to his attempt to switch around the songwriting credits (McCartney-Lennon) and you have the work of a desperate man more worried about his legacy than his art.Listen, if McCartney was such a genius in the 1960's - making experimental films and cutting edge Stockhausen-esq avant garde music - then where is it? Lennon actually made the films and the music and had the events, and he boldly put it out there.I'm sorry, Paul; you'll have to do better than to employ a bunch of hired guns to write your praises. Deliberately treading on the back of a dead man like John Lennon, over and over again, is simply inexcusable.It's getting so pathetic, I'm actually beginning to believe those freaks were right when they said you were dead."},{"Title":"You know me Al;: A busher's letters","review":"This is a classic.

That was a time that the name Ring Lardner was well known in sports writing and literary circles. The sports writing part was easy because that was his beat. The literary part is much harder to recognize but clearly the character of Jack Keefe has become an American classic. Does one need to be a baseball fan to appreciate this work? Hell, no. We all know, in sports or otherwise, this guy Keefe. Right? You know the guy with some talent who has no problem blaming the other guy for mistakes while he (or she) is pure as the driven snow. That is the concept that drives these stories told in the form of letters to Al, his buddy back home.The language, the malapropisms and the schemes all evoke an early more innocent time in sport and society. I do not believe that you could create such a character based on today's sport's ethic. They would all have a spokesperson \`spinning' their take on the matters of the day. The only one that might have come close is Nuke LaRouche in the movie Bull Durham but as that movie progressed Nuke was getting \`wise'. Read these stories. More than once."},{"Title":"You know me Al;: A busher's letters","review":"\\"You Know Me Al\\" consists of a series of rather detailed letters written by a bush-league ballplayer named Jack Keefe. Keefe has been called up from the Terre Haute team to join the Chicago White Sox. He is writing to one of his former bush-league teammates in Bedford, IN.Keefe is truly a country bumpkin, a rube, a bumbling fool who does not understand the more sophisticated world of the major leagues, but who still succeeds based on the strength of his pitching arm. The reader gets a kick out of seeing the world through his eyes but really understanding the situations he is in, similar to 'Forrest Gump', except that Jack does not have a disability - he is just ignorant.The audio version I heard (Book of the Road's version) is wonderfully performed by veteran Shakespearean actor Barry Kraft. Kraft captures his self-confidence, hoosier country-boy accent and innocence perfectly. To me, he will forever be the voice of Jack Keefe.Overall grade: B+"},{"Title":"You know me Al;: A busher's letters","review":"The book profiles a talented fictitious baseball pitcher whose primary limitations are his shallowness, arrogance and bone-headedness. Certainly the character is a composite of all the knuckleheads Lardner must have encountered in his beat as one of the premier sportswriters of his era. Elements of the main character can be seen in many of today's sports stars. The book is an easy and amusing read."},{"Title":"You know me Al;: A busher's letters","review":"Ring Lardner's place as one of the United States' most underrated fiction writers may be from producing almost exclusively short fiction. There, his gift for colloquialism, narrative voice, and an ironic distance between creator and character shines brightest.Even his one well-regarded novel, 1916's \\"You Know Me Al\\", speaks to Lardner's strengths as a short-distance writer. It's an engaging but thin first-person narrative about a headstrong rookie pitcher, Jack Keefe, who makes it to baseball's American League as a starter for the Chicago White Sox. Talented as he is, his selfish attitude puts him in several tight fixes which he wiggles out of with the blissful ignorance of Inspector Clouseau.It helps the busher is too dense to pick up on the ridicule he draws when getting off to a bad start, like in this sly, characteristic exchange with his manager:\\"I says Why don't you get a catcher? He says We don't need no catcher when you're pitching because you can't get nothing past their bats. Then he says You better leave your uniform in here when you go out next inning or Cobb will steal it off your back. I says My arm is sore. He says Use your other one and you'll do just as good.\\"Mention of Cobb, as in Tyrus Raymond, is important because it cues one of Lardner's most successful devices in \\"Al\\", as read at this remove in time. A number of real-life players, managers, coaches, and club owners put in appearances, sometimes in extended episodes. Keefe clashes with parsimonious owner Charles Comiskey over a couple hundred dollars and hangs his losses on teammates, including Buck Weaver, who ironically is blamed by Keefe for throwing a game for a friend. [The real Weaver would go down in history, three years after this was published, as the one \\"Black Sox\\" player who wouldn't do precisely that.]One wonders how Weaver, Comiskey, and the others reacted to \\"Al\\". They must have read it; it was the most popular thing Lardner, a famous writer, produced in his lifetime, first in magazine serial installments and then as a novel. Did they enjoy reading of themselves and get the joke was on Keefe?\\"Al's\\" format, as series of letters written by Keefe to a hometown buddy, allows for a good deal of hilarity in its deliberate unconsciousness, much of which holds together today. But as a story and a character study, it's quite thin. It boils down to this: Jack is a jerk, he's vain, and he's cheap. This last point gets pushed many times, especially during the book's creaky second half, where the now-established pitcher must share the wealth with a wife and son.Lardner's validity as a short-story writer includes the way he holds true to the voice of his central character, no matter how limited or blinkered. Here, it's a liability as the longer investment in Keefe doesn't pay off. I found myself tiring of this guy's company before long, and wishing that Lardner had traded him for Alibi Ike, not my favorite Lardner character either but a more interesting one, more amusing and sympathetic.Even reading this as a collection of short stories is unsatisfying, as the sections don't so much end as trail off. When we leave Keefe, he is getting ready to sail \\"a round the world and back\\" on a baseball tour. He is the same guy we met at the beginning, perhaps a realistic treatment of his fellow man by Lardner but not an arresting one."},{"Title":"You know me Al;: A busher's letters","review":"The travails of the boastful, blame-shifting, naive-unto-the-point-of-stupidity White Sox rookie first went into print 85 years ago. It's one of the miracles of 20th century fiction -- or a comment on the eternal childishness of America's national pastime -- that the bush leaguer's absurd confidences to a friend back home are still fresh and funny. &quot;I have not worked yet Al and I asked Callahan to-day what was the matter and he says I was waiting for you to get in shape. I says I am in shape now and I notice that when I was pitching in practice this A.M. they did not hit nothing out of the infield. He says That was because you are so spread out that they could not get nothing past you. He says The way you are now you cover more ground than the grand stand. I says Is that so? And he walked away.&quot; Yeah, this is clearly the same sport where the portly John Kruk turned aside a question a few years ago about conditioning with the Bartlett's-worthy, &quot;We're not athletes. We're ballplayers.&quot;Lardner does more than get laughs at the expense of his dense protagonist, though. He gives an intimate picture of baseball in its first classic era -- the busher comes face to face with Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker and Walter Johnson with interesting results. But it's not a sentimental depiction of the age: Among those with whom the busher crosses paths is the famously parsimonious and autocratic White Sox owner, Charles Comiskey. The book gives a hint of the resentments that led his players to agree to throw a World Series (as they did a few years after Lardner wrote &quot;You Know Me Al&quot;) and illustrates the indentured servitude that all but the best players endured before free agency arrived in the mid-'70s."},{"Title":"You know me Al;: A busher's letters","review":"Ring Lardner was a newspaper sports writer in the early 1900s. He rode the trains with professional baseball players and joined in thier card games. &quot;You Know Me Al&quot; is a unique set of letters from a fictional rookie ball player to his friend Al back home. The book contains real teams and stats, but is a fast-reading fictional look at the lives of players. With everything from front office negotiations with Comiski to on-the-field trash talk, &quot;You Know Me Al&quot; is a must-read for baseball fans who miss the game of yesteryear."},{"Title":"You know me Al;: A busher's letters","review":"This book was a real hoot to read. Ive always loved the language that revolved around the game of baseball. Ring Lardner does a credible job of creating this youthful prospect trying to make big in The Show. The format of writing letters gives it a touch a realism. The language and grammar of this semiliterates lend it a charm that is slightly reminiscent of Huck Finn. His delusional arrogance is more humorous than offensive in the long run. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the literature and journalism that surrounds this great American game."},{"Title":"You know me Al;: A busher's letters","review":"Not being much of a sports fan, but for many years standing close beside one, I knew nothing of Ring Lardner until I visited Niles, Michigan, pursuing a story of my own. In a quaint hometown treasures museum, we discovered the local author gone national, with a first edition of \\"You Know Me Al\\" under glass. Intrigued, I purchased a modern day copy soon after for my sports fan, but I had to read it first myself.In full agreement with Virginia Woolf in the book's Introduction, I can say you do not have to be a sports fan to enjoy Lardner's humorous portrayal of Jack Keefe, a bush-league pitcher who writes frequent letters to his best pal, Al, about his adventures on and off the baseball field. The letters are filled with hilarious misspellings, misunderstandings, and general bumblings. Jack may be a good athlete, but his mind, shall we say, is his least athletic muscle...All of which adds to the slim book's charm. Jack writes to Al about his fortunes and misfortunes in pitching, forever blaming others for his own obvious failures, never missing a chance to boast, thumping his manly chest with threats that he will beat up this guy or that for some imagined slight. His arrogance is in high form, but just about the time it approaches the point of no return, Jack charms with his naivete. One can't help but laugh at him again, much as one laughs at a child or a wildly bounding puppy.The letters are not just about baseball, however, but just as comically illustrate Jack's romantic flailings, as he imagines Violet is ever so smitten with him, then decides to marry another, only to drop her for another, only to long for the first again, only to marry Florrie. With whom the threat of divorce comes up again and again in similar cyclings. Jack waffles with all decisions in his life: team trips, moving from one city to another, borrowing and repaying funds to the silent and surely most patient and near saintly Al.It is the lack of hearing from the other side that keeps me from adding a fifth star to this review. We have only Jack's view of himself and his world, charming bumbler that he is, and I found myself often wishing for Al's side in response. Nonetheless, this is a classic that can obviously be enjoyed even over a great passage of time since its original writing some eighty years ago, and with or without a penchant for sports."},{"Title":"You know me Al;: A busher's letters","review":"I had not never heard of Ring Lardner until a visit to his home town in Niles Michigan right near outside of Kalamazoo. Born in Niles Michigan in 1885 Lardner was a sports writer for the Chicago Tribyoon but he is best well known for these busher letters that he rote as instalmints for The Satirday Eevning Post.The best letters were collected for this book You Know Me Al that were first published in 1914. It cronikles a bushers rise to the major league threw a serious of letters written to his pal Al in Bedford Illinoy. Jack Keefe is a right hander pitcher who has got some good stuf but he is offten his own worse enemy. He sees the baseball world round him threw child inocents seeing his skills as supeerier to every one. Think Nuke LaLoosh in Bull Durham. His qwik tempurr shows when he looses it is because he got no support from his team and so he blaims every one but him. And in these letters to his pal Al he shows how all too human he is even as he shows no skill with girls his team mates his manager or at writing. No atemped is made to kleen up miss-spelled words or fix up bad grammer. These letters show a glimpse into the great game of baseball threw the eyes of some one who played for Charles Comiskey, ohner of the White Sox and against Ty Cobb and Walter Johnson.You dont have to be a fan of the game to like this book. In fact I never knowed what a fadeaway fast ball was until I red this book. It is a fast ball that when the hitter hits it it fades away over the fence. And it can be red in a lot of ways. As historik fikshun a baseball book or a caractor study that shows that athaletes even then lived in a difrent world then ours. You can't not like this book.Hily reckomended."},{"Title":"You know me Al;: A busher's letters","review":"In the early days before ballplayers made a few billion dollars a year there was a young pitcher by the name of Jack Keefe who got called up from the minors to pitch for Comiskey's Chicago White Sox. He tells the story of this and his whole season in a series of letters to his friend ,Al. These letters are written in a special colloquial style and include the spelling and grammatical errors of the young pitcher, and also his quite surprising startling and humorous language. This is what this classic work of American humor is largely about. And while it is filled with sarcasm and a kind of mockery at the arrogance and naievete of its main character it also presents a picture of the baseball world of those days in the terms and language of that world.A small American classic."},{"Title":"You know me Al;: A busher's letters","review":"Athletes are much more educated & sophisticated today. But especially in baseball there are are still the fun-loving, ignorant, quick to anger, characters. Like Jack, for example.

Talking baseball, Ty Cobb, Walter Johnson, that cheap owner, Charles Comiskey etc. Listening to the audio version as I drove along, I was smiling. It jogged my own memories of baseball seasons past, even though it is almost 90 years old. This was all before World War I, the Black Sox Scandal & even Babe Ruth."},{"Title":"You know me Al;: A busher's letters","review":"This amusing look at baseball circa 1914 by sportswriter Ring Lardner (1885-1933) remains among the sport's top fiction. The story is told through a series of letters written by pitcher Jack Keefe of the Chicago White Sox to his buddy Al back home in Indiana. Keefe is a modestly talented pitcher finally getting his chance in the big leagues. Keefe is naive and immature, he has an excuse for every failure, and his childish emotions range greatly according to how his last game went. The author uses many real baseball figures in this story (Ty Cobb, Sam Crawford, manager Nixie Callahan, etc.) and that lends an added layer of authenticity. This book also mixes readable prose with down home wit, and the result is a highly amusing novel in the style of Mark Twain."},{"Title":"You know me Al;: A busher's letters","review":"This is a print out of the Internet Archive scanned version of the book from a copy held by the University of California Library.

Only the names have changed. Talented pitcher Jack Keefe tells this story in the form of letters to his friend Al back in their hometown. Jack begins below the major leagues, but gets there with the White Sox. Jack shows his personality by his own descriptions of actions and events. Don't expect him to spell well or use the finest grammar, but frequently laugh at his choices and apparent delusion about who and what he really is. It may help if you know names like Cobb, Lajoie, Matthewson, and Comisky, and have some rudimentary knowledge of baseball, but this is an enjoyable book about Jack's life changing as his circumstances change. He faces baseball issues, management issues, women issues, and general life issues as a young man who shows himself to be nave and not completely honest with himself about who he is. Good fun, well written in a voice that seems genuine for Jack, and definitely standing the test of time."},{"Title":"Rough Sets and Data Mining: Analysis of Imprecise Data","review":"This is a very good book on advanced topics of Rough set theory.

I used Kaplan, the test booklet produced by ETS, Princeton Review Cracking the GRE and my Campbell's Biology from freshman Biology in college. Of all books, I found the Campbells Biology the most helpful. Second was Kaplan. Check out my review for P. Review book, because the vocab list at the back was very helpful, and so was the practice test, but the rest of that book was worse than terrible. I am not sure of my score yet, but I know that many things I studied were on this test, it was a typical rehash of all that nit picky stuff like the difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic flagella to the intricate details of sarcomeres.Oh, and the structure of the test, I didn't know it until I took some practice tests -- either it's not explicit in any of these books or I just passed over it. It's 110 multi choice questions first, then 30 or so of questions that you have to choose the correct word for each statement, then 50ish questions on several charts and experiments. The last section takes the longest, the choose-word questions go very fast and the multi choice is where you can really gain time if you study these darn books for tricky questions regarding the mesophyll of plants etc that would otherwise take up time trying to eliminate and choose the best answer. If you can know the multiple choice quickly and solid, you'll have plenty of time for the charts etc."},{"Title":"Kaplan GRE Biology","review":"I don't know what this gentleman from Ann Arbor is talking about. Mr. Monk, however, has hit the nail right on the head. This was an excellent buy and helped me increase my score considerably. There are no significant typos throughout the entire book.

The review test at the end of the exam was really the kicker; there were questions on my exam that were nearly identical to those found in the book. Kaplan has done it again."},{"Title":"Kaplan GRE Biology","review":"Definitely useful, especially to familiarize you with what exactly to expect from the test. The practice test definitely taught me a lot (such as \\"I know nothing about plants\\"), and the review material was great.My only gripe is that there was only one test in the back of the book.

I got my score like a month ago and I was very disappointed. If you read the reviews for the new edition you'll find one reviewer talking about this book needs to be revised. And all I'm gonna tell you is he/she is 110% correct.If you are taking the test in April or later, consider NOT buying this book. I used this book, the Princeton review book and Campbell to study for the test. And I didn't get a 90 percentile or above, which totally enraged me since it felt like everything that was in this book was not on the test (I focused very much on the topics found in this book). I can't reveal the exact questions but let me just describe the kind of problems on the test (I bet future test takers would be curious). The most shocking question on the test I took must be the one where it mixed reproductive organs (anatomy) with evolutionary biology. There were 5 consecutive problems dealing with history stuff like when did this go extinct and when did that originated. It was just painful for me since I'm a big cell and molecular person. There were even matching problems where the student was supposed to match up the name of a specific gene (I mean very specific, at least that's what I thought) with its function or responsible disease or symptoms or body structure.Honestly I was quite devastated by the difficulty of the test, especially it felt like everything I studied did not show up on the test. If you're from Harvard or Yale or whatever, don't even bother studying because you're the people who get the 99 percentile. But for the rest of us (well excluding me), study your Campbell Biology textbook. And be sure to cover everything in the book. You'll be surprised when you see problems that you absolutely don't have a clue on the test."},{"Title":"Kaplan GRE Biology","review":"I bought this book two weeks before the BioGRE in order to bone up on anything that may have slipped my mind since freshmen bio class.

The actual test is far more clearly written, thought out, and fair.This book also gives a section to explain why you got that one question wrong about how bacteria reproduce. Sounds great, right? Wrong. Sometimes the explanations say things like \\"Answers B, C, and E can be eliminated because they are wrong. Answer D is the correct choice.

I did not even read a general bio textbook; I think that if you basically know your stuff already the kaplan guide is all you are gonna need .I found the plant info and info on evolution very helpful"},{"Title":"The Polish Community of Chicopee (MA) (Images of America)","review":"Chicopee is a city of almost 55,000 people, located in western Massachusetts approximately 35 miles north of Hartford, Connecticut. 22.8% of its inhabitants-the single largest ethnic group-still claims Polish ancestry, according to the 2000 census.Jendrysik claims that the first Poles \\"accidentally\\" arrived in Chicopee in 1880. Chicopee, like many river valley towns in New England in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, attracted immigrants to its textile mills. Mills like Dwight's wanted immigrant labor.The story of Chicopee Polonia has numerous similarities to other Polish communities deriving from the emigracja za chlebem. Immigrants from a rural and impoverished Poland (in the case of Chicopee, primarily from today's Maopolskie and Podkarpackie wojew&oacute;dztwa) found jobs in industrial America. Along the way, they built a church (St. Stanislaus), experienced a schism (Holy Mother of the Rosary Church), had extraordinary priests who ministered to them (Frs. Francis Chalupka and Stanislaus Czelusniak, OFM Conv.), fought in Haller's Army (47 from Chicopee, 500 from the Holyoke area), and assimilated.But Chicopee is unique in a number of ways. About half of the immigrants who started coming in the 1880s and early 1900s were teenagers (including this reviewer's paternal grandfather). The author says they were trying to avoid Austrian conscription. The entrepreneurial spirit of these immigrants was strong, evidenced by the numerous small businesses launched by immigrants, a prudent move given the tenuous nature of a local economy dependent on a single type of industry. Poles clearly thrived in Chicopee, and the small-town nature of the place allowed them to stand out and color the larger community in ways that ethnic enclaves in metropolitan areas like Chicago or Detroit did not. Chicopee had a Polish mayor throughout the 1930s (A.J. Stonina), who apparently ousted a French-Canadian. Poles dominated the City Council. Stonina's administration supposedly was involved in some of the excesses of machine politics and, in 1939, local Franco-Americans took the mayoralty back. One lasting achievement today was a major Stonina initiative: Westover Air Force Base, in Chicopee, approved in September 1939.In keeping with the pattern of the \\"Images of America\\" series, this book tells Chicopee Polonia's story through 221 old, black-and-white pictures. Each picture is accompanied by three or four lines of text that, taken together, tells the history of Polonia Chicopee from 1880-1941. Text alone is limited to a one page introduction. The genre makes the book easy to read, telling Chicopee's story in an interesting and visually pleasing way.Written by a local, probably arm-chair historian, the book does have some quirks. Why does the book end in 1941? How did Chicopee Polonia fight World War II on the home front? What about Chicopee Polonia today? Sometimes the narrative of the picture captions seems incomplete: I had to go back and forth a few times to figure out that Holy Mother of the Rosary emerged not as Chicopee's second Roman Catholic parish but apparently spent three years in a twilight zone existence as an \\"independent\\" Catholic church before formally joining the Polish National Catholics. Sometimes the story gets confusing because the slavish chronological arrangement of the picture captions' narrative breaks the continuity of a theme (e.g., we jump from preparations for war to a house built in 1916 to the first Chicopee casualty in World War I).Those shortcomings aside, this book is a useful addition to the limited pool of literature on American Polonia in small-town America, where the dynamics were both similar to and different from those in big cities. The pool of potential research on a place like Chicopee seems large: Poles in small-town politics, the Polish-American press (Chicopee was home to Nowa Anglia, a Polish weekly), and economic migration (both in terms of attracting immigrants from Poland and in local migration among the mill towns of southern New England). By putting it down on paper and making sure the history of Chicopee Polonia didn't get lost (a 1973 fire in St. Stanislaus School apparently consumed lots of old artifacts), Jendrysik's made a great start."},{"Title":"A dream of John Ball: And A king's lesson","review":"Written as a response to Edward Bellamy's \\"Looking Backward,\\" which contains Bellamy's rather fascistic utopian vision, \\"A Dream of John Ball,\\" along with \\"Letter from Nowhere,\\" reveal the Marxist humanism that so inspired Morris.

He wants to analyze the form, structure, and function of something he calls \\"social space\\" and explore how such spaces have been produced.\\"Social space\\" partly consists of a certain configuration of actual space in actual time. Space also encompasses and includes physical objects that participate in discourse (as Foucault would say). Thus, space is also a container of relationships. It is also the receptacle of history, \\"the outcome of past actions.\\" Lefebvre uses the example of a mountain. It does not have to have been produced or even physically altered by human hands to be considered a social space. Lefebvre's mountain participates in many relationships. The mountain space participates in a dialectic with humans, other spaces (social, representational, and represented), and history (it is produced in history and plays a role in history). It is at once a locus, a node on a network, a path, and place of potentials (i.e. of possible material exchange). \\"Its \`reality' [is] at once formal and material.\\" In short, the mountain cannot be reduced to a simple object, writes Lefebvre.Space is powerful. Space, according to him, is anything but the \\"passive locus of social relations.\\" It has an \\"active-operational or instrumental role,\\" it is \\"knowledge and action.\\" It instructs. It is also nothing less than a new mode of production. It contributes to \\"the establishment...of a system\\" and those in power (the bourgeois, most recently) frequently have made use of it. Space produces society, writes Lefebvre. He writes, \\"a decisive part is played by space in this continuity [of the reproduction of society].\\"At the same time space produces society, space is produced. What Lefebvre sets out to do is identify \\"the actual production of space,\\" to bring the different kinds of space and the modes of their production into a theory. Space is not \\"produced in the sense that a kilogram of sugar or a yard of cloth is produced.\\" Nor is it produced like an aspect of superstructure. Social space is produced by (and produces) power to serve its goals.Lefebvre laments that, in the work of philosophers, there has been an \\"abyss\\" between mental (\\"ideal\\") space and real space, between the internal \\"sphere\\", the realm of mental categories, and the external, physical, social. Lefebvre rejects the res cogitans/res existensa duality of Descartes, and separating mental space from real space strongly reinforces this. Lefebvre's belief that real minds in real bodies inhabit real space-at the same time spaces participate in the mental realm-is the most basic reason The Production of Space is useful for environmental historians. His ideas hint at new opportunities to bridge the culture/matter gap.Lefebvre also believes that physical environments have histories and humans are a part of them. \\"In short, every social space has a history, one invariably grounded in nature, in natural conditions that are at once primordial and unique in the sense that they are always and everywhere endowed with specific characteristics (site, climate, etc.).\\" He even sounds like an environmental historian at times. \\"The departure point for this history of space is not to be found in geographical descriptions of natural space, but rather in the study of natural rhythms, and of the modification of those rhythms and their inscription in space by means of human actions, especially work-related actions. It begins, then, with the spatio-temporal rhythms of nature as transformed by a social practice.\\"Criticisms: Lefebvre frequently returns to a critique of the space produced by capitalism, a powerful (abstract) space that spans the globe and has left few pockets free from it. The space produced by something like capitalism is extremely powerful because one can not choose but be obedient to it; to live in it is \\"lived obedience.\\" That is, to follow its dictates, move about in it in an orderly fashion, to be directed in some paths, prohibited from others, is to follow its instruction. This space is totally concerned with reproducing (bourgeois-serving) social relationships at the cost of \\"[creative] works, ...natural reproduction, over nature itself, and over natural time.\\"His point is well taken, but I think these frequently tangential moments detract from his exposition of a new analytical tool. I get tired of hearing that the point of this analysis is to uncover the social relationships latent in spaces for the ostensible purpose of inspiring revolution. I'd rather he left such an analysis to a historian employing Lefebvre's idea rather than having Lefebvre try to make his exposition of a theoretical tool double as a manifesto. (I am also really weary of his defending himself against hardcore Marxists-his concentration is greatly lessened for the effort. I understand that he is fighting personal battles with his old friends at these moments.)"},{"Title":"The Production of Space","review":"The Production of Space is a thick yet engaging introduction to Postmodern spatial theory, providing insights to a variety of philosophical concepts centering on how we perceive, construct, and reproduce both physical and mental spaces. While complex and eclectic, Lefebvre's book provides ample food for thought for those interested in the means by which we as human beings understand space in the world and how we negotiate and transpose it in our minds.Overall, it's damned good stuff. I read this book and the idea for my Masters thesis came exploding out of me like one of those creatures from \\"Alien.\\""},{"Title":"The Production of Space","review":"Henri Lefebvre's epic book, The Production of Space is a cryptic exploration into the production of various kinds of space. While I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a comprehensive spatial analysis, I warn the reader to avoid jumping into the book blindly. It is not a book to be kept on the night table and read leisurely before drifting off to sleep. It is a serious book and requires serious concentration on the part of the reader."},{"Title":"The Production of Space","review":"This is a fragmented and speculative work, from which readers (e.g. Soja, Harvey, Elden and Shields) have been able to draw rather contradictory and diverse conclusions. In part, that's because there's a lot in here, but it's not terribly consistently or coherently presented. I've read most of it twice and parts several times more -- there are lots of intriguing sketches of ideas, and the reader can fill them in in lots of different ways, but I'm not convinced it's worth it."},{"Title":"The Statistical Exorcist: Dispelling Statistics Anxiety (Popular Statistics)","review":"This is a light hearted look at statistics, that might be used to accompany an introductory class (associated with a more mathematical book) or for a general reader that doesn't want to wade through lots of algebraic symbols. Even the footnotes may be humorous (\\"FP sometimes gets carried away in his fervent reverence for his own books\\"). With 26 vignettes, only one of them uses mathematical symbols. This presents the sort of scenarios, that you may actually encounter such as Round-robin tournaments, life tables, and of course gambling. The chapter on \\"Was the 1970 draft lottery fair?\\" may have had personal consequences for some readers. The topics fall into categories of; making decisions, sampling, learning from data, and estimating probabilities. There are some common ideas about how more information can be obtained, from samples, Throughout the book, some of the ideas seem to be \\"common sense\\", while others are counter intuitive, and need further thinking, and working the problems helps. Readers of this might also enjoy \\"How to Lie with Statistics\\" by Darrell Huff and \\"A mathematicians reads the newspaper\\" by John Allen Paulos."},{"Title":"The Statistical Exorcist: Dispelling Statistics Anxiety (Popular Statistics)","review":"This book is a great hoot for those who can laugh at their fears of numerical weakness. Do not be misled to be serious about the title. Humorist Will Roger's said that we are all ignorant, just different subjects. Well, ... Myles Hollander and Frank Proschan, exorcise that ignorance away with their charming wit and deep insights. They both are internationally renowned academic scholars in the science called Statistics, with Professor Proschan having retired and enjoying writing children's stories for his grandchildren, etc. Think of spirits like Dr. Seuss writing about quantitative thinking. So see the light and lighten up with your silly fears about numbers, probabilities and reason with more quantitative confidence after reading this truly playful book. Enjoy thinking better!"},{"Title":"Unchained Melanie","review":"Forget doom and gloom and the scary state of the world... this is escapist reading pure and simple... and I for one could read it over and over.

Refreshing take on the importance of relationships and how they are formed when individuals are thrown together in a college setting."},{"Title":"Brothers Under the Skin","review":"Anyone who went away to college should read this book. Not only was it an entertaining read, it also took me down memory lane -- triggering recollections of events, milestones and characters from my own freshman year of college. Good books stimulate the senses, and reading &quot;Brothers&quot; I could detect the hot air in the dorm room and the smells and sounds of the dining hall.While I can't say my own group of friends had the same cut-throat approach to grades my freshman year, the story has elements that will resonate with anyone. Who doesn't remember that first romantic interest on their college campus? Or having too much to drink and ruing it the next day?The issue of race is presented in an approachable way in this book. It prompts a lot of thinking and reflection without the writer cramming his own POV down the reader's throat.Equal parts funny, serious and nostalgic."},{"Title":"Dydeetown World","review":"Dydeetown World really isn't a novel, it's a collection of three novellas that, while self contained, form a strong and much larger story arc. A clone of Jean Harlow asks a private detective for help. At first reluctant (it's just a clone after all, not a human) the detective chooses to do what is morally right, help the clone. What follows are a series of unique and startling adventures that never fail to entertain, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dydeetown World","review":"Dydeetown World,Dydeetown World is actually three short stories strung together to form the whole. The characters, stories, and writing are all very simple yet interesting enough to keep a reader entertained.The main character is a Private Eye who appears to be a bit down on his luck but his luck and his life all change when a clone of Jean Harlow enters his office seeking help. Jean Harlow leads us to the Lost Boys, which in turn leads us back to Jean Harlow weaving the stories together seamlessly.I did enjoy the read but on the other hand I found the book to be a bit choppy in its pace. Although the stories flowed together nicely, I found the stories in themselves to be a bit thin. Perhaps F. Paul Wilson could have added more detail to the world building aspects of this book. I feel he also could have taken a bit more time developing the characters. This single book may have made a nice thick trilogy.All in all the book was enjoyable even in its very simplistic form."},{"Title":"Dydeetown World","review":"Of all the futuristic, \\"harder\\" sci-fi books that Wilson has written, Dydeetown Town is by far the most successful, largely because it finally emphasizes character and plot, which are Wilson's stronger points, over his interesting but somewhat shallow worlds. Mixing private eye stories with genetic engineering and Orwellian government, Dydeetown World creates an intriguing subculture out of its cast of outcasts, black marketeers, runaway clones, and violent underworld figures. And in its three short tales, Wilson ends up crafting a complicated tale that would hold its own in the mystery genre, one with some legitimately surprising payoffs and some nice twists along the way. It's no Repairman Jack, but of Wilson's future-based books, it's easily his strongest piece, and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Dydeetown World","review":"Very well written story. Would recommend this to everyone. I've enjoyed this author for many years. You will have a great adventure with this story."},{"Title":"Dydeetown World","review":"With a gritty setting and some tough lives being rolled out in this tale, Wilson infuses the reader with such love for these characters that you can't help but enjoy this book.

Peter is best known for his statement of the Peter Principle, \\"People tend to rise to the level of their incompetence.\\" In this book, he writes about people who have been instrumental in generating some of the most significant ideas of history. Some of the people are long since dead, so he simulates an interview with them by using excerpts from their writing or speeches. This is very well done and occasionally quite humorous. He \\"interviews\\" Oscar Wilde, Elbert Hubbard, Mark Twain, Benjamin Franklin, Adlai Stevenson and Will Rogers.He also profiles other people such as Johnny Carson, Richard Nixon, George Carlin and Thomas Crapper. I found his examination of P.T. Barnum to be the most interesting. He argues that Barnum's contribution was to make fun and laughter a way of American life. While I don't necessarily agree with that argument, it was well made and I took it seriously. In the remainder of the book, Peter gives us a long list of rules and \\"laws\\" about the occasional absurdity of life. He lampoons government bureaucracy, the role of women in society and the role of ethnic humor in the assimilation of a group into a society.This is a funny book, reading the lists of the \\"laws\\" it was hard not to laugh and groan at the same time. The best satire has a serious bite to it and that principle applies to the rules that Peter puts forward in this book."},{"Title":"Digital Property: Currency of the 21st Century","review":"I borrowed this book to read, but now I realise I have to buy a copy of my own.

I first met John in a Seattle bookstore, and by chance that same afternoon his first printing of this book was coming off the presses. Anxious to find out if the color of the photographs was correct, we paused our conversation while he stepped out to check on his work. When he came back, he held in his hands the first copy of this precious volume, examined the photos, and pronounced them as having perfect color rendition. Upon this, he signed his book and gave it to me. Now, one might suggest that I am gushing 5-stars because of this special encounter between a reader and author, and therein one might be cautious with my recommendation.

By instinct, education and training he was superbly qualified to guide Britain's naval forces through their most challenging trial of the late 20th century, the Falklands War of 1982. It is not hard to argue that he was Britain's only military leader capable of saving his country's honor and the Atlantic alliance from a debacle, had Argentina's militaristic government at the time been allowed to prevail.Failure would have emboldened the Soviets who might not have gone on to permit a breach of the Berlin Wall a few years later. With Admiral Sir Henry Leach, Lewin was the steel in Margaret Thatcher's formidable spine. Richard Hill's \\"Lewin of Greenwich: the authorized biography\\" is a useful start to an assessment of the man and the quality of his leadership. We applaud making the book accessible in an electronic edition with a bonus of ninety additional photographs.That said, the biography is burdened by being \\"authorized.\\" What a dreadful word, rife with intimations of blatant bias, skewed perspective, score settling, excuses layered and truths padded. It is much better than that. Overall, Hill's take is a workmanlike, straightforward summary of an uncommon officer in an era of radically shifting national priorities. The result is efficient and touches every high note. Lewin turned to Hill for the task of pulling together an account of his life very near the end of it. There were only a couple of months between a diagnosis of cancer and despatch. By the time Hill got started writing his protagonist was long gone. The finished book reflects not just Lewin's personal memories but also the accumulated recollections of a very wide cross section of people who knew him, and who are attributed and searchable in the eBook version.All chief rubrics in Lewin's life are identified for others to exploit, as we hope they will because there is much left to discuss. His papers, oral tapes, Falkland notes, midshipman's journals, important photographs, uniforms, medals et al were donated to the National Maritime Museum where they are open to access by appointment to anyone wishing to research in depth. Hill's style is readable though laced with Briticisms, overly politic on sensitive issues not unexpected in a retired RN rear admiral-author-historian, and just a little understated in giving the United States credit for its definitive assistance in the Falklands campaign. Lewin himself was unequivocal in telling everyone that retaking the Falklands could not have been done without U.S. support. For that matter, acknowledgement is anemic regarding any American involvement in Royal Navy fortunes in the post-World War II era. Hill's perspective, we suppose. So it goes.The biography's subtitle ought to have been closer to the theme, \\"Lewin: His Life and Times.\\" Because it is not only about the man who is described in these pages, but the man in context of his historical backdrop on which the story pivots. Some reviews of the book are laced with after-the-fact speculation of what might have been, should have been or was rumored to be. Tongue is planted firmly in cheek when historians take the stage with a script of their own that rearranges the chairs to their liking. Hill's book is a necessary read for anyone sorting through mid- and late 20th century British history. And it is honest.By the time of the Falklands War, Royal Navy assets had moved perilously near to not being able to pull off recovery of the islands at all. From the early 1960s, Britain's military capabilities had steadily degraded, sometimes for political reasons and sometimes by colossal misjudgment. Hill covers all principal episodes: the carrier retreat, questionable aircraft choices, the notorious \\"8288\\" defense review ironically subtitled \\"The Way Forward\\" that actually gutted the Senior Service, and the rest. For American sensibilities, one of the most inexplicable decisions centered on aircraft carrier shipboard habitability. The Admiralty declined a couple of affordable U.S. Essex class assets because the architecture put together petty officers with junior ratings on the mess decks, U.S. Navy-style. Lewin sided with those who \\"thought the accommodations problem a [project] killer.\\" Thus, two disparate cultures look at one another with incredulity and divide over irreconcilable differences.Another year or so on John Nott's tack (Thatcher's Secretary of State for Defence) and there would have been no national military capability for an epic logistical challenge half-way round the world. One of the reviewers spent portions of two austral summers down there, back-to-back (1977-1978 and 1978-1979), when a series of decisions from London gave the appearance of broadcasting terminal disinterest in keeping the colony British. (Historically, crown ownership of the islands was re-asserted in 1833 after USS Lexington rescued crews from the American sealers Harriet, Superior and Breakwater taken prisoner by an overly authoritarian local representative of the United Provinces of the La Plata, as Argentina was then called.)Whitehall missteps were interpreted as nuanced encouragement to \\"free the Malvinas\\" by Argentina's military, which had in their employ several \\"civilian\\" personnel stationed in Port Stanley. It was common knowledge among the natives (who call themselves Kelpers, after the tenacious local seaweed) that every colony happening, large or small, was promptly relayed to the mainland. Announcement that HMS Endurance would be withdrawn got immediate attention. Removal of the Royal Air Force aircraft mechanic crew in our time rated as small news but was a portent of evolving unimportance, also. The Constantino Davidoff scrap metal fiasco became strongman Leopoldo Galtieri's manufactured casus belli that tipped the scales and precipitated the war.Argentine Navy representatives in Buenos Aires and, later, in Washington were keen to talk of \\"our Malvinas.\\" Reasserting ownership was the natural order of things. Morally, historically, geographically and militarily justified, they explained. In any event, Britain would not fight for a mostly uninhabited 4,000 square miles of rock slides, tussock grass and diddle-dee grazed by a several hundred thousand sheep. They were certain of that. Falklanders grew uneasy but also resolute in their wish to remain British. The Royal Marine Commando detachment in Moody Brook at the end of the only paved road at that time in the colony stayed fit, trained hard, was capable and thoughtful. Whitehall bean counters continued to signal that the colony had lost its relevance.When Galtieri deflected attention from his woefully mismanaged economy by an appeal to jingoism followed up with an invasion, U.S. Secretary of State, Al Haig, launched a Kissinger-style shuttle diplomacy with trips to London and Buenos Aires, to no avail. In Washington, the U.S. ambassador to the Organization of American States (the other reviewer here) established near-constant dialogue with the Argentine ambassador and through him, directly with Galtieri. The proposed solution, elegant and original in its way, was to divert the Pope's Latin America tour with a visit to Port Stanley to raise Vatican, British and Argentine flags. The hope, wholly unrealized at the end, was to defuse the immediate peril to allow for withdrawal of Argentine forces. Caspar Weinberger at the Pentagon also made trips to London where he and Lewin came to trust and respect one another, and establish a lasting friendship. (In 1987, Lewin, Weinberger and Middendorf collaborated to have President Reagan present the Maritime Heritage Award in the Oval Office to USS Constitution in behalf of the World Ship Trust, of which Lewin and Middendorf were vice presidents. For Middendorf's perspective of the Falklands War see his autobiography \\"Potomac Fever\\" [ASIN:1591145376 Potomac Fever: A Memoir of Politics and Public Service].Lewin's story touches on the episode in which then-Major (later, Lieutenant Colonel) Ewen Southby-Tailyour, Royal Marines failed to persuade the Welsh Guards to disembark and come ashore at Bluff Cove, with the result that the soldiers were trapped aboard and dozens were killed or badly wounded during an Argentine Air Force Skyhawk attack. It is not enough to explain the incident away (Hill does exactly that) as an understandable decision by the Guards because they had endured a rough sea passage, were tired and in need of rest. Lewin was a great enthusiast for the maxim that it is the duty of any soldier in a ship to get off that ship as swiftly as possible. In truth, the Guards' officers showed scant respect for the rule and were too parochial to credit a Royal Marine with knowing something they did not. An account of the incident is in his book, \\"Reasons in Writing.\\"As Commanding Officer of the RM commando detachment, Southby-Tailyour's military resources included the Motor Fishing Vessel Forrest. After reporting in 1978, he lost no time taking her out for a detailed survey of the colony's coastline and every harbor, bolt-hole, anchorage, rock, hazard and landmark, all of which he carefully noted. Years on, his book \\"Falkland Islands Shores\\"Falkland Islands Shorescame of it. In 1979, we failed to interest a British or U.S. publisher even with several chapters as bait.When hostilities commenced, the manuscript was immediately classified. Southby-Tailyour parlayed his work into a billet aboard HMS Fearless on the invasion force, where he produced answers to the myriad questions posed by planners from his office in the tub of the senior officers' bathroom. All military planning and conduct of amphibious operations was based on his rich store of data, including the initial invasion in San Carlos Water. Embarked in the lead landing craft on D-Day was Southby-Tailyour. In the Falklands War honors list he was gazetted with the award of an OBE.By great good fortune for NATO, Britain's sense of self-worth and Galtieri's miscalculation converged with a tough-minded Prime Minister and her exceptionally capable Chief of Defense Staff. Terry Lewin's steady hand on the tiller ensured the expeditionary force's success. Britain's armed services still delivered a sting.Lewin lived and served in the twilight of his county's military place in the world. Japan's navy is roughly four times the size of the Royal Navy today. The last aircraft carrier is gone. Perhaps uniquely among senior flag officers in his country's extraordinary naval history, Lewin dealt with the consequences of political indifference and diminished international standing fostered by a majority population more interested in welfare benefits and tribal identity politics (Scottish devolution, Welsh nationalism) than security and, like its American counterpart, for whom nothing is worth fighting for.One omission and a correction need to be noted. Hill's litany of Lewin-backed memorials neglects a plaque in the floor of Painted Hall, in the former Royal Naval College, Greenwich. The old plaque was dedicated in 1941 to the first three U.S. citizens to volunteer as sea-service officers in the Royal Navy, while their own country was still firmly neutral. College authorities knew that it was illegal for Americans to put on a foreign uniform and had deliberately kept the names secret. It was chiefly Lewin's lobbying (carried forward by his son Tim, following his father's death) that resulted in a new plaque complete with all twenty-two names installed next to the original.\\"Passport not required\\"The Royal Navy day by day[[ASIN:1591142245 Passport Not Required: U.S. Volunteers in the Royal Navy, 1939-1941] tells the story of the American RNVR volunteers. The search for who they were began in 1975 with a request from the U.S. Naval Institute and with approval of the Secretary of the Navy.Lewin shared an indirect but deeply personal moment with one of them. At 0140 hours on October 18, 1941 he was aboard HMS Highlander and watched as HMS Broadwater sank in the North Atlantic after a torpedo strike. Aboard Broadwater on bridge watch that night (and immediately above the torpedo's impact with the hull) was Lieutenant John Stanley Parker, RNVR the first American volunteer commissioned as a British naval officer to be killed in action in the history of the Royal Navy.The correction focuses on credit for \\"The Royal Navy Day by Day\\"[[ASIN:0900000910 The Royal Navy day by day]] to which Lewin wrote the introduction, first published in 1979 by Lieutenant Commander R. E. \\"Bushey\\" Shrubb, JP, RN the chronology's lead editor as well as our RN counterpart on the staff of the Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic. Junior-editor was the late Captain A. B. Sainsbury, RNR. Hill gives Shrubb's signal contribution a cursory nod. There is fulsome praise for the follow-on edition, somewhat enlarged to bring events up to date but quite the same book as before, except that Shrubb disappears from the title page. Sainsbury's grab for all the attention and credit reminds us of Joseph Addison's description of Daniel Defoe as \\"a false, shuffling, prevaricating rascal.\\"Hon. J. William Middendorf II is a former U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands and European Community and Secretary of the Navy. He was U.S. Ambassador to the Organization of American States during the Falklands crisis. In World War II he served as the engineering officer aboard USS LCSL 53 in the Pacific, in 1945.Commander Eric Dietrich-Berryman, Ph.D., U.S. Navy (retired) headed the logistics for the removal of twenty-two tons of the downeaster St. Mary wrecked in 1890 near Fitzroy, Falklands and their return to Maine for re-assembly in a building specially re-enforced for the purpose at Maine State Museum, Augusta. He served as bicentennial coordination officer on Secretary Middendorf's staff, 1974-1976."},{"Title":"Lewin of Greenwich: The Authorised Biography of Admiral of the Fleet Lord Lewin","review":"Admiral of the Fleet Lord Lewin's biography, well researched and well written, highlights the human side of one of the Royal Navy's most important flag officers. Lord Lewin's career from young fighting officer and ship commander in WWII to his elevation to the highest ranks in the British military exemplifies the type of officer any navy should be striving to acquire. One who is not only a superb ship-handler and war-fighter but also one who skillfully and with great care \\"handled\\" men of rank and the ranks equally well, if not better. From his days as a young officer he was noted as being a exceptional leader of men by a wide variety of senior officers, some of whom weren't necessarily his best friends by any means. Today's young men can take away many lessons in leadership and mentoring from a reading of this outstanding officer's career. Of particular note was his ability to command and lead without pretension or hubris -- he allowed his accomplishments to speak for him, a characteristic sadly lacking in many officers of rank in today's world. His ability to deal with the prickly world of politicians equaled his ability to deal with the problems of naval command, another exceptional and rare quality. Lord Lewin's career is a true gift of importance to any who would desire to rise up the ranks and become a leader of men, a navy, and exemplify the proud traditions of the Royal Navy in peace and war.The fact that the book does not cover every aspect of his career, particularly as a senior officer, does not detract in any way from the importance of the book. Most of those issues -- mentioned by other reviewers -- despite today's \\"political correctness\\" were of a trivial nature then and actually more so today in most respects, particulary in comparison to the issues of peace and war and the survival of a viable fleet in the face of the economic situation of the time. If I were to fault the book in any respect, it would be that it needed a thorough final edit, which doesn not detract in any significant way from the narrative about a truly exceptional naval officer. I would highly recommend this book as required reading for naval officer cadets or midshipman of any nation and an excellent read for any who has an interest in naval history."},{"Title":"Lewin of Greenwich: The Authorised Biography of Admiral of the Fleet Lord Lewin","review":"From the politically obedient point of view which Rear Admiral Richard Hill, editor for the past quarter century of the Naval Review, so admirably represents, Lewin's career was, to all intents and purposes, impeccable. Here was a man who was always behind the right desk in Whitehall at the right time. British admirals tend to fall in love with their own image, and Hill is no exception: his admiration of Lew&iacute;n borders on adoration.After war service, specialization in gunnery and early promotion to commander, Lewin went to Whitehall in the early fifties where he played a major role in re-organising officer training. This was the time when plans were in hand to amalgamate the War Office, the Air Ministry and the Admiralty into the bureaucratic leviathan known as the MoD.There followed a succession of plum jobs: command of the \`C' class destroyer HMS Corunna, service aboard the Royal Yacht Britannia, and command of the Dartmouth Training Squadron. After that, from 1963 until his retirement in 1982 as Chief of Defence Staff, Lewin was at, or very close to, the centre of naval politics.Hill does a fine job of recounting Lewin's career as a Whitehall Warrior, and to that extent his book is of great value - though, infuriatingly for researchers, one cannot copy excerpts from Amazon's \`look inside this book' facility.So that's the bright side of the coin. The other side - studiously avoided by Admiral Hill - is murkier.1. In 1966, under pressure from Wilson & Healey,\`the Naval Staff [...] reluctantly embarked upon a paper entitled The Navy without Carriers' (p. 170). Why? Were they afraid that they might dip out on promotion &iacute;f they didn't comply? No one in MoD had the guts to tell the politicians that depriving the Royal Navy of its carriers would deprive the fleet of its ability not only to strike at the enemy (the Cold War was at its height) but also to defend itself from air attack. Year after year, captains and admirals lined up in Buckingham Palace to receive rewards for their political obedience in the shape of gongs and knighthoods. The effect on morale was devastating. People left in droves.2. There was bitter rivalry between the RAF and the RN. Politicians played off one service against the other, with the result that the Naval Staff adopted a \`can do' cut and stretch policy that had (and still has) an adverse effect on recruiting and retention. In his various hats, Lewin cooperated with this policy.3. In the realm of public relations, the Royal Navy has a record of secrecy, paranoia and cover-up: (i) &Iacute;n 1962 the press were sent on a coach tour (by Lewin's colleague Admiral LeBailly) in order to hush up the fact that the British nuclear submarine HMS Resolution had been damaged in a collision with the escorting US destroyer on the morning that the first test firing of a Polaris missile was scheduled to take place. The press were deliberately misinformed that the telemetry needed further adjustment. (ii) After the sinking of the Belgrano in 1982, HMS Conqueror's signal log was conveniently \`lost' - and yet no officer was court-martialled for the offence. (iii) MI6, which has very close links with the RN, knew that the infamous \`blockade of Beira' was being by-passed by Ian Smith with the assistance of South Africa. Yet for twelve years from 1966-1978, HM ships were kept on patrol off Beira. I served on two of those patrols, and every man jack on board knew that we were wasting our time and the tax payers' money. All we achieved was to put Mugabe in power.4. The task force sailed for the Falklands in 1982 with inadequate weapons to shoot down aircraft and no airborne early warning capability. The low-flying air threat was virtually ignored as was the threat from Exocet missiles, which the naval staff regarded as \`a bit of a toy' (p.262).5. On p.397, Hill writes: \`Controversy over the sinking of the Belgrano was kept going by three sorts of people: those who were trying to make money or reputation out of it, those who were seeking to make political capital, and those who were genuinely shocked by what they saw as unnecessary violence and escalation [...] Lewin made no differention.' This, in my opinion, is a most extraordinary statement. It reveals the underlying arrogance of admirals who apparently believe they can sweep away opposing arguments with a heavily gold-braided cuff.6. Lewin's support for Trident has had an adverse effect not only on the Royal Navy but on the Army and RAF as well. Trident has bled all three services white in terms of equipment and morale, and deters nothing and no one. Hill seems to take it for granted that we all agree with the policy of Mutual Assured Destruction. He reports that Lewin selected Admiral Henry Leach to be his successor as First Sea Lord partly on the basis that Leach was \`sound on Trident' (p.320).7. Hill is very cagey about Lewin's attitude to homosexuality in the Royal Navy, which was a burning issue when he was 1SL and CDS. While it was widely known, in the late seventies, that two retired rear admirals were in a gay relationship, the mere admission of homosexual orientation on the part of an ordinary sailor was enough to have him booted out \`Services No Longer Required'. This injustice did not go unnoticed on the lower deck.Over three decades Admiral Lewin and his contemporaries on the Naval Staff created an image of the Royal Navy as being headed by arrogant, self-satisfied and secretive people (Freemasonry is strong among submariners and engineers) who believe that they are always right because they are admirals, and that they are admirals because they are always right. Hill's biography does nothing to persuade us otherwise.The Raging of the SeaJannaway's Mutiny"},{"Title":"Lewin of Greenwich: The Authorised Biography of Admiral of the Fleet Lord Lewin","review":"A must read for those who are interested in the Royal Navy.

They are basic good solid food recipes and assume that the reader can boil water without instructions. These are not extremely detailed how-to recipes on how to construct a salad, or tear lettuce, or fry eggs. They detail basic ingredients and give ways to combine them without fuss. Mostly for women or family cooks who had so many things to do that they couldn't spend a great deal of time watching the pot boil. They had to put on the soup and let it simmer for a few hours stirring occaisionally. I especially liked the simple split-pea soup recipe, the onion soups, and some of the rice pudding recipe ideas. There are more complex recipes should one desire to try them.The simplicity of ingredients is not because these folks were not inventive, or somehow crushed by their poor and difficult lives into a miserable grey existence devoid of flavor and taste. It indicates rather that the availability of fresh, non-hybrid, non-corporate farmed ingredients was assumed by the writer. The significance of this is missed by many. The fruits and vegetables, the grains and meats used in these recipes were full flavor and robust. The simplicity of the recipes allows the flavor of the food itself to show thru. There is no need for elaborate combinations of spices to cover up the styrofoam-like taste of supermarket veggies, hybridized for appearance and shelf-life, for example. It just wasn't yet a part of the reality of the era in which this book was written. And the quality of the food they ate was vastly different from what we are forced to make do with.There are very good instructions here on how to do things like pickling pork, curing meat, dressing chicken, cooking small game birds like pigeon or quail. There are a few recipes on soups in large quantity for 'distribution to the poor'. Delightfully, there are also some basic housewifely recipes for possets, teas, and other home remedies for colds, flu, dropsy and other digestive disorders. As a practicing herbalist I can say that the recipes I read in this gem of a book, although not extensive, are valid and useful. Come to think of it, they had to be.If you wish to imagine yourself better off than people at some other time in history, AKA 'we're so much more modern and privileged', then download the book, it is free and you actually might learn something. If you want to believe yourself a hip gourmet who only cooks in 1/2 hour segments with food pre-prepared and purchased in small packages from the supermarket, then pass on by, this book is not for you.But if you have an understanding of basic cooking, as well as an interest in historical recipes and simple goodness, then this is an excellent book, clearly written and well formatted for Kindle, and you can make your own substitutions for ingredients and methods as it suits you. There are many things that our era has that were not yet available when this book was written, and you might need to find a contemporary ingredient or two. Sadly, we have lost the two most precious things that these folks had in abundance: self-reliance and TIME."},{"Title":"A plain cookery book for the working classes","review":"Many recipes left me drooling.

He provides detailed instruction for the working class housewife on how to make economical versions of plum pudding, homemade mincemeat, preserved rhubarb, and how to bake her own bread which he assures her is more nutritious and delicious than buying bread from bakeries where she will not know what kind of inadequate flours and fillers they have used.He also devotes an entire chapter to how to make beer.

I won't say it is triggering, but it is not useful or helpful. Anyone reading this book who struggles with an eating disorder won't be surprised by the intricate details of the book. However, for someone in recovery or -just don't get it. I will give you better reason. It is a very short book, probably written in a couple of days-if that. It is repeatitive and appears to be the author's quest to become proud of her accomplishments-albeit she is not at all recovered. I found it sad the author is so disconnected from her true self and that she would write without a publisher who would steer her in a better direction. For, I believe we need more books on Eating Disorders but if you are going to get something, spend your money on Life Without Ed, or sht even go for Wasted (which I think is very triggering but definitely well written and a piece of literary genuis).

This volume is a reference guide and is a good basis, but the meat of Talmud study takes place in the rest of the series.The main problem with studying Talmud is that at any point in the Talmud, you are expected to know the rest of the Talmud. The way to circumvent this problem is to study Talmud with a group and make sure there is at least one rabbi presence (two or more is optimal since much of the learning comes from the divergent viewpoints and the tension in between.)What Steinsaltz seems to be trying to do is to place almost every commentary into the his series. This is great for the commentaries, however if you are not familiar with the particular tractate (Ketubos and Bava Metziah are the tractates currently published but there are other ones.) or the argument you will lose the thread of the argument and something that relies on you remembering a statement made a page back is going to be difficult since most Talmud &quot;pages&quot; (long story but there is a popular class in which you study a Talmud page a day) are taking about 4-7 pages to play out.This is an invaluable book in conjunction with a class. It is also a great series if you have already studied these tractates and would like to come back and see what you've missed (and in Talmud study you do tend to miss a few things, especially if you are starting out and you don't know all the context.)However, I would recommend the Artscroll Talmud if you are a beginner."},{"Title":"The Talmud, The Steinsaltz Edition: A Reference Guide (English and Hebrew Edition)","review":"This reference work is a wonderful introduction to the Talmud. It explains what the Talmud is, outlines and describes the various tractates, provides a definition of key terms, has a dictionary which translates key Aramaic concepts. I used it the way I sometimes in the past have used encyclopedias or dictionaries to help me fill gaps in my own knowledge, and to understand more clearly vague terms that I had a rough but not certain idea of.This reference work is an introduction to the Talmud as a whole. But the reader should understand that the Talmud is not a book to be read by oneself and understood by oneself. I believe that that is impossible. The Talmud must be studied with others, and this is the way traditional Jews ' learn' it. Thus however valuable this reference work is it cannot be a substitute for ' learning ' the Talmud. For this one must connect with some kind of Jewish communal framework, and connect too with those who have wider knowledge and experience.

For the Christian who wonders about the relevance of Scripture to life -- and what exegesis can mean for lay people of faith -- this Reference Guide can serve as an introduction to their own faith reading. For the youngster attracted to the classics of the East, as Rabbi Steinsaltz was for many years, the book can serve to teach just what books _are_, how to use them, how to be captivated and even captured without being enslaved. For the Jew whose Hebrew -- and Aramaic, and Greek, and history, and.. -- are not up to full-time Talmudic study, this guide can be just that, a guide, and one which will very likely lead to buying the rest of the English language volumes as they appear.

The book ends with the well-mingled culture -- a combination of good East and West culture. The book is printed in very big fonts and are easy to read. It does not take a long time to read, but it tells a wonderful story. In some way, I value this higher than Pearl's most famous work The Good Earth. A book suitable for people who are curious about ancient Chinese culture. (Note, nowadays we Chinese no longer do such things as binding feet or kneeling down before elders and so on) Enjoy your reading!"},{"Title":"East Wind: West Wind","review":"This was a quick and easy read told in the first person through the eyes of a Chinese woman. Also it's clear that the writer's own loyalty to the Western thought of romantic love is all over this story. It is this notion that ultimately drives the narrator to give up her old ways and accept the new.Buck describes how difficult it is for one to accept change in age-old rituals. Although many of the traditions are seen as unnecessary, foolish or just plain sadistic, it's difficult to question them after growing up in a culture where these traditions have been practiced for thousands of years. The narrator is a good vehicle to show how upsetting, confusing and frustrating it can be to incorporate these changes into one's life. Time and time again the theme of the generation gap is revealed, showing how many people simply cannot be changed.Although many of the following issues came into strong play in this novel, it wasn't so much a search for better opportunity, nor political freedom, independence, nor education, that was the big catalyst for change, as was the simple concept of romantic love.This was a lovely, bittersweet story with a seemingly very realistic portrayal of how a family rooted in tradition would react to their children, who want to break from tradition. A classic issue, regardless of what era or culture in which one lives."},{"Title":"East Wind: West Wind","review":"This is a lovely novel, beautifully written and insightful on romantic love and on duty in the Chinese culture of the early 20th century...but it lacks the \\"great\\" quality of The Good Earth, which is on my top ten list of all time! I liked the characters here but do not feel attached to them as I finish the book, which is disappointing. A nice read but not one of Mrs. Buck's best. For really super reading with a bit more dimension, try Peony and The Three Daughters of Madame Liang, among others!"},{"Title":"East Wind: West Wind","review":"Their's is an arranged marriage. She is brought up with traditional Chinese customs regarding marriage and he has been educated in the States as a doctor and has learned some Western ways. You will fall in love with the characters as they fall in love with one another and blend the ways of the East with the ways of the West."},{"Title":"East Wind: West Wind","review":"This was an eyeopening view of a chinese family to the west.We live in a flat world now and are so familiar with everything of the west. Our concept of beauty and desirable traits in the opposite sex are derived in a major way from Hollywood. It was interesting to come across how all things foreign was view by a chinese family unexposed to any but their own culture. 'Unfortunate blonde hair' a view expressed by a young chinese wife of her husband's white woman friend would be similar to what my great grand mother in India would have said of appearances she was not familiar with. Of course thanks to the global media, beauty isn't stereo typed now and we are becoming more open to other looks and cultures and rightly so too. Pearl S Buck has done us all a favour by recording what the chinese culture was like in the early part of the 20th centuary.Her writing as usual is superlative as in all her books. Id recommend it to all those who are keen to learn of a different way of life that existed prior to our 'Flat World'"},{"Title":"East Wind: West Wind","review":"Of course it deserves five stars because of the great author, knowledge of Chinese Culture, good characters and wonderful story. It involves the delicate balance between the old Chinese customs of ancient medicine vs science, the choosing of ones own mate vs the old custom of parents making the choice. In this case, the family is not peasant but prominent, but the culture just as interesting. There is no action in this book but more of a love story. No peasants trying to survive in poverty but a cast of the entitled and a struggle of wills."},{"Title":"East Wind: West Wind","review":"It's Pearl S. Buck's first novel, and you can easily see that she was headed for a long, illustrious career as a writer. An American author who spent the majority of her life living in China, therefore writing about what she knows best in a totally unique fashion - a lover of the Eastern, Chinese culture, but at the same time still possessing the Western ideas of romantic love, marriage, etc... This is what this little story is about - a young woman falling in love and struggling for her own freedom, her own individuality (something that most of us take for granted living in today's Western society).This is a wonderful little jewel of a book and I highly recommend it. If you enjoyed the 'The Good Earth' (one of my all-time favorites) then you will definitely enjoy this story. Ms. Buck writes with such effortless fluidity and charm. She keeps her prose simple yet elegant at the same time. The story also is quite educational in regards to Chinese culture. I can't believe that it has been 18 years between the time I've read 'The Good Earth' and 'East Wind: West Wind' (the only two Buck novels I've read). I can guaranty that I won't make that mistake again. After reading this story, I am very motivated to read something else by her.WHAT A FANTASTIC STORYTELLER BUCK IS!!!"},{"Title":"East Wind: West Wind","review":"This is a lovely read, it is shorter and more light-hearted than Good Earth.

Robertson gives us an inside look at the impact of segregation in sports (golf in particular), politics and societies social values of the late 40s and early 50s. I especially appreciated the biographical sketches of the major players in the civil rights case. It is an element often lacking in general historical recounts. A view of history which shows how ordinary citizens can have a significant impact on important events in our lives. I recommend this to avid golfers to see how their sport was transformed by these events.Robertson knows his history and tells it through the lives of ordinary citizens. Excellent footnotes.A good companion book to this is \\"Life is So Good\\" by George Dawson and Richard Glaubman. A story that also has its roots in East Texas."},{"Title":"Two Trees (The Luthier's Diary Series)","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time.

It shows what love should be and it gave me a desire to be a better person. I'm also a bigger tipper now.I found that many of the things written in the book about Guarneri, Stradivari, and other great violinists and luthiers are very accurate.

Every time I would finish a chapter, I had a sudden urge to go play my violin, or to call my loved ones and tell me what they meant to me. This book has an uplifting power that's rarely seen in the world anymore. In a culture where anything with meaning has to be blatantly spelled out, this book is delightful in that it lets you draw your own conclusions from the information presented.I work for a master luthier, and the depictions of the luthier are a masterful work of part reality, part legend, and part embellishment. Kevin Lee has taken the legends about luthiers, the misconceptions, and the actuality, and meshed them into an amazing fantastical composite. Yet somehow, he's done so in a manner that leaves you questioning how much is real and how much is not.On an earlier edition of the book, the genre is on the spine and listed as \\"Fiction?\\".

A good read all around."},{"Title":"Two Trees (The Luthier's Diary Series)","review":"This is a great romance! A romance between two people and the love of the author and the main character with the violin. Kevin Lee Luthier knows about making violins but he also knows quite a lot about writing a good novel. I do not play the violin but it is my favorite instrument and I am a huge Paganini fan. I loved all the references to Paganini and I'm looking forward to reading some biographies on him which I haven't done for many years. Seeing Richard Gaspar as an adult and through flashbacks as he is growing up is a great way to tell this story, it really works well. The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars, and it may be nit picking, is the way the author uses quotations around words or phrases for emphasis. This is done so much it gets annoying. But, the story itself is excellent. I don't know if I'll read others in the series, they don't sound as good as this one, but I may. If you love violins this is must reading. Even if you don't, but you like a good romance, you'll like this book."},{"Title":"Two Trees (The Luthier's Diary Series)","review":"If a book could be given a ten star rating I would rate this book a ten. Written in a style and manner that inspires and entertains to such a degree that I found it near impossible to put this book down until it was finished! This book is not only a story about true love between two young people, but instills a love for music, violins, and excellence in all things. I bought a violin and have commenced playing it daily! A book for all ages, and one that in 30 years you will still remember. A book for men, women, and children from all walks of life who desire to make tomorrow better than today.

He discovers things about himself that have molded his life and he now can choose to stay in the hardened way he has molded or make a leap of faith into a new life with the new violin.

After reading the latest I was a little disappointed by the story but still hopeful that with all the new additions to the team future volumes will definitely keep up the good work.The title refers to the fact that several prominent characters from past Net Force books make their last appearances as members of the Net Force, including Alex Michaels, the Commander in the first seven books. He hands down the title (hence &quot;Changing of the Guard&quot;) to Thomas Thorn, while the field unit is handed from General Howard to Abe Kent, a former Marine.Not too soon after the changeovers does Net Force find itself involved in a case where a disc containing the names of former Russian spies falls into its hands. The disc leads to an attempted kidnapping of one of Net Force's top computer agents, Jay Gridley. We learn that the attempt was perpetrated by a hitman assigned by a multibillionaire who is afraid the disc's information will reveal him to be a former spy himself and will stop at nothing to make sure that the info never sees the light of day. But when the kidnapping gets bungled and Gridley ends up in a coma, Net Force has to stop the attacker and find out what is hidden on the disc.The story is a seeming partial re-treading of a previous Net Force story that also sent Gridley into a coma, but this time it isn't as engrossing as before. As for the new Net Forcers (Thorn and Kent), they get a rough first start in the mission field but hopefully their next adventure will definitely give them time to flesh themselves out to the reader.Overall, this was an alright chapter in the Net Force legacy, but not all that satisfying to those who have been with it since book 1."},{"Title":"Changing of the Guard (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 8)","review":"Okay, I'll admit I knew before I picked up this book that I was leaving the real world behind and taking a trip down the road of great imaginations, but come on... a guy teaching himself control his own brain waves? While the majority of this book has some good sub plots and suspense, I found the outcomes a little to predictable. The \\"good guys alwarys win\\" seems to hold true with this series and while I like to see the good guys win, this particular book doesn't offer much to leave you guessing about what might happen next... though I'll still pick-up one of the other books in the series in anticaption of a better plot."},{"Title":"Changing of the Guard (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 8)","review":"It is an interesting story but there are some errors that will distract the reader from the fiction that the author is creating. I can't believe that Clancy does not know the difference between the Baltics and the Balkans (see page 121). I hope it is a big oversight or a super-sized typo. Or could it be that Clancy is going to have the Serbs and the Croats who live in the Balkans go looking for oil in the Baltics where the Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians live? Is he creating a new fictional ethnic conflict for a future book? Or is it lack of geographic knowledge? Also, when Eduard is escaping from the mansion, at times I visualize him on a bicycle, and at other times on a motorbike. Do I have a reading problem, or is there a writing problem here? Note, this is not to criticize the book as a whole, but just to criticize specific instances of lack of quality control that caused me to deduct one star."},{"Title":"Changing of the Guard (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 8)","review":"This book was one of the worst in the series. However it is important to remember not to criticize Clancy. He doesn't even write the books. This one is in fact written by Steve Perry.

This is a really bad book."},{"Title":"Changing of the Guard (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 8)","review":"The Net Force series was a good concept when it began, but has steadily gone down hill. This most recent effort appeared to continue the trend toward cranking these out by a predetermined recipe, rather than using this the opportunity of changing main characters to break new ground. Even the high tech angle was getting decidedly RW. And the story abruptly ended like someone reached a predetemined page length and said, well we have to end this thing. Can't we spice up the recipe?"},{"Title":"Changing of the Guard (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 8)","review":"As someone has already stated, this book brings a dark shadow to the series. Having been an avid fan of the NetForce titles from the very begining, I was disapointed in some ways with this latest offering. The action feels mechanical, and you keep getting that feeling of &quot;...havent I read this one before?&quot; even though many of the details and characters have been changed. On that note, if you are an avid fan Im afraid you'll be a little disapointed in the send off of Alex, Toni, and General Howard. It is a hollow farewell to say the least. The series has always been great in character development but I would have to agree that this book spends too much time on trivial details that dont need to be expressed. IF THERE IS AN UPSIDE.....and there always is, it is in the way things are dealt with toward the end of the book. As a director Alex Michaels was willing to bend the law at times - As the new director Thomas Thorn is willing to bend it around until it starts making snapping noises. All in all, a good read, but not the best. I do hope the series continues though, there is potential here."},{"Title":"Changing of the Guard (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 8)","review":"During the trip home from Orlando, I was able to finish up Tom Clancy's Net Force: Changing Of The Guard. This is part of his paperback series that bear his name but is written by others. The setting is about 10 years in the future, and the action revolves around a government office called Net Force. This group uses computer technology and the Internet to track down criminal activity. In this installment, the NF group has obtained an encrypted disk with the names of all the Russian spies throughout the world. The breakdown of the code is going slow, but a certain sleeper spy in the US is willing to do anything to keep the government from learning of his involvement. When the top NF codebreaker is nearly killed in a kidnapping attempt, there is an all-out attempt to find the killer and the person who might have hired him.Generally speaking, it's a good read. It will make more sense if you've followed the series, as there are references to past people and events that you won't know about otherwise. It doesn't kill the book if you haven't done the reading, but it helps. I personally like near-future techno-thriller novels, so this one works for me. It's not as action-packed as others in the series, but it is still a pleasant diversion."},{"Title":"Changing of the Guard (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 8)","review":"I have read all of Clancy's books and most of his Net Force books and this is the worst one by far. Fortunately I was able to read it quickly since I could skim over most of the book since it was material unrelated to the plot. The books spends a ridiculous amount of time on fencing, guitars and a VR world that to me is completely ridiculous and unbelievable. Look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Bloodsworth Island","review":"Dr. Marcus Gallagher holds virtually omnipotent power over Bloodsworth Island in the Chesapeake Bay. His followers are a carefully assembled group of doctors, a &quot;body&quot; thoroughly indoctrinated into his principles. Hs myriad principles rely upon eliminating free thought and complete dedication to his dream of eliminating disease. Rigid control of the doctors in his employee insures that no one on the outside knows of the methods Dr Gallagher intends to employ while taking funding from the Federal Government to further his research. Rather than healing those plagued with debilitating disease, such as Cystic Fibrosis, he plans to eradicate the population who carry the genes for such disease. Human testing has already begun.The book begins with Gene Nolan, one of three doctors sent to Orani tribe in the Ecuadorian rain forest. The doctors inject each tribe member with an immunization that actually kills with great rapidity. When a doctor challenges what they are doing, the Paladin Alfred injects the dissenter with the killing shot. As he dies, he breaks one of the Principles, he tells Gene that no one leaves &quot;the body&quot; alive. When Gene asks their leader Alfred about what happened, he's reminded of the seventh principle; that is, &quot;Components of the body would be told whatever they needed to know.&quot;The overly done theme of research scientists playing God-like eugenics achieves a new freshness in the hands of authors Jeff Slate and David Rearden. These authors combine many of the strongest elements of our culture to new ends, constructing a dangerous and destructive world. The echoes of Big Brother watching, keeping the &quot;body&quot; in line with careful observance and control seems all too plausible in this information age of easy tracking and recording. Likewise, the echoes the rituals and rites that have brought clarity and insight to many religious followers give this fascinating novel chilling spiritual overtones. In addition, the Orani tribe lends a chilling lesson as their systematic destruction ends with their village burning, destroying all evidence in a frightening echo of the Holocaust. The simplistic plot could have used a few more twists to fully satisfy this reader. In addition, the author's tone sounds more like a reporter giving the facts rather portrayed the expected emotion; however, it still makes for a fascinating read. Recommended."},{"Title":"Bloodsworth Island","review":"I enjoyed &quot;Bloodsworth Island&quot;, and that enjoyment was enhanced from having lived in the MD/DC area for some time.The novel tells the story of a medical doctor (Dr. Nolah) who is extremely skilled at his work -- and extremely insecure concerning his own value and worth as a person. As such, he is the natural target/victim of a cult of personality surrounding a brilliant but quite mad biotech research scientist (Dr. Gallagher) who is plotting a horrific biological crime -- the genocide of all humans carrying certain defective genes -- all in the name of improving the species (and, of course, doing the work of God). The research is being carried out (fraudulently) under the auspices of the Federal Government. (As a former civil servant, this was both amusing and frightening. See my review for &quot;Q-Clearance&quot;.) The novel chronicles the growing self confidence of Dr. Nolan in his own worth as a person and as a researcher -- and his breaking free of the clutches of evil. The book does not climax until the very end, and the authors have pulled together the various plot threads quite well.A number of observations:The authors have described the &quot;cult personality&quot; quite well, both in terms of how such a person operates and how intelligent people can get sucked into such a web.The scenario is believable -- which, in and of itself is frightening.There is a fundamental ethical tension in scientific research (one pointed out repeatedly in the novels of Michael Crighton), and exemplified well in this novel, namely this: Just because we CAN do a thing, it does not necessarily follow that we SHOULD do a thing. To my mind, this is becoming an increasingly important question.The &quot;love/hate&quot; relationship involving the extremely abusive character Richard with members of his family rang true with me -- and, I suspect, would also ring true with those involved in counseling in such situations.In addition, the authors have succeeded in producing a novel which does not have to rely on titallating sex, mindless violence, and gross profanity to move the plot along. In this day and age, such a thing is refreshing.The biggest weakness in my opinion? The reliance on the &quot;fringe supernatural&quot; for certain elements of plot resolution. Not believable, not necessary, and certainly not integral to the plot.All in all, I enjoyed this book. I hope that the authors produce more novels in this genre."},{"Title":"Bloodsworth Island","review":"An author's first novel is always a shot in the dark for the reader. Jeff Slate and David Rearden's new book, 'Bloodsworth Island,' is entertaining, though occasionally has it's flaws. The story centers around the efforts of one genetic researcher, Dr. Gene Nolan, to understand just what is going on at his research lab, the Davenport center on Bloodsworth Island off the coast of Maryland. During his quest he is forced to realize that the high ideals that the center was based on are only a front for a sinister group of men who will stop at nothing to see their demonic dreams become reality. The writing style is at times weak, and often choppy. The authors take too much time telling the story to really develop any of the characters save a few. That being said, where 'Bloodsworth Island' succeeds is in the feeling of paranoia that it establishes. At many times the same creepy feeling that Orwell gave us in '1984' is present and the conflict of conscience that Dr. Nolan experiences makes for fun and entertaining reading. Also interesting are the little touches the authors include. For instance the birthday of Dr. Gallagher, who runs the Davenport center, is givin as April 20th, (Hitler's birthday), 1939, (the year the Second World War began). If you're looking for a fun thriller with shades of Orwell and Huxley this might be one you should check out."},{"Title":"Bloodsworth Island","review":"Gene Nolan is a doctor virtually unemployable elsewhere when he is hired by Dr. Marcus Gallagher to work at Davenport Center, his research facility on Bloodsworth Island in the Chesapeake Bay. All of Dr. Gallagher's employees have been subjected to a cult-like indoctrination and live by rigid, Draconian rules in what amounts to slavery. The goal of the Davenport Center is purportedly the eradication of genetically transmitted diseases, but Dr. Gallagher's goals are decidedly less than altruistic. This novel, quite reminiscent of &quot;1984&quot;, takes an interesting look at eugenics and genetic engineering and how a benevolent concept can be perverted when placed in the wrong hands. The writing team is obviously talented and I would anticipate that they have other stories up their sleeves."},{"Title":"Bloodsworth Island","review":"I'm so glad this book was brought to my attention. I receive so many books to review, it's hard to make a decision on what to read next. I'm just so thankful I put the others aside to read this first. It's a thriller that will keep you glued to your seat till the very end. Jeff &amp; David have written a masterpiece of suspense that just builds &amp; builds to the final climax. I believe and I hope there's a sequel in the works, and I'm sure there's a movie in the future for this exciting story.The story centers around Dr. Marcus Gallagher who is trying to eliminate genetically inherited disease in the world. Dr. Gallagher's goal is to create a more productive society by eliminating all the people with defective genes. He has enlisted many great doctors &amp; scientists to work at his advanced cult-like lab facility on Bloodsworth Island in the Chesapeake Bay. Dr. Gene Nolan is one such research physician who gives up his own identity and personal self to help Dr. Gallagher. However, he soon learns Dr. Gallagher has a plot to eliminate millions of people. Should Gene turn against Dr. Gallagher who has always been there for him, or do the right thing before this gets out of control?You get the feeling of being a member of a cult from this story, or being brainwashed by a leader who has taken over the minds of the people. It made me think of Hitler and Jim Jones and how they twisted the truth and managed to make so many people believe in them &amp; follow them. I highly recommend this book to everyone who enjoys a suspenseful read. I eagerly await Jeff &amp; David's next book!"},{"Title":"Bloodsworth Island","review":"I really wanted to be able to write a positive review for Rearden and Slate's Bloodsworth Island. I have a soft spot for new authors, and for that reason briefly considered whitewashing my evaluation. In the end, however, I felt compelled to be honest: this book lacks strength in almost every area.That's not to say there aren't elements here to praise. These two new authors clearly love to tell a story and know something about creating suspense, essential in a thriller. So what failed? The prose is bland and often awkward, and the characters, despite the authors' attempts to lay details on top of them, are two-dimensional. The main character, supposedly a man bright enough to be a doctor, someone who has come created an ingenious marker to identify cystic fibrosis carriers (and &quot;genetically perfect&quot; to boot) demonstrates the wit of a flea. I don't care if he IS a member of a cult; a man of that intelligence should have sensibilities greater than those of a five year old child. The authors seem to have confused brainwashing with brain removal. As for the premise, that cult leader Dr. Gallagher, with his evil genetic purity plan, has positioned himself favorably largely by his government contracts and contacts, is preposterous. The security clearance process required of people working on top secret projects (even if they don't work directly for the government) would reveal at once a cult, something the US goverment would dump in an instant. The above are just a few of many holes in this book.Rearden and Slate have accomplished what many aspiring writers never do: a finished book. Now they need to learn that a novel is more than an idea, a plot. Once they incorporate all the elements of fiction into their work, weaving each into the whole of the others, they will be well on their way to careers as fiction writers. I wish them the best of luck."},{"Title":"Bloodsworth Island","review":"Dr Marcus Gallagher, the administrator for the closely controlled Bloodsworth Island facilty, wants to rid the planet of all genetically interited disease.

His suspicion begins to point to the idea that perhaps Dr. Gallagher and his administrative team want to rid the Earth of all genetically transmitted gene carriers.In a suspensful, fast reading first novel, Slate and Rearden have come up with a truly frightening concept involving genetic research, and the strange gullibility of dedicated humanitarians. When Gene starts thinking in terms of the numbers of people this mass murder would involve, it becomes unthinkable; he must stop this insanity.This Action packed suspense novel really gave me some things to think about...and maybe changed my mind on previous ideas about genetic research. I'm looking forward to more innovative ideas from this team...a bright star in the new author galaxy. Beverly Rowe, reviewer for myshelf.com."},{"Title":"Bloodsworth Island","review":"The premise for the book is chilling and realistic, particularly with the amazing developments in the science of DNA mapping, cloning, and stem cell creations. The cover art is masterful. The name of the island (which actually is in the Chesapeake Bay) seems to be a complex synopsis of the premise (as in worthy blood). Bloodsworth Island is owned by the federal government, which suits the intrigue and plausible terrorism in the scenario.Dr. Marcus Gallagher could easily pass for the charismatic Jim Jones or the youthful Adolf Hitler. He has established a bio-research facility with the goal of eradicating those that he has judged to be genetically inferior humans. He exerts cult-like control and indoctrination over all of his employees, but the devotion of highly educated scientists is not realistic.The hero is Gene Nolan, a research physician who lost his residency and could never get another job until this golden apple was offered to him. I immediately thought that Dr. Gallagher had arranged this before the story begins. Being jobless and unemployable is what Dr. Gallagher holds over him, but it is not a strong enough reason to support the loss of individuality that is required. There are no ex-employees, except in graves.The writing is disjointed and hard to follow, almost as if too much information was edited out in trying to create a more mysterious environment. &quot;...The clandestine practice of medicine...&quot; is a clue to the intrigue with the overtones of &quot;black arts&quot; or witchcraft and wizards, which does fit the story.These are good ideas that need further development. Future books by Slate and Rearden should be a real treat.Victoria Tarrani"},{"Title":"Bloodsworth Island","review":"This is a book about an all too plausible form of biological terrorism. Or more accurately, perhaps, medical eugenicism. One man has created a vision and a plan for humanity that will change the world forever. For those who are chosen, it will become the perfect world, a world without inherited disease--all inherited disease.The man behind the plan is a brilliant, charismatic scientist, Dr. Marcus Gallagher. He wants to eliminate all genetically inherited disease, and he has created the most advanced research lab on the planet to do it. After hundreds of millions of dollars in funding and 10 years of research, the doctor is almost ready to implement his plan.Unfortunately for humanity, the doctor's idea of how to do this is not what you would expect. Instead of trying to cure people of inherited diseases, for example, cystic fibrosis, he is developing viruses that will instead attack the carriers, thereby removing them from the gene pool, allowing doctor Gallagher to achieve his vision of a genetically perfect world.Doctor Gallagher has gathered a brilliant and dedicated cadre of devoted scientists and doctors to help him develop and carry out this sinister plan. Furthermore, they have been subjected to a cult-like indoctrination and training so that they are absolutely loyal to Dr. Gallagher. They are now part of a new order, a new secret society that will transform the world. Nothing, it seems, can stop the evil Dr. Gallagher from carrying out his plan. If the doctor is able to implement it, millions of people will die.Among the many scientists and doctors on Bloodsworth Island, a small island in Chesapeake Bay which houses the lab, only one man, Dr. Gene Nolan, has doubts about the doctor and his plans. But how can one man stop the seemingly omnipotent Dr. Gallagher and his cadre of hundreds of absolutely loyal men? Will he be able to break free of the conditioning, will he be able to carry out his plan in time to stop the evil Dr. Gallagher?We may soon have the genetic knowledge that will make such a sinister plan possible. Combining a realistic scientific premise with a suspenseful story, this is an imaginative scientific thriller about a terrifying, but all too possible, future."},{"Title":"Bloodsworth Island","review":"This is an intriguing book by little-known authors.

I have never seen a man or woman give up their identity, needs, and desires in personal situations. Though highly trained, and do obey a commander, they do not stop thinking.

Reardon and Slate take some of these threats, throw in eugenics and cult behavior, and then mix all this up to create Bloodsworth Island.Gene Nolan is a young, idealistic doctor who loses his residency and flounders around until Dr. Marcus Gallagher becomes his mentor, employer, and father figure. Gene joins Dr. Gallagher and his \\"family\\" at the Davenport Center on Bloodsworth Island. Gene thinks he's there to help the family find a cure for horrible diseases, but Dr. Gallagher's plan is to eliminate carriers of disease. Nice work if you can get it, eh? In the meantime, Gene falls in love with Kelly even though this relationship violates the rules of the Center. Gene then proceeds to violate nearly all the principles that guide each member of the family at Davenport Center. All of these elements come together in a race to save the world from Dr. Gallagher's nefarious scheme.I like this premise. It's timely enough to be interesting and scary enough to add a touch of \\"what if?\\" However, the writing style here leaves much to be desired. The characters are underdeveloped to the point of being rather one-dimensional. I didn't have a feeling of suspense or surprise at any point of the story. The writing is flat. I can't write a novel myself, so I rely on others to create great stories and characters for me. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen here. Perhaps with more fiction experience, Slate and Rearden can combine their great ideas with great writing and characters. This is an interesting storyline, and if you can ignore some of the writing flaws, you'll probably enjoy it."},{"Title":"Bloodsworth Island","review":"In their first novel, Jeff Slate and David Rearden tackle the theme of the possible eugenicist uses of the current revolution in biotechnology. Attempting perhaps to emulate the success of Michael Critchton in penning medical thrillers for a popular audience, Slate and Rearden weave a fascinating tale involving a secret Chesapeake Bay laboratory, an evil scientist with a cult-type staff of followers, the extermination of an entire village of Ecuadorian natives, and a confused but ultimately noble protagonist who attempts to right the wrongs he discovers. All in all this makes for a quick and interesting read that might make it a fun take-along on a summer vacation. At the same time, however, the novel emerges as disappointing in some fundamental ways.What succeeds here is the apparent familiarity of the authors with various aspects of their topic. Clearly Rearden knows a lot about the biological issues presented in the story, and consequently the discussions of the genetic markers associated with certain diseases are convincingly thorough. The authors also are apparently familiar with the life and culture of some Ecuadorian natives, as the interaction between protagonist Gene Nolan and his native friend Hiaroma comes across as authentic. The geographical underpinnings of the suburban Maryland setting for much of the book is certainly accurate and well-described. Finally, the overall trajectory of the story is gripping enough to keep a reader's interest from start to finish.Unfortunately, the book also reflects the inexperience of these authors as novelists. The prose style is so basic and unadorned that I suspect any reasonably literate middle school pupil could race through the story effortlessly. Some may perceive this as a virtue, but I found the simple, bare-bones style of writing to be disappointing.A second set of problems involves the authors' selection of a serious biological/philosophical issue as their central topic. In portraying Marcus Gallaher as a latter-day eugenics mastermind, the authors have neglected to explicate sufficiently the philosophical, social, and political themes and issues that would likely be associated with such a hypothetical figure. Gallagher's Bloodsworth Island laboratory is supposedly &quot;top secret,&quot; and yet it's clear that after one or perhaps two of his dastardly &quot;experiments&quot; resulting in large-scale body counts inquiries would be launched and there would be a significant reaction against any futher work of this kind. End of story.The only possible way out of this quandry would be for the Bloodsworth Island effort to have garnered political muscle as part of some kind of broadly based movement. Certainly neo-Nazi ties would make for glamorous thematic material, but portrayal even of the level of public support enjoyed by eugenicists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries would have made for a richer overall story. Is there a significant basis in our current American society for this kind of future political movement? Exploration of some of of issues raised by this question would have made the novel far more socially relevant and very likely more frightening, as well.Overall, there is a striking lack of discussion of any kind of utopian (or dystopian) vision for a better future world that might contribute to Gallagher's alleged &quot;charisma&quot; among his followers. The hold Gallagher exercises upon his underlings is cult-like in ways that are ritualistic and silly, in fact, rather than plausible. And aside from his immediate staff, there is no 'movement' at all--thus, the potential for actual success of Gallagher's lonely efforts to &quot;rid the planet of genetically inherited disease&quot; would certainly be doomed from the start.Finally, there is a curious inclusion of some supernatural elements that include a fortune teller whose visions we apparently are supposed to take seriously This, along with the sudden (and temporary) acquisition of magical qualities by a shamanistic totem from Ecuador don't really fit with the matter-of-fact scientific tone that characterizes the rest of the book. It's almost a kind of &quot;deux ex machina&quot; to get the authors through particular portions of the story, or else they represent potshots against the &quot;hegemony of science.&quot; To me, however, these were not convincing inclusions.Despite the flaws in *Bloodsworth Island*, I will look forward to the next effort by these two young writers, as they have talent as storytellers and to their credit, they apparently wish to explore some scientific issues that raise serious ethical questions."},{"Title":"Bloodsworth Island","review":"Reading a book by a previously unpublished author is a bit like &quot;buying a pig in a poke&quot;; you never know what you are getting. I can still remember the thrill I felt almost 30 years ago when I first found and read the initial book by a then-unknown Stephen King. That's what keeps me experimenting with new writers, hoping the magic will strike once more. This is not a particularly bad book, but the writing isn't particularly good, and the dialogue is often quite stilted. The plot is very interesting, although there are what I felt to be some silly aspects to it.

The ability of the authors to tell a story, unfortunately, is not. The problem is the authors seem to lack storytelling skills. As a technology professional I admire their writing, which would sparkle if the book were a technical dissertation. However, when I read a novel (a rare thing), I want it to read like a novel and not like a technical document. If the authors take a few seminars on creative writing, learn how to use words to elicit emotions (except for disdain) and to engage the reader, then rewrite this book it would easily rate 5 stars.

Comic Cammy looks just like Video Game Cammy.However, based on what the other reviewers said it is dissappointing to learn that this TBP doesn't include the extra material found in the original comic books such as mini backstories that flesh out some of the characters. These backstories aren't really required to understand the story as most of these tidbits are reiterated in the main plot anyway such as Eliza almost leaving Ken because of his sport or Cammy being freed from Bison's mind warping by Rose.

It is a quick read with excellent artwork and an interesting story, and although there are some small parts of the story that are boring for a few characters, most of the story and battles are worthwhile. Do a search to find sample pages of what the artwork looks like. The book is in digest size, which is smaller than the comic book sizes. There is also an Ultimate SF book available which collects the entire four volumes and shows them in larger-than-comic-book-size pages if you can find that version.

CaveThis well-written and well-researched book (by which the bibliography alone underscores the extensive research done by the author) seeks to explain, clarify, and describe the general archetypal patterns of responses that surrounded Amerindian prophets who called \\"for the regeneration of the Native American way of life\\" and warned of the wrath of the Great Spirit. Making use of a combination of historical data, co-joined with stories detailing the various Amerindian prophets, Alfred A. Cave masterfully describes the rise of revitalization movements from the 1740s to the middle 1830s. He separates truth from legend, as he weaves a comprehensive and readable sequence of events that surrounds the prophets, their visions, and their personal spiritual experiences. The gist of the book explains the personal as well as tribal identity problems facing the prophets as they similarly declare the return to some form of communal life and the purging of \\"practices offensive to the Great Spirit\\". Cave explains, it is only through the \\"institution of new rituals\\", designed to win the favor of the Great Spirit; the \\"establishment of a new, separatists sacred community; and finally, the development of a pan-Indian coalitions\\", that natives can \\"preserve Indian lands from further white encroachments.\\"Dr. Cave begins with the Delaware prophet, Neolin, who was not the first to preacher to proclaim a return to early native practices and beliefs systems, sans European influences; but rather, posited as a prophet who represents a more symbolic overview of the early prophetic movements. Nonetheless, Neolin learned in a dream that the Creator was \\"displeased with his Indian children and that the sufferings that plagued them were the result their transgressions. Later, as word spread and even Pontiac recounted Neolin's \\"journey to heaven\\", the prophet's message identified numerous transgressions against the Master of Life. These included not only addiction to alcohol, the practice of polygamy and of witchcraft, promiscuity; but also, the idea that Indians depended on whites and could not live without them. Finally, to Neolin, the natives suffered because they had allowed whites upon their lands.In chapter 2, Cave describes another prophet, Lalawethika, who emerges from the disparaging depths of Native American lost lifeways. The thirty-year-old Shawnee, known as the Rattle, was considered early in his life as a, \\"scorned as a braggart, drunkard, womanizer, ad coward, fell into a stupor so profound that his family, believing him dead, began preparing his body for burial.\\" Amazingly, Lalawethika did not die, but awoke with a vision of the afterlife he described which encompassed elements of burning and hellish Christian imagery as the price for Indian past transgressions by those who did not follow his vision cultural renaissance and revitalization. By 1808 Lalwethika became known by his new name, Tenskwatawa, which meant \\"open door\\" or \\"he who opened the sky for men to go up to the Great Spirit.\\" According to Cave, Tenskwatawa \\"inspired the political movement and military alliance usually identified with his brother the celebrated war chief Tecumseh.\\"Cave clearly details in the third and one of the most prolific chapters of the book entitled: Tenskwatawa, Tecumseh, and the Pan-Indian Movement, Tecumseh's role in the revitalization movements. Cave elucidates Tenskwatawain's role, posited as the true prophet and the inspiration behind Tecumseh's 1811 organization of the league of Indian tribes. Threaded throughout the text, the author expands on the diverse and intricate tribal leadership roles that at times thwarted collective tribal cooperation. For example, after Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh moved to Wapakoneta and \\"challenged the leadership of the accomodationist chief Black Hoof and sought to convert the Shawnees there to the native gospel. They were unsuccessful,\\" and as Cave explains, \\"As members of the Kispoko band, the brothers lacked political stature, as leadership had been traditionally entrusted to the Mekoches.\\" Thus exemplifying the political difficulties faced by many the prophets identified in the book.Faced with discord, both brothers, Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh were further frustrated by their inability to achieve consensus among other tribal nations, they built the Prophets village near Greenville and hoped it would become the seedbed of Tenskwatawa's influence as word of his miracles and teachings reached other tribal nations. However, as Cave notes, at Prophetstown, the two brothers' vision of a new world order free of European influences could not be achieved overnight since \\"they were still dependent on whites for certain vital trade goods, for the repair of guns and metal implements, and, for a time, even food. They did not call for a total rejection of post contact innovations.\\" Nevertheless, given that Prophetown's numbers estimated at three-thousand, the community could not provide enough food for the followers. Additionally, in terms of political agenda, other chiefs from various nations refused to accept claims that that Prophetstown represented a \\"capital city of an all-encompassing Indian confederation committed to the preservation of existing boundaries.\\" Finally, after Tecumseh's death Thames, and the failed pan-Indian coalition, Tenskwatawa wanted to move his community to the River Raisin Michigan area. However, Governor Cass of Michigan and superiors in Washington thwarted his efforts. Finally, Tenskwatawa returned to live with the Shawnees in Kansas after spending more than a decade in Canada and died in poverty in 1836.Other messages from other prophets included a new separatist and sacred communal community that supported renewed pan-Indian alliances that worked to stop white expansion into Indian lands. In similar vein, the Creek \\"Red Stick\\" prophets also posited this motif and preached for the unification of all Indian peoples with new nativist traditions. In the chapter, Red Sticks, Cave sorts through the numerous accounts of natives identified as Upper and Lower Creek Indians but also those similar language families do not necessarily make for cooperation and unification. For example, the complexities of the term \\"Creek Nation\\" since it \\"would have no meaning to Native inhabitant of the Southwest in the seventeenth century.\\" Cave adds that the Creeks were a diverse group of peoples with a majority of those who were rooted in the Muskogean language families. Yet, some Creek militants \\"incorporated some of the dances and songs taught by Seekaboo,\\" a Shawnee holy man, \\"who remained with them after Tecumseh's departure, but their words and actions did not always reflect either the prophet's teachings or Tecumseh's political advice. The Muskogee world had their own prophets, and their own prophets had their own agenda and their own timetable.\\" Cave further acknowledges the difficulty and challenges associated with identifying individuals and that helped shaped native societies. Therein lays the difficulty in detailing the larger patterns of many Native societies, who, striving to find a return on their cultural losses, posited each their own tribal views thus thwarting efforts for total devotion to prophetic teachings and a complete return to native rituals and lifeways.In the Seneca Prophet chapter, Cave describes similar Native American responses against European cultural influences. For example, a Seneca prophet named, Handsome Lake described several beliefs systems, similar in nature to other prophets that also include the rejection of Euro-American values, a need to preserve ritual practices, to stop witchcraft, to not use love charms or \\"the secret poisons in little pouches,\\" and finally to prohibit the use of herbs to induce abortions. Tragically enough however, the infighting among Iroquois left no real single ruler of the nations, but instead fueled quarrelling and discontent among leaders of differing factions. Later Handsome Lake called for neutrality and opposed the call for armed resistance as encouraged by the Shawnee's prophet. Yet these cries for unification were challenged by Iroquois religious traditionalists, progressive secularists, and a few Christian converts, and among other rival leaders, like Red Jacket who too claimed he was the choice for leader of all Iroquois or all would suffer if they did not comply with the Creator's wishes.In the last chapter Cave describes a final prophet, Kenenkuk, whose Gospel resembled Christianity but still maintained a \\"nativist answer to the question of why his people suffered defeat and were afflicted by poverty and disease: Native Americans had offended the great Spirit by embracing the vices of the white man.\\" Like his predecessors, Kenenkuk was against alcohol, witchcraft and greed, and his religious teachings included similar themes of \\"sobriety, hard work, and peaceful co-existence with whites.\\"In conclusion, the fundamental contributions of Dr. Cave's research in this book describes in detail the historical applications of the origins and developments of the prophet movements and the syncretic religious practices and beliefs that were formed from the various prophets. Finally, the book reveals the archetypal tragic struggle between Native Americans and whites, between various tribes as leadership roles, and tribal milieus of the many tribal nations--all of which diminished as each prophet struggled to explain his message to his peoples. The only reactions left by the remnants of once powerful and numerous tribal nations whose numbers dwindled due to white encroachment, bio-invasions, and alcoholism, was that of relying upon and piecing together lost beliefs systems in an attempt to return to earlier lifeways, pitted against the backdrop of complex tribal relationships and leadership, and white influences and controls.Greg Robinson"},{"Title":"Prophets of the Great Spirit: Native American Revitalization Movements in Eastern North America","review":"Author Alfred Cave presents a lengthy treatise arguing the premise that an American Indian concept of a 'Great Spirit' evolved among divergent groups post contact with European missionaries. I enjoyed reading this history even though it presumes (speaking for my grandfathers,) that before we were ever known, that we had no traditions of our own upon which to deduce the white man's religious traditions contain similarities which we could name for ourselves in our own languages. After all, the barrier of languages existed well before these spiritual leaders endeavored to stir a pan-Indian yearning in our souls.Consequently, this work stands as a sociological analysis because it is based on anecdotes of those who encountered the authentic characters. Although there exist contradictory reports of the origins of the Shawnee Prophet La-lay-weth'ka (Tensquatawa), and his brother Tecumseh the great war chief, this volume favors that version of legend which has their family being one of many siblings abandoned by their mother after the death of their father. When she gives birth to triplets, Tecumseh, Tensquatawa, and a third brother who dies, a toddler, she returns to live with her father's people, leaving the Shawnee prophet and his brother to be raised by older siblings.It seemed remarkable to me that two chapters, a full 80 pages of the book are focused on the story of these two brothers, and the events that shaped them. Most of it is devoted to historical recounting, so it stands out amidst an otherwise sociological attempt at explaining the psychology of the peoples in conflict. The following historical citation profiles how murder was racially condoned when it involved killing an Indian (even one invited to a treaty negotiation):\\"British general Thomas Gage complained that 'all the people of the Frontiers from Pennsylvania to Virginia inclusive, openly avow, that they will never find a Man guilty of Murther[sic], for killing an Indian' Gage described the frontiersmen as a 'People...near as wild as the country they go in' and 'by far more vicious and wicked' than the Indians they sought to dispossess.\\" \\"In the same vein, Gov. John Penn of Pennsylvania had complained a year earlier that 'no jury in any of our frontier counties will ever condemn a man for killing an Indian. They do not consider it in the light of murder, but as a meritorious act'.\\"Although I don't necessarily accept the premise of this author and other ethnographers, being that nativistic religious expression is overly syncretic, (ie. borrowing from external religious sources without comprehension) it becomes quite clear in these pages how the Eastern American Indian prophets by processes, accomplished an attitude among their followers which demonized the old world spiritism of their ancestors. In contrast, those whose efforts were perhaps more successful, owing that they brought less destruction upon their own people, would include Kenekuk the Kickapoo prophet, and Handsome Lake the Seneca prophet. Readers can learn more of what these chiefs strove to achieve, in their own words, from the following sources,Spiritual Leaders (American Indian Lives)Kenekuk, the Kickapoo ProphetThe Code of Handsome Lake, the Seneca Prophet (Forgotten Books)I also concur with the previous reviewer that the bibliographical references in Prophets of the Great Spirit are indeed substantial. Readers should prepare themselves to patiently digest countless descriptions of the social attitudes and outbursts of missionaries, Indians and colonists. Complaints and characterizations without dialog get kind of heavy at times. I had to put it down several times and restart with a refreshed mind."},{"Title":"Danish Proverbs (Danish Edition)","review":"Danish Proverbs is now back in print.

May you also find what your \`grandmother used to say' and more.This book is a beautiful addition to personal collections, as well as a thoughtful gift.\\"That which is unsaid may be spoken, but the spoken cannot be unsaid.\\""},{"Title":"Your Mummy Is a Nose Picker (L.A.F. Bks.)","review":"Based on comments of 10 year old boy.) This book is the last in a series of four so far (NP from Outer Space, Planet of the NPs, Invasion of the NPs, and Your Mummy is a NP). The main gag in the whole series is that the aliens look like they are picking their noses, but they are really operating internal nose computers. Earth has just become the main tourist attraction for tourists from the planet Pan. Pants, as they are called, love to go to the dentist, be stuck in traffic jams, and sneeze. But they are not able to sneeze, so they might not visit, and the Earth might be moved past Pluto as a result. To stop this, Stan from Pan and Devin from Earth go back in time to ancient Egypt to bring back Nile Delta Goldenrod, a weed that Pants are allergic to. They goof and change history. Now the world is one big Egypt!"},{"Title":"Your Mummy Is a Nose Picker (L.A.F. Bks.)","review":"As an education major I had to read this for a Library Science class. The antics in the book had me laughing. I know young readers will be taken as well with the modern language and hilarity of the Nose picking trio. The author mixed historical information in with the plot. I think this will inspire young readers to read more about ancient Egypt and the mummies. For a quick entertaining read this summer this book has it for young people."},{"Title":"First Feelings","review":"As a single parent of a 2 1/2 year old boy, I have found this book to be the best teacher, guide, and sanity-saver since the day he was born. This book has given me concrete options for understanding and dealing with every perplexing behavior of my son's. He has a flourishing emotional life because of this book, and I have managed to keep sane.The book is easy to read, gives several solutions to each problem presented, has tables and lists to help explain concepts, and offers a contiguous view of the child and his family's development. If a parent could only read one parenting book, *this* is the one they should read, take to heart, dog-ear and memorize techniques from, through the start of pregnancy through all their children's first years. The family foundations and relationships it helps to establish make the most solid beginnings for family life. Thank you, Greenspans, for this seminal contribution!"},{"Title":"First Feelings","review":"This book is a must read for any parent that is worried about the emotional health of our society today. We live in a society of repressed emotions that come out in violent outbursts. This books tells parents how emotions develop in a baby and toddler and what we as parents can do to help our baby develop all of their emotions. It also teaches us how we can help our baby handle and express all emotions so that they don't become bottled up and come out in violent outbursts. Most of the advice in this book goes against conventional parenting advice, but in my view we've been following conventional advice for 50 years and look where it has gotten us. It is time for a new, more sensitive way of parenting that teaches our children that emotions are ok and can be expressed in appropriate ways. I give this book my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"First Feelings","review":"This is a wonderful book for new parents or even grandparents who want to understand how they can help their baby grow into a confident person who can have a full emotional range. The book also helps a parent understand his or her own feelings and how those can affect the baby. I give this book as a baby gift now."},{"Title":"First Feelings","review":"The Greenspans have offered up a concrete, easy to understand gathering of what all new (and maybe not so new) parents should know about infancy and toddlerhood. The best thing next to self esteem a parent can offer a child is to teach that child an emotional language. &quot;This feeling goes with this label...&quot;. A child begins to associate, &quot;Oh, so THAT'S what this funny feeling is about&quot; and before long you have an individual who is aware of feeling states and then moves on to appropriatley expressing them. Give this gift to YOUR child!"},{"Title":"First Feelings","review":"I'm a therapist, and this book has helped me understand the milestones beyond the physical development.

Highly recommended for parents, caregivers, therapists, etc. who want to insure their kiddo's emotional health and development is on track."},{"Title":"First Feelings","review":"I think I am too analytical to appreciate this book. It seems as though no-one proof-read it before publishing.

As an Emotional Intelligence Coach, I strongly recommend this book. Your child's EQ can't develop farther than yours. Take an assessment and see how yours is, get some EQ coaching from a trained and certified EQ coach, read this book and get to work. Your child's future depends upon it."},{"Title":"The Walk-Out Woman : When Your Heart is Empty and Your Dreams Are Lost","review":"Having read this book, I personally recommend it to marriages that are hurting and in trouble.

I did not even finish reading it."},{"Title":"The Walk-Out Woman : When Your Heart is Empty and Your Dreams Are Lost","review":"Despite the title and picture on the front (woman walking away), this book encourages you to stay in your marriage and fix what's broken. It has 17 chapters, all worth your reading.I got the most out of 1) chap 6: the Downside of Divorce; 2) chap 9: This Lady has the Blues; 3) chap 10: Different Walls; and 4) chap 5: Take Care of Yourself. I've given this book to all my very best friends, regardless of the state of their marriage. This Christian book has much to offer for both young & old marriages. Reading it can only improve your marriage and your own sanity!!My husband liked the book too and insisted on doing the exercises. It's not a big put-down on the male race but a loving, Christian based guide to improving your relationship with your best friend.Add this to your shopping cart. You will not be disappointed!!"},{"Title":"The Walk-Out Woman : When Your Heart is Empty and Your Dreams Are Lost","review":"Although I am a Christian, I have not come across many outstanding Christian books on marriage. I tend to find their views unrealistic, sugarcoated, or stereotypical, and their advice either biased or impossible to follow. (Is everything really going to get better if you just decide to submit to your husband more?!) This book exceeded my expectations. First, it has a correct, realistic view on humanity - us Christians are not exempt from sinning or immune to temptations, we also face disappointments, and struggle in our married lives. Read the excellent chapter \\"The Fantasy of Something Better\\": it shows you how anyone can start having secret yearnings about that kind, gentle man in the next pew, but also how flawed and dangerous those fantasies can be, and how to redirect your thoughts and actions.Second, the book is compassionate and helpful without enabling victim mentality. It keeps you accountable for what you and your husband have or have not done for your marriage, but without judgment and guilt-tripping. If this is not a true expression of God's grace, I don't know what is! Third, the advice offered in the book is both plentiful, realistic and applicable. I can't overemphasize the word \\"realistic\\". The authors don't promise a magical overnight solution to your problems but the insights and encouragement offered will help you see what is wrong with your marriage and how you can start working on it.If you are feeling restless and disappointed in your marriage, I highly recommend this book. Even if you don't have any major problems, this book is worth reading and learning from."},{"Title":"The Walk-Out Woman : When Your Heart is Empty and Your Dreams Are Lost","review":"Although this book was primarily written for women who are thinking of leaving their marriage, it is also a book that will help keep your marriage strong and vibrant whether you are newlyweds or a couple celebrating your fortieth anniversary. There are suggestions for activities and conversation at the end of each chapter. Read it alone or even better, read it as a couple. Both men and women have written commenting on how much the book has helped their marriage. Chapter 4, \\"What Happened to the Good Times,\\" Chapter 10, \\"Different Walls,\\" Chapter 14, \\"The Fantasy of Something Better,\\" and Chapter 17, \\"Dreaming New Dreams\\" are especially important if your marriage is hurting.Neil Clark Warren, founder of eharmony.com, has endorsed the book with this comment: For any man who wants to love his wife more deeply--and for any woman who is dying to be loved that way.The book offers wise and gentle advice to restore hope to your marriage.

It can help you recognize the value of what's really there, good or bad. Both of the authors wisdom come from many years of counseling.

I want to be married - I just didn't know how to stay married. I have finally learned.My husband enjoyed and appreciated the assignments. We learned more about each other - and our marriage grew much stronger.I highly recommend this for married couples - and especially every woman who wants to 'WALK OUT'.The book is easy to read - layed out in simple-down to earth chapters!! The book may cost $5.00 but the result is priceless."},{"Title":"The Walk-Out Woman : When Your Heart is Empty and Your Dreams Are Lost","review":". . . until I read this book. Okay, well, truthfully I didn't have the guts to walk out, but I really wanted to. And I had been that way for a long, long time. It was on my mind all day, every day of my life for years. What held me back? Namely the fact that I knew it would not be pleasing to God. Then there were the five children my husband and I shared together; our families; our friends; our church. It was impossible to ever think about facing these people again if I did walk out. Of course, the fact that I didn't have any money or a place to go weighed heavily on my decision to stay put.Regardless of the reasons listed above, walking out on my husband and the life I didn't like anymore still crossed my mind . . . and lived there . . . daily. It came down to the fact that I really needed to change my thinking. I really needed soome counselling but could not afford it.This book had been sitting on my shelf for two or three years. I had picked it up at one time and had begun to read it. There were even little sticky notes and highlights throughout. But I didn't get far at that time. I just wasn't ready to hear what the authors, Dr. Steve Stephens and Alice Gray, had to say. But just a few weeks ago, I literally felt at the end of my patience. I had written three notes to my husband about how I was feeling, but I don't think he knew exactly how to deal with the intensity of my frustration, anger, bitterness, and saddness. If anything was to be done, it was up to me.While packing a bag of reading material for a weekend trip with our daughter for 4-H, I grabbed this book hoping to get some relief from the ugliness in my soul regarding my marriage. Not really ready to read cover-to-cover, I flipped through the pages until I came across a chapter I thought might help the most. It's titled \\"This Lady Has the Blues\\" and it absolutely described this lady for sure!I have been hooked on the book since then and am reading about a chapter a day. Just the fact that **somebody** understood how I felt seemed to lift the heavy burden I felt I had been carrying around. It was also helpful to read the stories throughout that chapter and others of women who are going through the same problems as I am.One of the things I love most about this book is the fact that it is interactive. Most chapters include a list of symptoms, suggestions of things to try, and/or questions concerning you and your particular situation. These are the blue boxes throughout the chapters. All of this extra information helps you to identify what's really going on, as well as helping you to be truly honest with yourself about some things. So often what we \\"feel\\" is so one-sided. Are **all** problems in your marriage your husband's fault? This is one misconception that is addressed in this book.At the end of each chapter is a section called \\"Something to Try\\". It is a list of several suggestions to try to reinforce what has been taught and discussed in that section. You can choose just one from the list. Most of these suggestions are very simple but eye-opening.Some of the topics addressed to the \\"walk out woman\\" include:- discovering if you really are a walk out women- clueless husbands (boy, did **I** need this!)- discontentment- focusing on the positive instead of the negative- anger (when I wasn't depressed, I was angry!)- building walls (the authors must've been spying!)- talking and reconnecting- caring for yourself (a source of guilt for me!)- devastation of divorce- affairs and how to avoid them- happiness- and much more!Several chapters seemed to be written about me! I wondered if the authors had been hanging around my house. I especially was distraught to read about myself in the chapter on building walls. We women seem so predictable.Overall, this was just an eye-opening book for me. It helped clarify the fact that all marriages have issues and even if a walk out woman did get a new husband, there wouldn't be any guarantee that she'd be any happier. It was helpful to read about how Dr. Stephens would counsel a walk out woman; how to talk to my husband; how to tear down walls; and the fact that it's okay to do things for **me**. I have spent so many years caring for others and I often feel guilty for doing something for myself.I am very thankful to have been able to address my issues with depression. I feel that my husband hears me better when I write out my frustrations and hurts and was glad to learn that this is an acceptable way to communicate with your man. Since I've done that, my Mister Wonderful has really been trying to be more attentive to my needs . . . and I am feeling much better.While \\"The Walk Out Woman\\" addresses a negative topic and speaks to serious issues in marriage, it is also uplifting as the authors offer much helpful advice on getting through this time in life.There are several references to scripture throughout, but it is not overbearing in its use. The authors also refer to many of sources in regards to writings on marriage counselling.I really never have **wanted** to be a walk out woman, but it seemed the only way of escape for me. After reading this very insightful book, I feel that I am equipped to better handle the issues in my marriage. I hope that if you read it, you will come away refreshed and ready to fight for yours."},{"Title":"The Walk-Out Woman : When Your Heart is Empty and Your Dreams Are Lost","review":"First of all, I bought the Kindle edition so I am not sure if the print book is the same, but the Kindle Edition is full of typing errors, like the word die comes up alot for the or how about fJiere for there. It is very annoying to read through.Second of all, I don't know how it could help anybody who is truly thinking on walking out. The book makes excuses for the man so if you are thinking on walking out be prepared to be told over and over in this book to pray for him, make concession after concession, to try again. Basically bend over backward for him because he's just a man. Your expectations are too high, poor guy just don't know how to communicate, or you are dwelling on all the bad times. I don't know about you but thinking on the good times only makes me angry because I know he can be a way better husband than he is now. And don't even give me the 'oh he's just a man he don't know how to listen or talk' stuff. He didn't have any problems doing it when we were dating.I can't begin to explain how one sided this book is, but I guess it comes from your basic Christian attitude--the man is number one and it's your job as a wife to make sure he and everyone else knows it. Take chapter 5, it talks about having a love bank(someone else's idea btw) that women keep track of the man's interactions with you, either negative or positive. So here's the wife's responsibilities:1. Give him a fresh start just erase all the negative stuff in your bank.2. It's your job to communicate your reasonable needs to him. But remember he's just a man so you will have to make him understand.3. Give him credit for the good things he does and don't forget all those good intentions he has they count too. I don't think relationships or anything else for that matter can be built on good intentions do you?4. And erase all those bad deposits he's made in the past. How many times has the wife been the one to have to do that, forget everything, forgive over and over, hoping next time the husband will get it, only to be disappointed again and again. That's why you have marriage problems in the first place right because of all the disappointment and rejection you've felt? But just let it all go.Anyway here is the man's responsibilities from this chapter:1. He needs to pay more attention to how his behavior affects you.2. He must learn to understand your needs.Then it goes on to say, but remember he's just a clueless guy so you as a woman will have to help him along. I have been married for 19 years if he hasn't gotten it yet, if all my helping him understand hasn't helped I don't think it's going to happen now. Know what I mean.I'm tired of being the one to try to work on our marriage, making concessions, always taking the initiative for time to spend together, his idea of spending time with me is watching tv with me, woo hoo, right? I think just like every other man he's just too lazy to try to meet my needs, I mean as long as their needs are met then that's really all they care about anyway, right?I haven't finished reading this book, but so far it is not a book I would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"The Walk-Out Woman : When Your Heart is Empty and Your Dreams Are Lost","review":"I am 51 years old, recently divorced after a 3 yr separation, with 2 young adult children (21 & 18), and certainly would like to have read this book years ago. 'Though divorced, I absolutely did not want a divorce, never believed in divorce; but had no idea whatsoever how 'not' to go there. Two years ago when I'd realized how things had gotten, I told my then husband that I'd do whatever it took to keep our marriage, within reason of course; but after having been 'out there,' he decided that a life of no responsibilites, a'care-free' and frivolous life was what he wanted. Our 'children' at the time were 14 & 17 'he' decided he wanted the break, and he'd said that the kids would be okay, knowing full well that this was their ultimate fear - DIVORCE. However, since that time, I'd been reading everything, listening to Christian counseling programs and had learned much, but this book ULTIMATELY made me see for the very first time ever what 'my' mistakes were. Honestly, even at my age I had no idea how very ignorant I was! Now I understand some of the things that 'though they were 'small' so to speak, they were huge to him. We have had to have contact on account of our 18 yr. developing lung cancer, which we were told was there from birth, but is only now revealing itself. (Neither of us were smokers, for the record). I thought that this would unite us, but apparently not; still, I am so very happy that I've discovered this book, and besides, who knows what God has in store for each us?

It truly is a treasure!"},{"Title":"The Walk-Out Woman : When Your Heart is Empty and Your Dreams Are Lost","review":"This is a great book! All women shouLd read it.

It was a smart move to use his Still Life hero, Touch Benson, in this amazing book. In Death Rites, Touch is on a case that defies logic, and once again one of the chief suspects is his high school friend and now near-lover, Michelle, who seems to be predicting the murders through her dreams.Nothing is what it seems in this book, which makes for an exciting and fascinating read, and I highly recommend that you read Still Life first, then Death Rites. Touch Benson is a great character and should be good for a long run!"},{"Title":"Death Rites","review":"Mr Elliot continues to show his wonderful imagination with \\"Death Rites\\".

I can't believe that Bruce Elliot, a new writer, could top last summer's thriller, STILL LIFE, but by golly he did with his newest, DEATH RITES!Weird is the only term for the serial killer in this book, which for a police procedural has a distinctive gothic flavor. Elliot brings back Touch Benson, the hero of his first book, and gives him a new love interest, who isn't new at all, but rather a childhood sweetheart and best friend. Trouble is, she seems to be able to predict the murders through her dreams, and she becomes a prime suspect. However, the surprise ending is totally different than STILL LIFE, but just as thrilling.I think I'm in love with Touch Benson, so please, Mr. Elliot, write another Touch thriller..."},{"Title":"Death Rites","review":"Witty, saucy prose, served with a healthy dollop of attitude, contributes toward this book's strongest attribute -- you can't stop reading it. Despite a feeling that you've been here before, and a few \\"oh please\\" contrivances, you simply must keep going to find out what happens. Nonetheless, the main reason I didn't rate this book a \\"5\\" is because the primary characters (not to mention the plot) tend to lean toward primetime-TV cliches -- the sad, recovering quasi-alcoholic ex-jock cop hero, his grouchy lieutenant boss in need of a chill pill, the whacko psychotic killer into whose mind we get a frightening peek. Rather than imitate the genre (note to author: there's too many Patterson wannabes in the game already), Elliot should use his considerable talent and skill to take us somewhere new. Here's hoping."},{"Title":"Death Rites","review":"Elliot is a former screen writer, and this book is like reading a made for TV movie. The character development left me not caring for the people involved, and the plot bounced all over the place, often without good reason. Elliot relies on greasy hair to vilify one character, and good looks to let us know if a character is a \\"good guy\\". Touch, (the main character) is a man conflicted by the death of his bi-polar wife two years ago. This a great base for personal growth and insight of the lead character. Instead, Elliot turns Touch into a macho, drinking tough guy, who somehow is justified in things like fighting on an LA freeway and lying to protect people he likes. Generally is a bad version of Mel Gibson's character in Lethal Weapon.The only reason I read this book, is so you don't have to."},{"Title":"The Political Philosophy of Hannah Arendt","review":"(First of all, there is a paperback printing of this, as I have it.)This is a very readable, very well organized overview and assessment of Hannah Arendt's political philosophy. The book is broken into 5 major sections: 1) Introduction 2)Arendt's conception of modernity 3)Arendt's theory of Action 4) Arendt's theory of judgement &amp; 5) Arendt's conception of citizenship.Now, anyone familiar with Arendt's work is probably already well aquainted with these themes, yet this book manages to bring more life to these major concepts and takes some of the most illuminating quotes from Arendt's works, so that the reader needn't take the author's word on what Arendt meant.This book is not merely an introduction to Arendt (though it is fine as that, too) it is a sharp critique of her ideas, but is aware that even when her words seem inadequate, the spirit of Arendt's political philosophy is still strong; and d'Entreves does quite well emphasizing this intangible aspect of Arendt's philosophy. He addresses the criticisms and responses of many philosophers and critics and draws Arendt into a dialogue with these writers, helping to continue the project of Arendtian philosophy."},{"Title":"Robo Para LA Corona (Espejo de La Argentina)","review":"En este libro, Horacio Verbitsky, periodista argentino, que trabajara en el peri&oacute;dico Pagina 12 y actualmente cronista del programa televisivo Dia D 2000, cuenta como en los primeros a&ntilde;os del gobierno del presidente Menem, y en medio de las privatizaciones de las principales empresas del estado, como Entel, Aerolineas Argentinas y Petroquimica Bahia Blanca, la corrupci&oacute;n, los chantajes, los sobornos y las coimas, estaban a la orden del d&iacute;a, escrito en 1991, muestra como un pa&iacute;s sumerjido en la ignorancia asistio al desfasaje de sus principales empresas, a manos de un gobierno corrupto como no ha habido otro en la historia de la Argentina."},{"Title":"Robo Para LA Corona (Espejo de La Argentina)","review":"Para muestra basta un bot&oacute;n dice el dicho.

Many readers, going into this, are frankly in the wrong for carrying too many expections along with them. Here you will not find the familiar lodgings of a Slave Laboresque horror/humor mashing. While Lenore and Johnny the Homicidal Maniac present us with worlds that are, in essense, fantastic reinterpretations of our own, Benjamin Roman and Keith Giffen present the reader with a world governed by unfamiliar rules. Not provided with a safety net narration, the reader is thrust into a world which on the surface is similiar to ours, but underneath has jarring and facsinating differences that work with the story elements toward more and more unlikely scenarios. The narration told just enough to leave me pondering like a child over the laws that govern this fictional universe. It's a blast just to observe the goings-ons, read the off-beat exchanges between characters, and watch the overarching and glib plot unfold.The hints of supernatural twists in this volume are enough to drive me to the next one, which promises an elaboration of the only glimpsed at zombie theme."},{"Title":"I Luv Halloween, Volume 1","review":"I thought this book was so funny I almost wet my pants laughing.

It all starts when this group of kids get an apple each in the first house they trick or treat, which it seems brings back luck. But, there's a friend ( Devil mask) which only comes that day; they only get to see him only in Halloween, don't know from where he is and such; that didn't trick or treat with them at that house so there's a chance that maybe they will get clean and have good candies. To their surprise, bad luck comes when Devil gets chocolate and so in every place they go. It seems they need to reverse the \\"curse\\"(?) by killing the one who did it which was the old lady who gave them the apples. Also, Finch knows how to bring back the dead; knows about zombies. An example of this is their dog. I don't know if the house they are at the prologue and in the end is their house, nor if those two that are dead are their parents (which I dont think so). But if they aren't what happened to them? the only clue I have (that yet again we dont know if is their house) was when in the beginning they show Finch in a room with an article that said: MOTHER OF TWO DEAD and other one about Murder. We don't know (at least in this volume) if this kids ( Finch and his sister Moochie) are homeless and such that maybe they are living in the house of those two dead bodies. Moochie is ver psycho, I don't even know how she gets such ideas of killing people for the teeths."},{"Title":"I Luv Halloween, Volume 1","review":"I love these books. Loved them so much that after searching down and buying the graphic novels I spent the money and bought the ultimate twisted edition. They're so gleefully morbid.

I recommend this to anyone who has a dark sense of humor and appreciates large doses of some ultra-violence."},{"Title":"I Luv Halloween, Volume 1","review":"I absolutely loved this series! I Luv Halloween is origional, and one of the darkest, most brutal black comedies out I ever seen/read. If you aren't a fan of things likeMetalocalypse: Season Onethen this aint for you. Its about bunch of cynical kids who try to enjoy trick-or-treating, and their hijinks always end up in some kind of insane massacre-fest. The artwork is perfect for the Halloween theme, but the art in the first volume has much lighter feel than that of other two. Each volume focuses on one Halloween night and each is equally enjoyable and has its own brilliant ending. There are plenty of jokes, stomach-churning gore, and random \\"WTF!?\\" moments. This is incredible stuff. Almost exclusively for horror and morbid comedy Enthusiasts only."},{"Title":"I Luv Halloween, Volume 1","review":"My teenager loves this product!

The story is well done and a good depiction of the life of Southerners during the Civil War, particularly of women on the home front. As another reviewer said, I wish the author had finished off some of the story lines. For example, he does not take the Brannons to Texas. He does not tell what happens to the former slave, Roman, who is the central character in the first chapter of the book. As an animal lover, I would love to know what happens to the grey stallion.However, in my estimation, Lloyd James, the narrator of the audio version made the book. I listen to a lot of audio books and James has now risen to the top of my list of narrators. His ability to change his voice and the wide variety of voices that he uses is amazing. But for James, I would certainly have lost interest in this book.It's well worth the listen."},{"Title":"Appomattox (The Civil War Battle Series, Book 10)","review":"APPOMATTOX, the 10th and final volume in James Reasoner's THE CIVIL WAR BATTLE SERIES, certainly lives up to the preceding nine volumes. The ending of the Civil War, and the conclusion of the Brannon family saga during the conflict, is once again well-researched, and tautly written.Mr. Reasoner gives us characters we can relate to and care about, from the Brannon family, to Cory Brannon's wife Lucille, to Pie Jones and his wife Rachel, to Roman, Will Brannon's now freed slave, to the fearless men of the Texas Rangers, and even many of the minor characters. The reader can't help but becoming deeply involved with the lives of the characters. And, as always, the battle scenes are fraught with tension.I only wish the author had taken the book one step further, and had the Brannons reach their final destination, rather than still searching for their new future. However, this is a minor point, and certainly detracts little, if at all, from a riveting series.APPOMATTOX, as are all the books in THE CIVIL WAR BATTLE SERIES, is must reading for any fan of excellent historical fiction, and also highly recommended for Civil War buffs."},{"Title":"Appomattox (The Civil War Battle Series, Book 10)","review":"Shenandoah: The Civil War Battle Series, Book 8For Civil War buffs, lovers of the southern culture or just wanting a good book to read this series is it.

I couldn't put them down once I started. I would love for James Reasoner to pick up the story of the family in Texas. I'm a Civil War buff. Reasoner added enough fiction with non-fiction to make the books really interesting. Books usually don't affect me too much, but it broke my heart when Will died. James Reasoner is an excellent author and I hope to find more books by him. Thanks Mr. Reasoner for a wonderful adventure."},{"Title":"Appomattox (The Civil War Battle Series, Book 10)","review":"For the first several volumes in The Civil War Battle Series the great irony in James Reasoner's books was that the particular battle that served as the title was usually covered in a relatively few pages at the end of the book. More than the strategy and tactics of a particular battle, however, the narrative was more caught up with the interpersonal problems of the Bannon family of Culpeper County, Virginia, so that many of us thought the series should be called The Civil War Soap Opera Series. I knew how the war was going to turn out, my biggest concerns was Duncan Ebersole getting his comeuppance and with how many of the Brannons would still be alive at the end of the tenth and final book. The latter concern actually last longer because it was not until the end of the ninth volume, &quot;Savannah,&quot; that Will Brannon became the first of the five Bannon brothers to get killed in the war.One of the reasons that the Bannons lasted so long was that they were essential to the far flung nature of Reasoner's narrative. Originally this was just Will and Mac in the Eastern Theater of the war, with the Stonewall Brigade and the Confederate cavalry at Manassas, Antietam, Chacnelllorsville and such while Cory represented the Western Theater from Shiloh to Vicksburg. Even once Henry and Titus got involved in the war, leaving Coredlia home on the farm with ma, they were busy covering other aspects of the war. Now, all the chickens come home to roost in the final book. Of course, Appomattox is really not a Civil War battle per se, not compared to Gettysburg and Chicamauga, but the site of Lee's surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia to Grant. This means that Reasoner has to cover a lot once he begins &quot;Appomattox&quot; with Mac and Roman burying Will.Mac is still with Fitzhugh Lee's Confederate cavalry while Titus is not a member of Mosby's Rangers engaged in guerrilla warfare in the Shenandoah Valley. By the end of the book Mac is involved with the defense of Petersburg and Titus is actually involved with a desperate plot to save the Confederacy that allow Reasoner to make him a part of American history. Meanwhile Cory is now part of the retreating Rebel army facing Sherman in the Carolinas and Henry is riding with Nathan Bedford Forrest in Alabama. Back at the farm Cordelia is still being courted by a Yankee lieutenant while Nathan Hatcher is serving with the Union army in the Dakota Territory and Cory's wife Lucille is heading to Texas to meet up with Pie and Rachel while waiting for the war to end so Cory can join her. Throw into the mix what happens to Roman and this novel moves at a faster pace than any of the rest. It often seems like Reasoner is bouncing around from character to character, making sure he is touching all his narrative bases. By the end of this book characters in different parts of the war are showing up in the same chapter, which was not what was happening before.In winding down the war the soap opera elements are about as reduced as the health and fitness of the Confederate army. There was really only one significant element left and it unexpected just sort of ends, so Reasoner is able to keep the focus on the reactions of the Brannons to the drawing end of the war. Capturing the reactions of the surviving Brannon brothers to what is happening is the strongest part of this book, even if he is forced to rush through the final months of the drawn out war. Still, it is hard not to be struck by how odd at the quick pace of this final book at the end of a ten volume series. If you go by the number of reviews written about each volume in The Civil War Battle Series it would seem there have been some massive desertions along the way, but overall the series holds up well and even if a couple of the Bannons become officers (a helpful way of having them in the right place with the right people at the right time) you do get a sense of what it was like for the ordinary soldiers of the Civil War."},{"Title":"Lifeskills for Adult Children","review":"The cost was fantastic.

I found the tone of this volume somewhat simplistic and the sample person-to-person interactions a bit forced (which I suppose is the point), but that made it hard for me to relate to them or imagine myself carrying out the sample exercises.Personally, I got a lot more out of _Adult Children of Abusive Parents_ by Steven Farmer, which deals with many of the same topics but uses far more detail and more real-life examples I could believe actually happened, and that made a big difference in whether I felt able to take the advice to heart. (Details ARE important to me, and I felt like _Lifeskills_ was light on them: My copy may be 200 pages long, but it uses a suspiciously large font and liberal line spacing -- only 28 lines to a page.)There's also a curious convention _Lifeskills_ uses -- three small stylized icons of a man tilting back a bottle of wine, which are used as section separators! Given that many \\"adult children\\" have one or more alcoholic parents, this really made me cringe.If you've never read any other books in this genre, this is probably an OK place to start. I just found that with some other books on this topic I'd read, I got more \\"bang for the buck.\\""},{"Title":"Lifeskills for Adult Children","review":"&quot;Lifeskills&quot; is one of those books everyone should own.

One of the shared characteristics I've learned about adult children is a yearning for what is \\"normal\\". This book helps to know how to 'pick up the many broken pieces' and learn how to move on from the childhood life-style we were brought up in and relearn what is normal. I've read another book by the same author and have enjoyed the amazing insight she brings to light. I would hightly recommend Adult Children of Alcoholics expanded edition. It tells about the several characteristics identifiable statics that so many of Adult Children have in common --- it is amazing! A couple of other reads I would recommend and have found very insightful are:YOUR PERFECT RIGHT: Assertiveness and Equality in Your Life and Relationships (9th Edition) by Robert E. Alberti and Michael L. Emmons(Excellent book on how to be Assertive ---not passive or aggressive.)BOUNDARIES by Cloud/Townsend --- When to say YES, When to say NO, To take Control of Your Life(A must read book-- it helped change my life). We all need boundaries in our life and this book helps in many ways, but a couple that stand out are \\"the freedom to have our own thoughts and opinions, and how to deal with our own emotions and disengage from the harmful, manipulative emotions of others\\".Because of Janet G.

From simple transpositions of figures (swapping the &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;complex&quot; network examples about 8 pages apart) to downright inaccurate figures (text talks about networks A, B, C and D; figure shows networks X, Y and Z) the illustrations are by far the most confusing part of the text. There are however a number of textual errors as well many of them subtle problems in technical content, my favorite example being an IPv6 address displayed with *two* double colons in it, and no, that wasn't in the example of invalid addresses.The redeeming feature is actually the non-technical content, such as the introductory materials that explain why IPv6 is where it still is today, and how it can move forward, or the project/migration management aspects of network administration that non-seasoned network hands will find accessible and useful.Bottom line: those vaguely familiar with IPv6 already will notice a number of mistakes, but then they really don't need this book. Those not familiar with IP networking are bound to be confused, especially if they're trying to experiment along the way.

One thing I hadn't known about previously was the &quot;Internet model&quot; of internetworking, which as four levels instead of the standard seven with the OSI model. Also covered are reasons why IPv4 no longer &quot;works&quot; and then the origins of IPv6.One thing too about Ipv6 that because it is a streamlined version of IPv4, that items like headers and such are streamlined as well, some items necessary in IPv4 are not needed with IPv6.

This should be the first book on IPv6 you read, and, unless you are an IPv6 development engineer, it may well be the only book on IPv6 you need to read.Unlike technical books that bury the reader in details from the outset, this book provides context first, starting with a brief overview of IPv6 and how it improves on IPv4 - the current widely-deployed global network protocol. This holistic approach to explaining IPv6 provides much more than reference material or detailed configuration-level information (although that level of detailed information is in the book too).Pete's latest book will help you really *understand* IPv6, from \\"what triggered the development of the new protocol\\", to \\"IPv6 basics\\", to \\"how to configure IPv6 network devices and host computers\\". Each major topic is covered - addressing, security, multicasting, QoS, neighbor discovery, autoconfiguration, mobility, transition, services, deployment planning, and futures (full disclosure: I contributed to this book).Considering the enormous success of the Internet and the pervasive native of IP-networking, and considering that IPv6 will be here soon and likely be *the* network protocol for the next 20 years, every IT professional should know something about it.

Even with a fatal attraction undertone, the ingenious Ms. Crusie leaves her fans feeling quite contented with life.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"After reading Bet Me, I knew I had to get more of Crusie's books. This is my second of hers, and while I did like it, it wasn't nearly as good as Bet Me.The story is about a woman who's pretty much woke up one day and decided she needed to make some changes in her life. She does so, and never looks back. The backdrop for the book, the small town she lives in, the school she works at and her friends scattered about town, make for fun side-stories.I think part of the reason I didn't get as wrapped up in it as I did with Bet Me, was in part because I felt like these characters were too \\"out there\\". I mean, this girl decides to change her life, without a single doubt in her mind. Not once does the author have her sit back and really think about the changes, to see if this is what she really wants! The same goes for the other characters as well, who I thought were \\"out there\\" as well for various reasons I won't bother to list.All in all though, I enjoyed the book. It was basically a fun read. I'd recommend it if you're a fan of Crusie. For me, I'm looking forward to trying another book of hers, hoping for more magic there."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This book was so great! As always, Crusie gives you main characters you can really relate to. I found myself cheering them on and smiling at every turn. Once you pick it up, you will not be able to put it down! You really accept the characters into your heart, I hated to see this book end! Funny, kooky and downright spooky (wow, what an ex from Hell!) You will love it! Try all of Crusie's books, she is my most favorite author by far. She will win you over, too! Just wait"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This book was so great!

I love Jennifer Crusie, so I grabbed a bunch including Crazy for You, which I couldn't remember reading before though eventually the story came back to me. There are funny parts and sweet parts in CFY, though I am not totally convinced of the main love story between Quinn/Nick; however, the Max & Darla love story was excellent and hilarious.Unfortunately, Quinn's ex-boyfriend is creepy and as I continuted to read, his creepiness started to poison the entire story. It stopped being light summer reading, it stopped being fun, it stopped being a romance. The ex not only stalks the heroine, he abuses her, terrifies her and tries repeatedly to kill her dog - and this storyline is probably more detailed and dominant in the book than the one between Nick and Quinn. The ex progressively gets worse, so that as the climax draws near, I wasn't wondering how Nick and Quinn would finally \\"get together,\\" but wondering if the boyfriend would have to be shot by police in order to finally stop him (seriously.) The stalking/abuse/animal abuse was so real and detailed (we get to see into the stalker's mind, which is supposed to show how screwed up he is in a \\"ha-ha\\" way, but instead reinforces how chillingly sick in the head he is) that it began to feel obscene to be putting that kind of story line in a \\"funny\\" romance. There are woman who undergo this kind of terror and humiliation everyday, and animals too -- its not funny and its not fluff. I worry that there are going to be people who've been victimized that pick this up to bring to the beach for a fun read and will instead be dragged down to a dark place. Honestly, I think this book should come with a warning label. And it isn't that great a romance even without this disturbing story line that permeates the book starting a third of the way in and going until practically the very last pages. There are plenty of great JC stories out there - I recommend a pass on this one.BTW, I also re-read Welcome to Temptation, one of the best JC books ever, an outstanding, fun romance and very clever story. In WTT, besides lots of funny parts and romantic parts, etc., one of the characters dies in what appears to be a gruesome manner, someone repeatedly tries to kill off the female lead, and there are some other unsavvory elements. But I would recommend the story in a nano-second --- it worked and wasn't creepy, not like CFY. Other good ones: Bet Me, Fast Women."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"In 99 out of 100 romances, Crazy Bill would be the \\"hero\\" of this book.He is: handsome, thinks he knows what is best for the heroine, orders her around for \\"her own good\\", and is beloved by the entire town, who spend much of the book trying to get the heroine to \\"come back to her senses\\" and back to Bill.One problem, though. Bill's a control freak and nutso to boot.It's wonderful to read a book with a romantic heroine who knows what she wants and goes after it, instead of the usual, \\"must be manipulated into happiness for her own good by hero, parents, entire town\\" nitwit."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I was shocked at seeing the price on here. Right now all Jennifer Crusie books are being re-released in anticipation of the paperback release of &quot;Bet Me&quot;, and are 3.99 each!! That's new, not even used! So that's my first hint. Go to your local bookstore and save yourself the 3 odd dollars and the cost of shipping!!Ok now onto the book. Awesome, but at some points, you can be afraid of what Quinn is going through. I was somewhat irked that the subject of domestic violence would be portrayed in a humorous fashion in the book. Same with stalking. I suppose it's central to the plot, but I didn't think it was funny.Other then that, this book was excellent, true Jennifer Crusie excellence. The idea that one day you realize you've been living a &quot;beige&quot; life, and want something different is something many women can attest to. Quinn stands up for herself quite nicely in the quest for a new life. A recommended read!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"can be very funny as Jennifer Crusie shows in this wild and crazy tale of a small town art teacher whose life is totally changed when she adopts an abandoned dog that looks more like a large rat. Quinn realizes she craves change in her \\"beige\\" life and acquiring a dog was her first step in that direction. Her second is to dump her annoying control freak of a boyfriend ( the creepiest character in any novel ever ). Then she buys a house and falls head over heels for her sister's ex-husband. Nick is Quinn's best guy friend, totally gorgeous and unfortunately afflicted with the worst case of commitment phobia. Quinn knows this but her common sense dissapears every time she sees him and she is now determined to be with him. Quinn's life is full of that excitement she had craved what with her mom coming out of the closet and her loser ex stalking her she's got her plate full. What else could possibly happen in this previously excitement challenged town? Read on to find out.This is my first book by this author and although I did not think this book was a keeper it definitely got me interested in her other books. An excellent beach read. Recommended. :)"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This was my second Jennifer Crusie novel and she definitely does not disappoint. Just as in \\"Welcome to Temptation\\", the novel flows smoothly and the dialog is very realistic; in fact, dialog is really Crusie's forte. It is light and casual and will pull you into the story and make you feel like the characters are your closest friends. You will miss them dearly when the book comes to an end!Quinn and Nick have been best friends for 20 years, and Nick has developed some romantic inclinations toward Quinn. Quinn soon realizes, to her surprise, that the feelings are mutual, and she wants Nick more than she has ever wanted anyone before. The obstacle in their relationship is Nick's stubbornness, and his unwillingness to delve into a serious relationship. Ever since his divorce from Quinn's sister 19 years earlier, he's had trouble going the distance with women and even kicks them out of bed long before dawn starts to break.He and Quinn only realize their attraction after Quinn breaks up with Bill, the town's good \`ole boy and high school baseball coach. Bill refuses to believe Quinn could actually want to leave him and begins a descent into madness. He becomes so crazed with winning Quinn back, he stalks her and even jeopardizes her life.The subcharacters are also another highlight of this book, you are sure to become enthralled with all the little dramas that are going on in this small town. As Quinn's sister states in the book, life in that town plays out like an episode of Jerry Springer's greatest hits!This book is filled with realistic conversations, hot, ......, and intense character development. Loved it, Loved it, Loved it!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"It's hard to choose, which of Jennifer Crusie's books I think is the best, because I think they are all terrific. But this one is the one I prefer. She develops the plot so deftly, introducing the characters in normal context and then adding the twists and turns that make them endearing, frustrating, scary and all the other emotions she manages to evoke in the reader. Perfect book, aside of all romantic subplot. I believe JC manages the tightrope walke between mystery and romance best of all authors. Congratulations!!!Readers who like this book should definitely read TELL ME LIES and WELCOME TO TEMPTATION. I'm also impatiently waiting for her new book FAST WOMEN to be published in paperback."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I must be missing something here. Although I found the characters well defined and the dialogue sexy and lively, I had trouble relating to any of them. I found the women to be petty, bitter whinners and the men to be pathetic imbeciles. The only one who knew what they wanted was Bill and he turned out to be an abusive stalker. This is my first book by Ms. Cruise. I'm willing to try another one to see if its me or the author."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I've loved every single one of Jennifer's books and this one is no exception. Just when I think she can't top herself, she exceeds my expectations. Jennifer's delightfully wicked sense of humor (ex: every day was a beautiful day in the neighborhood for Bill) keeps me laughing with delight. Her technique with dialogue ranks right at the very top. Every time I think about the break-up of Quinn's parents I start laughing again. That and Darla's attempts to seduce her husband were an absolute hoot. Can't wait until the next one."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Is there some unwritten rule than when romance novelists start getting hardback book contracts they must then include psycho stalking nutcase characters in those books? Nora Roberts makes the switch from romance to romantic suspense with ease, but in Jennifer Crusie's case the transition from her humor-filled romance novels would be better served without the psycho stalking nutcase type character. The story of Quinn and the domino effect her desire for change triggers would have worked fine without Bill, the dumped boyfriend who cannot take no for answer. Bill is not a funny character. The escalation of his stalking behavior is not funny. As a result, CRAZY FOR YOU is neither a completely funny romance nor does it qualify as romantic suspense since there are many humorous elements. CRAZY FOR YOU is entertaining, but suffers a bit of an identity crisis."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"It looks like I'm going to be the voice of dissent here. But just coming down from the high of reading &quot;Watermelon&quot;, I was sure &quot;Crazy For You&quot; would be the perfect choice for my next read. Wrong! For far too much of the novel the &quot;villian&quot; is too pathetic and lost to be the least bit threatening. When Crusie finally turns up the heat the end is already crystal clear. Great sex scenes....but I stopped reading romances just for those scenes around high school. The rest predictable and flat. I'm thankful I only invested in a trip to the library on this one. For a great break-up-and-change-life-for-the-better romance try Marian Keye's &quot;Watermelon&quot; and for a great romantic suspence with wonderful tension try Karen Robards &quot;Hunter's Moon&quot;."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Oh, Jennifer Crusie, I do love your books!! I first read TELL ME LIES and could NOT stop laughing. CRAZY FOR YOU had me snorting and giggling, too. I imagined Quinn to look like Lauren Holly and Nick to look like Jay Bontatibus who plays Tony Viscardi on the Young and the Restless. Their frustrating love story made me want to shake them sometimes but I knew they'd work out OK. Darla, Max and even the mother had lots of great one-liners. All in all, a great story by one of the best! Jennifer, you're right in the same league as my other 2 favourite &quot;funny&quot; authors: Susan Elizabeth Phillips and Janet Evanovich! Congratulations!!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Aw, this book is so good that I hated for it to be over. Read it cover to cover in one, late night sitting. Quinn, the heroine, grabs your heart from the first line. And her reluctant hero Nick? Well, he has one of the best comeback lines I've ever read in a book. Count me in the crazy for Crazy for You camp. Totally. Absolutely. And I'm ready to read it again."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Great sex and warm-hearted humor. This author has a gift for creating absolutely true, human characters and putting them in the middle of an ordinary life...and then making them a part of an extraordinary story! A super read which my mother stole from me before I could get to it, but then she gave it back saying it was great. I dove right in and you know what? Mothers are ALWAYS right."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Let me just say that Jennifer Crusie is quite possibly the world's best writer. I kid you not. Seriously, this book is so fabulous, it is nearly impossible to put down. All I need in life are Jennifer Crusie's books, chocolate, ice cream, four hours alone and I'm fine. Wonderful, superb, exquisite and in all other ways fantastic book. I only wish Jennifer Crusie wrote more, but the world can't possibly get that great."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This is a great book! It is not only funny and engrossing, but touching. I especially enjoyed Ms. Crusie's touching upon the love lives of the heroine's parents, best friends, and students. She demonstrates a deft touch regardless of the age of the character. Worth the hardcover price."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Only Jenny Crusie could get a plot out of a woman adopting a stray dog! I'm still laughting out loud and calling friends to share some of the best lines from the book. This is one of those few times when I have absolutely no regrets about shelling out the big bucks for a hardcover. &lt;G&gt;"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Absolutely--this is Crusie's best, and that's saying a mouthful. This book is sheer fun, notwithstanding the genuinely creepy ex-boyfriend who won't take no for an answer. Nobody writes like Crusie; her voice is unique, utterly charming, and you can hear it a mile away. She really is a treasure."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I've read all of Jennifer Crusie's books, and this one is her best yet. Quinn McKenzie, bored with her safe, predictable life, decides to keep the stray dog she's rescued from the parking lot. From that one tiny decision, her life dominoes out of control in mostly hilarious ways only Crusie could dream up. Safety alert: set down your mug of hot chocolate before reading the scene out behind the dog pound. Once again the heroine's relationship with her best friend is central to the story -- every woman needs a best friend like the ones Crusie creates for her heroines. This book is all about getting what you need, and it works on every level."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I'm a big Crusie fan (go read \\"Bet Me\\" and \\"Faking It,\\" my favorites!), so I was really disappointed in this one. I was prepared to like Quinn -- she's stepping out of her beige shell, going for what she really wants -- and was cheering her on.. when I began to realize she was being STALKED by the ex-boyfriend who didn't want to be her ex, and she was totally clueless! Honestly, this is not an amusing topic for such an otherwise light, funny chick lit pick. It may be my personal experience, but the situation was absolutely terrifying for me and not at all appropriate for a romance novel. Kind of ruined the whole thing for me."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This is my first Jennifer Crusie read and I have to tell you I loved it !!! There are parts that made me sad, parts that made me think, and parts that made me laugh out loud. I can't wait to try out more of her books :)"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Maybe I shouldn't have read two early Crusies in a row -- \\"Getting Rid of Bradley\\" was great fun -- because \\"Crazy for You\\" almost made ME crazy! Quite dull, jumping all over the place with several different characters and a hero and heroine that were completely uninteresting. I guess what she wanted was small town charm, but it came out as big time boring.Nick just seemed like an old hound, living in a crappy apartment, drinking beer and dating twentysomethings. If he weren't \\"gorgeous,\\" would any self-respecting woman go near him?Quinn was a dope. She had no spine and is such a wimp. I can't believe she is viciously attacked by Bill, who is clearly mentally deranged, AND SHE WAITS UNTIL THE NEXT DAY TO GO TO THE POLICE???? How dumb is that? And to hear the characters say \\"Oh, hell\\" a thousand times got real old, real fast.Get any other book, \\"Bradley,\\" \\"Manhunting,\\" or \\"Anyone But You\\" if you want vintage Crusie.This one was a dud."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This was my first (and last) Jennifer Cruise book. I have thoroughly enjoyed the Stephanie Plum books by Janet Evanovich, and was looking for something to read while awaiting her most recent installment. Several people suggested Jennifer Cruise to me as an alternative. I was totally underwhelmed and unimpressed by her writing. Weak plot, lame characters, and tacky sex (in a high school, no less). What is there to like about this book? I managed to make it through the entire book, but was extremely thankful I had checked it out from the library. Needless to say, I won't be reading any of her other books."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Are we talking about the same book? It happens to be the most boring book I have ever come across. It took me almost 3 weeks to finish it. In fact, I had to struggle to finish reading it. Very disappointing. I wonder why it's getting such good reviews."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I checked this book out from the library because it had more critical acclaim than any romance in a long time. The list is impressive: Romantic Times/Reviewer Choice nominee; Rita nominee; Romance Reader top five and Romance Writers Reader Choice top 10. Is it that good? Almost.The story is pretty real world. A school teacher whose desire to liven up her life becomes infectious. I'm sure many of us married women can relate to Darla as she tries to rekindle the spark in her 17 year old marriage.I'm holding back a star because there are times in this book where I really wanted to tell the characters to wake up and smell the coffee. Still, lots of fun - a great vacation read."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Jennifer Crusie will not disappoint. Once a &quot;mere&quot; paperback romance writer who no one had ever heard of, she's made a move into the mainstream, and has done so successfully. Her chararcters are real--flawed, unpredictable, and absolutely hilarious. If you enjoyed &quot;Crazy for You,&quot; then &quot;Tell Me Lies&quot; is a must-read."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This book was hysterically, laugh-out-loud funny!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I finally broke down and read this book. Why didn't i do it sooner! I loved it! I laughed out loud at some of the scenes! No i am dying to read her latest book which is still in hardcover. Definetly a keeper! I really enjoyed this book. She has the humour of Susan Elizabeth Phillips...maybe even more so...lots of sizzle too! I will definetly read more of her work!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I have been a fan of Ms Crusie since I read Getting Rid of Bradley a few years ago, but this book is by far the best one by her I have read to date. The characters were realistic, honest and very easy to relate to. Her wit and style are fresh. She tells it like it really is instead of glossing over things. You can see real people have the same trials and hardships as she portrays in her characters. Rarely do I laugh out loud while reading a book but Ms Crusie cause me to do so time and time again with all of her writings, and even though she has written several books the humor stays new. None of the repetive humor you see time and time again from some writers. I have nothing more to say but EXCELLENT JOB!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I'm a big fan of Jennifer Crusie since reading Tell Me Lies and Welcome to Temptation. But I must say that my favourite so far of hers is Crazy for You. She has combined an excellent blend of romantic emotion (I love it when the guy has been burning away with a unrequited love for a long time), humour and suspense. A very good contemporary novel if you're trying to get away from the run of the mill romance."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This book is laugh out loud funny. I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly reccomend it. The characters are colorful and you don't know what they are going to do next."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"If you are sick and tired of reading about foreign royalty, designer clothes, jaunts to Monte Carlo, and meaningless sex laden with tired metaphors, here is your antidote. Jenny Crusie writes about real people, characters I could recognize right from the people in my home town, and yet their story is told with such humor and sensitivity, such great understanding of the dark and the light, that I was riveted. This is an incredibly fun read, yet as right and true as any piece of literature. I am incredibly impressed with it; and I shut the world off and devoured it in a day."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"So, I'm trying to figure if the frequent references to pizza count as the trademark Crusie junk food fetish.I was really slow getting to this one, and boy do I feel guilty about it. And stupid. This was too fun to hold back on. The ethics of the Crusie universe are evident and appealing here."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Just browsing I spotted the book and enjoyed it. Multiple developed characters, not just the main two. Everyone seemed real in this book; no bodies to die for, and Miss America looks. I'm checking other books by this author after I post this."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"When a student holds out a stray dog to her, High School Art teacher, Quinn McKenzie can't help but embrace the creature into her arms and welcome it into her life. Katie soon becomes inseparable much to the despair of friends and family alike. But when her staid boyfriend steals Katie and has her impounded, Quinn realizes she has had enough and moves out. Bent on changing her life rather than bending to the whims of others, as has been her habit, Quinn begins to assert herself; a contagion that quickly spreads itself among her friends and family revealing sides of themselves she never even knew.Nick Ziegler has known Quinn for nearly two decades and he has loved her as a sister for nearly that long. Or at least he's tried. It's always been easy to keep his ex-sister-in-law in the role of best friend because she was always involved in a long-term relationship. But ever since the &quot;rat on stilts&quot; entered her life, things haven't been the same. Quinn has left her boyfriend which has Nick realizing that without an obstacle between the two of them, there is even more of an opportunity for the two of them to acknowledge the repressed attraction they feel for each other, forcing him to question whether acting on it is worth the price of their friendship.Jennifer Crusie has written an incredibly funny and sometimes poignant book that seems to echo some of the sentiment derived from the saying, &quot;Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus.&quot; While Quinn and Nick are the protagonists of this novel, it is easy to see that they also become unwitting role models for the women and men of their town. When Quinn leaves her boyfriend because he doesn't &quot;see&quot; her, her mother and her best friend also realize that they are disappearing in the face of their marriage. All three women have varying ways of dealing with the situation, some poignant, some hilarious. When their women defect, the men follow Nick's knack for remaining uninvolved. This story could be seen as farcical or as simply a wicked parody if it didn't have so many truths ringing solidly behind it. Instead of appearing slapstick and over the top, it is humorous but never loses its sense of depth. In addition, the characters never lose sense of their integrity when it comes to the story as a whole. Instead, Crusie has woven a story with relationship at the heart of it but with a slight emphasis on social commentary. For instance, instead of making the narration one-sided in favor of the women, the author also offers some perspective from the viewpoint of her male characters in order to reveal to readers their inability, initial or perpetual, to understand their girlfriend's or wives' dissatisfaction. This offers a wonderful balance to what might have been merely a slapstick romantic comedy."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Well I certainly was not 'crazy' for this book.It had all the eliments to make it great, but somehow just kept missing.Truly a disappointment after Tell Me Lies, which was a 6 star book if there ever was one.I still gave 2 stars, because the characters were all filled out, and the story line was a fun one, it was just somehow, not quite together.Lets hope her next one is more like her first book."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here. What was the point of this story? I was in the mood for something humorous and I love to read about dogs. So, the first few pages were promising. But the story never really went anywhere. It was like reading a soap opera without the suspense. I managed to finish the book (always hopeful something interesting would happen), but I feel like I wasted my time."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I wanted to like this book, but somehow I just didn't. The mix of tacky sex, limp suspense, and contrived romance really didn't work for me."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Quinn is an art teacher in a small town called Tibbett, Ohio. She has a perfect boyfriend, Bill who is a football coach in the school where she works as art teacher. He is famous for his coaching skills, his team and his personality as the nicest guy in the town. She has an older sister Zoe who is flighty so she becomes the voice of reason in her family from early on. She is always poised always solving issues and fixing things.Every things looks perfect but she is bored to death. That's when fate intervenes. She sees a dog and she wants to keep it. When she faces strong opposition from Bill, she starts evaluating her entire life and makes some changes. She keeps the dog, breaks up with Bill and tries to start a relationship with her ex-brother-in-law (married to her sister Zoe for 3 months 19 years before) and best friend Nick. Except, Nick is not interested in relationships and Bill doesn't accept their breakup. Her school principal wants her to go back to Bill because he is not able to concentrate on coaching. Her mother wants her to go back to Bill because he is steady and earning. Her friends suggest that she go back to Bill. Quinn resists every one of these well wishers and suddenly everyone around her except Nick and Bill start making changes to their own lives.The story is funny and fast paced. I finished it in one sitting. The secondary characters are also interesting and well-developed. My only complaint was that Nick seemed to change his mind very fast. There are a lot of twists and turns to keep the reader hooked. I have read almost all of Crusie's books. Though this is not her best, in my opinion, it is still good.3.5 stars"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This was the worst book I have ever read.

It drags on and on with no purpose."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Jennifer Crusie is a very entertaining author, her books are an easy fun read, great for that trip or weekend alone!!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Loved this book. It was such an entertaining book from the very beginning that I had a hard time putting it down.Loved Quinn's character and all the relationships that were interwoven in the book."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I always enjoy Jennifer Crusie's books, but this is my favorite of hers, and one of my favorite light romances ever. The chemistry between Quinn and Nick is excellent, and the side story of Max and Darla is very funny. The small town setting, the dog, even the crazy coach ex-boyfriend make it a five star read for me, and one that I return to over and over."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I highly recommend this book if you like quirky funny love stories. It's well worth the time to read this romance."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Crusie has it all in this one, suspense that will have you jumping at things that go bump in the night. A scrap of a dog that wins your heart without even trying and a lover that has you in his corner even when he messes up. All wrapped up in funny twists that will have you laughing so hard you'll cry."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This was a fun, light, chick lit read but to be honest, I expected a little better. I read \\"Bet Me\\" by Jennifer Crusie just prior to this book and it was one of the best books I've ever read of this genre -- period. Reading this right after it, and I suppose being one of her earlier novels, it was cute but just didn't stand out from the crowd. The dialogue is catchy, the characters three-dimentional, and the love story sweet. I just like a book to leave me wanting more, and when \\"Crazy For You\\" ended, I didn't look back."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I absolutely adore Jennifer Crusie and have most of her books. I especially like this book. The story she tells about Quinn, the dog, her love life, and her friends is totally funny! And there is a lot of romantic steaminess to boot!It also includes some &quot;real life&quot; drama with the boyfriend who just won't let go, people who are second guessing every decision, the choice to break out of the norm, etc.It not only is a great fiction book, but in a way gives you a little girl power too! :)"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"\\"Crazy for You\\" is the first book I have read from Jennifer Crusie and I only picked it up after reading good reviews from Amazon.[com.] I have to admit she is fast becoming one of my favourite contemporary-romance author!\\"Crazy for You\\" is sexy and witty and the conversation between characters are funny as well. Besides liking the part about Nick and Quinn, (Duh, who doesn't?! But it helps that Nick is super-hot and Quinn is so lovable,) I also really liked the part about Max and Darla. Throw in the part about Quinn's ex,Bill, an ex-boyfriend-turned-freaky-stalker, and you have the perfect read filled with romance, steamy sex, and just a bit of suspense.\\"Crazy for You\\" is recommended to everyone. Need I say more?"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Jennifer Crusie has a way of describing an ordinary event and taking us on a journey. These trips are full of excitement, disbelief, pure humor and love. \\"Crazy For You\\" is no exception.Quinn McKenzie is happy to just be and not ready to ask for more from life. She is living with the small town's legandary football coach, Bill. Everyone thinks she has the perfect life. Quinn never thought to question things either until the day one of her high school students gets her to take a stray dog. Bill is a control freak who usually gets his way by taking or naggng Quinn into acceptance and a dog is not part of the picture. Bill humor's Quinn for a day and then takes the dog to the pound while she is at work.As a response, Quinn's veil is lifted and she starts making all sorts of changes. Quinn's metamorphasis is contagious and pretty soon everyone whom we have been introduced to is breaking out of their molds. The men in this story are all standing by scratching their heads. Some take it better than others. Bill's lack of coping skills give us drama. While, Nick (Quinn's ex-brother-in-law) starts our engines.Jennfier Crusie's characters remind me of David Kelley's from \\"Alley McBeal\\", \\"Boston Public\\", & \\"The Practice\\". They are bizarre, charming, and a hoot. For pure fun give \\"Crazy For You\\" a chance."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"In CRAZY FOR YOU, all the criteria that make an author an autobuy for me are met in spades: realistic, appealing characters; complex, flawlessly executed plot; wickedly witty prose that captures -- and keeps -- my attention.To be honest, Ms. Crusie has an edge to her writing that, in a lesser author's hands, might actually turn me off, the humor notwithstanding. But in CRAZY FOR YOU, the sheer brilliance of her craft softens that edge, infusing depth and richness into what might otherwise be nothing more than a sexy, outrageous romance.I thoroughly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"'Crazy for You' was the first Jennifer Crusie novel I've picked up. It won't be the last. I had a blast reading it from cover to cover, laughing out loud more than a couple of times because of the author's great insights into her characters.Quinn, a school teacher, has a very normal lifestyle, and that's what she hates about it, it's too normal. Life with her boyfriend Bill is going down the tube, especially when he refuses to let Quinn keep Katie, a mongrel that one of her students found. Quinn moves out with the help of her old friend Nick Ziegler, and that's when the sparks start to fly!A well rounded book with great supporting characters that add real texture to this remarkable book."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"What a refreshing book! Jennifer Crusie is wonderful. She has an incredible talent to make her characters so real....the inner monologues of Quinn are hilarious! I got so hooked I went and bought her other books and they are just as good! A must read."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This is the story of Quinn and her friends, a group of incredibly gossipy small town thirty-somethings who seem perpetually confused. Quinn falls in love with a mangy dog and this triggers her desire for a change in her routine life. And the changes come fast. OK, I liked the fact that these are ordinary people and that the book is about ordinary life, and there is some humor but the whole time while reading it, I felt I was watching a sitcom. So I'll recommend it to people under 40, not to middle aged folks who, hopefully, are enjoying secure relationships and don't want to read about nutcase behavior."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I originally reached for this book for the sheer fun and delight I knew this author would provide. I got that, of course, in Nick and Quinn, and Quinn's family and friends and even in her students, but it was the fascinating downward spiral into madness of her former boyfriend that had me riveted to the pages. Such darkness amidst such humor, each handled so skillfully by Ms. Cruisie, has cemented this fan's opinion that this author is one to watch out for--and enjoy--for years to come. I highly recommend this book (and it also had one of the best &quot;love&quot; scenes I've read in awhile!)."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This is my 3rd Crusie book and I had just finished Fast Women which I really liked. As I started getting into this book, it felt like deja vu. Quinn and her ratdog was like Nel and her Sugarpie. Darla was another Suzie from Fast Women. Both stories took place in small towns where everyone was somehow connected. Darla and Quinn both looking for that \\"zing\\" in their life, the passion they both needed. Like other reviewers, I actually liked Darla more than Quinn. But I have yet to finish this book. In most Crusie books, I think the supporting characters are actually better than the main heroine.So 2 stars because of the recycled material. I will continue to read Crusie as long as each story is different and unique from the last."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Crusie is an automatic keeper. Her writing is witty and the story lines are interesting. The only reason I haven't given her 5 stars is because I can't read them in one sitting (over 300 pages). :) Too bad she is such a prolifice writer! See the other 64 reviews to date."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I only wish the book was as good as the synopsis on the back, which I considered hilarious. The supposed humor in this book rarely gave me more than a smile. Maybe I just didn't get it... I can think of many other books that made me laugh more than this one did.Like a previous reviewer, I, too, appreciate the use of ordinary people in ordinary towns and circumstances. Too many romances are about the beautiful people of a given age/location, so this was a refreshing change."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I have read five books in the last two weeks, including Linda Lael Miller &amp; Susun Elizabeth Phillips new one. I threw them away and kept this one! I have been looking for a new author to read and Jennifer Crusie fits the bill. This book is very funny, full of relationships and very sexy!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"&quot;Crazy for You&quot; was pretty good. I never suspected Bill to be that crazy. I'm glad Quinn found true love with Nick, and that everything worked out well for Darla and Max. Last year, I read &quot;Tell Me Lies&quot;, and that was also good. Jennifer Crusie is a great writer. She depicts small town life pretty well."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I was disappointed with this book. The dialogue is often unimaginative and silly...repetitious phrases like \\"her hair like copper silk,\\" \\"warm and round,\\" and \\"oh hell\\" got old fast, and the plot didn't seem important. The characters were flat and the book just didn't get going for me...if Quinn was so exciting and wonderful, what was she doing with that dork Bill in the first place? Just change boyfriends and get over it, will ya? Similarly, the Nick character's reasoning that kept him away from Quinn was just stupid; a vague threat from his ex-wife 20 years ago kept his simmering love at bay? Quinn is 35 years old, and he's nearly 40 for goodness sake! Get real! I even found the dog irritating! My advice to the author: Invest in a thesaurus and work on character development. Guess I'm just not a fan of \\"light romance.\\""},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I have read other books by this author in the past and I've enjoyed them. This is not one of her best. The connection between Quinn and Nick is a bit oversimplified, but I can forgive that since it isn't unusual to see this in romance novels. Honestly, it would only have taken a few more scenes showing the progression from long time friends to romantic interests to make their relationship seem much more plausible. The secondary characters added a nice mix to the story. I found Barbara to be a caricature of a husband stealer, who's whole purpose was just to add unnecessary drama. It would have been nice to see her grow during the book and see the error of her ways by the end. I do have a huge complaint about this book that would keep me from recommending it to a friend. The author spends a good portion of the book (I would estimate about 30% if not more) writing from the perspective of Quinn's ex Bill. It is obvious early on that he is a complete psychopath. Reading scene after scene written from such a creepy perspective just really doesn't fit in a romance novel- especially one I picked up expecting a humorous read. I think this book would have been much better if it utilized some other plot device to move the story forward, rather than having Bill be the main focus. Bottom line: If you are new to Crusie, start elsewhere. I especially recommend Bet Me if you are looking for a place to start reading. This book gets three stars because Quinn and Nick are likeable characters, as are the two main secondary characters."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I agree with another reader - were we all reading the same book. I was really looking forward to this book. I've read other Crusie books & loved them & this book had great reviews. But I was thoroughly dissappointed - bad in every way. The plot was lame, the characters were lame....lame, lame, lame. And have I mentioned boring? I do not recommend this book. Neither do I recommend \\"Getting Rid of Bradley\\" or \\"Charlie All Night\\". But I have read a few greats by Crusie - I RECOMMEND: \\"Bet Me\\" and \\"Welcome to Temptation\\"."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This is one of those love stories which just sucks you in and makes you want more. Jennifer crusie has a very endearing style of writing. Her characters were very real and you almost felt as if you were part of the small town they lived in. It's also the first book in which I liked all the secondary characters almost as much as the main protagonists. I would certainly recomend this as an entertaining beach read!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This is one of those books that you like more each time you read it. I just finished reading it the second time and I liked it more than the first time I had read it. If you are one of those romance fans who like humor more than tear jerking emotion then this is the book for you. Not that this is lacking in emotion, it's just the emotion is also presented in such humorous way that you want to laugh and cry both for Quinn and Nick.The way Nick and Max kept criticizing each others love life was hilarious. And they didn't know what to do with their own love life. This is so true how we keep telling others what to do but keep screwing up our own life!!! I have always liked friends turned lovers kind of romances and this is the best I have read ever!All the characters are so interesting. Darla was a darling. I liked her more than Quinn actually. Everyone had there own story and an interesting one.I can't wait to read welcome to temptation which I had ordered."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Several reviewers before me have done a great job of summarizing the plot of the story, so I will not bore you with yet another summary and instead just report my positive experience with this book!Crazy for You is the first book I have read by Jennifer Crusie. I was hooked from the beginning and found the book to be a fast and fun read. The characters are well-developed and it was easy for me to relate many of them to people I know in real life. The plot never became too far-fetched, and it was fun to read a book that left me wanting to keep reading long past my normal bedtime!This book was especially pleasing to read because it revolves around life in a small town where gossip is always being exchanged and lives are constantly intersecting. The scences described about conversation in the school staff rooms cracked me up. I think we can all think back to our high school teachers and figure out which ones were the nosy ladies looking for hot scoop to spread through the town!I highly recommend that you read Crazy for You if you're looking for some witty, non-shallow, non-overly dramatic chick lit with a plot. I was pleased with the reading experience that Jennifer Crusie provided me and will be heading to the library soon to check out a few more of her books!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This, as most of Jennifer Crusie's books, was a fast and fun read.The story of the small town and teachers will hit home for anyone thinking of dating a work colleague. The gossip circle of the school is oh so true! Equally true is the obsessive lover."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I think she did an excellent job of slowly showing Bill's decline. I have only just read three of her books and so far I am really enjoying myself!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This is a lovely romance novel, but that isn't all that it is. Along with the romance you find suspense and adventure twisted in.Quiin and Bill are school teachers, at the same school. They have been living together for quite some time, but Quinn needs a change as she notices some of Bill's controlling habits. Quinn breaks it off. Was she crazy to leave Bill, or was Bill crazy enough to drive her away?This was a wonderful story, and although it wasn't the most suspensful of stories there are a few spots that kept me on the edge of my seat. Ms. Crusie is one of my favorite authors of romance as her characters are real, beleivable, and humerous. Her books are always entertaining, and I would recommend all of her novels to anyone. This novel is of course no exception."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I liked this book, but the characters are very similar to another one of the author's books Tell me lies. I liked though. You feel for Quinn and you root for her."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"If you like Jennifer Crusie's humorous, sexy and suspensful writing, you will like this book.If you haven't read Crusie's work before, she has a light fast-paced style. She understands alot about small towns and her characters are real and fairly complex. In this book she explores the themes of fidelity and acceptance in relationships, as well as the need for and problems with changes in life. There is a lot of humor here, even in the villain."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I am a huge Jennifer Crusie fan- after reading this book; it was the first one of hers I read, and I don't usually read books like this; I have bought all of her other books after reading this and I love them all so far; they're fun, easy reads. BUY IT!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I love this book!! I cant put it down, it usually takes me a week or so to finish a book but I finished this in a couple of days.The carachters are fun and exciting, and I couldnt wait to see what happened next.This is a must read! Awsome beach or poolside book!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I am a fan of Nora Roberts, but now that I've read several JC books, I realize I wasn't relating to NR the way I tune into this author. It might be because I'm a teacher in a small community, or have dated an OK guy that turned into a creepy dude, I don't know. I love the fact that Quinn didn't settle for the ordinary relationship and went looking for more!Like I said, I've now read several Jen Cruise books and I keep coming back to Crazy for You as my favorite. Its a good one to start with for a good introduction to her brand of humor!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"What a delightful read!! Quinn and Nick are so down to earth, as are all the people we meet from Tibbett, OH. Lots of little twists and turns, all so human and believeable! Sometimes I feel like Darla, I love my husband, but after 10 years, things get stale at times. I can't wait to read more Cruise books and meet new characters!!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Can you tell - I am absolutely in love with this book! I picked it up yesterday and read it in a night!I came online to check and see if this has been made into a movie. Part of me wants to see this onscreen (I've even got a cast in mind), but another part would hate it if the story was ruined (the way Hollywood has a tendency to do).I loved the plot, the characters, the insanely hot sex and the beautiful and spirited little Katie! I hate, hate, HATED Bill - so much so that I wanted a longer and more graphic description of his come uppance.I'm off now to find other stories by this gifted, funny and enchanting writer. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"When I started reading this book, I thought it was just going to be your average, formula romance. But the plot quickly pulls you in and you keep going, fascinated, as the ex-boyfriend evolves into a stalker and the two main characters fight the chemistry. THIS IS A GREAT BOOK!!! The ending is very satisfying, on several levels. Check other reviews for the plotline. This book is DEFINITELY a keeper for me..."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I'm such a Crusie fan it's almost indecent. This book was such fun!Quinn McKenzie's day started out in it's usual normal 'beige' way and then a stray dog came along and messed up her life, her friend's lives and her parents. Before she knew it she'd broken up with her boring boyfriend, her best friend had left her husband, her mother had come out of the closet, and her best friend Nick has kissed her and she's seeing fireworks.What follows is her ex kidnapping her dog, stalking her and her discovering that sometimes the guy who's been there all your life is the one that gets you all hot and steamy! This book does get quite hot and steamy, so if that's not your cup of tea don't pick this one up."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Quinn McKenzie is a High School art teacher. She is known as being the calm one in the McKenzie family; the one that makes things right. One of her favorite students, Thea, finds a dog and takes Quinn to it; as she knows that Quinn loves animals and finds homes for them. When Quinn meets Katie (the dog), she falls in love, and decides she wants to keep Katie for her own. This is where the story begins.Quinn's not-so-significant other (Bill) unilaterally decides that Quinn will not keep the dog. He informs Quinn of his decision; going so far as to take Katie to the pound when Quinn won't give her up. Quinn realizes that she doesn't love Bill, has never loved Bill; and moves out. Bill does not take this so well.Enter Nick Ziegler. Nick is Quinn's best friend, next to Darla Ziegler (Nick's sister-in-law, wife of Max, Nick's brother). Nick was Quinn's brother-in-law (briefly married to her sister Zo...who would have made a great Crusie character...see this as a plug for a prequel to Quinn's story, please!) for a few months about twenty years before the story takes place. Nick has been in love with Quinn for that entire twenty years...but he's good at sublimating, so he tells himself that while he loves her, he's not IN-LOVE with her...they're just friends...really.Nick helps Quinn move out of Bill's; and that's when Quinn notices Nick. She decides she has to have him...he pretty much screams like a girl and runs for cover. Eventually, he comes to his senses, and he and Quinn wind up together. The trip from start to finish is GREAT! I LOVE this book!The supporting cast of Darla and Max Ziegler, Meggy and Joe McKenzie (Quinn's \\"'rents\\"), Zo-remotely (telephone calls), Edie the High School English teacher (and a bit more...no spoilers, though), along with Barbara, just add to the greatness of this book.Buy it! Read it! You won't be disappointed...unless, of course, you don't like fiction..."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Wow! This book is steamy and fun! Quinn and Nick have always been best friends, but once Quinn decides not to be so predictable and safe, things start to heat up between these two. The sexual tension between them is sizzling! The auditorium sex scene - well let's just say you may need a cold shower after reading it! The suspense part of the book is based on Quinn's ex-boyfriend Bill. He's a total whack job, way beyond the normal control freak. I definitely recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"It was about a school teacher, Quinn, her family and friends. It was about relationships that weren't going well, some were breaking up. Some got back together later. Nothing really excited me. Even after seeing her end up with Nick, which was a happy ending, I felt as if too many details were missing. The story wasn't as fulfilling as I would have liked. Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: three. Setting current day, small town USA. Copyright: 1999. Genre: contemporary romance."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This is a fun book with a real plot to it.Quinn is a boring, safe, school teacher and she is sick and tired of her life. She decides to make some changes. She gets a dog, dumps her boyfriend and buys a house. Her taking chances in her life, inspires people around her to do the same. The ripple effect is great -- from her mom to her best friend (I don't want to give away too much!).Her ex-boyfriend's character is a bit over the top -- unbelievable and then just not enjoyable to the story anymore. I think it was a great book w/o all his drama, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. But it is a fun, quick, enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"The plot's been given several times by other reviewers so I'll just give my opinion. Great book! I'm a big fan of Crusie so I'd recomend all her books but this one is my second fav. My number one is Welcome To Temtation. This one is great for me because I love plots of old friends ending up together. And the sexual tension is great between the main characters. The sub plot of the long married couple trying to rekindle the sparks is very realistic dispite the humor. And the bisexaul house wife will have you laughing out loud even if that sounds crazy to you know. This one's worth your time. READ IT!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"When Quinn McKenzie decides to get a dog, she doesn't realize how much one little animal can upset her orderly life. Before she knows it, she's leaving her boyfriend, buying a house, and potentially falling in love with the guy who's been her best friend for as long as she can remember. Crazy for You is classic Crusie with a little dog-napping, obsessive exes, commitment-phobic mechanics, and animal-saving art teachers thrown into the mix. This book took awhile for me to get into, but once I did I really enjoyed it. It reminded me a lot of Anyone But You, another Crusie book that focuses on the way getting an animal can change your life, but this one was a bit more dark than ABY. Overall, I thought this book was good with a lot of funny moments and with a strong plot that just took awhile to develop. I'd recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Crusie's work or to anyone who likes chick lit with a little intrigue."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"The main romance between Nick and Quinn is good, but there is also an underlying theme about overcoming marital discontent that made this book great. Max and Darla rang so true. Surely every married woman in America has struggled with keeping the flame alive like Darla. It was a quick and fun read."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Quinn adopts a dog, and we're off! This one act triggers the whole town to go crazy, including the local mechanic Nick who finds that after years of friendship, he's crazy for Quinn. The psychotic ex was less than fun, and overall the book wasn't my favorite Jennifer Cruisie book, but well worth the time."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I enjoyed this story. It is fast paced and more than a little crazy. It is based on a woman who has decided that she wants to make a few small changes in her life. Basically she wants to keep the stray dog that someone has brought her. Her live in boyfriend (who is just a bit controlling) doesn't want it and even takes it to the pound. This sets off a huge chain of events that ends up with her being stalked and at the same time finally finding her true sole mate. Along the way she buys a house, helps her friend try and put some spark back in her marriage, and it seems the entire town catches the bug that she has and things are changing all over the place. There is quite a lot about stalking in this story that makes you take notice!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Crusie's characters literally pop out of the page at you. I found myself wanting to smack Bill, the ex-boyfriend, gossip with Darla, and help Quinn move, just from reading. The book's exploration of what one small decision can do to affect the lives of practically an entire town is interesting and thorough, and Crusie throws in enough quirky characters and plot loops to keep one interested the entire way through. But like any good romance, everything works out in the end - just not the way you'd quite expect a typical romance novel to work out, though. A caveat - if stalker-esque behaviour freaks you out, you might want to avoid this book."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This novel is all about how changes, even something as small as adopting a stray dog, can shake up your own life while managing to cause ripple effects in the lives of your friends and family. I really enjoyed reading the book! The only thing I'd change about it is Katie; I wish Katie had been a cat instead of a dog! I'm not much of a dog person. Other than that, an excellent story!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This isn't my normal sort of book. I read this book while working as a teacher in a foreign country and was limited in book selections. I had already read 'Temptation' which I found entertaining. I thought I was reading something light. Wrong! This book (for me) was no light read. As a teacher I could completely relate to the various stresses the protagonist went through: from buying a house on a teacher's salary to the fear of misunderstood affection for a student. The author was so dead on that I was stunned by the closeness of it to (my) real life. A collegue I shared the book with wholeheartedly agreeded with the uneasiness. If you are a female teacher of students middle school aged and up, this is a must read. If you aren't a teacher you will appreciate it anyway because it is utterly entertaining. For whatever reason you choose to read it, it's a gem!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This is the second book I have read by Ms. Crusie and found it about the same in comedy and story-line. The humor was okay, but not up to my expectations. I liked the fact that the author had the main character of Quinn have a close friend that was a woman, when most romance novels focus on the hate between two women instead of the joy and friendship. I also liked the male lead better in this book than her other one &quot;Tell Me Lies&quot;. he was more real and believeable.~Quinn McKenzie is tired of her boring life and her boring boyfriend. She is sick and tired of living what she calls a 'beige life' and intends to do something about it before she goes nuts! But what she finds out is changing her life is not going to be easy. For a respected art teacher with everything going for her, the towns people are shocked to find out that the 'good girl' who is dating the perfect guy is not so 'perfect' or 'good'.She begins by adopting a stray dog and what sounds really innocent and 'beige' turns crazy in a matter of one day! Dog-napping, breaking and entering, seduction, sabotage, stalking and more secrets than she really wants to know and two men that are suddenly crazy over her! Quinn has to calm things down before her normally 'beige' life turns deadly!The male lead of Nick Ziegler is great, he's not some super'buffed man with rippling muscles, but a normal guy who has been best friends with Quinn and also her sister's ex-husband, lol. He doesn't expect to fall in love with Quinn when he is caught in the middle of her mad world! Or was he always in love with shy and quiet Quinn? Can he put his feelings aside in the name of friendship when some guy suddenly starts stalking her peaceful world? Or will he become suddenly obsessed with her also?There are some really funny parts and the 'love' scenes nearly set fire to the pages! All in all a fun read, but i wouldn't rate it with the best...Tracy Talley~@"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I am a fan! Jennifer Cruise is an incredible author. This is the 3rd book that I have read; Manhunting &amp; Temptation are the others, and I love her stuff!In \\"Crazy for You\\" Quinn is a 35 year old high school art teacher who decides to change her life. As a result, the whole town begins to make some changes too.This is a funny story about families and relationships and all of the messes that can ensue.Perfect summer time reading. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Too bad this book is fiction instead of non-fiction. Then it'll prove that females do rule this world! With a little change with Quinn McKenzie (that is a girl! ) everyone around her starts changing also. Her mom is coming out of the closet, her best-friend is moving in with her and best of all, that sexy Nick and her may have somethin going on. The story gets really interesting when Quinn's persistent ex, Bill, starts stalking her. Things get intersting and all this from a little change with Quinn getting Katie, a poor looking dog that really looks like a rat."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This was a really fun book to read. Some of the humor reminded me of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum, or the &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; books. My local librarians (thank you Sue and Linda!!) have turned me on to some good reads lately by relatively &quot;unknown&quot; authors, and this book was a perfect example--I thoroughly enjoyed the characters and the love-play between them. Quinn was the perfect heroine, because she is real and we can identify with her as women looking to get out of our boring, daily lives. It's a great book--gotta read it!!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I just returned from vacation where I devoured this book! I loved it. It made me laugh out loud several times which caused my 3 year old to ask what was so funny! Now I am waiting for the movie. I can just see Sandra Bullock as Quinn but I haven't yet made my decision for Nick - maybe Nic Cage. Nic fits Nick's description - wiry and not too good looking. I have also read Tell Me Lies (&amp; loved it) and am anxious to read Welcome to Temptation. I am almost tempted to buy the hardcover rather than wait several months for the paperback."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This was my first Jennifer Cruise book I have ever read. It was a pleasant surprise to read that she is an Ohio State University professor and it was even nicer to read that this book is set in Ohio too! I thoroughly enjoyed this book ~~ light, funny and sexy. Who ever says small towns are boring need to read this book!It all starts with a dog. Quinn McKenzie rescues a small dog and falls in love with her. She decided to keep her in spite of her boyfriend's objections. Then her &quot;beige&quot; life (where she's dating the nicest guy, has a good job, surrounded by friends and family ~~ only to realize that she was bored to tears) suddenly changed into a life of color (there's even a huge red couch in her new life). Between dog-nappings, breaking and entering, seduction, sabotage, stalking, secrets and suddenly two men who were crazy for her ~~ it's enough to keep you interested in the book.It is a quick read and funny as heck. There are some scenes in there that reminded me too much of my experiences with a stalker ~~ Cruise writes that vividly! I would wait till the last minute to go to work because I was so caught up in the book. Then the first chance I would take, I would grab it and start reading it again!Even if you don't need a reason to buy this book, I recommend it anyways. It's fun, sexy, terrifying all rolled into one ball. Since I have read two of Cruise's books, I will be keeping an eye out for the rest of her collection. Once you start reading this one, you're hooked. And it's a ride that you won't easily forget."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I read &quot;Tell Me Lies&quot; last year and did not purchase this book until it came out in paperback. What a suprise! After reading this I will not even wait for her next book to come out in pb. I am running to the store for &quot;Welcome To Temptation&quot; in March!The reason I loved this book were the characters and Ms. Crusie's wonderful writing style. Funny and sexy go well together! Also I love the fact that Quinn and Nick seem like normal people. Not perfect, yet still attractive to each other. They are not super rich or super thin or super models! A nice change from all those other romances where the hero and heroine have perfect looks/bodies/money, blah, blah, blah.And Quinn's family and friends are as intersting as she is. Not to mention hard headed. I loved them all! I only wish it didn't have to end! Bravo Ms. Crusie. You are a terriffic writer and my favorite new author!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Jennifer Crusie is at the top of her game in this charming and hysterical contemporary romance. All of her trademark elements are here - witty dialogue, amuzing secondary characters, a hot romance. This is the story of a small town art teacher, Quinn McKenzie, who adopts a stray dog and decides to finally take control of her life. She breaks up with the steady but dull school coach, gets her own place and tries to initiate a romance with her ex-brother-in-law and close friend, Nick. The problem is that the rest of the town thinks she lost her mind. The coach refuses to accept their break-up and her boss blames her for the team's loosing streak and threatens to fire her. Inspired by Quinn's new attitude, her Mom comes out of the closet and her best friend leaves her happy but unexciting 20 year marriage. As if things are bad enough, Nick refuses to sleep with her! There's one amusing plot twist after the other, and the dialogue is priceless. One of the things I love best about Crusie's novels is the way she makes the lives of ordinary people - Quinn is a teacher and Nick is an automechanic - funny, exciting, sexy and romantic. This is a great novel that you will read again and again, laughing all the while."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Crusie really succeeds here with the tale of a young teacher who gets tired of her mundane life in a small town and tosses it over, only to find the excitement she craved at her doorstep.There are all manners of plot devices represented here; the notable theme being long-term relationships and can two people ever stay together for a long time without growing in different directions. Great insight into the teaching profession and \\"office politics\\" in public school academia, as well!Crusie is lighthearted and unafraid to have her books fall into the \\"beach trash\\" category, and, in the manner of Evanovich, (without the mystery) goes way over the top with some of the plot twists. This book, like her others, just cannot be put down!One caution for new readers - Crusie makes the sex scenes in her books hot enough to need a small firefighting device close to the place you choose to read. She has an incredible touch in describing how both men and women feel in their most passionate moments.Look for Crusie to score big with her big with her next new novel...she has really developed a following!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I don't read a lot of romance novels because the cliched plots, bad dialogue and over-the-top prose usually all drive me nuts. But Jennifer Cruise writes romantic novels that are funny without being too cute; romantic without being completely improbable; sweet without being cloying. _Crazy For You_ has a classic plot-line (lifelong best friends suddenly find themselves in major lust with each other) but the story still kept me guessing and very interested throughout. I liked the main characters and rooted for them to get together. The kissing/sex scenes were also steamy and fun.The supporting charaters and storylines entertain (and that's a rarity in this genre) while taking away nothing from the central love story. All the characters, in fact, are appealing and believeable, with only one exception: Bill, the heroine's ex-boyfriend. We know he's doomed to be dumped from the start, but his increasingly erratic behavior doesn't fit with what we know of him early in the book (he's sensible, dependable, and deadly dull) and his downward spiral into scary stalker territory didn't ring true to me.But that's only a very minor criticism of a book that is a joy to read. Jennifer Cruise is a talented writer who knows how to create engaging love stories and this is the book that made me want to read everything she has written. I recommend _Crazy For You_ to anyone who enjoys love stories but may sometimes turn their noses up at romance novels. It's perfect for beach reading or as something to relax with in the tub."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I only wish Quinn could have been tougher. This sort of spoils the book. Besides that, I would have given it a 5. I know, it's a book, it's not real. Still a wonderful read. Enjoy.P.S. I hate the changes that Amazon has made. Searches are not as easy and not as accurate as they were before. And, the book ratings are not shown unless you click to see them. Looks like I'll be spending more time selecting books."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"High School art teacher Quinn is leading a predicable and boring life. She is engaged to the school's baseball coach, Bill, and he's crazy for her. Maybe a little too much. Forever picking up strays and finding them new homes, she's suddenly drawn to the ugliest and scrawniest dog she's ever seen. When Bill insists that she take it to the pound, she refuses. Bill takes the dog to the pound himself since he's used to taking control in their relationship, and Quinn promptly sees this a catalyst of their future and calls off the wedding, moves out, and tries life on her own.But Bill has a really hard time realizing that it's over, as he campaigns to reclaim the affections of the woman he loves, to the point of stalking. The normally staid Bill descends into a man over the edge. All this plays out in the gossipy small town in which they live. The school board wants her to get back with Bill so the baseball team can have a championship season. Meanwhile, Quinn's newfound independence is contagious to other members of the community.Quinn turns to best pal Darla, who's having trouble igniting passion in her own marriage, as well as hunky ex-brother-in-law Nick. As Quinn tries to encourage Nick to take a chance with her, Bill is not far behind trying to stake his claim. Nick is the reticent love 'em and leave 'em type - not used to sharing his life since his divorce nearly 20 years early.At times scary, tender, and downright hilarious, this is a great and fast read from cover to cover! Crusie is still the best romance writer at capturing the essence of relationships particularly the dialogue - even in the oddest situations, her crisp dialogue always rings true rather than cliched and dated like many of her contemporaries."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This book is such a fun, playful read! I could not put this book down once I got passed the halfway mark. Jennifer Cruise is a great author and I am her new biggest fan. Keep them coming Ms. Cruise! Your time will not be wasted on this book, it will keep you interested and laughing!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I thought this book was fabulous and nearly perfect. I thought ALL the elements worked. The humor and romance were perfection itself and Bill's descent into near madness was one of the most compelling and logical I've ever read because it made so much sense to him. Every character in Tibbett rang true with genuine depth and charm. I didn't want to put the book down and when I did, I couldn't find anything else nearly as wonderful to read. This is my favorite Jennifer Crusie book to date! She's earned a lifelong fan with this marvelous novel."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Jennifer Crusie hits a home run with this one! I lost an entire day's work because I couldn't put it down. It's funny,fresh, and completely satisfying! This is one book you won't feel as if you've read a hundred times before. I loved the characters, the humor, and the surprises. The best book I've read in months!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"So this confetti cover catches my eye. What kind of book gets this kind of weird cover? As a man, if it's a &quot;woman's book,&quot; I won't be interested.When I look inside I see sex - good stuff, with both emotions and sensations - from a woman's viewpoint. Is this for real? Most woman novelists are too indirect. But, checking the author photo, it was written by a real live woman. Just maybe, if I read this, I can get a glimpse of sex from the &quot;other side.&quot;And I read it, enjoying the sex as expected. And I do get to see the other side, not just the sex part either. Yes, it's a little romancy contrived - but not enough to spoil the fun. So why only three stars? Well, Steinbeck gets five. I'm sure Jennifer will understand. She does, after all, have a passionate sense of humor."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"So, there I was: sick of kids, sick of husband, sick of everything in my normal, ordinary life. Needed a treat in the worst way. Do I buy the hardcover or indulge myself with a bottle of Italian wine? One or the other--both are impossible. I bought the book. And, boy, was it ever worth it. We all know Cruise is funny--and she is. This is a very funny book. But there's also a rich, deeply satisfying kind of honor underlying her work, an exploration of our deepest relationships, our most treasured wishes and dreams, a recognition of how deep and terrible and wonderful our lives are if we take three seconds to appreciate them. Crusie is funny, but she's also wise, and the combination has never been better than in CRAZY FOR YOU."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Heroine: average/voluptuousHigh School art teacher Quinn McKenzie, known for being reliable, dependable, and responsible, is bored, bored, bored! But then she adopts a pathetic little stray mutt and her entire world is turned upside down. A simple \\"take it to the pound\\" from her all-American coach boyfriend plunges her into the realization that he's not the man for her. Whoever \\"her\\" is. She's not really sure who she is anymore. In fact the only thing she is sure of is that she wants that dog. And her sister's sexy ex-husband. And a rundown old house all her own. But that's it. Really.Before she knows it, Quinn's decision to assert herself has rippled through the small town and broken up several other relationships, created some new ones, and driven the school's championship winning baseball team toward the bottom of the league.Can she and her town survive her epiphany--and her ex's increasing mental instability?What worked for me:I thought Quinn was a terrific heroine, a nice gal who got caught up in a weird situation.True romantics will be glad to hear that there are lots of couples to root for in this story, their issues being the sort that can be related to by most women. (I know I certainly understood them.)Some of the imagery in the story was just so vivid I felt like I was really there. And the humor is deliciously, wickedly, laugh out loud funny.Size-wise Quinn was a softly-rounded average. She thought she might have about ten pounds to lose, but the men around her thought her lush curves wore those ten \\"extra\\" pounds very well.What didn't work for me:There were a lot of characters to keep track of in this book and the reader spends a fair amount of time in the shoes of each one. This makes for deeper characters but the constant juggling of people might be confusing to some readers.Overall:\\"Crazy For You\\" has a great blend of sexual tension, suspense, and humor. I think it's just bumped up into my #1 favorite Jenny Crusie novel slot.Warning: This book has some steamy moments, coarse words, and mild references to lesbianism within its pages.If you liked \\"Crazy For You\\" you might also enjoy \\"Some Girls Do\\", \\"Heaven in Your Eyes\\", \\"Fast Women\\", \\"Name Dropping\\", \\"Welcome to Temptation\\", \\"Faking It\\", \\"Switcheroo\\", \\"Plum Girl\\", \\"Infernal Affairs\\", or \\"Princess Charming\\"."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This is a cute story but not as interesting as her other books that I have read. The characters are not as fascinating as they were in Agnes and the Hitman, but are interesting. It seemed like the adults were still living their lives like they were still high school students.I don't want to give away the plot but there are definitely turns and twists that do keep you reading. It is worth buying at the prices Amazon offers."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This was a very interesting book for me to read. Although at times it was a bit emotional for me because the psychotic dude was really CRAZY He gave me the willies! Other than that the book flowed smoothly and had a very nice happy ending. The sexy scenes were hot and perfect. The hero's main characters brother frustrated the heck out of me! I thought he was a bit too naive for his own good. I hope that any man who's greeted by his wife naked understands the message she is trying to send him, and not \\"honey go get the chips\\"."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Never has a book made me feel so warm and squishy inside, but at the same time, so damn angry and frightened and . . . just every evil thing you could think of! I absolutely LOVE this book!! 'Crazy for You' is literally a crazy roller coaster ride in the life of this young teacher who decided that the 'beige' life she was living wasn't what she wanted anymore. It all starts with an adorable little puppy, and everything starts to fall apart soon after. On the bright side, the romance that develops in this story is very sweet and appealed to my romantic side (Jennifer Crusie is very good at that) and the love scenes are ones I'll remember forever (especially the auditorium scene...very nice :oD). However, the antics that the ex-boyfriend go through to get her back are completely unforgivable, especially those concerning the dog. I wanted to do very bad things to this man . . . this just goes to show how Ms. Crusie's books can pull you in and make you feel for the characters, either negatively or positively, and that's what makes her so great. I was literally going crazy reading this book! But as many times as I wanted to put the book down because the ex was upsetting me so much, I couldn't because I had to know how it would end. The story itself is very good, though, and I highly recommend reading this book. If you're up for a book that has everything you could think of--thrills, laughs, love, hot auditorium lovin' ;o), stalking, you name it!--then this book is definitely for you. Just another reason why Jennifer Crusie is my absolute favorite author. :o)"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I have read several of this author's novels and this is my favorite. The plot and characters are woven together in a comepletely believable way. One little change \\"upsets\\" the balance in this small town and lead to a mountain of change. If you can read this book and not at least chuckle out lous than you have no sense of humor. A book everyone can enjoy. Yes, even men."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This book was adorable and will suck you in from page one. It's a great ensemble cast and you really will enjoy each story that's going on within. It seems to be Crusie's trademark to have strong secondary stories alongside her main characters.However, Crusie tries so hard to have the style, wit and cool of Sex in the City type characters. In my opinion, she doesn't make it. Her love scenes border on vulgar and her girlfriend talk tends to be over the top. Every scene of intimacy was discussed the next day with Quinn and her sister or her best friend or even with Nick himself. And those conversations were just too in-depth for me. I think I'd be embarassed to discuss my love life in detail. While I talk with my friends about anything, there's just some things you don't need to say. Get the picture?Read the book: You will laugh, cheer, cringe and laugh again."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I enjoyed this book. It has a nice storyline; however, it has a very slow beginning. The end really picked up though. It ended up being a great story. I liked Quinn a lot. She was a great character. The only thing about the book is that I got really distracted with Quinn's obsession over the dog. I think the dog part of the story was taking away from the romance that was developing between Quinn and Nick. She was so obsessed with the dog for most of the book that Nick didn't matter too much until the end. I would have enjoyed some more romance. Reading a book entitled, Crazy for you, I thought it would have been more about a steamy, exciting relationship than a dog. Even with the dog storyline, I do have to admit that I still liked the book. If you are looking for a good book, with not a lot of sex, but a pretty decent storyline, this one is for you."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Quinn McKenzie has lived in a small town all her life. At the age of 35, she is living with the dream of the town - the high school coach and is enjoying her job as art teacher.A student brings a stray dog to her and this dog serves as a catalyst for Quinn to evaluate her life. She has always just peacefully gone along with everyone and as a result - her life is flat and boring in her eyes.Quinn rebels and suddenly it seems as though the whole town is rebelling as well! What ensues is somewhat disturbing at times, but realistic in many ways.An excellent book."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This was the first book from Jennifer Crusie I managed to read. I liked it, but felt that it lacked momentum. Well, that is, until the last few chapters. I was pleased that the characters were of average character and status. Really, who needs to read about perfect people falling in love, right? With Quinn having \\"roundness\\" to her appearance, I felt that this book has promise for the average gal. The literal sense of how the title mirrored a character in the book was a shock to me. The stalker tendencies of the ex-boyfriend definitely was something I could relate to... being stalked is scary. Of course, this stalking story escalated a lot faster than I would have thought and to a much scarier level.Being a stronger fan of the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich, this is not at the same caliber in humor, but it had its funny moments. I will probably try another novel from this author, but if you are looking for sexual tension, humor and a little more mystery.... this may not be the best out there, but it is enjoyable after the story does manage to take off. This book had too many characters to be a fun read from the start, but it is good once the story takes shape. The last few chapters held more of my attention than the first half of the book. Did I like it? Yes. Did I absolutely love it? Not that much."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I would tell you to read this book. it was fun, kept me going, kept me entertained and kept me happy. Do it."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Crazy for you is the story of Quinn and Nick, formerly brother and sister-in-law, now best of friends. As the story starts, Quinn has made the decision to quit being a doormat to her ex-boyfriend and to start living her life. This means figuring out her attraction to Nick and trying to win him over. For his part, Nick knows he loves Quinn, but is content with his laid back lifestyle and unwilling to put their friendship at risk.The story progresses as Quinn must contend with a crazy ex-boyfriend who just won't take no for an answer. While the ex is loony, the novel itself is fast-paced and fun. I enjoyed Crusie's style and the subplots involving Nick's brother, Quinn's parents, and two of her students. And I loved Nick. He was sexy and sweet, and I loved that we got quite a bit of the story from his point of view."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This is my all-time favorite, go to book when I need to read something wonderful. From the opening when Quinn meets the dog to the end when Quinn and the dog Katie do what eeds t be done.... perfection.Quinn is a perfect heroine. She's smart, focused, funny and she changes everybody in her life because she needs to change her own life. Her one decision to buy a house (and leave her live-in boyfriend) sets an entire town into motion.I loved Quinn and Nick. I loved the slow spiral of Coach Bill. I loved Darla and the bank slut and well... I love Jennifer Crusie but this is my #1 book of all time. I'm an unabashed fan girl here and I totally admit to it."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This book is funny, suspenseful and, at times, tense. One of my favorites by J. Crusie. It really is hard to explain to someone how a book about a stalker can be funny, but it is."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"This is my favorite Jennifer Cruise book. I love the thinking process. Nick is a doll and I couldn't help cheering for Nick and Quinn. I love the way Nick is always thinking about Quinn and trying to avoid the physical attraction he has felt for 20 years. I would love a future book with Nick and Quinn as secondary characters. Of course I want them to be together. They are a great couple. I read this book over and over, whenever I want something to make me feel good. Bill is creepy and this in itself is an education for women who have controlling people in their lives. If you see similarities, get out.I have read most of her books and liked most enough to read again.I have read Jennifers supernatural books and frankly don't know why she is pursuing this genre. I was trying to read Wild Ride and just can't get into it."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I love this book. It has great dialog, terrific sexual tension and excellent characters. It's funny and hot. One of the best contemporary romances I've read."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Quinn McKenzie's rebellion started with a dog. It wasn't even a very big dog. It was just the dog she wasn't willing to give up to please someone else. For her entire life, Quinn has been the good girl, the steady one, the one who doesn't make waves. She has a good job as a high school art teacher and she's living with Bill - the world's nicest guy who teaches history and coaches boys' sports at the same high school. From the outside it looks like Quinn has everything under control and maybe she does, but she's also bored out of her mind. So when she brings home the small stray dog she's decided to keep and Bill says 'no,' something in Quinn snaps. She decides she's had enough of making other people happy. It's time for Quinn McKenzie to worry about grabbing some happy for herself.Suddenly everything in Quinn's life is going squirrelly. She's broken up with Bill but he doesn't seem to be getting the message. His refusal to accept what Quinn is telling him is making her angry, and starting to creep her out more than a little. Her good friend (and ex-brother-in-law) Nick Ziegler is alternately coming on to her and avoiding her. And while Quinn's pleased with the former, she knows Nick is a one night stand kind of guy, no matter how much she wishes he weren't. For his part, Nick is just plain confused. Quinn is his closest female friend, heck she's his only female friend. And the kind of things he's feeling for her could put that friendship in jeopardy.As if crazy hadn't already taken up a permanent slot in Quinn's daily agenda, her best friend Darla has decided to 'rekindle the fire' with her husband and the results are disastrous. And while she is busy comforting Darla, Quinn's mother has kicked her father out of the house - and dear old Dad has decided to move into Quinn's new place with her. Quinn loves her family, but living with your dad at her age? So not what she had in mind when she decided to assert her independence and leave Bill.This is Jennifer Crusie at her best. The plot is stellar, Quinn and Nick are a couple you can root for and the secondary characters add a wonderful depth to the story. Humor, a touch of suspense and lots of good old-fashioned romance make this book a delight from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"It all starts because of an abandoned, stray dog that is delivered to Quinn McKenzie, art teacher at Tibbet High School. Quinn rescues strays in her hometown but she has to give the dogs away since her live-in boyfriend, Bill, does not want any dogs in their apartment. But this time, Quinn decides to keep the pooch that she names Katie. Bill is having none of this and takes the dog to a kill shelter. When Quinn comes home and finds the dog gone, she decides that not only is she going to get her dog but she is leaving Bill. Quinn wants to change her life and decides Bill and she are not a good fit any longer.Once Quinn moves on, her best friend Darla decides she needs to have some change in her marriage. Then Quinn's mom decides that she needs a change from Quinn's dad. As the women in the town of Tibbet change their lives, the men in their lives are all flummoxed as to what to do about it all.This book was great. I could not stop reading it. The plot is wonderful, lots of romance, dialogue is snappy, and tons of humor.There is a dark side to the story as well, and the author handles it really well and provides some seriousness and edge to a story that could have been about only romance but actually deals with men who are controlling and find themselves turning on the women they want to control.I don't read too much contemporary romance but this was really, really good. Definitely a five star read!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Crazy For You is too good to put down. Quinn wants something different in her life. She gets a dog, moves out of her boyfriends place, and acts on her desire to have Nick, her closest friend, all to herself. The heat between Quinn and Nick carries to every page.There's funny dialogue, laughable situations, a stocking ex-boyfriend, and friends who want changes in their lives also which at times makes matters worse for them. Crusie did a great job of frustrating Quinn with Bills actions as well as the readers. I wanted to reach through the page and smack him. But some people really can't just let go of one's they love. It started to get a little scary when Bill was physically hurting Quinn and she should have went to the police right away. The little dog was cute, Nick was hot, and Max and Darla's situation was just as fun to read about as Quinn's. Another great book by Crusie."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I haven't not liked a Jennifer Crusie book, and I've read four of them now. They involve you right from the start, with three dimensional characters, laughter, drama, and quite a few twists to keep you guessing. Ms Crusie's books won't change your life, but they're a fine way to while away an afternoon or two. More please!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Then use this excellent book.

Quinn is now ready to take on her new life and Tibbett, OH.This book allows us to 'hear' Quinn's thoughts and it adds quite a bit to the depth of Quinn.

Jennifer Crusie has outdone herself!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I'm always hearing such fabulous things about Jennifer Crusie. People rave about her books and eagerly anticipate new releases. And I just don't get it. This is the second book of hers I've read and I haven't liked either one. I was bored to tears with this one by page twenty. It got a little better as the story progressed, but I still couldn't wait to finish and be done with it.The whole vibe of this book was just bizarre. The only thing I can really say that I liked about the book was the humor. Crusie does do well incorporating humor into her books, but it doesn't overcome the short points. I had problems with the story right from the start. The introduction of all the various (many) characters is poorly done. They are all just sort of plopped in there like I should already know them, and I ended up confused as hell until they were better established later.Romance wise...so-so. There was chemistry between Nick and Quinn, but I wasn't feeling the sentimentality of it. It was just sort of like too people getting together for the heck of it and because of a long standing friendship. I had some problems with the fact that these two people were good friends for like fifteen years or however long it was...hung out, were close and all that...but only now a sudden sexual overtone pops up. That just kinda didn't work for me. And the characters overall where just very one-dimensional, with very little depthWhat really killed the romance of this book, and just the story overall, was the faithlessness of everybody. It seemed like there was cheating going on left and right and nobody gave a damn. Well, they do, but not to the extent they should, and it just seemed exceedingly bizarre. I mean, one couple is having some marital problems, so the husband decides he's gonna go on a date with the town [...]. Then Nick's not sure what he wants to do about Quinn, so he dates the town [...] Another woman decides, what the heck, I'll take my husband back now that he's been dumped by the town [...]. Then Quinn's parents have some bizarre problems and her dad goes out with the town [...]. Quinn's Mom reveals she's had a long-standing sexual relationship with another woman, kicks her husband out, has her girlfriend move in, and Quinn's Dad is just like, okay whatever guess I'll go find myself a date. It was like nobody in the whole book had any respect for commitment and monogamy. I just didn't find anything pleasant or romantic about that and it drove me nuts.In the end, I just found the book as a whole rather stupid and campy. It was like reading a cheesy soap opera with fickle, whiny woman, clueless men, and rotating romances. There was absolutely no substance to the story whatsoever. Why people act like Crusie is the next coming, I just don't know. I certainly don't plan to read any more of her books. If you like lame, very superficial beach reads, then, hey, go pick this one up. But if you like stories that have more substance, I wouldn't waste your time on this one."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"A weak 3 stars. Crusie always has yummy male leads, but this got pretty ridiculous. I think I need to take a break from her books!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I am a HUGE fan of Jennifer Crusie novels. I really enjoy her sassy style of writing and interesting subplots; however, the heroine in \\"Crazy for You\\" annoyed me.

Everytime ANYTHING happens, the characters think \\"Oh hell.\\" This sometimes occurs several times on one page.It got to the point where anytime someone said or thought \\"Oh hell\\", it made me cringe.I mean, do you use the exact same phrases as everyone else you know? Couldn't some of the characters say \\"Oh crap\\" or \\"Uh oh\\" or anything but \\"Oh hell\\"???Other than that annoyance, the book was good, easy, light reading. None of the characters are especially deep, but you don't expect that from these types of books. :)Crystal"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I bought this book because I thought it might be a fun read but I was terribly disappointed. The characters are one-dimensional and extremely boring and the plot is riduculously stupid. The ending is something like you might read in one of my seventh grade students' favorite books. As a teacher, I felt that Quinn and Bill's professional lives were nothing like any teacher I know. I'm a dog lover and I didn't even like the dog. If you feel compelled to read this book just grab one of the Sweet Valley High Series books--they are a quicker read and will leave you about as fulfilled."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I found this book to be funny and interesting.

This was my first book by Cruisie but I have picked up several more since reading this one."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Another Crusie great. Who would have thought adopting one poor, little, skinny dog would change Quinn's life? What a change it is. She goes from dating the \\"world's nicest guy\\" to dating her sister's ex husband.

Comedy, Romance, and Suspense rolled into a delightful package."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"I have been a big fan of Susan Elizabeth Phillips for a long time and Jennifer Crusie is definitely a name that is coupled together with SEP. Romance readers have come to expect humorous love stories from these two and hold high respect for their work. After hearing her name for about a hundred times, I decided to give Jennifer Crusie a try. I've gone through SEP's backlist and wanted a good funny romance. _Crazy For You_ was definitely a different type of romance. I really liked getting to know Quinn and I think that most of the readers of this book could identify with her. In a sense, this book was not a total romance becuase it was a little more down to earth then most books in this genre. Quinn had more flaws (a wonderful trait) and her romance with Nick was a little more like something you could expect in real life (refreshing!). Jennifer Crusie has lovely writing style that enchants you from the first page. She definitely has an underlying sense of humor running throughout her books and a lot of one line zingers that will leave you in stiches. The only thing that puzzles me is how this book got pegged as a mystery/suspense. The whole book you know who the &quot;bad guy&quot; is, and it never really seems like there is any real danger up until the very end. But, minor problem, didn't bother me at all. Dog lovers will especially enjoy this book as a little mut plays a major supporting roll. All in all, I like Jennifer Crusie's style. If you're looking for something similar to Susan Elizabeth Phillips, give one of her books a go! I really enjoyed _Crazy For You_ and I cannot wait to read more of Ms. Crusie's work."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"It is only after MANHUNTING that I discovered JENNIFER CRUSIE had such a flair for penning hilarious and scintillating contemporary romance. CRAZY FOR YOU is no exception - with the protagonist Quinn McKenzie rousing a storm that rocked the sleepy town of Tibbett, Ohio. She finds a dog and believes it is a symbolism for her to change a new life - to desire passion, excitement. Soon she changes her life attitude by kissing goodbye to the mundane fiance of hers, Bill , buying her own house and pursues the match she wants - Nick Zielger.CRAZY FOR YOU leaves you bawling and questioning whether change is indeed that good. We are often dulled by our marriage life and where passion and love extinguishes with time - CRAZY FOR YOU explores what women want and in a refreshing manner. Adultery, the issue of lesbian and love are dabbled in this novel - though not much of an insight. However, this read is no doubt a light, breezy read with Ms. Crusie's antics - mindless entertainment that will leave you crazy for this beloved author."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Well, I am a new reader to Jennifer Crusie and have just recently finished &quot;Welcome to Temptation&quot; which I found to be really good and out right funny. However, this one just didn't stand up to the other. It started out good but then the second half of the book is practically all on the man who is stalking his ex-girlfriend who dumped him. I would have like it better if it had less of his stalking character and focused on the others who were great. Definitely read this author but I would recommend starting with her other books."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"Quinn McKenzie teaches art in Tibbets H.S. and lives with the popular baseball/football coach, Bill Hilliard, the nicest guy in town. Everybody just loves Bill! Quinn, though, is beginning to wake up to the fact that Bill pressured her into the relationship, that she doesn't love him, and doesn't particularly care for all the life-plans Bill has laid out for her. What brings matters to a head is the ugly (but totally precious) little mutt that Quinn decides to adopt. What Bill does to this animal will rouse the strongest emotions in those who care for animals. He's not by any means a nice guy. In fact, he's a control freak and he may very well be crazy. As Quinn's so-called perfect life falls apart, her parents face a crisis in their relationship, and so does her best friend, Darla. Darla's married to Max, the brother of town bad boy Nick Ziegler, who used to be married to Zoe, Quinn's older sister. (Are you following all this? Well, there's more :) Jennifer Crusie does a fine job depicting life in a very small town where everyone's business is everyone else's business, and where perceptions of people are often very much at odds with their true natures. This is a quick read, a funny read, a romantic/very sexy read, and, at times, a pretty scary read. For any woman who was ever in a crazy relationship and wanted to pull herself out of it, Crazy For You is a must-read."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"First of all, I had the pleasure of meeting Jennifer Crusie at a writers convention. Moreover, I got to sit with her at lunch! I only wish I had already read this book, so I could have told her in person how much I enjoyed it. Lots of books promise a good story. This one actually delivers!"},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"So far I have read two of the novels by Crusie and I love both of them. This was the second one I read and I was not disappointed at all. I love Crusie's writing style and characters. She has great storylines and humorous yet realistic dialogue. I love her novels because they are real, funny, romantic and I tend to get so into the books that I cant put them down and am sad as soon as I finish. I am going to read Tell Me Lies next and I am sure I will be hooked as soon as I start it. Her books are what I have been needing, good reads, romance, sexual tension, lots of fun and I feel great when I read them. I feel like I was friends with the characters because I got to know them so well. To Jennifer Crusie-Please keep writing, I am about to run out of your novels and I dont know if I will want to read anything else. I think these novels would make great romantic comedy films."},{"Title":"Crazy for You","review":"&quot;Crazy for You&quot; was such an awesome surprise. I picked it up just on a whim, not expecting anything because I usually like to read mysteries. The story was so fun, fast-paced, sexy, sweet, and also did contain some elements of mystery. It was fabulous!! Even though Quinn was the main protagonist, Crusie's development of the other characters stayed refreshing &amp; interesting, and did not take away from Quinn's storyline or her romance with Nick. I can not recommend it enough - i found myself looking forward to getting out of work just so i could get back to it! Just great."},{"Title":"The Book of Hit Singles 4 Ed: Top 20 Charts from 1954 to the Present Day","review":"A variation on pop-chart history books, McAleer summarizes a month's worth of charts into a single top twenty. Each page contains 3 months of singles charts, with the even numbered pages showing UK charts directly opposite the same month's summary in the US. The margins are filled with the music trivia of the day. The odd format of monthly charts exaggerates the chart success of songs that were around at the start of the month, but hurts songs that peaked in mid-month. Also odd, each country's chart also include a cross-reference to the WEEKLY position in the other country. But as a nostalgia tool, it's great fun to see what songs were popular in a given month, such as a birthday, wedding or graduation. Also includes an All-time US 100 (with The Twist at #1) and UK Top 100 (where Rock Around the Clock reigns), and cross reference by song title &amp; artist."},{"Title":"The Book of Hit Singles 4 Ed: Top 20 Charts from 1954 to the Present Day","review":"I really love this book and pop/rock music fans will spend hours with it...HOWEVER this book really needs an editor to catch those little mistakes, ie, its \\"Topsy II\\" (Cozy Cole) not \\"Topsy Li\\"; \\"Affair of The Heart\\" (Rick Springfield) not \\"Affair of The Night\\". And with each succeeding edition, the charts need to be updated, (Britney Spears, for instance, has had more than one hit- \\"Baby, One More Time\\" listed as first and last both right off the bat in each succeeding edition! Adam Ant had a US Top 20 hit with \\"Goody Two Shoes\\",(1983) so why is the book listing \\"Room At The Top\\"(1990)as his first and last, just as it did with \\"Goody Two Shoes\\"?), the listings need updating, not merely added onto.

TAVERNER is perhaps the best known work of fiction authored by renown Esotericist and Psychiatrist Violet Mary Firth (a.k.a. Dion Fortune). Dr. Taverner runs a very UN-conventional nursing home. He uses the ancient, arcane knowledge that he has learned as an Initiate of an esoteric secret order in his diagnosis and treatment of mental disturbances. Modern psychiatry could learn a lot from Dr. Taverner. While the book is actually a series of short stories, Fortune has expertly woven them into a meaningful tapestry of lessons-by-example, much like the texts I recall from my grammar school catechisms. Dr. Rhodes, a novice to the occult and the narrator of these tales, develops many insights and skills of his own as he witnesses and experiences the esoteric &quot;therapies&quot; that Taverner brings to bear in his unique treatment regimens for disturbances that allegedly have mental underpinnings. Along the way, the reader learns that it's often the things we DON'T see that can make or break an individual's sanity.Despite Fortune's spiritual enlightenment, she was also a victim of the times in which she lived. I've read all of Fortune's other published works of fiction and, in my opinion, DR. TAVERNER is perhaps the only one of her novels that is largely free of the racist and nationalistic baggage that was so common in class-conscious, post-WW-I England. I suspect this just an artifact of the story's setting but it was a refreshing relief none-the-less.As with Fortune's other novels, DR. TAVERNER represents a primer for the seeker looking to reclaim lost spiritual knowledge - a &quot;How To&quot; guide that reveals ancient and arcane secrets and practices sacred to Western secret societies and mystical orders. If you are a fan of Fortune's other work, you will love THE SECRETS OF DR. TAVERNER."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Dr. Taverner","review":"An interesting collection of short stories by Dion Fortune. Dr. Taverner, assisted by the young Dr. Rhodes, runs a nursing home in which patients suffer from a variety of \\"psychological\\" disturbances which are all psychic in nature. Very much a Sherlock Holmes bent, as Dr. Taverner, being an adept of an occult order, is able to hone in and cure these various problems using unconventional means.I found the stories to be interesting reading in and of themselves, but according to Dion Fortune, they were all based on actual events that she witnessed in her early occult training. Supposedly, \\"Dr. Taverner\\" is based on one of her mentors, while \\"Dr. Rhodes\\" is based on herself. So, read with this in mind, it is doubly fascinating.I also enjoyed the stories from the context of being written not terribly long after World War I, and many references are made to that event, with one story in particular, \\"Blood-Lust\\" telling of events occurring as a result of the war. In her book,\\"Psychic Self Defense,\\" Fortune goes into more detail about this particular event, which indeed was toned down somewhat for the book.I highly recommend this for anyone looking for an intro to Dion Fortune's fiction."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Dr. Taverner","review":"Dr. Tavener is a psychic Sherlock Holmes. In this book, Dion Fortune puts together different stories of strange tales, pulled together and solved with the wit and wisdom of Dr. Tavener, who knows how to read the signs and come up with the cure. Hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Dr. Taverner","review":"The Secrets of Dr. Taverner is a fun book, with lots of esoteric philospophy lacing a Sherlock Holmeslike psychologist. The sperate stories take place in a &quot;nursing home&quot; -i.e a mental hospital. run by Taverner in a most eccentric way. The doctor uses his training as an initiate of the Western Mysteries to solve his clients &quot;issues&quot;. These issues run the gammut, between vampirism and faery lineage, to psychic manipulation and past life transgressions. OF course, the book is absolutley studded with examples of the author's aristocratic prejudices. Once or twice I had to stop and exclaim to my self &quot;God! Could this woman be WHITER?!!&quot; That being said, Secrets really is a good book. Like all of Fortune's work, once you get over the initial shock of reading the words of an early 20th centurie bourgoise, its thourougly enjoyable"},{"Title":"The Secrets of Dr. Taverner","review":"The Secrets of Dr. Tavernor is an easy and quick read, highly recommended for anyone interested in the occult.. Dion Fortune's adventures in the realm of early 20th century england wonderfully describe the practical side of studying the western mysteries.Its chapters follow a series of case studies, allegedly pieced together from Dion Fortune's experiences during her training with Dr. Moriarty, this book allows the reader a great cross section of the experiences of a student studying under and adept."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Dr. Taverner","review":"This is an interesting and an entertaining book. Basically its with a guy (Dr. Rhodes) who works with Dr. Taverner who helps people according to his esoteric training where other more conventional methods fail in helping people. He is the witness of many of Taverner's techniques and so he is like an eye witness to the workings of the occult. Also Taverner has to battle against people who use the occult for purely personal gain. If you have some understanding of occult methods you will be able to grasp some of the things Dr. Rhodes is witness to. The Tree of Life by Israel Regardie is a great introduction to the Magical technique."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Dr. Taverner","review":"This is another must have book in my library. I wore out the old copy so had to get a new one. I read it every year and always wish it were longer. There are so many interesting stories in this book about modern day magicians and occult problems that ordinary psychiatrists don't recognize as such. The best part, for me, is that the stories are true. This from Dion Fortune's autobiographical Pscyhic Self Defense. Evidently, Dr. Taverner is the pseudonym for her real occult teacher."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Dr. Taverner","review":"Dion Fortune is one of the best occult writers of all times. She has not been surpassed by the younger generations. This book contains case-stories from Doctor Taverner's private hospital, something like a nursing home or general sanatorium where he looks after some very interesting patients. In each of the stories different esoteric phenomena are analysed, and the author's descriptions of both the symptoms and the doctor's decisions about each case are fascinatingly constructed. She (Dion Fortune) has a sophisticated, ironic literary style. In this intangible world of spiritual, karmic, astral-mental factors that co-exist around each patient, the author never looses her fine sense of reality. Very good British common sense, let us say. There is sense of humor, there is depth, there is love and punishment, vampires and strange \\"nature beings\\" in the collection ... I absolutely love this book."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Dr. Taverner","review":"I have always loved this collection of stories. Over the years, I have read them over and over again. Dr. Taverner really is like a true, metaphysical, occult Sherlock Holmes. What's more, they are based on a real character that Dion Fortune actually knew - and there are many elements in these stories that are true in the occult world! These stories are even better than Madame Blavatsky's \\"Nightmare Tales\\" - and they would make a fascinating occult adventure feature film or TV series (how about BBC America or SyFy?) - if done right."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Dr. Taverner","review":"It does not get any better than this. Somewhat dated stories, written almost 100 years ago, by the foremost female magician of the 20th century, that describe in delightful detail the very real dangers that guard our investigation of the esoteric world, and the wonderful rewards to be gained therein. Must have for occult students."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Dr. Taverner","review":"This is a great book. I took a college course, about 35 years ago, entitled \\"Literature of the Occult\\". This book was one of the assigned readings. I have this hardback edition. It is a collection of stories about a Sherlock Holmes-type of guy who goes after vampire, werewolves and the like. It is not a gory cut-me-up type of book. It doesn't involve devil worship or other types of child-scaring things. It is simply a great suspense book filled with stories about an investigator going after \\"bad people\\". Like the current show Grimm only no blood and guts. Hollywood should make a tv series with these stories - they would make a mint. The reading is easy and is never boring. I frequently use Dion Fortune's term \\"psychic vampires\\" only I use it to describe people at work who suck the energy from you. One of those books you want to keep so that you can read the stories to your kids - if you don't want them to go to sleep!"},{"Title":"The Secrets of Dr. Taverner","review":"It's an interesting book. The author claims that a lot in the book came from real experiences.....spooky :)"},{"Title":"The Secrets of Dr. Taverner","review":"I would compare Dion Fortune favorably to Aleister Crowley. She was an associate of his in her time, and her texts and fiction hold up well compared to Crowley, who was easily the best and most controversial occult figure in more modern times. Though Fortune, like Crowley, also inherited some of his problems- most of her fiction and others is knee deep in pre equal rights movement racism and can be imposing, putting off anyone who wasn't in the author's elite inner circle, the same inner circle that is still shrouding its practices in mystery despite a renewed popular interest today. While anyone who has real knowledge of the occult can do the paperwork to get stuck with a low end membership, it is nearly impossible to become the group's leader unless you form such a group yourself. Names of group members were often hidden or disguised to protect the rich and famous. The book reminded me of Crowley's Simon Iff stories, with Dr. Taverner being the lead character in a series of mysteries. These books are easy to read but can be hard to find, and they still restrict its members because every man and every woman is a star? Fortune is sort of a female equivalent of Aleister Crowley."},{"Title":"Champagne Girl","review":"This story was ok. It really isnt anything special. This is going to be an opinion from someone whos read over 30 books from Diana Palmer.If like me, you have read various books by this author, you'll see that this is absolutely nothing new. Diana Palmer is very repetitive in her plots. However, in some stories, her characters are so magnificient that you like it. But, this was not the case.Story is about a young woman (Kit) who is completely in love with Matt. She has gotten a job offer in New York that she cant refuse. The problem is, Matt is beginning to see Kit in a new way. He starts courting her and doing everything possible so that she can change her mind and not go to New York.I didnt like the characters in this story. Sure, Kit is a sweet girl who had ambitions. However, shes so contradicting. She supposedly loves Matt, yet she refuses to express her real feelings in most instances. She is also very mindfully passionate but she freaks out at physical contact. Matt on the other hand is dull. He also doesnt express his feelings. Everything about their relationship is physical, and not even mediocre physicality at that.The ending is bad. It is so abrupt. Nothing special and very predictable.Overall, if youre a fan of Palmer you'll probably like it because her stories are good but very much the same. If you are barely getting into her stories, i recommend it because this is the way most of her stories are. Good book, but the characters werent great."},{"Title":"Champagne Girl","review":"Matt and Catherine are a great couple -- even if they're having trouble convincing each other! One of the most likeable elements is their history together. Rather than being two strangers falling in love almost instantaneously, they grew up together.

I came to love this family and rooted for Matt and Catherine throughout."},{"Title":"Champagne Girl","review":"This was well on its way to being a 5-star book for me until the end. Spoilers follow, so don't read on if you don't want to know...anyway, the chemistry between Kit and Matt was smoldering, Palmer did a fantastic job of escalating the romance and sexual tension between the two through the whole story, but then doesn't give the reader the payoff of them making love for the first time. She writes such amazing love scenes in most of her other books, but cut the story short this time, with no wedding and no wedding night that had been so anticipated. Great story otherwise, but I can't give it five stars without a trademark Palmer love scene."},{"Title":"Champagne Girl","review":"I REALLY LOVED THIS BOOK.I REALLY LIKED THE FACT THAT MATT HAD REMAINED CELEBATE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AFTER REALIZING HIS FEELINGS FOR CATHRYN.

IF YOU CAN FIND IT BUY IT."},{"Title":"At Mrs. Lippincote's","review":"The grossly neglected English novelist Elizabeth Taylor once admitted in an autobiographical note that she enjoyed reading novels \\"where practically nothing ever happens.\\" Such is the world of her own fiction, as beautifully demonstrated in this her first novel, published in 1945, which shows how much emotionally can happen in a world of practical inaction.Billeted temporarily to the village and home of the eponymous Mrs. Lippincote to be near her husband, an officer in the RAF, Julia Davenant is expected to be a model officer's wife, serving meals to her husband's commanding officers, joining in the fun had by his fellows and their wives, and behaving so as not to attract attention or to embarrass him. Reminded of these obligations by the model of the domestic Lippincotes that surrounds her in her new home, she chooses instead to escape into an inner world of observation and intellectual reflection as she cares for her husband, her sickly son, and her husband's censorious \\"odd woman\\" cousin Eleanor who serves as both company and as foil for the nonconformist Julia. Little happens for a long time in this novel from a practical standpoint though much happens within Julia's and Eleanor's consciousnesses (through which most of this novel is focalized) to prepare us for the explosion at the end of the novel that changes their lives forever, a formal device taylor often replicated in her later novels.This early work shows Taylor's debts to her friend Ivy Compton-Burnett more clearly than in her later work: as with Burnett, more is indicated through the undercurrents of dialgue than is explicitly said. so that we must interpret (as the characters themselves both do and do not) what is really happening belwo the surface of their comments. This is also one of the most explicitly feminist of Taylor's novels: Julia's and Eleanor's socially stifled situations seem to be that bemoaned by Jane Eyre in Charlotte Bront's classic novel, which is often mentioned within the text as a kind of counterpoint to this novel. Like all of Taylor's books, AT MRS. LIPPINCOTE'S has a surface facility that belies its thematic and structural complexities; by the end the novel seems to have rushed by, yet when you stop to consider the significance of the young Miss Lippincote's unannounced visits to the house (and the effect they have on the family), or the contrasts among Julia's husband, his solicitous and Bront-loving Wing Commander who nurtures a crush on Julia, and the raffish and sexually ambiguous Cockney living in their village she knows from London, the meanings of the novel multiply exponentially."},{"Title":"At Mrs. Lippincote's","review":"I was reading the Atlantic Monthly which featured an article about Elizabeth Taylor; an author I had never heard of. I have since read Mrs. Lippincote and enjoyed it so much. The writing is intelligent, warm, and funny. It is deliciously English, and considering it was written in the 1940's, surprisingly modern. I am going to read everything this woman wrote - what a pleasant surprise, and I am so grateful to the Atlantic Monthly for making people aware of this fantastic writer."},{"Title":"At Mrs. Lippincote's","review":"Elizebeth Taylor has a way with words, a way of phrasing sentiments one has felt but never expressed so well. She is splendid at dissecting the scenes of ordinary life with all their frustration and boredom. In At Mrs. Lippincote's she shines a brilliant lamp on the lives of Julia Davenant and her RAF husband Roddy, their son Oliver and Roddy's cousin Eleanor. Stationed out of London during World War II, they stay at the furnished home of Mrs. Lippincote, but the strangeness of living in someone else's home seems to reflect the strangeness and drabness of the trappings of ordinary life: a dirty white coat, a child's illness, or a cheap porcelain swan.Some of the best scenes revolve around the way the child Oliver blends the world of the books he reads with the world around him, freely mixing fantasy with dull reality.She reveals the inner lives of her characters in short scenes and much like life does not attempt tidy resolutions but allows her stories to breath in glorious messiness. At the same time, her own choice of words has the precision of a scalpel pulling back layers with deft flicks of her wrist. She may not be to the taste of the reader who demands a lot of plot, but for those who enjoy subtle portraits of characters, she is well worth being rediscovered."},{"Title":"At Mrs. Lippincote's","review":"Sorry , Elizabeth Taylor fans, I found this book opaque and pointless. A pissed off housewife who has to share a house with her school aged son, her indifferent army husband and his female cousin who adores him. And then, not much happens for the whole book. I made myself read it right to the last page as I had read so many gushing accolades for this author.

It was a pleasure to read this book while traveling in Riga, as I was able to visualize many of the settings. This book is a murder mystery but much more- atmospheric (almost to the extreme)."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"One of the pleasures of reading the Wallander series is the insights we get into modern Swedish society. In this novel, Mankell sends Wallander to Riga, a location with which Mankell clearly is less familiar. As a result, the writing in the last half of the novel is a bit forced and formulaic. It's still worth reading, but not up to the standards set by Faceless Killers."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"\\"The Dogs of Riga\\" is another Kurt Wallander mystery by talented Swedish writer Henning Mankell. It is set in the early 1990's, as Europe is rocked by the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Its premise is a visit by Swedish detective Wallander to the Baltic city of Riga, to follow up on the death of a Latvian detective.The story opens with the discovery of a life raft, washed ashore in Sweden with two corpses. Wallander and his colleagues find tenuous links to Riga, prompting the visit of Lativan Detective Major Liepa, who quickly makes a strong impression. When Liepa is murdered upon his return to Latvia, Wallander is asked to visit to shed light on Liepa's aborted investigation.Wallander is a stranger in a strange land, full of conspiracies, shadows, and rivalries, whose residents are in deadly earnest over goals that are unclear to him. At stake is informatio allegedly gathered by Liepa that could shape the outcome of the struggle for power in a newly independent Latvia. Wallander will cast his lot with the outsiders, including Liepa's widow Baiba...\\"The Dogs of Riga\\" reeks of paranoia and conspiracy. Wallander will find more than one devil, and find himself frequently out of his depth. His ability to survive and operate in the Lativan police state is a bit unrealistic, but the story works. \\"The Dogs of Riga\\" is recommended as another good mystery by Mankell."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"Henning Mankell, like PD James, is a serious novelist who works in the murder mystery format. This is the second th Kurt Wallander books I have read, and both feature a thoughtful, analytical detective dealing with life, family, love, society and a murder case.After two dead bodies in a life raft float assore on the Sweden's coastal village of Ystad, and are determined to be from Eastern Europe, Wallander is drawn into the corrupt police state of neighboring Latvia. There he falls in love with the widow of his murdered Latvian doepplanger. We get a visceral sense of the desperate \\"no where to run\\" terror of living in a corrupt police state.There are aspects of the plot that seem contrived. I'm still sure I understand why Wallender actually HAD to go to Latvia, other than to further the storyline. But I recommend the book highly as being several cuts above the run of the mill murder story."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"The third installment of this Swedish \`noir' police procedural series takes Inspector Kurt Wallander to Riga, Latvia. Although Latvia has broken free from the Soviet Union, it is still a dictatorship and most of its institutions, including the police, are still controlled by men who are corrupt and will do anything to retain their power.An inflatable life raft has washed ashore on the coast of Sweden. In it are two men who have been shot through the heart. Wallander investigates and, through meticulous detective work, finds out that the men were from Latvia and were known to be involved in drug trafficking. Major Liepa, an officer in the Latvian police, comes to Sweden to assist Wallander. Shortly after Liepa returns home, he is brutally killed and the Latvian police ask Wallander to come to Riga to help them determine why Liepa was murdered. From that point, the story becomes very dark. Wallander is convinced that one of Liepa's two superiors was involved in his murder. As Wallander investigates, the plot gets more intense and eventually he ends up being a murder target himself.Mankell paints a very interesting and realistic picture of the bleak life in the Baltic States after the fall of the U.S.S.R. He shows how corruption is still the norm and that people will look the other way when offered a few Swedish kroner. As usual, Mankell reveals Wallander's thoughts so that we know his temptations, weaknesses and mistakes. But probably the main reason that most readers enjoy this series is Wallander's persistence and his resolve to push ahead regardless of the obstacles that are in his way."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"At a time I wondered if this \\"Mystery Novel\\" was going to become a spy novel instead but it's still very good.

I have read many of his books and count this one among the most gripping and exciting of his stories. Wallender is so human, feeling all the emotions we know in ourselves, and yet he has a great talent for unravelling the most complex cases. Can't wait to read another Wallender adventure."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"I'd read three other Wallander adventures before reading The Dogs of Riga. While the story has the same gloomy Swedish atmosphere I enjoy in the other stories, it didn't feel as plausible as the others I've read. This is the case where Wallander meets Baiba Liepa, who appears in subsequent books. His adventures in Latvia are detailed but feel less well-informed than usual in Mankell's novels. That may be because I'm not at all familiar with the political situation in Latvia in 1992, or because Mankell himself was not as familiar with it as he is with southern Sweden."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"This is my first Mankell book. Wallander is a wonderful character. As an middle-aged man, I can relate to Wallander's self doubt and self questioning. His co-workers have far more respect for him than he does for himself. I am in a happy marriage, but I can understand how Wallander as a divorced, lonely guy falls in love with every eligible woman he meets. He solves the case more through bull dog tenacity than cleverness, although he is far from stupid.He paints a bleak Latvia and I have no idea whether it is historically accurate. I went to post Soviet Hungary back in 2000. I can visualize the architecture he was talking about, but I am sure there is no comparison with the culture.The book is suspenseful, but the plot pushes credulity at times. The author doesn't make him out to be James Bond, but the action sequences for this character doesn't quite fit. The plot is suspenseful and there is nice turns in the plot. How he solves the puzzles is satisfying. He is not perfect, but he is methodical and determined. The book is a good read."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"In most mystery novels, the social order is disturbed when a horrific crime is committed. The hero/detective uses his superior skills to solve the mystery, catch the criminal and thus restore the social order. One variation on this pattern is when the mystery writer takes the hero/detective out of his element and places him in a strange environment where the system and rules of the game are radically different. The thrill of this variation is to see the hero's superior insights and skill triumph in a hostile environment.\\"The Dogs of Riga\\" is a classic example of this variant. The Iron Curtain is falling and mysterious forces are waging a hidden war to determine Latvia's destiny. Into this morass, stumbles the stolid Swede from Ystad, Kurt Wallander. He knows nothing of the language, culture or history of Latvia. Nevertheless, the churning undertow of Latvian politics draws Wallander into the fray. The pleasure of this story is to see Kurt Wallander's superior intellect reassert itself in this topsy turvy world.If you are new to the Kurt Wallander series, this book is not the best place to start. It is better to have seen him work on his own ground. \\"The Dogs of Riga\\" is not the strongest book in the series but for those of us who love the rumpled detective, this book is a pleasure."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"Just as a point of trivia but in Europe and in Sweden, detective Kurt Wallander's home, the spelling is sometimes Wallender or Wallander, but usually Wallander. One encounters both spellings on amazon.I thank fellow reviewer Leonard Fleisig for bringing this author to my attention. The writing is simply superb, and I am very interested in reading more books by the same author. The story overall is not great and there are better books by the author. In addition to this book, I have read five other books in the Kurt Wallender series, including The Man Who Smiled, and One Step Behind.I gave the book 4 stars. I thought that the story was sometimes slow and there were too many coincidences and unreal fights in the book. Wallender is more interesting when he is at home in Sweden and when there is more interaction with other policemen at the Ystad station. Here that element is almost lacking and that spoils the book, along with the many departures from reality. Also, the story follows the same Wallender formula which after three books is a bit too predictable: chapter one is a murder, and in a subsequent chapter a fellow policeman or friend of Wallender is murdered, dragging Wallender into the conflict.Most of the story is set in Riga, but the opening sections are set in southern Sweden in Wallender's home base of Ystad.I will not give away the plot and the essential plot elements are outlined by the publisher: two dead bodies wash up on the shore near Ystad in a rubber raft. A policeman arrives from Riga since the bodies are traced to that city. Wallender works on solving the crime in Sweden and then follows the crime to Riga.This is a fast read that I was able to read it in less than a day. I read it while staying at a hotel in southern Sweden, not too far from the crime scene; the details and descriptions of the places and other details are authentic.The writing is smooth and flawless, but the story pulls it down to 4 stars. One Step Behind is a better book in the series."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"Henning Mankell's \\"The Dogs of Riga\\" was written in 1992, around the time of the dissolution of the U.S.S.R. While the novel was certainly topical at the time, it wasn't one of his best efforts. In atypical fashion, \\"The Dogs of Riga\\" does not feature intensive character development which is a Mankell hallmark. As a consequence of this it is difficult to empathize with the plight of his characters. Mankell in this book exchanges the usual dreary southern Swedish locale for a drearier environment in Latvia. Unfortunately police inspector Kurt Wallander seems out of sync when not in his familiar Ystaad location.Wallander becomes involved in an unusual investigation when two well dressed corpses wash ashore in a lifeboat on the outskirts of town. Pathologic examination of the bodies as well as the boat point to both eminating from one of the Russian Baltic states. Wallander is soon joined in his investigation by Latvian police inspector Major Karlis Liepa. Working well together they discover that the dead men were members of the drug smuggling Latvian underworld. The investigation is relinquished to Latvian authorities and Major Liepa returns home. Wallander has officially wahed his hands of the affair when he shockingly learns that Major Liepa has been murdered.Latvian authorities summon Wallander to aid them in solving the murder of Liepa. He arrives in Riga where the police department is commanded by two colonels Putnis and Murniers. He soon learns that the police department suffers from massive corruption and is affiliated with the criminal underworld. The ethical Liepa was killed to prevent his from blowing the whistle on the corruption. While investigating in Riga, Wallender becomes enamored with Liepa's widow Baiba.The novel proceeds as Wallender continues to probe while the whole political structure in Latvia is undergoing a major upheaval as the Communist government is crumbling."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"Riga did indeed feel like that at that time. The author skillfully takes you back to that time and place. The mystery part is not the greatest, but the discription of the nature of the struggle between the good guys and the bad guys is very good. For the mystery I award three stars. I like the short and common Latvian names that Mr. Mankell choose, but the two dead Russians that drifted to Sweden should have more properly been given Latvianized russian names and not the very Latvian names Leja (valley) and Kalns (hill). For mood, setting and background I award five stars. The average is four."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"Chief Inspector Kurt Wallander leaves the comforts of his home turf in this second entry in this stellar series. Two bullett-riddled corpses in a life raft wash up on the coast near Ystad, and it soon becomes clear to Wallander's team that they are not Swedes. Latvian seems to be their nationality, and a detective from that country, Major Liepa, is sent in to consult. Kurt and his guys are relieved (who wants to tangle with the Russian Mafia?) when Liepa takes full responsibility, returning to Latvia to continue the investigation. In a stunning development, Liepa himself is murdered on the same day he arrives home, and now it's Wallander who is assigned to consult in Riga.Wallander is a talented detective and a good man, but in the strange new world of post-Soviet Latvia, he's out of his element and overwhelmed. Soon he realizes that he's being followed 24 hours a day (by some of the Dogs of the title), and from what the Latvian police have shared with him, Kurt senses that something is terribly wrong with their story, and it scares him. But he liked Major Liepa, and when he meets his widow, Baiba, Kurt grows determined to find and expose the truth. What unfolds is a tale of the grimness of life in the Eastern Bloc, where the freedom that was promised by the demise of the Soviet Union has not been permitted to blossom.The Dogs of Riga is part police procedural, part spy novel, and part social commentary. Henning Mankell usually writes around a theme, and in addition to Wallander's loneliness and chronic angst (makes one wonder why his doctor never suggested a good antidepressant), the grim forces of totalitarianism, organized crime, and government and political corruption, toward which Western Europeans and Americans prefer to turn a blind eye, color every facet of this gray, gray novel. Even Wallander's attraction to Baiba Liepa is fraught with complications that would never be a problem had they met back in Sweden. It is the social commentary that makes this novel so compelling. Dogs was originally published in 1991, only translated into English four years later, but there is little reason to suspect that life in Eastern Europe has improved any. Mankell has done a superlative job in bringing this matter to the attention of his readers. That is not to say that Dogs is nothing more than a dull political diatribe; on the contrary, it's a first rate thriller in every sense of the word."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"After reading a feature article in Entertainment Weekly about this author a few months back (after publication of his last in the Kurt Wallander series), I was intrigued. So I picked up \\"Faceless Killers\\" (the first in the series) and quickly devoured it. It's a solid 4-star debut from this interesting and talented writer. Definitely a different kind of writer, and Wallander is a different kind of police detective. Given that these books are a translation from Swedish, there are some awkward passages in the novels. However, overall the brilliant pacing and characterization of Mankell shines through from page to page, and I really loved \\"Faceless Killers\\". This (\\"The Dogs of Riga\\"), the second in the Wallander series, is not quite as... I don't know what the right word is... it's not quite as polished in some ways, and it didn't feel as realistic. It seemed over-the-top and unbelievable at times in its depiction of the strange world that Wallander falls into (a la Alice in Wonderland) in Latvia. And a bit implausible, to say the least, that Wallander would be so captured by the widow of the slain Latvian major, and so desperate, that he would willingly return to Latvia for what turns out to be a stunning if (again) rather implausible climax. Nonetheless, I will pick up at least one or two more books in the Wallander series, because there's something about Mankell's writing -- how he paces the plots and unfolds the story, how he depicts the harsh Swedish landscape as well as the tormented inner landscape and essential humanity of the protagonist (a very flawed, yet likable character is this middle-aged Swedish policeman) -- that leaves an indelible impression on me. Perhaps it's because I can relate so closely to the flawed character and psychological turmoil of Kurt Wallander? Anyway, the bottom line is that this may not prove to be anywhere near the best in the Wallander series, but it's still an interesting and satisfying read... If you like well-crafted murder mysteries set in a foreign land with compelling characters, you could do much much worse!"},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"I'm hardly the first to praise Mankell for his Wallander series, but this one I found especially compelling. Mankell has done a marvelous job of placing us so close to Wallander that we experience the confusion and fear as he tries to unravel a mystery that takes him to Riga, Latvia as the Soviet system is imploding after 50 years. Like Wallander, we are always just a bit off balance, uncertain of where we are, what is happening, and why events are as they are. At the heart of the mystery is not so much an action or series of actions but an inability to sort friends and foes and the confusion and fear that permeate a disintegrating totalitarian state. It reminds me of Koestler's \\"Darkness at Noon,\\" and in fact, one of the characters echoes a central theme of Darkness. So if you like the gun-toting, bourbon swilling hard-nosed dick who can give or take a beating, don't bother with this book."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"This is the second book in the Kurt Wallander series, and I found it much more compelling than the first, although I thoroughly enjoyed that one also. Once again there is a mystery to be solved, in this case the appearance of two corpses washed up on the Swedish shore in a life raft. The initial question is, of course, who are these men and where did they come from? Once that is established, and it's not easy, Kurt is dispatched to Latvia to help in solving the murder of the Latvian policeman sent to Sweden to assist.This is a Latvia in the midst of its struggle to free itself from the grip of the Soviet Union, and it is a drab and cheerless place, where the citizens are frightened and distrustful of almost everyone around them. Wallander meets a group of folks organizing against the government, and when he returns home he goes back into Latvia by means of smuggling routes to help those people. There is a scene of great carnage, and Wallander must decide which of two high ranking police officers is the person responsible. The ending is exciting in the extreme, and you just keep turning the pages to find out what happens.I've enjoyed the first two books in the series, and am now reading the third. I hope to get through all of the ones published in English as they become available to me."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"Though this was the second book in the series, it was the sixth to be translated into English. Unless you lived through the Cold War and the transition time of the early nineties, you will not understand this book. In 1991, two men wash up on the Skane shore of Sweden. They are in a life raft with no ship markings. Both men are well dressed in Western European clothing, and have both been tortured and shot in the heart. Their dental work is Eastern European. So how did they get to Sweden?When Inspector Wallendar is called in on this case, he has little to go on, and then some one steals the life-raft out of the Police Station. When the men are tracted to Latvia, a Major in their national police force comes to Sweden to help out the inquiry. On the day that he returns to Latvia, he is murdered, and their police request Wallendar's help. From here, the story turns into a thriller and the mystery becomes involved in politics and the changing political situation in the Soviet Union.The rest of the story needs to be read, not summarized. They is only one weakness in the story and most readers will be able to figure that out. But, I'm curious to see how this 'affair' will effect Wallendar down the road in later novels."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"This is the second book by this author that I have read and am constantly dragged down by the awkward writing. The story line was interesting, but the language was flat and terse. The books do not exhibit a sense of location or richness of characters. It is as bland and colorless as a winter landscape. Perhaps that's the intention. I wonder if the author is a poor writer or if the translation is just bad. Perhaps a Swedish reader could elucidate."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"This is as good of a thriller as one is likely ever to read.

Very atmospheric, and the truth of the matter(s) comes only at the end, keeping one's interest plowing ahead. Super story and writing."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"Westerners who were present at the time will know that this story does a terrific job of catching the way things were in early ex-Soviet Baltic countries in early '90s. And it is a good Wallender story, as well. And the Wallender - Liepa connection is a mainstay throughout the rest of the series. Dick Hill is a gifted reader, and one whom I admire and enjoy for his voice and ability to use it -- sometimes. But he is not at all right for this series. Mr Hill's reading is a major distraction -- kind of like the New Joiseyian who tries to do Texan. After hearing Sean Barrett on the Isis Audio Books of UK reading Mankell, this is disappointing by comparison. But I would buy and recommend Hill's Mankell readings anyway, and I want more. Blackstone Audio, Inc, please check out Mr. Barrett, but don't stop making Mankells in any case!"},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"This is the weakest of the six books I have read in the series. The translation into English is flat and the language drab. Usually, the element of mystery and suspense is stronger as is the character development of the detective Kurt Wallender and those surrounding his life. Here, the mystery lacks tension and at the end I hardly cared about the resolution. Also, there was little depth in the portrayal of Wallender or his personal circumstances. If you want to read two first rate Wallender mysteries, choose either One Step Behind or Sidetracked [they are quite similar in plot --and both are extraordinary mysteries]."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"Henning Mankell is the author of a number of police procedurals set in Sweden with a hero called Inspector Kurt Wallender. Most of the books are slow moving with most of the interest arising from the sub plots related to Wallenders life. Generally unexciting stuff, his conflicts with his irritating father, and the general problems and anxieties of a middle aged man. The strength of the books is the sense of their Swedishness and the realism of police matters.This book is odd in that instead of the usual rather dull plot the hero heads of to Latvia, enters the country illegally on a false passport, steals car, assaults the local Lativian police, falls for a local damsel in distress and we have the plot elements which would normally be associated with an American film starring Tom Cruise. In the rest of the books the most action one would expect is for Wallender to be slightly overcharged for some herrings.The feeling after reading the book is rather like buying the New York Review of Books and finding that it has suddenly got pictures of page three girls from one of Rupert Murchoch's publications through it. Quite disconcerting.Never the less like any mystery thriller, one is looking at entertainment rather than emerging with a new vision of the world so that such things matter not. Still probably not as good as his other books which one reads with a sort of solid comfort."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"After thoroughly enjoying Henning Mankell's first book, Faceless Killers, I was looking forward to reading his second book, The Dogs of Riga. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. As long as the action takes place in Sweden, the story is entertaining and believable. However, when the action shifts to Riga, believability disappears, and I was as bewildered as Swedish detective Kurt Wallander, who is summoned to Riga to investigate the murder of a Lithuanian detective who had assisted Wallander when two bodies wash ashore in Sweden.These murder victims are identified as Lithuanians, but Riga is the capital of Latvia, not Lithuania. The Riga plot is based on real events that took place in Lithuania, so the action should take place in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. I don't know if the error is the author's or the translator's, but it annoyed and distracted me.The bloody violence at the end of the book is jarring, and the freedom fighter subplot seems contrived. I hope Kurt Wallander remains in Sweden in subsequent books. Mankell makes his native country come alive, but he is not very successful at doing this with unfamiliar foreign territory. If Wallander weren't such a likeable character, I might have shelved The Dogs of Riga when the story moved across the Baltic Sea."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"i see a lot of disappointed reviews here--personally i think this is one of the best in the whole series. it has more unrealisitic spymovie sequences--but they are breathtaking. i honestly had no idea if wallender would survive--and i've read the later books. dont be put off--this book is angry, venomous really, driven and tough. like wallender. i compare it to early LeCarre."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"The group rating this at \\"3\\" or below summed it up well. As one who's purchased and enjoyed numbers of Mankells' books, I found this to be a poor reflection of his fine capabilities otherwise. Some reviewers indicated it was their first experience with Mankell and would likely be their last - I would have felt the same way.The first part of the book suggested numbers of opportunities for a great plot but as it moved from Sweden to Latvia (a country described as having communist influences), the plot became absurd. I believe readers of mysteries generally like books with plots that could be feasible. From aspects involving Wallender's immediate personal interest in the widow of a murdered Latvian police officer to his reason for being in Latvia in the first place, let alone his return to Latvia as a respected Sewdish police officer sneaking into a foreign country, the events in this book didn't even hint at being remotely possible. This book is titled \\"Dogs of Riga\\" in summary , as they say in some parts of the US \\"this dog don't hunt\\"."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"'Dogs of Riga' is without any doubt the darkest book in the Wallander-series. Henning Mankell is one of the best in describing the atmosphere in the Baltic countries before the fall of the USSR. It was dark, depressing and, like Wallander, you really didn't want to be there at the time.This is not the best book in the series, simply because the character of Wallander doesn't belong in a spy novel. As someone else said, Mankell should stay with the detective/police stories in Sweden. I just don't find the spy story realistic enough (maybe because I am used to so much more excitement after reading his other novels).Although not his best book I give it four stars. The description of the grim, volatile atmosphere in Riga is one of the best I've ever read."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"This is the second novel (I think) about Swedish police Inspector Kurt Wallender, and the third one I have read, and it's by far the most harrowing. Wallender is going about his business in Ystad, on the far southern coast, when a report comes in about a life raft that was washed ashore nearby with two well-dressed corpses in it. The investigation leads back to Riga, capital of Latvia, on the other side of the Baltic from Scandinavia, and the always overworked Swedish police are relieved when the case and the corpses can be turned over to the Riga police. But a Latvian police major who had come to Ystad to sort things out is killed the same day he returns home, and Wallender's assistance is requested in Riga in order to solve the murder. Of course, 1991 was a time of great turmoil in the Baltic states, as it was everywhere in the collapsing Soviet empire, and Wallender finds himself caught up in the nascent Latvian independence movement -- and also emotionally involved with the late major's widow, Baiba Liepa. Wallender is not, in his own mind, an especially courageous man; he'd rather be investigating bank frauds, he thinks, than mucking about in political killings. But even he makes numerous human errors, he acquits himself very well. He'll never really understand Latvia, though. At one point, he inquires of a high-ranking Latvian cop what the penalty would be for the murderer, if they were able to catch him. \\"I would expect him to be shot,\\" he's told. \\"Personally, I think that would be an appropriate punishment.\\" Wallender is speechless. \\"That he was in a country where they executed criminals was so horrific that he was rendered temporarily speechless.\\" (I wonder what Wallender would think about American judicial customs?) Mankell, who admits he knows probably less about Latvian politics than even Wallender, probably would do better to stick with pure cop/detective plots, rather than edging over into quasi-spy stories. Nevertheless, he paints a vivid portrait of a gray country and society at a turning point in its history."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"This is my first Wallander book and I found it heavy going. It started out well with the two dead men on the raft drifting into Wallander's jurisdiction, but once he goes to Latvia, it's just one vague, awkward paragraph after another. Lots of hints about great suspense, possible death and a revolution brewing but the details are never filled in and you find yourself more and more fed up with Wallander and his endless cups of tea, sleepless nights and trips to the crapper. I never really felt like I knew what was at stake in this novel, it was all very vague, full of insinuation and very little actual political detail. I'm not sure why I kept reading it. I guess I wanted to find out if it ever picked up and got good. It didn't.I'll read another Wallander, just to see if this was a fluke. Hope so, because I like the character, but the writing was mediocre and the suspense non-existant."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"After mostly enjoying the first in the Kurt Wallander series (Faceless Killers), I definitely found this one to be a significant step down in quality. Set in 1991, it starts off promisingly enough with a pair of smugglers discovering two dead men adrift in a life raft. The good samaritan criminals tow the raft closer to the Swedish shore, where it winds up washing up in Inspector Wallander's territory. For a while, the story proceeds as a straight crime procedural, as he attempts to find out who the men are and why they were killed. As usual, in the background is Wallander's shaky personal life and his coping with the death of his closest friend on the police force.However, once it's determined that the men are from Eastern Europe, the story morphs into an international thriller. First, Major Liepa of the Latvian police arrives to try and assist on the case. Then, Wallander is himself dispatched to Latvia to help with a related murder there. Rather improbably, Wallander simply steps off the plane and is whisked away by his Latvian police liaisons. At the time, one would think the Swedish Embassy would have someone on hand make sure all went smoothly. However, this would make it harder to develop the plot, which revolves around Wallander's confusion over the forces at work and the Latvian police he's working with. Soon, the book is awash with amateur spycraft, as Wallander goes to clandestine meets with mysterious figures. Next thing you know, the dour detective has launched himself headfirst into a ridiculous scheme involving illegal border crossings, false papers, car theft, and wild shootouts. Even worse, these over the top Mission Impossible style theatrics are due to his infatuation with a woman he's only briefly met. If all of this smacks of a bad Hollywood film rather than a solid crime novel, that's unfortunately how it reads as well.At the time of the book's writing, the Soviet Union was still in the midst of dissolution and reformers and hardliners in the USSR's various satellite republics were struggling to determine the future of their new states. Through Wallander, Mankell attempts to contrast orderly, progressive, first-world Sweden with chaotic, repressive, third-world Latvia. Alas, the city never really comes to life, and the atmosphere feels ersatz. Mankell attempts to make a connection between organized crime and the political power structure of the emerging post-Soviet states, but it kind of falls flat. It doesn't help that the characterization isn't particularly good, even for critical characters such as Wallander's platonic love interest. Like the first book, the writing is fairly straightforward and plain. One rather severe misstep involves the Latvian Major and Wallander, who are both described as having very shaky English, and yet their conversations are rendered in more or less grammatically sound, highly idiomatic English.Note: The book was made into a film for Swedish television in 1995 which is apparently unavailable in English."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"Henning Mankell is the famous creator of Swedish detective Kurt Wallender. In \\"The Dogs of Riga\\" we see Wallender investigate a murder case which takes him to Riga, Latvia.

The raft contains two bodies of well dressed men who have both been shot through the heart.

He falls in love with a beautiful Estonian widow but returns to Sweden alone at novel's end.Mankell's descriptions of drab and cold Riga living under the heel of Soviet domination is a fascinating snapshot of life in Eastern Europe.The novel is filled with a shoot out and plenty of cloak and dagger action in a well written, plotted and told police procedural. Mankell is good at making us care about the characters.

A far more interesting character than Monk is to be found in crime novels, Kurt Wallander the Swedish detective created by the author Henning Mankell. Wallander suffers deeply from anxiety. He even (like many people) self-medicates by drinking too much. Like so many cops, he's divorced and very isolated. Wallander is drowning in doubt even though he solves difficult crimes. Michael Ondaatje, my favorite NY Times book reviewer says \\"For me, Henning Mankell is by far the best writer of police mysteries today.\\"The second book in the series is The Dogs of Riga takes place in Sweden and Latvia in 1991. Most people in Latvia live in fear because the communists are in charge. Reading this shows how fear infiltrates daily life. Wallander is besieged with worry because he sneaks into the country (legitimate fear) and never trusts his own tenaciousness. His ordinary life is constantly interrupted because of the disease of anxiety.When people are anxious they tend to want to people please, and then too much truth goes ignored. When hurts and wants are unspoken they go underground and build into resentments. Anxious people suffer with short term thinking and are afraid of hurting others. One of the most important things anyone can do to build more authentic relationships is to be able to talk about hard things. Inability to talk about hard things means the pile of resentments deepens and it can be tough to dig out from under it. People tend to get self righteous about their resentments which then makes it hard to consider the truth of the other person's point of view. Truth always lies in between people. Hearing the truth from someone who loves you is one of the most important ways to grow.If you are anxious and people please you will lose track of yourself. Love is meant to help you be more of yourself, not less. Diane Keaton was asked why she never married and she responded that she knew she would lose her identity. Kurt Wallander does get lost. His father was disgusted he became a policeman. Kurt still plays with the idea of quitting to be a security guard, to regain his father's approval. Though he's in his early 40's, his anxiety clouds his ability to recognize he only needs his father's love. These are a terrific series of novels and Wallander is a very three dimensional character who makes mistakes in relationships because of anxiety."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"This was my 1st Henning Mankell book and I thought it was great!! I couldn't put it down. I like Inspector Wallander's down to earth, everyman kind of approach to life. And this is coupled with a strong policeman's street sense and the natural innate ability to come up with the right conclusions every time.

So it is with this Kurt Wallender thriller about a small-town Swedish detective who gets mixed up in international intrigue. It starts off with an innocuous case: two bodies are discovered floating on the Baltic Sea. The field is expanded until Wallender winds up in Soviet Latvia, smack in the middle of a local political duel between two colonels. We discover that one colonel is a demon, but we don't know which one until practically the very last page. I enjoyed the way the author builds gradually from nothing into sublime complexity. This kept me from going crazy on a flight from Paris to San Francisco. My gratitude."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"Fantastic book, very intriguing detective work with a fantastic translation. Can't stop reading his books! Highly recommended for people who enjoy a great story without the mass production feel. Love the storyline with his family which is not mushy at all. Totally enjoyable read for both men and women"},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"This 1991 thriller is situated in Ystad, Sweden and Riga, Latvia just before the end of the SU. This 2nd of 10 police procedurals about chief inspector Kurt Wallander (KW) finds the hero in poor shape: only 43 and overweight, left by his wife, mourning for his dead mentor. Has little contact with his daughter who studies in Stockholm, plays cards with his quirky father once a week. Sleeps badly, is prone to stress, thinks he has heart trouble and about leaving the force (he applies for a security job in a factory).Then one day, a rubber boat with 2 dead men lands on a beach near Ystad and a classical police procedural begins. This is the most satisfying part of the book. They turn out to be criminals from Latvia, executed and left to be discovered as a warning to others. The breakthrough and much additional background comes from a Latvian police major sent to Sweden to identify the bodies and help repatriate their remains. KW hopes he will take the murder case with him as well... But he likes the Latvian, whose English is even poorer than his own. One night, while killing a bottle of J&B;, KW learns about the links between drug dealing mafia-type gangs, the political elite and the KGB. And what it means for Latvia, which yearns for independence.Alas. Two events scupper KW's hope. First, the rubber boat disappears from the basement of the police station. No breakage, keys were used. Earlier, details of the murder investigation were leaked to the media: the Ystad police force has a mole... Next, he learns his Latvian police friend was beaten to death on the day he arrived home. Now the police in Riga requests KW's presence to help them investigate his murder. Its investigation disgusts KW because of its sloppiness. After lots of intrigue, KW and his dead friend's superiors part company, leaving KW with a feeling of failure and a yearning to help the widow of his dead friend. KW is in love with her...In Sj&ouml;wall & Wahl&ouml;&ouml;'s second book about Martin Beck, the hero was sent to Budapest. In this second book about KW, his creator sent him behind the Iron Curtain too. Coincidence? Both heroes come across as helpless. But KW returns to Latvia in a clandestine manner, aided by the Latvian diaspora. During his infiltration many good and bad people are killed.The book has several issues: too much introspection, too long and slow moving, and too many loose ends. The killers of the two men in a rubber boat are not found. Neither are the mole or spy inside KW's police station. Etcetera. And did he get the factory job? Stupid question!"},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"This books deals with the problems of the police department and everyone in general following the new era of freedom from Soviet oppression. The problems of secrecy and lack of trust in people around you are stressed. A Swedish policeman is sent to help solve a murder; his attempts to ask questions are stymied and he is constantly shadowed. I purchased this book second-hand to give to a friend who had just been on a lecture tour of one of the Baltic countries. She had been told many tales of persecution and secrecy so I thought this book would be enlightening for her. (I had read it in Swedish so I couldn't share my book with her.)"},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"I've been a fan of Scandinavian mysteries since Smylla's Sense Of Snow. Henning Makell is one of my favorites. This on doesn't let you down."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"When I read \\"The Man from Beijing\\" a couple of years ago, I loved it so much that I decided to read Mankell's Kurt Wallender books. For me, that was a big move, because I never used to read mysteries at all. Stieg Larsson changed my mind about mysteries, and I was hoping that Mankell would be another pleasant surprise. However, this was my second or third Wallender book, and I don't think I'll read any more. He seems to be identical in all his books; there doesn't seem to be any growth or even change in the character from book to book, and I don't even understand his motivations - which is odd given his critical role in each of his books. For example, why does he fall so madly in love with the widow of his Latvian counterpart to the point of obsession? For a character who seems so devoid of passion for anything, it just seems out of place entirely.I do love the way Mankell writes - those clipped, short, barb-like sentences, combined with terse but adequate dialogue. But the characters (even, I'm sad to say, Wallender) are all kind of cardboard cut-outs, and the plots are undistinguished."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"What a great way to reading Swedish novels! And that I can find such old titles at a great price that includes shipping! Thanks!"},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"I really enjoyed Mr Mankell's \\"Faceless Killers.\\" He was obviously writing about a part of the world he was familiar with. I enjoyed the specific details he provided. It was gritty, unpolished and a good read. Wallander was painted effectively as a flawed hero. However, in \\"Dogs of Riga,\\" Mankell moves the storyline to Latvia where he does not appear to have the same familiarity. He retreats from providing details in the story to the point of cliche. His description of Latvia could be one of 15 different countries. After reading the book, I don't feel that I have any greater understanding or knowledge of the country or the culture. Also, I had a very difficult time suspending reality sufficiently enough to finish the book. Supposedly Wallander becomes Major Liepa's most important confidant in the world after a few days together with virtually no conversation. Really?! Then the resistance in Latvia puts the fate of their movement in Wallander's hands. Essentially a small town policeman from another country that knows nothing about their country, culture or struggle. Really?! Then Wallander risks his life because he falls in love with someone he has met once, knows very little about and can barely talk to. Really?! The \\"conflict\\" between protagonist and antagonist is trite and sophomoric. When he announces the obvious suspect is guilty, the story does not provide any information to support this announcement. We know it just because the author tells us who is guilty. Then the simplistic plot twist tells us he really isn't guilty. Once again, the story provides no support for this change, other than the author telling us he's innocent. This plot reads like a high school creative writing project. It is silly and not the same caliber as Faceless Killers."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"As I've written above, this is a great summer read--it's very readable, entertaining, and even suspenseful towards the end. Inspector Wallander is a very well-developed character, but what I especially enjoyed about this particular novel is how Henning Mankell does a great job of painting what life was like in Riga during the time when the Iron Curtain came crashing down. He also does a great job of hinting what life was like in Latvia during the Communist era. This is the second Inspector Wallander book I've read, the first being his debut, Faceless Killers, and I must say that I enjoyed this second book much more than the first book! The book is suspenseful, and I found myself wondering how it would all end. I look forward to reading the third book, The White Lioness, later this year or sometime next year."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"One of the previous reviewers mentioned that \\"Dogs of Riga\\" might be difficult for Americans because of its pervasive 'Scandinavian gloom'. True, I think, but what makes this novel even more unsettling is the thick, murky atmostphere of mistrust and suspicion depicted in the countries of EasternEurope in the early 1990's. It is difficult for Americans to empathize with the fear and suspicion of those times, which is the setting of this novel. The repressive and grim background is indeed the leading force in the novel: it is a force which still impacts life in much of the Eastern Bloc today, accompanied by suspicion and corruption.Against that setting, then, the characters assume heroic proportions. The desire of Wallander to do his job well and bring closure to the deaths, the courage of Major Liepa to confront corruption, and the passion of Baiba Liepa to revenge the murder of her husband--all assume epic dimensions when viewed against the social backdrop. The plot is thickened by the lies, fear, and deceit by which even the ordinary citizen must survive. The labyrinth is constructed with masterful prose and an observant eye, hallmarks of Mankell's craft as a writer.\\"Dogs of Riga\\" is a classic of the genre. More complex and better crafted than the typical police procedural, it is a 'must read' for the epicurean mystery reader."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"In THE DOGS OF RIGA-- both four-legged and two-legged--Inspector Kurt Wallander is back with another difficult crime to solve. Two dead men, dressed to the nines, wash ashore in Ystad in a life raft. As usual, initially there are practically no clues. This crime takes Wallander away from Sweden into Latvia, a place he finds colder-- if that's possible-- than his homeland. He warms up, of course, when he falls in love with the widow of another murdered character, Major Liepa of Riga. Inspector Wallander remains the character fans of Mankell have come to love. He doesn't always get along with his father and daughter or his police superiors, he on the best of days bends the rules of conducting an investigation, on other days he breaks them, he doesn't eat well, he has trouble with the opposite sex and he's a tad hypochondriacal but still loves opera. Does he sound like someone you know?I found myself not liking this novel as much as previous ones I have read by Mr. Mankell. It may have been that he was writing about locales and people very foreign to him. On the other hand, a B novel by this most talented of writers is better than those of dozens of his contemporaries.As always, Mr. Mankell writes about big issues, in this instance \\"the revolutionary events that took place in the Baltic countries during the last year\\" as he says in a rare \\"Afterword\\" written in 1992. He remains one of our very best crime writers."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"\\"The Dogs of Riga\\" is one of the earlier books in Henning Mankell's series about his somber fictional Swedish police Inspector Kurt Wallendar and the plot is darker and jerkier than in later stories. I first read the book when it was published in German in 1993 and it's the only one of the series that I regularly enjoy re-reading. There's nothing slick about the story telling: it has a very raw edge to it.The story follows the traditional Wallendar plotline: an exotic foreigner arrives in the peaceful coastal town of Ystad, accompanied by a slew of violent acts and connections to powerful people that shock the overworked local police force. In this case, the foreign dogs who wash up on Sweden's shore are two very dead businessmen with drugs in their systems.Wallendar follows the trail back across the Baltic Sea to Riga, the capital of newly independent Latvia. There he involves himself more in local \\"affairs\\" than is politic or safe. Mankell kicked up some dust with this book. The Latvia described is a chaotic mix of gangland crime and corrupt officialdom. Some Latvians took exception to that bleak picture. (Latvia became independent in 1991 and \\"Hundarna i Riga\\" was published the following year.)Kommissar Wallendar is often compared to Georges Simenon's Inspecteur Maigret or Colin Dexter's Chief Inspector Morse. In this book, he also shows traces of John Le Carr&eacute;'s Smiley. Mankell has been extremely popular in Europe for a long time. Maybe his books are better read in a cold, damp climate like that of Sweden, but I can't see anything that makes them \\"difficult for some American readers\\" as Publishers Weekly advises."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"In Henning Mankell's \\"The Dogs of Riga\\" police inspector Kurt Wallander finds himself alone and possibly in peril in post-Soviet Latvia. He is truly a stranger in a strange land.The plot of \\"The Dogs of Riga\\", the second in Mankell's Kurt Wallander mystery series, is fairly straightforward. Two bodies wash up on the southern coast of Sweden, near the town of Ystad. Police Inspector Kurt Wallander is placed in charge of the investigation. The investigation reveals that the bodies had drifted across the Baltic Sea from the Republic of Latvia. A Latvia police detective arrives to assist Wallander before the investigation is turned over to the Latvian police force. However, Wallander is soon obligated to travel to Riga, Latvia's capital. Wallander is immersed immediately in the Byzantine politics that engulfed Latvia and the Baltic States in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet empire. He doesn't speak the language, he knows next to nothing of the political situation he has walked into, and yet plods on, determined to get to the bottom, not of the murders of the two Latvians, but of a new-found Latvian friend and colleague.Mankell's Kurt Wallander series is often compared to the Martin Beck detective mysteries authored by the husband and wife team of Per Wahloo and Maj Sjowall. Wallander, like Beck, is a police detective in Sweden. Unlike Beck, whose beat was Stockholm, Wallander works in the small southern-Swedish city of Ystad. The Wallander series takes place in the 1990s while the Beck series took place in the 1960s and 1970s. Although I tend to prefer the Beck series, the Wallander books are entertaining page-turners. Mankell stays well within the \`police procedural' formula and has not tried to reinvent the genre. However, he has done a good job, in these first two volumes in the series, of developing the character of Mankell and his supporting cast of characters. Wallander is no Sherlock Holmes and gets results more by perspiration than inspiration. He is also a fully drawn character. We see him dealing with the break-up of a marriage, an estranged daughter, and a father who is developing senile dementia. The supporting characters, particularly his fellow detectives, are also well drawn.Although I think I like the Martin Beck series a bit more, the Kurt Wallander series, so far, has been entertaining. As noted, Mankell stays well within the confines of the police procedural. However, he manages to put together an entertaining plot and keeps the reader \`engaged' with his recurring characters. Mankell does not hide clues from the reader. In fact, the opposite is the case. I found myself seeing \`clues' throughout this piece wondering if and when Wallander would spot them. Some may find that not to their liking, but it kept me entertained. Recommended. L. Fleisig"},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"In this the second book by Henning Mankell, the setting starts in Sweden but then moves to Latvia just as this country is breaking its bonds with Mother Russia. Mankell attempts to bring the reader into the depths of despair of the newly forming Latvia, but he does not quite execute.The story starts with a life raft carrying two murdered Eastern Europeans landing (with some help) on the shores of Sweden. It is a very slow and uninspiring first 100 pages. The characters are paper thin and the story just doesn't beg the reader's empathy. As the story moves to Latvia, the plot thickens and picks up dramatically as Mankell seems to be on top of his writing as this second phase of the story unfolds. Detective Wallander is asked to come to Latvia to continue the investigation that was begun in Sweden. The writing turns to a \\"Le Carre-like\\" spy story and the reader is treated to a myriad of protagonists and possible suspects. The reader is immersed into the \\"stab in the back\\" Russian sympathizers and their own anti-revolution sentiments.However, the last 100 pages revert back to lame writing and a story that just does not want to end. This reader can see the potential building in this author, but in this novel, Mankell oversteps his comfort zone too much. He fails to bring the reader with him throughout the book and turns a promising premise into a somewhat boring effort by simply failing to edit the last 100 pages.I am enjoying reading Mankell knowing that he develops into something special and experiencing this after the fact by reading books written nearly 20 years ago. This one could really be skipped. The initial offering was more interesting, but the sophomore slump hits Mankell in this one."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"Novels whose protagonist is inspector Kurt Wallander from a small village of Sweden, contains for me as much sociology and politics as crimes. This books follows a chronological order, so we can see the aging of the personages and the pass of time in the police station of Ystad, South Sweden. That is fully believable, although it seems not likely that in a small village it could happen so many terrible, complicate and strange murders that let New York as a quiet hamlet. Sure, that gives to inspector Wallander the opportunity to demonstrate his high ability and intelligence as policeman, philosopher, etc. We, as readers must accept that literary license.We see, I spite to have to face terrible criminals Wallander very rarely carries his ordnance handgun. He drives too much his old and re - repaired Peugeot, delegates very little the most routine tasks, earns a low salary, sleeps very bad and very little and he's constantly sick and tired after many journeys of almost 24 hours of hard work. He resists all that by drinking a big amount of coffee, doesn't disdain whisky, eats usually cheap tasteless hamburgers and pizzas, all very fast and very bad and so, he suffers some diarrheas, and he's overweigh and prone to diabetes. Summing up, Kurt Wallander isn't Mike Hammer: he's humane, so humane, that if truly necessary he's able to knock out with a powerful punch to an adversary. He's constantly consternated by the cases he has to solve. He's truly a pacific man and doesn't like his profession but he simply doesn't know another thing to do in life.And there, it does very well: the reason is Wallander possess an extraordinary sharpened instinct for true or false things and words, a rare ability to relation spare words, declarations apparently unconnected, and a deep knowledge of human being and human situations. That is worth more tahn a revolver. These abilities I think aren't fully innate: you need to have experience of living, looking, and capacity to learning from it. In effect, personal and familiar problems of Swedish society are omnipresent. In this novel Wallander has to solve the murder of two Latvians in a small boat at derive. That goes him to find a love with a Latvian woman. In Spain we have much Swedish and Scandinavian people living here almost permanently with a good standard of life while Russians and Baltic people are economically in poor situation, but the novel reveals truly these Northern people seems very near in character and mood."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"Let me begin by pointing out that I am a huge Henning Mankell fan, although I found this book a bit of disappointment. His writing ability is clear, concise and flows so smoothly he can only compare to Ed McBain who also knew how to tell a story in a simple but extremely effective way. The problem with this story is that so much of it involves foreign intrigue that seems out of place for both the writer and the Wallander, the main character, that I am not surprised that Mankell didn't go back to it. I can't praise this author enough, but I would read any of his other Wallander books before reading this. It's not bad, just a disappointment when you consider what he can do."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"Henning Mankell is undoubtedly the Agatha Christie of Sweden - a very good, competent author of crime and suspense novels. His writing style is sparse, but very effective, and as a suspense novel, this story will grip you and keep you reading until the last page. At least, it kept me glued to the story to the last page. As a history of the events in the Baltic states, especially Latvia, it is not so convincing. Several grievous errors crop up, and it is quite unbelievable that a policeman, even from a small Skne town, would be so ignorant of the history and situation in the Baltics. Even in the turbulent times of the 1988-1991 'Singing Revolution', There was no question who the ultimate authority was in Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. To pretend that Latvians had any real say-so in their country is not realistic, even by a Swede. It is true that Sweden was practically the only western country to recognize the incorporation of the Baltic States into the Soviet Union, but it also had a sizeable diaspora of Estonians and Latvians, some of whom moved in fairly high circles of the Swedish government. Any halfway-educated Swede knew the situation across the Baltic Sea. And any Swedish policeman sent to coordinate criminal investigation in the former Soviet Union should, and would have been briefed by the foreign ministry before being allowed to go. So, in reading the book, be enthralled by the mystery, but do not take the history and explanation of the political scene all too seriously."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"Kurt Wallender gets caught up and lost in the gloomy world of the soviet remains of Latvian chaos in this one and he does not do well. My reading device says I have slogged my way through 88% this mess of a book along with him. The snow drifts have been high,damp dark and cold, but that marker tells me we will see the light in the cabin window soon, Kurt will bid a gloomy fairwell to that dispairing widow, leave his German passport behind, and get on that big plane back to Sweden where we belong.What on earth was Hennning Mankel thinking? Where were his editors and publisher that they would even consider marketing this really dreadful story. It sounds like something put together around a campfire with a group of people getting drunker while the multiple sub-plots twist, turn, run into dead ends and often emplode in emptyness , subsummed in numerous black holes.Like many other readers if this had been the only Wallender story I ever attempted it would certainly be the last.

This case will take Wallander to Latvia and into a politically driven plot with twists and turns as he strives to find the answers to several murders. He encounters a passionate group of Freedom Fighters and begins to understand the political underbelly of Riga and the shadows that rule. It is a dark,dank and dreary world that he finds in Riga. As usual Wallander's emotions rule the day and he throws himself headlong into a dangerous plot to help a group of Latvians discover the truth. This is the second book in the Wallander series and differs significantly in that the social commentary is front and foremost. I felt like Mankell teetered on the edge of melodrama with this one. There was alot of action and unlikely scenario's where Wallander survives by the skin of his teeth. I missed the camaraderie and banter of the Ystad police force. In all though a good mystery but less enjoyable for me than the other books I've read in the series."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"Perhaps it is unfortunate that this is the only Henning Mankell book I have read, because I would never read another of his \\"mysteries\\" after this. Having been rather disappointed by the PBS renderings of his works, I now commend them on making them as interesting as they can.What a dull book this is. Perhaps if written as a very short story, it would have been OK. But the characters and situations are dull, the plot almost non-existent, and little or no suspense for the reader. I finished this book only because I wanted to see if in the ending there would be something which made it worthy of publication. Sadly, there was none. Save you money and time, if you like tightly constructed and well written mysteries."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"OK, I'm not going to give away the ending. But here is the plot. Two men are found dead in a liferaft, apparently with expensive clothes put on them after death. This is a mystery that isn't solved. A Latvian cop is killed and for some reason, the Latvian police call on Kurt Wallender -- who is Swedish and speaks not a word of Latvian -- to cross the Baltic and solve their crime. Good investigative technique -- interview people who don't speak your language. But that's the premise of this book, and it makes no sense at all! Okay, so it is dark and brooding and Scandinavian, but give me a break. At least give us some kind of plot to make us suspend disbelief (This may be easier in Sweden where everyone drinks, smokes, drinks coffee and commits suicide.) It is well written but you've got to have a plot. Oh yes, in the end the solution comes from out of nowhere after Wallender has messed it up."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"The setting and the characters promise a great read. And while the books is easy to get thru and diverting enuf, it is far toosimplistic and predictable; like a TV crime episode. There are far too many far-fetched turns to make it believable. The basic political tenet is never really explained or backgrounded. This is a great shame as the book's theme and characters hold so much promise."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"Two dimensional characters, predictable plot, tedious attempts at suspense and a lazy, poorly-crafted plot. A friend recommended Henning Mankell when I asked for suggestions in the spirit of early John LeCarre.

It is more like a globe-trotting spy novel than a slow-paced Wallander mystery. The biggest fault of this particular book is the poor translation to english. There are at least a dozen significant translation errors in this edition. At one point in the book, the phrase \\"much muchness\\" occurs ... I still can't figure out Mankell originally wrote there! In short, I encourage all interested readers to read Mankell's mysteries. They are well written and full of complex characters; however, this particular book is not the author's best work, and furthermore, it is poorly translated."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"My third KW novel, and although I enjoyed it, it was not as good as Faceless Killers or The Man Who Smiled. I think Mankell erred in setting most of the scene outside Sweden. Kurt is still the sloppy detective, constantly on the lookout for coffee and sandwiches and scared of his own tail. Some things are laughable such as when Kurt, in Riga, so concerned that he is being watched and followed wherever he goes, attempts to give any potential tail the slip by running, as fast as he can at that, for three whole blocks before turning a corner and proceeding at a normal pace. Now, in a large city, what is one of the best ways to attract attention to yourself? Yes, by running fast. He is truly pathetic but that is part of his charm, as when he falls in love almost at first sight with a particular character in Dogs. I also felt the ending, particularly the tossing back and forth as to whodunnit, was cheap. So what was good about it? Somehow I liked the fact that Kurt dedicated himself to helping people in another country that he barely knew at considerable danger to himself. It is easy to write such heroics, of course, but Kurt being such a chicken I was glad he volunteered.Oh well, are there any truly good writers in the crime genre? Let me know if you know of any."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"The book is interesting partly because Mankell suggests that the roots of the present mafia lie in the blackmarket network of the old communist system, and partly because the text was written before the total collapse of the USSR.It's a powerful book, the scene where the fascist police storm in and kill the opposition is frightening, realistic, and bloodthirsty. So is the difficulty of making contact with Baiba, since both are watched. And the ending: who are the good guys, and who are the bad ones?But Mankell strains the the will to believe too often. Why should Wallender, with a fake Latvian pass, go so far south and then enter the country illegally on foot? Not very likely that Wallender would have survived the massacre and escaped the building, either. Nor can I believe that Wallender could have found his way through the police headquarters, into the archive, and out again so easily. In the end, Mankell gives away a bit too soon who the bad guys really are.One thing is puzzeling. Wallender did not connect with Baiba in the end. So, in later novels, is it only in his imagination that Baiba is his distant girlfriend? Mankell, realistically enough, does not present us with a happy life for the Commissar!This review is based on the German translation \\"Hunde von Riga\\"."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Man From Bejing\\" and \\"Faceless Killers.\\" I was intrigued by Kurt Wallander and decided to read my way through the series. Then came \\"The Dogs of Riga.\\" What a disappointment. For the vast majority of the book, Wallander wanders around, lamenting his life and inability to crack a case. He spends most of the novel in Latvia, aimlessly moving from one building to another, waxing about dark plots, lies and conspiracies. Did it never occur to Mankell that if his own character grows tired of his worthlessness at solving a crime, his readers might also grow weary of him? Plus, the romantic subplot, such as it is, is terrible. Out of nowhere, based on nothing more than two rushed meetings, Wallander falls in love with the widow of a murdered police officer? There was nothing about that plotline that remotely rang true. Frankly, I finished the book because I only had about 50 pages to go when I realized that the plot was never going to turn around. I may try one more Wallander novel because every author has an off day, but this book did not live up to its predecessor, \\"Faceless Killers.\\""},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"I've read several Wallander mysteries and I love the character but this book, while I liked it, is at the bottom of my list for favorite Wallander mysteries."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"I found this book lacking in excitement and credibility. I liked the character of Wallender but found the other characters not very well developed. And the plot was weak. For instance, I can't understand why the detective was so driven to return to Riga and risk his life, if not his comfort, to get involved in something that did not seem compelling. I felt the novel got off to a good start, but then lapsed into incredulity. This was my first, and will probably be my last, Wallendar novel. I just found the characters and the plot weak and unexciting."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"I love the other books of the series but this one is not as good. I noticed a couple of mistakes in the plot like when Wallendar cut his knee in one of the last chapters and then there was no mention to that again in the rest of the book, or when he was paying a hotel and noticed he had enough money to spent more days but a few minutes later he had no money to pay for gasoline and then at the end he changed money..I was just confused specially because the other books are flawless..."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"I am wondering if Mankell spent any time in Latvia doing research for this book. While it is a very good yarn, I question whether Riga was a grim as Mankell describes. I question this because of personal experiences and because in an afterward in the book Mankell pleads \\"poetic license\\" for the Riga he portrays.I was in Moscow in 1978 with a trade group and encountered a group of Latvians at the Moscow airport. They were waiting for their flight home after some sort of meetings in Moscow. They were singing, laughing and joking and had a very in-your-face attitude toward the Soviet officials who were glowering at them. I don't know if they were using the hijinks to annoy the officials or just having a good time. However, the memory of their spirit has stayed with me through the years.In 2004, my wife and I took a cruise on the Baltic, and one of the ports of call was Tallinn in neighboring Estonia. Tallinn was an attractive and pleasant city. I encountered an Arizona Saloon, which paid homage to John Wayne and his movies; a wedding reception at a McDonald's; and a lot of Finns who had come over on the ferry for the day. It is hard for me to picture that Riga would be in such worse shape. The book was written in the early 90s, but is a decade long enough to rehabilitate the city Mankell portrays.Somehow, I feel Mankell had this great idea for a story and felt Latvia, Estonia or Lithuanian seemed a logical site. Then, he forced his idea on Riga.Also, it seemed a bit of a stretch to have Wallander suddenly becoming James Bond."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"This time inspector Kurt Wallander has to solve the murder on two very well-dressed men, who float ashore the Swedish coast on a raft. The trail leads to Latvia. After his Latvian colleague is also murdered, Wallander ends up in a web of intrigues in an unstable country that is unknown to him and where he does not speak the language. Soon he finds out that one of his two nearest Latvian colleagues is the villain, but which one of the two?In contrast to &#65533;Faceless killers&#65533; by the same author, this book contains much more action, but after a while I became quite dizzy with all the twist and turns that the story took. It is an entertaining story, but Wallander appeared less real to me than in the previous book."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"The second book in the Kurt Wallander series, as happened with the first installment &quot;Faceless Killers&quot;, falls clearly short of the mark. I have a Swedish friend who encouraged me to read the first book, and after finishing it and telling him it was not very good, he said I should give it another try. This second book did not change my opinion whatsoever, but since I heard that this was the weakest book in the series I am willing to give Henning Mankell one more chance.It is February 1991 and after two bodies wash ashore the Swedish coast in a raft, the Ystad police, with Wallander leading the investigation, determine that the murdered men are from one of the countries in the Eastern block. The Swedish police receive the visit of Major Liepa, from the Latvian police, who comes to help with the crime. Following the discovery of certain facts, Anette Brolin, the district attorney object of Wallander's infatuation in the previous book, closes the case and transfers it to Riga. An unexpected turn of events will require the presence of the Swedish inspector in Riga to help with the case and a new murder. Upon his arrival, Wallander realizes that Latvia presents a high level of political unrest after the fall of the Berlin wall, with the group seeking independence is confronting the Russians.Clearly the best aspect of the book is the main character, which has a complex personality and whose emotions, thoughts and inner demons are explored in depth, making these the main focus of the stories. In this case, Wallander is dealing with the loss of his partner, Rydberg, who was one of the most experienced policemen in the department. We find that Kurt is constantly second guessing himself and thinking what Rydberg would have done in his situation. Other factors like Wallander's relationship with his father and daughter are also cause of concern for the detective, and we find him having health problems and thinking of choosing and alternate career because of this.Where the novel really lacks in quality is in what has to do with the mystery per se. Mankell never really grasps the reader attention in this aspect and, even though this book is a little bit more fast-paced than the one before, the action seems drawn out. If the author could improve in this point, his books would be great, because they already have an awesome main character. I really hope that my next, and maybe final, try with this series results in a more fulfilling experience."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"This book was riveting and essential reading if you are reading the series. Everything was plausible and not only kept you on the edge of your seat, but also was quite emotive. I love the description of the country - you actually feel like you are there - even if you have never had the experience. Excellent read.I wish Amazon would just post the books in the series by number as it's annoying to trawl through each book to find out the number in the series."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"I am a huge Mankell and Kurt Wallander fan. I have read all the novels and am just sad that they are over! A must read, quintessential Mankell."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"For those true lovers of a great book, and those interested in murder mysteries, this book is for you. A Swedish detective, with complicated relationships, and a World closing in on itself, he is able to see and solve problems others cannot. The interplay between his great police work and his personal life falling part creates a wonderfully rich backstory. Mostly set in Latvia, this book involves multiple murders , personal relationships, and intrigue. I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"It is just ok thats all. Not a bad one but his later books are much better. This series can be read out of sequence so start further on."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"A Very intreaguing story with plenty of excitement and twists and turns in the plot which makes for good reading"},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"In typical Mankell style, The Dogs is visceral in every way. We are made to feel all of the fear and uncertainty that goes with Eastern bloc countries in the early nineties. We even feel Wallender's discomfort upon donning woolen long johns in riga. Brilliant plot, with the outcome in doubt right up to the shootout on the roof of the department store."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"Having read most of the Wallender mysteries out of order, I finally learn how and when Wallender meets his love, Baiba. I enjoy the Wallender mysteries because Mankel's character is an everyman. He plods along, going down blind alleys, having to regroup, and rethink. He eats poorly, drinks too much, and doesn't take care of himself as he should. He's a dutiful son, divorced, with a teenage daughter that he loves, but barely knows. Who couldn't identify with a poor schmuck like that?"},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"Great writing emotional, sad, so descriptive of Wallander with mounting tension against a well painted background. Absorbing, could not put it down."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"This story is much more interesting to read than to watch. I liked the story even though it is convulated. Worth the time."},{"Title":"Dogs of Riga","review":"Originally I thought I might read all the Kurt Wallander stories in the order that they were written but that didn't work out. But as it turns out, it doesn't matter because they are all good. The Dogs of Riga was very exciting and held my interest to the very last page. It is incredible how Mankell makes his stories seem so realistic. This one in particular really pushed Kurt Wallander out of his comfort zone and gave us a glimpse of what it's like to put one's self in some very unpredictable situations."},{"Title":"Queen Mother: A Biblical Theology of Mary's Queenship (Letter & Spirit Project)","review":"This re-publication of Dr. Sri's doctoral dissertation is a wonderful contribution to Mariology because it answers the Second Vatican Council's request that Sacred Scripture serve as the soul of theology (Cf. Dei Verbum).We know well from Apostolic Tradition - as mediated by the Magisterium of the Catholic Church - that Mary was assumed into heaven to be coronated as queen. What Sri has done in this fine work is demonstrate how this dogma finds its source in the Kingdom tradition of Israel. He then goes on to show how several key New Testament passages draw from this same tradition when portraying Mary.The scholar will discover an authentic addition to the wealth of knowledge in print regarding Mariology; the cleric will find a resource to enhance his Biblical homiletics; and the average layperson will uncover a beautiful foundation for his Marian spirituality. For all, the surprise of discovering the Old Testament foundations of Mary's ecclesial office is well worth the read. This enlightening presentation, I believe, will - as the book says in its closing chapter - advance the important work of ecumenism by demonstrating this essential Scriptural support for Mary in God's salvific plan.With all of this praise, you may ask why I gave this book 4 instead of 5 stars? I believe Sri would have done better with a more thorough examination of the New Testament's allusions to Mary's queenship. For example, he fails to mention or examine Mary's statement: \\"All generations will call me blessed\\" in her Magnificat (Lk 1:48), which - as many have noted - seems to draw upon Psalm 45:18, the conext of which is a royal Davidic psalm that speaks of the King and Queen.Also, Sri's examination of Elizabeth's response \\"How does this happen to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me?\\" (Lk 1:43) does not take into account Luke's continual allusion to content of the Books of Samuel, and the New Ark typology employed in the Visitation. He focuses upon \\"the mother of my Lord\\" as a form of declaration that Mary is the Gebirah, when he could have gone further and shown the correspondence between this exclamation and David's words: \\"How can the ark of the Lord come to me?\\" (2 Sm 6:9). I find this allusion to me much more tenable than a more abstract declaration of Mary as Gebirah. However, this point could lead to Mary's office as Gebirah if you take into account that in the ancient neighboring dynasties to Israel, the pagan Queen Mothers sat upon an ark that was carried in procession."},{"Title":"Queen Mother: A Biblical Theology of Mary's Queenship (Letter & Spirit Project)","review":"I was quite prepared to like this book after only a brief look in the bookstore. The quotes from the well-known Marian theologians on the back were impressive:Fr. Roten from the International Marian Research Institute wrote\\"Sri's scriptural examination of Mary's queenship in light ofthe Davidic kingdom tradition is a welcome antidote againstfrequent unidimensional historical reductions of Mary's personand role. Mary is not a shadowy figure frozen in the distant pastbut the 'eschatological icon' of salvationhistory.\\"Dr. Mark Miravalle adds \\"The biblical queen-mother tradition isof paramount importance for our contamporary understanding of OurLady's dynamic role of spiritual queen and advocate for all humanity.Edward Sri offers an outstanding synthesis of this Gebirah or 'GreatLady' biblical tradition.\\"Perhaps most intriguing was Dr. Scott Hahn's statement in theForeword that Sri's study is important not just for Mariology butas a model for all biblical Theology. He writes, \\"An approach likethis provides theologians with superior interpretive and explanatorypower and has potential to heal historic divisions between scholarsand the Church, between the academy and the seminary, and among thevarious separated Christian bodies...When we read the Bible in thisway, we find no tension between letter and spirit -- between literaryand historical study of scripture and faithful contemplation of itsreligious and spiritual meaning.\\"The book turned out to be even better than I was expecting. This is not a book of Catholic apologetics. It is also not a book about Marian spirituality or devotion. Nonetheless it will both strengthen your faith and deepen your devotion.Dr. Sri carefully and systematically lays out the scriptural roots of the Queenship of Mary in the queen-mother tradition of the Old Testament Davidic Kingdom. He then shows how the New Testament draws on those themes and applies them to Jesus, the royal son of David, and to His mother, Mary.This book is scholarly but still accessible to non-scholars. My one difficulty was that he used endnotes instead of footnotes. There is so much good material in the notes (and there are over 50 pages of notes) but you have to keep flipping back and forth to follow it. I ended up just reading with my finger in the the proper notes pages and keeping two bookmarks in the book when I put it down; it's not too bad once you get used to it but footnotes would have been convenient."},{"Title":"Queen Mother: A Biblical Theology of Mary's Queenship (Letter & Spirit Project)","review":"Edward Sri's Queen Mother is part of the Letter & Spirit Project run by the St. Paul Center for Biblical Theology (founded by Scott Hahn). Thus, it focuses almost exclusively on the Sacred Scriptures. Though there have been criticisms regarding the lack of recourse to Sacred Tradition, I don't think this is ultimately detrimental, nor am I surprised since the goal of the St. Paul Center for Biblical Theology is biblical theology (hence the name). It does not deny or negate the importance of evidence from Sacred Tradition, or the Magisterium, but simply seeks to draw out a deeper understanding of the biblical evidence of certain themes and doctrines of the Catholic faith.Dr. Sri's book is an examination of the Theology of the Queenship of Mary from a solidly biblical perspective. This theology of Mary's Queenship is important as it explains and identifies her role as Queen of Heaven and Advocate. Mary's role in God's plan of Salvation was not limited to her earthly life, and this book provides biblical evidence for Mary's role in Heaven. She is the prime intercessor to her Son, the King of Heaven, and the spiritual Mother of the Church.The book is divided into four parts: an introduction, evidence from the Old Testament, evidence from the New Testament, and then summary conclusions. It is a relatively small book, only about 100 pages, but the back half of the book is filled with copious notes, references, and a great bibliography for those inclined to deeper study of Marian doctrines.I think Dr. Sri's book will also be of value to those practicing apologetics. The Marian doctrines of the Church, and especially the acknowledging of Mary as Queen of Heaven and Mother of the Church, have always been a concern of Protestants. Dr. Sri's Queen Mother presents a biblical view of Mary that should provide an excellent response for apologists defending the biblical view of Mary."},{"Title":"Queen Mother: A Biblical Theology of Mary's Queenship (Letter & Spirit Project)","review":"Being a convert to Catholicism, there have been some hard pill to swallow. The Theotokos is one of those areas which gives our separated brethren the most reason to doubt our sincerity to Christ. This is the best book I have read on the subject of Mary and her place in the Bible. I recommend it as a gift to ANYBODY you know in RCIA or Confirmation prep."},{"Title":"Queen Mother: A Biblical Theology of Mary's Queenship (Letter & Spirit Project)","review":"Edward Sri presents this book as a study of the theology of the Queenship of Mary and a corrective to previous explanations of Mary's Queenship. His aim is to be solidly Catholic, ecumenical, and understandable. I think he achieves these goals and then some. He gives a thorough explanation of what was lacking in previous explanations of Mary's Queenship and then he sets forth his own explanation which is scripturally sound and consonant with Church tradition. My one frustration with this book had more to do with Sri's writing style rather than with the facts he presented. He repeatedly told the reader what he was going to say, said it and then told the reader that he had said it. Such a paradigm is useful for beginning writers, but it becomes overly tedious in a book such as this. Overall this is a good and useful book, as much for the presentation of its thesis as for its extensive footnotes and bibliography."},{"Title":"Queen Mother: A Biblical Theology of Mary's Queenship (Letter & Spirit Project)","review":"I have barely started this book, but it looks like it's going to be great! Eventually, I'll also look for others like it."},{"Title":"Queen Mother: A Biblical Theology of Mary's Queenship (Letter & Spirit Project)","review":"This review is not meant to be critical of the author as a person. I simply want to offer some points for critical consideration, that I feel need to be addressed for those who may use this book in a Catholic theology course. I will just narrow them down to 3 points.First, Sri says on p.34-35, that the PBC(Pontifical Biblical Commission of 1993, which no longer enjoys the teaching office of the Magisterium of the Catholic Church, unlike the ones that came before Vatican II)makes a distinction in the different ways that the \\"sensus plenior\\" can come to be known. This distinction that Sri is trying to insist on, is NOT a distinction that the PBC talks of when explaining how the \\"sensus plenior\\" can be assertained. Please see PBC document p.130-131. The PBC states this about the \\"sensus plenior\\", \\"Its existence in the biblical text comes to be known when one studies the text in light of other biblical texts which utilize it(meaning sacred scripture)OR in its relationship with the internal development of revelation.\\" The later is called by the PBC p.131 \\"a genuine doctrinal Tradition.\\"(sacred tradition) Notice how the PBC does not make a distinction on how to arrive at the \\"sensus plenior\\" as Sri is insisting. The PBC does not place one above the other, but rather side by side. The PBC has so worded it this way because the sacred deposit of Faith comes from 2 divine sources, sacred scripture and sacred tradition(see also Dei Verbum #9,10). Sri seems to suggest that the PBC deems less important on how sacred tradition or the Magisterium comes to the understanding of the sensus plenior, than sacred scripture. This is not true. It seems as though Sri has either unintentionally or intentionally, adopted this view that sacred tradition is of little value when it comes to biblical exegesis. A case in point is found specifically(& generally throughout the book) on p.54-58, where Sri speaks about the prophecy of Is.7:14. Sri is in agreement with the view of modern and rationalistic exegests, that the \\"almah\\" spoken of in Is.7:14 refers to the \\"wife\\" of King Ahaz and sees this prophecy has having a \\"double fulfillment with the successor to Ahaz bringing the prophecy to a partial fulfillment & Christ giving its ultimate fulfillment(p.58).\\" Sri also says, \\"Finally, we note that the extent to which this passage can be viewed as messianic prophecy is still debated(p.58).\\"First of all, this view of \\"partial or double fulfillment\\" of this prophecy or that it was referring to the wife of King Ahaz, therefore his son, was defended in early times by Jews against Christians. Sts. Justin & Jerome, both refuted this view. Is.7:14 has been viewed by the Faith of the Catholic Church & the unanimous view of the exegetical tradition, that this text is to be understood as exclusively Messianic & Marian. Meaning that the debate is over as to whether it is messianic or not & it exclusively and literally refers to Jesus & Mary.Let me make another note, the PBC itself gave this text of Is.7:14 as a prime example of how the \\"sensus plenior\\" can come to be known. It says, \\"when a subsequent biblical author attributes to an earlier biblical text, it takes it up in a context which confers upon it a new literal sense(p.130).\\" As an example of what the PBC means by this, it refers to the very text of Is.7:14. It says that the \\"almah\\" in Is.7:14 was taken up by St. Matt.1:24 & had given it the fuller meaning(sensus plenior). St. Matt. definitively gave the meaning of the word \\"almah\\" to mean virgin, because it was translated into the Septuagint as \\"parthenos\\". Therefore, the Gospel of St. Matt. then confered upon the text of Is.7:14 a NEW LITERAL MEANING. The word \\"almah\\" is to literally mean \\"virgin\\" in the strict sence & could not refer to the wife or the son of King Ahaz. If Sri had paid more attention to what the PBC said & to what sacred tradition had already solved, he would not still hold this view of \\"partial or double fulfillment\\" of Is.7:14. In addition, it would have given him a stronger case for the Church's Queen-Mother typology of Is.7:14.Another note: Sri says on p.153 in footnote #113 that \\"While it is true that Vatican II was cautious on its use of Gen.3:15 as having Marian significance,...\\" This is just not true, nowhere in Vatican II Lumen Gentium, which has a section devoted to the Blessed Mother, are the Council Fathers cautious on giving Gen.3:15 \\"Marian significance\\". If they did do this they would have been going against sacred tradition & the dogmatic development of Marian dogma. The dogma on the Blessed Mother's Immaculate Conception, specifically referred to Gen.3:15 in Pope Pius IX bull Ineffabilis Deus.Lastly, Sri agrees with the position that the \\"Woman\\" in Rev.12 refers primarily to \\"the community of believers, God's people of both the Old & New Covenants(p.96).\\" On p.103 Sri asserts the same statement but adds, \\"she also can be understood as the mother of Jesus, Mary, when the passage is read in light of the Gospel of John & the wider New Testament canon.\\" It is unfortunate that Sri has not brought out the view of the \\"Woman\\" being Mary the physical person representing the Church as a mystical figure. This view has a strong support among prominent biblical-mariologist & this would have also given a stronger support for the Queen-Mother typology for Rev.12. For a more extensive treatment on this topic please see the great work of Fr. Stefano Manelli's book \\"All Generations Shall Call Me Blessed.\\"In conclusion, I did not see how the 3 criteria for interpretating scripture as expounded on in the Catechism of the Catholic Church #'s 112,113,114 was followed, as stated at the beginning of the book."},{"Title":"The House of Saud: The Rise and Rule of the Most Powerful Dynasty in the Arab World","review":"David Holden was murdered in Egypt in December, 1977, while this book was still a work in progress, and it was later finished by Richard Johns. Both are journalists, in the best sense of the profession, and both have done an outstanding job meticulously researching the origins of the present Saudi state. Some say that Holden pried too deeply, and that is why he was murdered, others ascribe his death to a case of mistaken identity; almost certainly the truth will never be known. Certainly his death is part of the reason why this book is now relatively \\"obscure,\\" despite the fact that it is a very rare, and much needed account of the Kingdom's creation. There is one other book that also does an excellent job in covering this same period - from the first recorded origins of the Saudi family, through 1980 - Robert Lacey's \\"The Kingdom.\\" I've read them both, compared them both, and although they differ on such matters as Abdul Aziz's age when he re-took Riyadh in 1902, I cannot say which one is better - either is an essential book for those seeking an understanding and more knowledge on the creation of the Saudi state; to read both is also highly recommended for any Westerner who believes a better understanding is the first step towards ending the current policy of conducting endless war.The book contains some excellent, straightforward maps that illustrate how and when Abdul Aziz consolidated the present country, as well as where the major oil fields are. There are also numerous photographs of the principal characters. Holden & Johns' writing style is crisp and methodical. The characters and events reflect the sweeping panorama of the country. Each chapter commences with a highly appropriate epigraph, either from one of the principal actors, or from the wider field of knowledge, to underscore how these specifics tie into the broader human experience. In contrasting the weighting given to various periods in the history of the latest rise of the House of Saud, 40% of Lacey's book involved covering the events in the peninsula prior to the creation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932; in Holden & Johns' book, this period is covered in 20% of the book.So much of the West's perceptions of the Kingdom are received through intermediaries who promote a fantasy view. One of the most well-read, and famous, is T. E. Lawrence. Other historians, such as David Fromkin, in his excellent book, \\"A Peace to End All Peace,\\" have made the point that telling the truth was not among Lawrence's virtues. Holden and John confirm the same position, contrasting Lawrence with Harry St. John Philby, stating: \\"Where Lawrence wove spells of fantasy and imagination, Philby was all for bluntness. Where Lawrence wrought his wartime work into an exquisite, evocative and, it seems, partly fanciful tale of desert loves, betrayals and derring-do, Philby set about his great work of exploration with meticulous method and scrupulous regard for fact...\\" (p 65) Of course, there are other fantasy views, most recently, \\"Finding Nouf.\\"Holden and Johns' own meticulous work covers several dominant topics in Saudi history, after the creation of the Kingdom, quite well. The discovery and initial development of the oil resource is covered quite well, from a non-Aramco perspective. (which the authors refer to as \\"mammon\\".) The internal power struggle(s) in the Royal family, after the death of Abdul Aziz, during the ineffective and wasteful rule of Saud are also presented in a factual manner. Eventually he was deposed, and Faisal assumed the leadership position, in name as well as fact. External developments, particularly those with Nasser, his pan-Arab movement, and the Yemen civil war are also well depicted.The final 40% of the book is devoted to the 10 year period, 1971 though 1980, and covers the response to the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, the oil embargo, the commencement of the development of the infrastructure in the Kingdom (\\"mammon rampant\\"), and \\"the return of the Ikhwan,\\" the taking of the mosque in Makkah in 1979 by fundamentalists. There are some wonderful nuggets of insight not discussed in other books, such as the head of the Ulema, bin Baz's belief that the earth was flat, and the sun revolved around it (p262) (much to the embarrassment of King Faisal); a quote from Kissinger's own doctoral dissertation: \\"... not shy away from duplicity, cynicism or unscrupulousness, all of which are acceptable tools of statecraft.\\" (p 348); and after the death of King Faisal, a quote from the Washington Post, revealing the all too consummate \\"Orientalism\\" mindset: \\"Faisal probably did more damage to the West than any other single man since Adolf Hitler.\\" (p382); and that the Israeli air force, in a blatant disregard for a country's air space and sovereignty, did a \\"in your eye\\" touch and go at the Tabuk air base in 1977. (p 479)Holden and John covered the story of a \\"Death of a Princess,\\" like Lacey, but did not assign it a separate chapter, realizing that the taking of the mosque in Makkah was a much more significant event, and therefore only that event should merit such coverage. That chapter poignantly ends with the dazed plea from one of the dubbed followers of this latest \\"Messiah\\" (Mahdi) when, upon surrendering, he asks: \\"What of the army of the north\\"? Sadly Holden did not live to document the Kingdom's turn \\"to the right\\", certainly socially, following this event, one that has been followed, and perhaps only reversed, following the suicide bombing of compounds in the Kingdom in the first decade of the present century.This is an excellent historical account of the Kingdom, and should be essential reading in every Middle East studies center in the West, as well as by those individuals desiring more information on one of the most important countries in the world today."},{"Title":"The House of Saud: The Rise and Rule of the Most Powerful Dynasty in the Arab World","review":"When I opened this book and read that the author was murdered in Cairo before finishing it, I began to get an idea of what I was getting into. Holden, a writer for the London Times, chronicles the rise of the Saudi Royal family beginning with the seizure of power by Ibn Saud in 1901. Many people neglect to position North African and the Middle East in World War II, but Holden recognizes how conflicts in these regions continue to be a problem today. Churchill carved up Kuwait, inciting future Iraqi aggression, and John Foster Dulles hobnobbed with the slick prince Feisal. Feisal was seen most recently in a picture in the New Yorker chatting it up with Muhammed Bin Laden, father of you know who, back in the \`50's. Cars, planes, diamonds, Aristotle Onanasis, the Suez canal. To understand the role of the Saudis in world events is complicated, and Holden's book is often dry with details. His sense of humor saves him, describing incidents where Ibn Saud's successor is hospitalized and insists on making love to one of his wives in his hospital bed, assisted by several others. Better for academics and scholars than the average reader, this book is nonetheless accessible to those willing to look. Holden includes many vivid photographs of the sheiks posing with awkward executives and oil prospectors."},{"Title":"The House of Saud: The Rise and Rule of the Most Powerful Dynasty in the Arab World","review":"For those interested in how this country came into being, this is a great book. I never thought that the history of this country is relatively new. The House of Saud ruled the region of the Nejed. They dispossesed the House of Rasheed through the use of a fundamentalist Islamic religion called Wahhabism. Then they conquered the Hejez, ruled by the Hashemites. The leader of the Nejed was Ibn Saud. He lived a long and fruitful life, having over 50 sons (no mention of daughters though). When he died in 1953, his sons took over and haved ruled since. The current sovereign Abdullah is one of his oldest.For those interested in the current situation in the Middle East, this explains much. The export of this fundamentalist strain of Islam called Wahhabism is now plaguing the world with terror. Since the House of Saud has cultivated this strain, they have much to be responsible for in the current terror situation (including 9/11). The original author of the first ten chapters was murdered in Egypt and one wonders if it was as a result of writing this book. This is a very informative as well as long book. It describes much of the internal politics of Saudi Arabia. Since this was published in the early 1980s, it is a little dated."},{"Title":"How I Learned to Cook: And Other Writings on Complex Mother-Daughter Relationships","review":"Review by Summer Lopez for Small Spiral Notebook:When we are very little, we see our mothers only as we want to see them-all powerful and perfect. The older we get, the more we realize how untrue-and unfair-that perception is. How I Learned to Cook is a gripping look at the truth about mothers and daughters, and the matchless strength of the bonds we share. That is not to say it is a book full of heartwarming mother-daughter tales. The authors of these stories have reached deep into the vaults of their childhood memories, often exposing pain but always revealing the powerful affect of their mothers in their lives. As adults, they are able to look back and see their mothers as the very real and often very flawed women that they were and are. In some cases the scars of childhood are strong, and one can sense that the writer is still seeking answers and explanations, but in other stories there is an echo of love strengthened through time and understanding. None of these mothers is one-dimensionally caring or cruel, and this lovely and heartbreaking anthology is full of the explorations of this most complex of relationships.Perin points out in the Introduction that fear of betraying or demeaning the image of the mother or one's own mother has kept many women from telling the truth of the pain inflicted on them in childhood by women who were supposed to protect them from all things. How I Learned to Cook brings some such examples painfully to life. There is Ruth Kluger's mother who, upon arriving in Auschwitz-Birkenau, calmly suggests to Ruth that they go together and throw themselves against the electric fencing. Or Hillary Gamerow's, who tells her young daughter simply one night that she has put rat poison in the family's dinner, and that they will all die in their sleep. When that turns out not to be true, she says, \\"Well, you never know. I could do it anytime, right?\\" Then there is the mother in \\"The Body Geographic,\\" who watches with a gleam of satisfaction as her husband beats her daughter senseless. One cannot help but admire the bravery it must have taken for these women to tell their stories. They are kick-in-the-gut painful, to the point where it is often hard to believe they are real, but they are also gripping and written with lyricism touched with a grief that seeps through the pages.There are other stories here too; stories where societal expectations and other outside forces shape the nature of the relationship between mother and daughter. Nawal el Saadawi tells of being raised in Egypt, her mother's love separated from her by a veil that is both literal and figurative. In \\"Home is Where Your Stuff Is\\" Helen Ruggieri describes her mother's obsession with cleaning and maintaining the \\"stuff\\" in her house-her attention to the domestic space she can control seemingly overtaking her ability to focus on the people living within it. In \\"Anybody Could See It\\" Elizabeth Payne reflects on her father's infidelity to her mother and the way both women struggled to recover from that betrayal. \\"Domestic Silence\\" tells the story of Meena's attempts to rescue her unwilling mother from her abusive marriage, leaving her feeling that she has been the caretaker all along, rather than the other way around.The beauty of these stories is the authors' willingness to be honest, whether they are sharing the depth of love and respect they feel for the multi-faceted women that brought them into the world, or their deep-seated pain and anger at the betrayal of what we often view as the most natural of bonds. In most cases the truth lies somewhere between these two extremes, where real relationships exist in all their intricacies.* Odds are this book will make you appreciate your own mother (I felt compelled to call mine and thank her for being wonderful), but I should point out it's not exactly the ideal Mother's Day gift...stick with flowers and keep this one for yourself."},{"Title":"How I Learned to Cook: And Other Writings on Complex Mother-Daughter Relationships","review":"Anyone with a mother will love this book!

Sometimes Mom isn't loving or nice. Within the scope of these stories we see that our family is our first and most important community. Our young hearts, before they are broken, are wide open and expectant of love, however fragile our connection. Margo Perin has put together a collection of true stories by very talented and brave women who faced the truth of parental abuse and named it while offering healing, hope and love in the same breath."},{"Title":"How I Learned to Cook: And Other Writings on Complex Mother-Daughter Relationships","review":"No, the stories aren't all roses and puppy dogs--but they are realistic, and well-written.

I was most impressed by the heavy-hitters, like those listed above; but I was also pleasantly surprised to discover new talents, like Elizabeth Payne, whose mother isn't &quot;terrible&quot;, but only mysterious and dealing with the pain of a broken marriage.

The individual sections skitter and swoop over great realms of aesthetic, personal, and historical territory, and the tone ranges from hilarity to wistfulness. In the guise of a meditation on Gauguin's strange allegorical painting, Finnell offers an indescribable mixture of family history, dream vision, artistic rumination, and slanted autobiography--all turning on and returning to the questions posed by Gauguin's title: &quot;Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?&quot; These huge questions fairly beg for solemnity and bardic posturing, but Finnell addresses them with consummately sly and strange offhandedness.

Moreover, other irrelevant baggage is accrued by the many books on art or other endeavours who employ Zen in their titles as a marketing gimmick. This further complicates popular understandings as to what Zen either is or isn't.Therefore, it is appropriate that author Shunryu Suzuki targets the subject of \\"Mind Weeds,\\" from which I quote briefly:\\"That everything is included within your mind is the essence of mind. To experience this is to have religious feeling.\\" --p. 35 and also:\\"\\"Nothing outside yourself can cause any trouble. You yourself make the waves in your mind. If you leave your mind as it is, it will become calm. This mind is called big mind.\\"--35The reader will find himself captivated and excited by the author's insight and teaching, and will begin probably to see the world and self in an entirely different perspective."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"Though I have always had some interest in Zen meditation, it was reading Susan Blackmore's CONSCIOUSNESS that finally prompted me to examine it more closely. So many people who meditate seem to equate spirituality with total gullibility that I have been leery of its supposed benefits; and my mind is constantly so occupied with the repetition of immature fantasies and irritations that I do not meditate very well. Blackmore's description of meditation as \\"a weeding of the mind\\" struck me as exactly what I wanted. Blackmore, as a materialist, believes that consciousness has contingent rather than intrinsic existence, and she maintains that this was what Buddha taught. None of the Buddhists I have spoken to since reading her book agree with her.Since Zen masters apparently speak only in contradictions, it is hardly clear what Buddha's opinion was. Though S. Suzuki does not specifically describe the nature of consciousness, I am essentially certain that he would say something like: \\"Consciousness is not intrinsic and it is not contingent; consciousness is intrinsic and it is contingent.\\" It is very easy for any schnook to sound like an enlightened Zen master by simply claiming that opposite things are the same. \\"Love and hate are one thing. A foolish person is a wise person; a wise person is a foolish person. Emotionally we have many problems, but these problems are not actually problems. Happiness is sorrow; sorrow is happiness.\\" As Suzuki says, \\"This kind of experience is something beyond our thinking,\\" and \\"Our true nature is beyond our conscious experience.\\" I am inclined to try to make sense of this by relating it to quantum mechanics: an electron both is and is not a particle, and is and is not a wave. This is a fact that can be experimentally verified, yet is beyond conception. Presumably, if one is enlightened, these seeming contradictions will dissolve away.One problem is that only an infinitesimal number of people are enlightened, and since Buddha denies reincarnation, the effort of achieving such ephemeral enlightenment might strike one as pointless. \\"The goal of our life's effort is to reach Nirvana,\\" and then you die. Another problem is that \\"enlightenment\\" seems dependent upon the philosophy of the teacher. Disciples of Yogananda Paramahansa become one with God and escape the cycle of reincarnation when they achieve enlightenment. The Dali Lama, who is supposed to be the reincarnation of a previous Dali Lama, admits that he does not know if reincarnation actually happens. This is admirably honest of him, but we are left with the impression that \\"enlightened\\" masters are maybe just about as confused as we are.I initially became interested in Eastern religions after once briefly experiencing that the core of my being was Christ. Since I did not equate this \\"Christ-self\\" with the historical man who was Christ, I was just as inclined to think of the core of my being as Buddha. I do not know whether there is reincarnation or not, and I am essentially sure that my present personality will not survive death (I rather hope not!), but I doubt that my sense of \\"I\\" will cease to exist. I also am not convinced that our only purpose on Earth is to escape back into pure immutable consciousness, or into the nothingness of mere matter.Suzuki advises us to practice zazen with no preconceived ideas and with no anticipation of achieving enlightenment. This strikes me as sound advice."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"&quot;in the beginner's mind there are many possibilities; in the expert's mind there are few.&quot;indeed!I find that the negative reviews listed here are quite instructive and worth reading. It is worth realizing, for us westerners, that Buddhism has its sectarian squabbles over heresy and scripture just like any other religion. As well as its own organizational byzantine structure and inertia just like any other church.I can imagine that not a few devotees of Zen Mind Beginner's Mind have been dismayed at the disgust they were greeted with when naively and optimistically discussing Buddhism with some transplanted asian Theravadan monk. (ahem, or was that just me? :)That said, the book clearly comes from a deep place of understanding 'beyond the scriptures'. Though, to my mind, I find it complements them quite well, assuming one understands that Suzuki's concept of 'Big Mind' is quite literally heretical in the Theravadan sect. Personally, the biggest heresy in the book I find is in the 'God Giving' chapter - 'How can He [God] help their activity when He does not know who He is?'. Phew! Christians of all sects will vituperate over this heresy even more than Theravadans over 'Big Mind'.Yet, the need for the mutual awakening of God *and* us, in order for God to awaken *to* us, is an old Gnostic tradition, it seems. e.g. Read Kazantzakis' 'The Saviors of God' for more of this heresy. Or, Matthew Fox's translation of Eckhart in 'Breakthrough'.Meanwhile, it surely cant hurt to bone up on the suttas at, for example, accesstoinsight.org, even though Suzuki said 'it is not that important'. Since surely he *wasnt* saying *never* read the suttas!As always, take the Middle Way between the extremes!"},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"Get this book.

I tried this book on the recommendation of a friend. I had high hopes for it based on his recommendation, but I found it extremely disappointing. The first chapter really explains my major gripes with the book. In it he states that the most important part of Buddhism (not specifically Zen, Buddhism) is to meditate with a perfectly erect spine, and that this act of sitting with an erect spine is meditation, is Buddhism, and that there is no necessary mental component, no special breathing, nothing but sitting in this fashion.That's absurd. Its mindless formalism for the sake of formalism. Posture, while nice and helpful is not the point of meditation, and certainly not the point of Buddhism. I think he has an unhealthy attachment to the position of his body and the continuation of acts in accordance with his tradition.Otherwise, I have no problem with him."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"One of my first books on Zen.After reading dozens over the years since, I would throw this book out the window.That is if my house were on fire."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"Zazen is zazen, plain and simple.

Still it does show up the limitations of St Zen as practised in Japan, and still more when seeded overseas.St Zen leads to an open-ended model of practice. You sit for the sake of sitting, not to achieve anything. Your practice goes on and on like a meandering river, now swift and narrow, now broad and slow, and now troubled by rocks and rapids. Whatever happens in meditation you \\"let go\\" of it and start again tomorrow with a \\"beginner's mind\\".The notion of aiming at Enlightenment is anathema. That is Dualistic Thinking. Aren't Practice and Enlightenment one and the same?But read the Pali Canon. You'll find that hundreds of times the Buddha urges his listeners to work with all their strength to attain Enlightenment. Why the contradiction?From the highest standpoint, of course you can't attain Enlightenment: in Enlightenment there is no You, no Attainment. But this is a level of truth beyond most of us. No-one was ever nourished by pictures of food and no-one was ever enlightened by repeating words like \\"Nonduality\\" or \\"Must avoid Dualistic Thinking\\".Have you experienced a Nondual state, with self and world perceived as One? Or a state of pure Unity beyond time and space, without subject or object? Can you \\"drop off body and mind\\" like Dgen-Zenji or \\"dwell without thought-coverings\\" as in the Heart Sutra? If the answer is No, then saying that Practice and Enlightenment are one and the same is like someone stuck out in the snow and the freezing wind, miles from home, repeating, \\"My house is cosy and warm; my house is cosy and warm\\".Read the teachings of two Japanese St Ancestors: Dgen-Zenji's \\"Zazenshin\\" and Keizan-Zenji's \\"Zazen Yojinki\\". Both are findable online or in John Daido Loori's book \\"The Art of Just Sitting\\".Better still read the \\"Practice-Instructions\\" of Master Hung-chih in \\"Cultivating the Empty Field\\".

It is a powerful weapon, which helps people realize the ultimate reality."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"A great teacher of Christian prayer has described to me personally that \\"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind\\" is a \\"classic\\". Shunryu Suzuki would best describe his book as \\"nothing special\\".I never thought that this book would impact me as it has, but a combination of Jesus' own teaching on prayer(\\"Metanoiesete, for the Kingdom of God is within you\\"[Lk.17:21]); Saint Thomas Aquinas' ultimate confession:\\"Because we are not capable of knowing WHAT GOD IS but only what God is not...this is the ultimate in human knowledge of God: TO KNOW THAT WE DO NOT KNOW HIM\\"[Questiones Disputate de Potentia Dei,7,5 ad 14]; and Suzuki's conclusion \\"I discovered that it is necessary, absolutely necessary, to believe in NO THING.\\"(p.116) has brought me to the conclusion that EAST/WEST dialogue on contemplative prayer is the key to the future of Christianity and all other world religions in these desperate times.This book teaches prayer with the understanding that the only time we have is \\"NOW\\", and the only directive is \\"Don't think about it, don't write about it, do it! Now!--------------------------------------------------------------------It has been three years since I wrote the above review. Since that time, I have read a great number of books on Zen and on Contemplative Christianity and have come to believe that I am the blessed recipient of a genuine insight that the world so desperately needs to hear. It is that put on Jesus' lips as his keynote in the Gospel of Mark (The first and earliest gospel, ~65AD...Mk.1:16) where Jesus says:\\"The present moment is the right time, the Kingdom of God is within you. Change the way you think about reality; believe this 'good news'.\\"Zazen/Christian prayer can be done 24/7/365 anywhere, in any situation, and when it is, it is \\"ordinary\\", \\"interior\\" and \\"nothing special\\"."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"Mr. Suzuki says it himself: Zen is about practice and not about reading books. Zen can't be intellectually explained but it's an experience that needs to be lived. But since the huge majority of us don't have access to a Zen Master to guide us through the practice, knowledge has to come from somewhere. Enter \\"Zen Mind, Beginner's mind\\". The book is basically a compilation of talks given by Mr. Suzuki after meditation and it's compromised of simple statements regarding Zen. But don't misinterpret simple as lacking of depth. Just the opposite. This is a book to read maybe 1 or 2 pages at the time and put it aside to savor the wisdom of a Master. If you want to understand Zen, start practicing and read this book.Although the book does cover some basic meditation techniques, a more thorough guide can be found inThe Three Pillars of Zen: Teaching, Practice, and Enlightenmentby Philip Kapleau.

One's view of the book, perhaps, may say more about the reader than the book itself. The first time I read it, almost a decade ago, I read it intellectually, and enjoyed it as many of the 5 star reviewers do. The second time, a few years ago with some years of meditation under my belt, I agreed more with the critical reviews-- the book seemed shallow and full of pop-psychology.Now, on my third time, I am reading this as a part of formal Zen study. Suzuki Roshi's wisdom is bright and illuminating. Zen is not about reading, it is about practice, and until there is genuine practice, I'm afraid the doors to this book will be closed. A lot of what he says is subtle and makes sense only in the context of practice. But in that context, the energy in this book is direct and powerful. Make no mistake, Suzuki Roshi's Zen is authentic and his realizations are deep. The books is a series of smaller essays that allow one the ability to read slowly and reflect on what is written. If one hurries through the book as with a novel, one will miss out on its hidden treasures.Accordingly, I would recommend this book as a complement to Zen training, or to those curious about Zen training."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"This is a great book for someone who is interested in Zen practice to read.Even if you don't, it's good wisdom for your everyday life."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"Zen is mysterious and this book brings me the closest to unraveling that mystery.

What originally seemed weak and intellectually dull is in reality the best guide to Zen Buddhism I've read. It is an extremely rich source of wisdom that communicates at many levels.

The only shortcoming of the book, then, is what is lost in the process of transcribing-the tone of voice, the emphasis on a particular word or phrase, the demeanor of the speaker.

Do I?If you are just checking Buddhism out for the first time, this book is a perfect jumping off point to the sometimes confusing sect of Zen Buddhism.Suzuki Roshi was a true Zen master. His teaching and skills transcended the western mind set and allowed Zen Buddhism to be understood by the simplest of terms. In this book he covers breathing techniques, which even masters do daily. This book also covers mindfulness practice and the benefits of doing this every day. Written with the skills of a master but understandable by everyone this is one of the greatest treasures this book holds. Its not very long and can easily be read in a weekend. Its lessons can carry you through a lifetime. There are not many books that can do such a thing and do it so adeptly.For the every day practicioner you will not find a koan in this book. You cannot skip Dokusan by reading this. It is after all just a book. What you will find in here is a refreshing of attitude that many Zen Pro's get stuck in a rut. Its worth a first read through just for that.

But recognising dualism, even if not understanding it, provides a pathway forward. Regardless of the intellectual challenge, this book leaves one feeling optimistic and more serene, positive attributes of a 'Beginner's Mind'."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"Mr Suzuki's lectures are short, easy to read, & so seemingly simple at first tocause us to re-read them, & happily so. Christians will find nothing threatening here, & those seeking enlightenment will discover they've beenwalking past it their whole lives. Also has specific instructions on properposture & breathing for sitting & beginning meditation. But mostlywill surprise the reader by showing how that we can & should be enlightened, refreshed & heartened by activities, thoughts & routines that alreadyare part of our everyday lives, & take a closer look at our attitudes about seekingZen in the first place. Truly a book to make us think, smile, hug our Children & even have a good laugh at ourselves."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"Thoroughly satisfied with this Zen audio book. Narration is at a comfortable pace and enhances continuity. Content is exactly what I was looking for to complement my beginning experience with Zen. Good companion to Zen Flesh, Zen Bones."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"I've read this book a couple of times....the first time I had no idea what Roshi was talking about, but somehow I did. The second time around I had six months of Zen practice and the book took on a totally new meaning...although I still didn't quite get everything at great depth. I feel that each read will only deepen my understanding and lessen my ignorance. Great book."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"Outstanding book on Zen theory and a little on practicing meditation. Basically this is like having a chance to sit in on a Dharma talk with a revered Master of the Soto tradition. I have read it over and over. It's easy to read, straightforward, and continues to provide great advice after several years of practice. I gave my last copy away to a friend and bought the hardcover version for my own collection so it will hopefully last a lifetime. I would recommend it to anyone interested in Zen, whether you're just curious or are already a committed practitioner."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"So many people have spoken so well here of the experience of this book, I'm barely chagrined to have nothing new but honest praise for it. I've lived with, and tried to live, this book for years. Its pages are the clearest light, &amp; the cleanest water. It remains unspoiled, evergreen, &amp; always ready to hand you everything whole each time you encounter it. I remember Shunyru Suzuki in SF, even before Tassajara, years before I knew anything at all! I'm embarassed by the few buddhists writing reviews of 'heresy, heresy'... roshi is laughing at their passionate defence, even admiring it! Better, he'd say, simply look and see. That way you know that heresy never shines a light, then your attention can bear fruit. Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind may be the single most inevitable spiritual document of the last century. Its pages become lighter and more clean to the bone with each passing day. Read this book and find the REAL way to end war. Find out the REAL peace. It brings you right up to yourself. Once read, everything changes. It's like getting REAL eyes. Recommended with real heart!"},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"I cannot consider myself a beginner, much less a monk. Even so, I praise this book, knowning it was never intended to refute or confirm any dogmas of the Suttas. As far as I can see it is a collection of recordings from the master's talks. I feel very bad about these so-called Theravada monks bashing a book that doesn't say a word about their practice( maybe that's the problem). Theravada is budhism, strong and linear. So, why these guys infiltrate on a review list, intended to inform people mostly interested in Zen, with an attitude that is a mixture of dvaitin logic and christian fundamentalism? Is this the middle path? Don't you see you are driving many sincere practioners away from Theravada? Maybe you don't care."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"This is a collection of talks by one of the first Zen teachers in the U.S. If you're already practicing Zen, I highly recommend this book. If you're new to Zen, you might love this book or you might find it largely incomprehensible, or maybe both. Suzuki makes liberal use of the paradoxical language that is typical of Zen--e.g., \\"For us, complete perfection is not different from imperfection. The eternal exists because of non-eternal existence.\\" If you'd prefer a more ordinary, explanatory style, I recommend Charlotte Joko Beck's \\"Everyday Zen.\\" If you're looking for practical instruction in Zen meditation, you'll find it in \\"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind,\\" but you might prefer either Philip Kapleau's \\"The Three Pillars of Zen,\\" which includes more detailed instructions and illustrations of sitting postures, or Cheri Huber's instructional video \\"The Secret Is There Are No Secrets.\\"When I first read \\"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind,\\" for a college class on Buddhism, I wasn't quite sure what to make of it, but I did end up practicing Zen, and maybe this book had something to do with that. For many years, even while living at a Zen monastery, I suspected that a lot of the enthusiasm for this book was an \\"emperor's new clothes\\" phenomenon: a few respected people said it was wonderful, so then everybody said it was wonderful. I figured its aura of profundity was due in large part to Suzuki's congruence with our archetype of mountaintop gurus--the short sentences and limited English vocabulary, and the paradoxical language that sounds deep even though nobody actually knows what the heck it means. More recently, I've come to think that the emperor really does have clothes and that the big issues of human life are hard to talk about without paradox, and this is now one of my favorite Zen books."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"This book took me out of the maze of faith-based religion and for the first time I found a teacher and a philosophy with so much credibility I had the confidence to trust in the more esoteric aspects of a teaching that weren't initially obvious. Suzuki, and I assume Zen in general, has the wisdom and courage to acknowedge that there are things about our universe that we cannot comprehend and treat them as both beautiful and mysterious. This contrasts with faith-based religions which instruct us to accept notions of &quot;gods&quot; and elaborate tales for explanation and as such are a complete assault on and violation of the intellect. Zen outlook which does away with the largely western notions of right &amp; wrong, past and future, and states of lack will put one squarely in the present tense from moment to moment. It is utterly refreshing and healthy to look at the universe through glasses which are not colored by human desire and ego. Read this book, gain an understanding of yourself, an appreciation for the universe as a whole and piece of mind. Namaste"},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"Anyone interested in reading this book should not be dissuaded by the negative rantings of the &quot;humble monk&quot; and &quot;Dharma teacher&quot;, whose reviews appear to be from the same person. This book does not disappoint. I first read it over 25 years ago and I've fondly returned to it time and again since.This book is intended as a look at 'Zen Mind', mind at one with Tao. The term 'Beginner's Mind' refers to the goal of always keeping our original beginner's mind in our practice. To awaken to this mind, Suzuki encourages the practice of Zazen, for when we take the Zazen posture we are at once aligned with The Buddha and all of the Patriarchs, we perfectly express our own Buddha nature. The act of sitting itself is the actualization of Buddha Nature or Being. This IS the practice of Zen.Zen is a practice, not a religion and as thus can not be blasphemed in the way that the negative reviewer asserts. Religion is an attitude of devotion to something other than yourself which is regarded as worthy of supreme devotion. Zen Buddhism is not the worship of Buddha. Buddha taught the way to eliminate the cause of human suffering and conflict, the way to awakening. Zen is the means to that end.To the Dharma teacher and &quot;Zen monk&quot;, I quote Zen Master Dogen Zenji's Bendowa. &quot;You look on the meditation of the Buddhas and the supreme law as just sitting and doing nothing. You disparage Mahayana Buddhism. Your delusion is deep; you are like someone in the middle of the ocean crying out for water. Fortunately we are already sitting at ease in the self-joyous meditation of the Buddhas. Isn't this a great boon? What a pity that your true-eye remains shut - that your mind remains drunk. The world of the Buddhas eludes ordinary thinking and consciousness. It cannot be known by disbelief and inferior knowledge. To enter one must have right belief. The disbeliever, even if taught, has trouble grasping it.... Your only purpose in reading the sutras should be to learn thoroughly that the Buddha taught the rules of gradual and sudden training and that by practicing his teachings you can obtain enlightenment. You should not read the sutras merely to pretend to wisdom through vain intellections.... While you look at words and phrases, the path of your training remains dark....Constant repetition of the Nembutsu is also worthless - like a frog in a spring field croaking night and day....Understand only this: if enlightened Zen masters and their earnest disciples correctly transmit the supreme law of the seven Buddhas, its essence emerges, and it can be experienced. Those who merely study the letters of the sutras cannot know this. So put a stop to this doubt and delusion. Follow the teachings of a real master and, by zazen; attain to the self-joyous samadhi of the Buddhas.&quot;The Buddha himself said &quot;This is itself the Way to Awakening&quot;."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"I do not want to detract from this book's worth or wisdom in any way. No doubt the glowing reviews reflect the book's significance to the lives of those who have read and UNDERSTOOD it.My only caveat is that for complete novices--like myself--the title is misleading, and therefore the book's teachings were not very accessible to me. The term \\"beginner's mind,\\" as used in this work, refers to the idea of maintaining an open, childlike mind, and never acting or feeling as though one has ACHIEVED enlightenment. Be always searching, always growing.\\"Beginner's mind\\" should NOT be taken as an indication that this is a book for those like myself who are newcomers to the study of Zen (i.e. \\"beginners\\"). Maybe you're an \\"old soul,\\" but new to Zen, in which case, you may get more out of this book than I currently do.As someone who instinctively feels that Zen has something BIG to offer me if only I can understand what the hell the books on Zen are talking about, this is NOT a good introduction. Zen terminology is thrown around as though I already know what the terms mean. The description of poses (without benefit of pictures) is confusing, and I must admit that I [shallowly?] found myself ticked off: if I couldn't figure out a stinking pose (or even get BEYOND the fact that I couldn't figure it out), how on earth was I \\"deep enough\\" to get my foot on the path to enlightenment?For anyone who, like myself, needs something a little more concrete to get me started, something I can sink my literal Western teeth into, this ain't the book! I believe I personally need something a little less esoteric to start with, a book that bridges the gap between my VERY literal-minded Western upbringing and the much LESS literal mindset required of adherents of eastern religion/philosophy.I also believe that if I am able to bridge that gap (using other resources), THEN I will be able to appreciate this book's teachings and will certainly come back to it."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"ZEN MIND, BEGINNER'S MIND : Informal talks on Zen Meditation and practice by Shunryu Suzuki. Edited by Trudy Dixon, with a Preface by Huston Smith and an Introduction by Richard Baker. 138 pp. New York and Tokyo : Weatherhill, 1970 and Reprinted.Some years ago I undertook a fairly extensive program of reading in Indian, Chinese, and Japanese Buddhism and in Zen. Most of my Zen books have since disappeared. Only the choicest remain, among which is Shunryu Suzuki's 'Zen Mind Beginner's Mind.'Buddhism may be said to have begun with the enlightement of the Buddha. Many centuries later, however, when Buddhism entered China, an incredibly elaborate and complex superstructure of Indian scholastic thought had grown up around the Buddha's original insight. The Chinese, with their basically down-to-earth and common sense attitude, had little use for Indian over-elaboration and set about ridding Buddhism of it.The Chinese, as Lin Yutang says, believe in a reasonable use of reason, and not in reason's excesses. The end product of their effort to rid Buddhist thought of its heavy freight of scholasticism, and to shift the emphasis from theory back to the practical by centering Buddhism once again in the enlightenment experience, became what the Chinese know as Ch'an and the Japanese as Zen.As Shunryu Suzuki himself pointed out, when freed of unnecessary theory and speculation, Buddhism as Zen becomes something that is basically &quot;quite simple&quot; (page 64). Its essence was brilliantly captured in the thirty-one verses of Third Patriarch Seng-ts'an's 'Hsin-hsin-ming,' the very first Zen treatise in verse. This is a beautiful text that deserves to be far better known, and an easily accessible translation will be found in D. T. Suzuki's 'Manual of Zen Budhism' ('On Believing in Mind,' pages 76-82).The first verse of the original Chinese may be read as follows, with oblique marks to indicate line breaks:&quot;To realize the Way is not difficult / If you'd only stop choosing; / Just let go of all of your hate, and love, / And everything will be brilliantly clear&quot; (my transl).This statement may gain in meaning if we set it alongside an observation made by the great Zen Master Dogen (1200-1253), founder of the Japanese Soto sect of Zen Buddhism and one of the most brilliant philosophical minds Buddhism has ever produced, who wrote in 'Genjo Koan,' the third chapter of his 'Shobogenzo' :&quot;Conveying the self to the myriad things to authenticate them is delusion; the myriad things advancing to authenticate the self is enlightenment&quot; (Tr., F. H. Cook, 'Sounds of Valley Streams,' page 66).Suzuki Shunryu, who as a member of the Soto school was a direct spiritual descendant of Dogen, would certainly have understood this. In fact, so far as I can see, the idea expressed by both Seng-ts'an and Dogen Zenji is at the very center of his book.'Zen Mind Beginner's Mind' is a golden book that may be heartily recommended to all open-minded readers. In it they will find a Buddhism freed of all scholastic superfluities and unnecessary elaboration, and one that returns us to what the Buddha was really about."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"I luckily stumbled onto this little treasure while reading basketball coach phil jackson's &quot;sacred hoops.&quot; in that book, jackson repeatedly referred to the teachings of zen master suzuki's teachings in this book. never could i have imagined that a book on sports could lead to such a dramatic, profound and truly life changing experience as i found when reading &quot;zen mind, beginner's mind.&quot;whereas faith based religions are a complete assualt on the intellect when providing answers to the secrets of the universe that are not known to us, suzuki instructs us to respect such things as both &quot;mysterious and beautiful.&quot; important and fundamental concepts such as &quot;non-attachment&quot; that can be difficult to grasp are succinctly communicated in reminders such as &quot;a weed grows even though we hate it, and a flower falls even though we love it.&quot; zen mind will place your focus squarely in the present and allow to rid yourself of state depriving emotions once you learn to let go of any &quot;gaining&quot; notions. you'll find focus and calm in all situations.

To a westerner conditioned to experience one's perceptions through the filter of the mind, it was near incomprehensible at the time and it was only many years later, as I began to establish my sitting practice, that I was able to read Suzuki-Roshi's talks with benefit.This book will probably make little sense to you if you do not practice zazen. If you are looking for an intellectual exposition of Buddhist thought, there are many other books that will better suit your purpose.If you are looking for a how-to method for sitting practice, this book is also probably not the best place to start.However, if you are looking for encouragement with your sitting practice, this book is what you are looking for. Suzuki-Roshi's gentle words will nudge you back onto the cushions and help you feel that there is some sense in what you are doing. His compassion shines through on every page."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"Whenever I've read books in the past, one of the things I've looked for has been intellectual satisfaction. In fact, it has almost been a necessity in order for me to appreciate a particular book. Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind offered me little, if any, intellectual satisfaction and yet, I treasure it as one of the greatest books I've ever read. This book (or Buddhism for that matter) is not about intellectual, moral or even spiritual satisfaction. The practice presented in the book is a very matter-of-fact journey into yourself and your true nature.If you are new to Buddhism however, I would not recommend this book as a starting point. I first picked up this book four years ago out of my curiosity for Zen Buddhism, found it to be really abstract and incomprehensible and it collected dust on my bookshelf for years. Last year, I decided to re-introduce myself to what Buddha taught through Steve Hagen's Buddhism Plain and Simple, and simultaneously started practicing at a local Zen center. I have since read Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind a couple of times and found it to be wisdom beyond wisdom. If you want to live each moment of your life fully, this book will undoubtedly be an invaluable tool."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"I've reread this book cover-to-cover three times and referred to it countless others. Every rereading turns up wisdom I'd missed on the previous go rounds--because I wasn't ready to really hear it. It's this layered wisdom which makes Shunryu Suzuki's book one of the greatest spiritual books of the century (a small, informal survey of writers and &quot;thinkers&quot; in a recent issue of Shambala Sun found Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind as the most cited &quot;Best Spiritual Book of the Century.&quot;) Keep this classic by your bedside and read a couple pages when you wake up each morning."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"Zen Master Suzuki gives the most lucid exposition on practicing zen ever put on paper. The teachings are not watered down, sugar coated, or given false pretenses as the absolute truth. The chapter on meditation exemplifies all these qualities. To Suzuki, just the act of sitting zazen is meditation itself and as a consequence, enlightenment. No mention of mystical visions, long processes of clearing the mind and becoming &quot;one with the universe&quot; - his only instruction is to perceive simple reality. As a long time meditator, I have found Zen Master Suzuki's approach much more honest and fruitful than any of the methods that use various mediums(i.e. imagery, sounds) to facilitate meditation. The rest of the book constantly reaffirms this simple yet profound concept. Anyone interested in Zen Buddhism, out of spiritual or intellectual curiosity, should start here."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"When I began on the Zen path in the 1980's I read several books all of which helped some . Like a lot of people I preferred the more dramatic ones like Zen in the Art of Archery, The Method of Zen etc.. and they did sustain my interest but two books which I came to and began to read over and over were the Tao Te Ching and Zen Mind. And I believe the reason is that they resonated with my zazen practice. They seemed most like the actual event of sitting itself. In the chapter entitled Nothing Special Suzuki begins by saying \\" I do not feel like speaking after zazen. I feel the practice of zazen is enough...strictly speaking, for a human being there is no other practice than this practice. There is no other way of life than this way of life. Zen practice is the direct expression of our true nature.\\"If Zen verbal teachings are at their best just fingers pointing at the moon then the best teachings are those which most directly resemble the non-verbal ones and these words come close to doing just that. They are imbued with the highly elusive wisdom the Zen path conveys and are steeped in that wisdom.

Einstein, I believe, said that if you can't explain something simply, you do not understand it well enough. I get the full import of his statement having read this book. I do not understand it though it is easy enough to follow. Quite a few ideas are rather esoteric & I do not think it is possible for me to understand the symbolism in the way Shunryu Suzuki articulates them. Trying to understand them itself may not be the right approach anyway. I do not know.What I did understand however, in spite of myself, is that whether you understand or not is really immaterial. What is important is that you practice the ways of zen living. What these ways are, & how to practice them right is very well articulated in the book. This practice is based on a set of core ideas - which, like I said, were difficult for me to digest fully. But you can look not to digest, but simply to believe that Buddha is you & you are enlightened, & keep practicing for seeing things as they are, for awareness of transience, & having a peripheral vision.It's a hard book to read - & I would not recommend this for light reading - probably meant for zen enthusiasts.@souvikstweets"},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"May this book also inspire you to:Practise mindfulness and awarenessMake mind, body and spirit oneAcknowledge adversity, adapt, act from the heartTranscend dualityBe aware of nature, flow with the TaoStrive for non-attachmentBe natural, be at easeExperience life, loveBe creative!Look within, open your intuitionTruth is beyond reason, understood through your direct experience.See with fresh eyes, always the beginner's mindEach moment, live fully."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"I read this book some 15 years ago, and there are still passages in it that haunt me, especially the amazing section &quot;Nirvana.

Shunryu Suzuki outlines with crisp clarity the fundamental beliefs and practices that underlie Soto Zen. &quot;Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind&quot; is a collected edition of his talks which strike closest to the heart of the Soto school of the modern day. I found this book relevatory as a beginning practitioner of Zen.For beginners, I also recommend &quot;Zen in the American Grain,&quot; by Kyogen Carlson. It's especially useful for those trying to reconcile Western culture with Zen practice.As a previous reviewer has noted, &quot;Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind&quot; is not intended as an introduction to &quot;Buddhism&quot; -- it seems to me that there are in fact far too many Buddhisms for such a book to be written."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"This book is an excellent primer for developing Zen Meditation.

These talks were collated and edited by his students who organized these Zen pep talks in to Right Practice, Attitude, and Understanding. They flow, summed up in epigraphs and pithy examples that open up into profundity. As with the Zen message itself, deceptively simple on its surface.This can be, as Amazon reviewers have cautioned, not the best book for absolute beginners. I liked David Fontana's \\"Discover Zen\\" and read that and pondered its contents for a few months before tackling Suzuki's classic. This will not give you a true primer for Zen; it's a guide for those already \\"sitting\\"-- that's the audience for the talks edited here. You can find out about Suzuki's life and career in David Chadwick's \\"Crooked Cucumber\\" (I recently reviewed Fontana and Chadwick); the contents of \\"ZMBM\\" strive for a sense of what a master might advise for his followers, but the aim's always to get beyond teacher-student dualities, and all barriers between you and the teaching. So easy to compress, yet it expands into infinity and nothingness from the brief chapters compiled within a few elegantly designed pages.No inspirational fluff, this can be demanding, no-nonsense, and sobering. Basically, \\"just sit.\\" Eat when you should eat, work when it's time to work, sleep the same-- and practice meditation regularly. Stay disciplined but free from habit; composed yet able to stand up for righteousness; detach from the world but marvel at it.It's often moving. \\"When we hear the sound of the pine trees on a windy day, perhaps the wind is just blowing, and the pine tree is just standing in the wind. That is all they are doing. But the people who listen to the wind in the tree will write a poem, or will feel something unusual. That is, I think, the way everything is.\\" (88) This gives a flavor of the calm tone and steady pace of these reflections from the Japanese-born founder of the San Francisco and Tassajara Zen Centers, responsible for the great 1960s expansion of Soto Zen into America. Anyone will find here wisdom, common sense, and the same peace that must have permeated the \\"zazen\\" sessions that inspired this book."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"This is a delightfully informal book. It flows as a series of loosely woven themes - transcripts of Suzuki Roshi's Dharma talks. He encourages his students in their practice and discusses Zen in simple and direct language - pointing to the luminous nature of their ordinary lives. The talks are divided into three larger sections that correspond to the body, emotion, and mind aspects of Zen meditation. No talk is longer than three pages, which makes it an excellent book to read before or after practice.This book has immense significance for anyone who practices silent sitting. It is informal - as the nature of mind is informal. It is simple in the way that a thunderstorm is simple. \`Beginner's mind' is a phrase that Suzuki Roshi knew from the work of Dogen Zenji, founder of the Soto school of Zen. It is essential to Zen and also to Dzogchen sem-d&eacute; as taught in Aro. In the Prologue, Suzuki Roshi says:\\"Our \`original mind' includes everything within itself. It is always rich and sufficient within itself... In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities; in the expert's mind there are few.\\"This is the essence of silent sitting, and Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind presents this essence in a variety of displays.

It struck me as a little banal at the time, although I appreciated it's down-to-earth wisdom. I now listen to it on my I-Pod fairly regularly. It's a brilliant diamond, a rightful classic, quintessential Zen literature. It doesn't seem to please the Orthodox Buddhist crowd, as it diverges from the original set of teachings. But it gets to the \\"Marrow of Zen\\" very well. This book instructs a would-be Zazen practitioner how to live a noble life, a Zen life, in a no-nonsense and simple and profound manner."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"I first read this book years ago, as a complete novice on the spiritual path. While there was a lot I didn't understand, I appreciated Shunryu Suzuki's quiet wisdom, gentle humor, and clear and simple meditation instructions. Every few years I find myself revisiting it, and every time I get more out of it.Zen is simple, counterintuitive, and profound. In another work, Suzuki says \\"just to be alive is enough,\\" and that pretty much sums it up. We spend so much of our lives wanting things to be different instead of just appeciating life as it is. Roshi's words consistently bring us back to that critical point.While there are a lot of books that talk about the importance of being in the moment (The Power of Now comes to mind), this one is the one that I always seem to pull off the shelf."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"I first got this book in the 80's along with Journey Of Awakening and was looking for peace, seeking, learning.I have had and given away many copies, this 40th anniversary edition I am going to keep.Dr Jess Lair, Ram Dass and Shunryu Suzuki are responsible for the person I am today.Thank You"},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"I often recommend this book to people interested in learning about Zen.

The book is thoroughly enlightening. I'm not planning on conversion, but there are many good thoughts."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"\\"You may think that if there is no purpose or no goal in our practice, we will not know what to do. But there is a way. The way to practice without having any goal is to limit your activity, or to be concentrated on what you are doing in this moment.\\"I think this quote epitomizes the message of the this book. Shunryu's approach to explaining Zen not only to groups of Americans in the 60's, but even today, was simple and like a pond that is motionless, clear as clear can be.He came to the US to mind Soko-ji, a temple located in San Francisco. He was a bit put off by the fact the Zen that had been taught was diluted. He was excited though to see and hear all that was going on and believed that teaching Americans could help revolutionize Zen teachings. He went on to found the San Fransisco Zen Center, and left Soko-ji disappointed with the way Zen was being taught by mainly Japanese immigrants. He believed that the students he was gaining, mainly Caucasian hippies, were more serious about the core practices.I do not know, nor do I have any excuse, for why it took me so long to read this book. \\"Zen Mind, Beginners Mind\\" is hands down one of the most important books in Buddhism. It is a compilation of various talks he did.Although it is simple, and seems stripped down, it took me a bit to read as I truly wanted to immerse myself in every page. Shunryu's style is one that is polished, and understandable. If these words are truly the words he spoke and taught, it's no wonder we have some many wonderful teachers coming from San Fransisco Zen Center.I recently met someone who had practiced at SFZC and I sat with him a bit to go over some things. From that conversation my practice has taken on a whole new direction. If it has anything to do with what was learned at SFZC than I am grateful.One of my favorite quotes of the book is, \\"The basic teaching of Buddhism is the teaching of transiency, or change. That everything changes is the basic truth for each existence. No one can deny this truth, and all the teaching of Buddhism is condensed within it.\\"If for some reason it's taken you as long to read this as it took me, than I recommend you make this your next Dharma book to read. I look forward to referring back to this time and time again."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"This book is, in fact, probably the very best introduction to Zen Buddhism for Americans. It is short, informal, yet well written. Shunryu Suzuki, the author of this book, is not of the same school of Zen as D.T. Suzuki, who wrote many more books and is probably better known. Shunryu was of the Soto school of Zen, while D.T. belonged to the Rinzai school.To the beginner, the differences might seem small. Both schools practice sitting meditation, called zazen. But Rinzai puts more emphasis on the experience of Satori, which I will not explain here (and is hardly explainable, anyhow). Soto Zen, and Shunryu in this book, emphasizes just sitting and practicing zazen. He does not dwell on Satori, in fact, I don't even think he mentions it.In any event, I highly recommend this book as an introduction to Zen. Shunryu tells you about real Soto Zen practice -- not history, or theoretical concepts. It can be read in an evening, and can be re-read for years.You can later proceed to other books on Zen; by D.T. Suzuki, Philip Kapleau, Christmas Humphreys, or others, including John C. H. Wu. Thich Nhat Hanh is very popular too, and has written many books. He is Vietnamese, while both of the Suzukis were Japanese. I believe that Nhat Hanh is of the Soto school, but I could be wrong. Certainly other authors are worthy, but the reader should be careful until you are more familiar with the basics of Zen. (Beware especially of the shallow, even flippant, Zen books which often begin with the words \\"Zen and the Art of...\\" They have little value.) Just remember that Zen Buddism has two main schools: Soto and Rinzai. Also, Zen is a special form of Buddhism -- kind of like Quakers being a special form of Christianity -- and is not necessarily representative of Buddishm as a whole.Zen was heavily influenced by Taoism. So if you really want to go deeper, consider getting a translation of the Tao Te Ching -- I highly recommend the version by Stephen Addiss and Stanley Lombardo, but the translation by John C. H. Wu is good and very popular, plus he is Chinese by birth. Stephen Mitchell's version is very popular and accessible to modern Americans.Finally, both Shunryu Suzuki and D.T. Suzuki definitely agree on one thing; Zen is understood through practice, not through books or ideas. Zen is not a philosophy. If you really want to understand Zen, then you will need to find a Zendo (meditation center or temple) and a teacher. And meditate!"},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"This is the best book I have found on the practice and the mind of Zen. It is easy to read. Each talk is about 2 pages. I have probably read it over 50 times throughout the years and have given many copies away. This is the book to help you practice, not a philosophical or analytical discourse."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"The book is aimed at explaining the basics of ZAZEN (ZEN Meditation), both on the practical side: how to sit and how to meditate, as well as the basic philosophical side: to always have an 'empty' mind i.e to be able to easily fill it because a full mind cannot accept new things. It also pinpoints the relation of ZEN to everyday life, and how ZEN is nothing more than fully living (not having a wandering mind) what you are doing, no matter what you are doing.Recommended to have a broad understanding of ZEN and ZAZEN, because it explains in a plain and straight forward way, unlike many other books or texts, what is actually ZEN and ZAZEN.

Reading this book helpped me understanding my ignorance. I cannot claim I now know Zen since that would defeat the author's goal of teaching \\"Beginner's Mind\\". Learning is a continuos process so Zen is a practice, not an end to understanding a subject.

A great book to go back repeatedly."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"Again, I'll make this review very quick. A great book, although sometimes comfusing with apparently paradoxical language (which is fairly commen in zen buddhism). That aside, this book can be very helpful for beginner as well as long-practicing buddhists.

This is good book but I give it only three stars to demonstrate that unlike many other reviewers I don't have \\"some kind of excitement\\" about the words in this book and don't focus on it and rave about it as if it is some kind of a Bible.

This book has obviously helped a lot of people. But - hasn't anyone twigged the fact that isolated things in it are simply nuts. What !!! Heresy !!!What do I mean? Well, its simple. Shunryu Suzuki condoned suicide in this book, citing the example of Sen-no-Rikyu's suicide as an example of Buddhist 'acceptance.' Maybe the offending passage has been removed since the first ed. Don't know, haven't checked reprints. Suzuki didn't even provide the background details,which concerned Hideyoshi ORDERING Sen-no-Rikyu to commit seppuku (ritual suicide)- because of various suspicions. Hideyoshi had felt 'up-staged' when the tea master had his own statue erected over the gate at Daitokuji. Secondly, Hideyoshi had confided many things to the tea-master. Fearing this might endanger his position of authority (Sen-no-Rikyu evidently shared 'confidences' with other people), Hideyoshi decided to play it safe - and exercised his power, ordering the tea-master to kill himself.This - very briefly, is the background to the story.It has NOTHING to do with Zen, and everything to do with feudal POWER in Japan. It is about unquestioning OBEDIENCE, the invisible steel wires that regulated old Japan. The kind of 'acceptance' found in Buddhism - has nothing to do with such controls. Put in a modern context, it is like a wacky dialogue between a company boss and employee:Boss: \\"Listen Jones, I'm not happy with your performancethis past year or so. I order you to jump out offthe window on the 73rd floor. \\"Jones: \\"Yes, boss . . .aaaaaaahhhhhhh. \\"Get real! Would any of you take such orders, or see sense in that kind of 'acceptance'? Why, then, is it so palatable, because it is conveyed by a Japanese Buddhist teacher?A final point. I didn't write the book, or invent Japanese history. I am merely pointing out the problem."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"This book is a must have for anyone looking to better understand the Zen philosophy or gain introspective on themselves.

I found it to be one of the most accessible works on Zen Buddhism and Zen-inspired meditation techniques I've read (and I've read plenty, by both Eastern and Western writers). The late Suzuki had a real gift for making Zen accessible to Westerners, as evidenced by his extensive use of anecdote and analogy to put across some of the more esoteric aspects of the philosophy.

It came promptly and was in good shape. It is for a class my son is taking and is a required read."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"So many books have been written about Zen, and so many reviewers have waxed prolific on the values of Zen, I'll not waste my time doing that myself. Suffice to say that this particular book was never intended by Shunryu Suzuki to be a book, and as such, it's probably close to the perfect book for anyone wishing to delve into the awareness of mind that Zen represents. This book could easily represent the spearhead of the invasion of the western world by a unique, eastern thought process. It is also the comfortable image of warm wood and wisdom at your door.At first, when I touched on &quot;Right Practice&quot;, I was disappointed. For my interpretation of Zen requires no practice. It's not about practice. And yet, I understand after reading what Master Suzuki was getting at. In order to break the back of your old practices that lead to the busy, reactive world, you need other mechanisms. They could be anything, so long as they lead down the path of self-awareness and balance.He says it: chanting and meditation will not get you there. Yet I suspect that &quot;practice&quot; will always get more publicity than the intended result. In this capitalistic age, meditation classes sell, but having a Zen state of mind is totally antipodal to making money.Still, reading this book cannot hurt. Perhaps in your case, thought will not become thoughtless stone..."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"It sounds good, with the fly printed on the page and the condescending rhetoric that passed for wisdom at the SFZC.What Zen masters of this lineage teach nowadays is nothing valuable.

There are no real masters in the USA for certain, where they all look up and bow down to Shunryu Suzuki, who came out (in THIS book) and admitted he had never had satori, and whose lineage was a matter of ritual and hand-me-down heritage.Or the followers of Trungpa, a drunk who appointed as his successor an HIV-positive predator who knowingly infected his own students with AIDS.

I am amazed at the high praise it receives in these reviews, and I can appreciate some of what the naysayers point out, Sutra study (Mahayana or Theravada) isn't part of the picture here. I wouldn't recommend the Sutras for those new to Zen, but I would expect that what's presented in a book on Zen would have its roots, in some fashion or other, in the Mahayana, whether zazen is emphasized or not. Consequently, I would recommend THE WAY OF ZEN, by Alan Watts, which is a lot more informative and, more importantly, a lot more fun! Yes, I said the F word and if you've read all the reviews here, as I have, you will notice they are rather serious and that alone makes you wonder. (The Watts book is always available 'used' and can also be found in most libraries.) Take Care.UPDATE: Finally managed to read this book. (How can one avoid it with all the hype surrounding this book & this Master?) Well, I can now say Little Suzuki does try to hitch his wagon to the Mahayana, but with nothing other than cliches. In every instance where he mentions either the Sutras or Zen Masters he follows it with the most insipid comments imaginable. Here's an example from the text (you be the judge):\\"This sutra [Prajna Paramita Sutra] says, 'Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara observes that everything is emptiness, thus he forsakes all suffering.' It was not AFTER he realized this truth that he overcame suffering --to realize this fact is itself to be relieved from suffering. So realization of the truth is salvation itself. We say 'to realize,' but the realization of the truth is always near at hand. It is not after we practice zazen that we realize the truth; even before we practice zazen, realization is there. It is not after we understand the truth that we attain enlightenment. To realize the truth is to live--to exist here and now.\\" (pg. 113, 7th printing 1973.)Every mention is followed by this type of cheerleading passed off as 'insight'. Just look at the each chapter heading and the accompanying quote.'It is wisdom which is seeking for wisdom.'Now, that's impressive. There's more. How about:'The point we emphasize is strong confidence in our original nature.'Or:'When you become you, Zen becomes Zen. When you are you, you see things as they are, and you become one with your surroundings'.Management seminar talk applied to Zen? Richard Baker may have been impressed by such nonsense, but its clear that he and 'the Emperor have no clothes.'No stars. Worst book ever on Zen. This is nothing more than a shallow attempt to make sitting meditation the be all and end all of Buddhism (just to 'keep things simple,') 'Zen Center' Buddhism. Since this book is considered 'a classic of American Buddhism' you'll probably end up, like me, feeling you probably should read it. Well, at least, check it out of the library before you waste hard earned money.If you want to avoid the 'intellectual and religious stuff' better to return to your study with the poetry of Cold Mountain or even Mary Oliver! Sands of the Ganges, read the Tang Dynasty Masters, better to struggle with them than be coddled by these guys!

If this is the best way that Zen can be explained then I'm not embarrased to say I don't get it, don't think I'll ever get it, and don't care anymore (or wait...does that mean that I actually do get it?).

I'd heard a lot of people talk about Zen and how it's in part an atheistic philosophy amoung other things and being an atheist I'd been meaning to look into it for some time now. This book was my first real close look at Zen. On page 65 there's a chapter titled 'God Giving' which talks about 'God' in the way that I've heard Christains, Jews, and Muslims talk about 'God' as really existing, as the 'creator of everything', etc., etc.,. Up till that point I was really into the book but after I finished reading that chapter I decided to discard the book. I'm one of those atheists who is searching for the truth, whatever that might be. I'm certain that there is no proof or evidence to warrant belief in the supernatural, but I'm not opposed to the idea, I just refuse to believe in something that could very likely not exist.I've read that 'god(s)' don't play any real role in Buddhism, so why bring them up. If you took out the supernatural talk, then this book might be more appealing to theist and nontheist alike. If you're an atheist looking to Zen because of it's reputation for being atheistic then this book will probably disappoint you. It did me. If you're able to overlook the parts you don't agree with, I'm sure you could find valuable wisdom here.

But you'll just be clouding your head more than it already is when the whole point is to remove the clouds that are already there."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"Transcripted and edited by Trudy Dixon and Richard Baker, Zen Mind is as near as you will get to the ideas of this remarkable man. &quot;Crooked Cucumber&quot; is a biography of Suzuki and a wonderful intro to Zen Mind."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"This book has brought me to a greater understaing of Zen. Anyone who has interest in Zen, I think, should definately start off by reading this book. It gives you most of the basics that you need to understand the actual meaning of Zen. So far, one of the best that I have read!"},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"have been reading on zen for years,but nt tiil this book that l started to do zazen."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"A classic! A very well spoken audio cassette to present one of the great books on Zen in a classic way. This is a great treasure and to hear this is a reaffirmation of the author's tremendous knowledge of the subect. Easy enough to understand. !!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"As the other reviews indicate, with this book, you either get it, or you don't. Suzuki Roshi's teaching here is simple, and direct. The author's wisdom lives and breathes in every word. If you're looking for something cut and dried, you won't find it here.I've read this book many times over the years, and every time I read it, it's like learning about Buddhism for the first time all over again. If you want to meditate, you'll never need another book besides this one."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"With just a few words, Suzuki Roshi fills one's heart with the desire to be alive now...to awaken to the possiblities of all things...to awaken to the present moment without pretense, without ambition. His explaination of the way of Zen meditation makes one feel that enlightened awareness is possible right now."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"This book is a find, for all those who are seeking spiritual cleansing. It is simplicity at it's best, and that is what makes it beautiful"},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"A simple, well-written text on Zen practice. Read it again and again. Pass it around. Great."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"I recently found a used copy of this book published in 1974. I had heard of it but had never seen it. I have decided to give it as a gift to friends as a means for them to understand me better. This book challenges your self image and refocuses us on the faithfullness of regular practice. It is clear that much lies hidden in the text of this gem. Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"This is the clearest, most coherent book I've yet found on the subject. Although the zen master hails from Japan, his later years were spent in the U.S. - the product is a clear translation of the zen practice with most of its subtleties intact. The style is an informal conversational one covering zen meditation and practice.It was required reading when I studied Eastern Philosophy back in 1989, and I haven't stopped reading it since.Louis Cornel"},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"There are so many great reviews for this book already so I'll keep this brief, saying that I hardly ever review products, but this is much more than that. The wisdom in this book has had a profound and beneficial impact on my life which can not be tagged with a dollar price. I have already recommended it to others, and it has affected those who I've lent my copy to in a similar way. Yes, there are some words which I did not know, I'm not a Buddhist, nor was I familiar with certain terms, but it wasn't necessary to know them. The applications of this form of thought, or living, are vast, and simplistic. So sit. Just sit. Or don't."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"No praise is sufficient to what Suzuki Roshi accomplished in his life, and in this book. It is the kind of book that becomes a part of your life: you carry it around, you read it again and again, scribbling in its margins, writing down some of the stories so you can tell them to others, and marveling always at the graceful humility of this extraordinary man's expression. Like Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching, this book is fit for any audience and any religious or professional orientation: it works as well for the general or the businessperson as it does for the Zen student or the spiritual seeker. It is everything that Zen was, should, and could still be: small, modest, inexpensive, and unfathomably rich in the simplicity and directness of its expression."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"Shunryu Suzuki's book has become a Zen classic in North America. I think this is in part because the book is quite accessible at first reading, and, then, later, you can reread a chapter and get much more out of it. For example, if the atheist who stopped reading at the chapter God Giving were to re-read the chapter, he would see something new. Suzuki uses &quot;God&quot; as a means of relating to his audience, mainly Christian Americans of the 1960s. His point is about the non-duality of person and &quot;God.&quot; Then, again, if I re-re-read the chapter I'd realize that . . . This is a simple and profound book."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"As a student of comparative mysticism and practitioner of meditation for more than 20 years, I can say this book captures Zen for the modern reader much better than ancient scriptures. It is pure and unburdened by confusing and unecessary dogmas, and the knowledge is from Suzuki's direct Realization of That which is always-already present. It needs no further validation and will provide a useful tool for those seeking ultimate Truth."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"And I'm still reading it. It's like a different book every time I pick it up. Like most Buddhist teachings, you might notice more and more refined subtlety as you go along. Along side it, I've also been sitting every day. I recommend the book...(well, and sitting for that matter...) Not just to folks curious about Zen but to anybody who is curious at all."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"When I first read this book years ago as a Christian I really did not understand it. It really seemed like foolishness to me and incomprehensible. But after coming back to it as a Buddhist having studied Buddhism for a year, I now understand. This is a truly ZEN book attempting to explain in English how to have a mind that exists by experiencing the current moment as it is without filtering reality first through past experiences and preconceived beliefs. A thing or a circumstance is simply as it is with judgement held back. That is the summarized teaching of this book. This is an excellent book if you are ready for it. If you are a beginner it may be better to look at the writings of Bhante Gunaratana or Bhikku Bodhi these authors prepared me to understand the more advanced Zen teachings of this book."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"\\"The points we emphasize are not the stage we attain, but the strong confidence we have in our original nature and the sincerity of our practice\\" Reading over 20 books on Zen I can confidently write that Beginners Mind is unique among modern Zen literature in that it gives the reader the \\"sense of Zen\\". Unlike other books by D.T. Suzuki or Alan Watts, both of which are very profound writers that write in a more intellectual and formal manner Shunryu is more humane. This is not the best book to start with, a better first step could be Alan Watts \\"The way of Zen\\" or D.T. Suzuki's \\"An Introduction to Zen Buddhism\\" but after a basic understanding of Zen is acquired this book will uniquely supplement it."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"Weather you don't know anything about Zen or have been practicing for twenty years, &quot;Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind&quot; will always give you something new. Out of all the Zen books I own, this is the one I am constantly going back to and re-reading. For many American Zen students, this is the book that started it all. &quot;Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind&quot; is a collection of lectures given by Shrunryu Suzuki given to his students in Los Atlos, CA. They deal with the fundamentals of practice in the Soto Zen tradition started by Dogen in Japan. However it would be wrong to limit this book to just a tradition. I believe no matter what your beliefs or practices are, this book and the practice of zazen can help you. Suzuki emphasises strongly on practice which in Zen, its easy to get carried away with false ideas and I think that is what makes this book so helpful with my practice. So pick up this book and a Zafu and take the lotus position and be prepared to be changed forever."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"I have been through a lot in my life and was ready to give up. My brother gave this book to me and I read it one night after I had a discouraging day. It gave me a new out look on life and how to approach everything that does or does not concern me. I have now lent that book to over 10 people and they come back to me with the same awe I had. I read it when I'm down. I read it when I'm ready to succeed. I read this book whenever I can. I highly recomend it for anyone who is ready for a change"},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"This was the very first book on buddhism I ever read, and although many will point out it's shortcomings, I belive it is a good starting point for anyone interested in buddhism. Is there a bad starting point-if it sparks your interest? Progressing from this book is an easy step, and the book is simple enough for anyone.This is the first book on buddhism I give to people with new interests in buddhism as everything and anything can branch off and away from it. All the more indepth information can be taught from other books. Give this book a try (it's cheap too!) and lighten up on the bad reviews--at least people will show an interest without being overwelmed."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"Quintessential book on Zen, a must read anyone interested in Zen and Buddhism."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"filled with enlightening points and ideas to provoke thought and inspire meditation practice, Zen Mind, Beginners' Mind is the most effective book on zen I've ever read, and I've read plenty of books on the subject. Also, be sure to check out Kaplau's &quot;The Three Pillars of Zen,&quot; which takes a more direct approach to expaining the practice of zen and does so magnificently. Five Stars for both!"},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"This book ... of all books about Zen, makes it perfectly clear that the whole purpose of Zen is to help you see reality more clearly ... that is all. However, *that* is saying a lot ...One of the interesting features of this book is the author was a direct descendent of the 13th C. spiritual master, Dogen. However, the author does not write based on this relationship -- instead, he writes based on his *experience*. The book is well organized into three parts, &quot;Right Practice&quot; (action) and &quot;Right Attitude&quot; (frame of mind) adn &quot;Right Understanding&quot; (self-explanatory). The author describes how posture, control, breathing, mind waves and mind weeds affect our reality when practicing 'zazen'. No matter what arises in the mind we need to continue our efforts ... the power lies in our ability &quot;to accept things as they are, whether agreeable or disagreeable.&quot; This is one huge pronouncement ...While it is considered &quot;nothing special&quot; to meditate in this manner ... the ability to track one's mind and release duality occurs with &quot;right practice.&quot; Repetition and maintaining a &quot;single-mindedness&quot; is the effort that brings results --&quot;cultivating one's spirit&quot; one can attain equanimity and overcome many obstacles.. The overall effect is to communicate and express one's self from a point of truth. One begins to realize how effort, energy, and outcome arise from moment to moment ... *IF* there is a sense of being driven to attain &quot;enlightenment&quot;, perhaps, the practice driven by &quot;karma&quot; and one is wasting their time. The direction of effort needs to be pointed within ... developing readiness, mindfulness, without a true sense of a goal. It is difficult but that seems to be the true art of zen practice. Discovering a weed is a treasure for zen students ... because that is an opportunity for learning and growth to occur. Highly recommended book.

It IS zen."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"This book is simple reading for those who know nothing about Zen. Though, the less you know the better, according to this book. You can read one paragraph at a time and set the book down for a month (though you most likely won't) and continue having lost nothing. Also suggest you read &quot;Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Book of Eastern Wisdom&quot; by Taro Gold, which makes a great companion book on the path to learning about Buddhism."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"Despite my unfamiliarity with Zen, the sense did come through to me of an earnest, centered practitioner. I found the philosophical observations in this book more universal, and so more accessible, than the observations about the specifics of Zen meditation practice -- sitting, breathing techniques etc. This book does not lead the reader by the hand from square one, it is, rather, a book of observations transcribed from tape recordings of Suzuki addressing groups of people already experienced in Zen. I liked the book's secular, practical tone, as I can do without the magical thinking that is served up without question in many books by practitioners of Eastern religions, more so, to be sure, in the Hindu than the Buddhist tradition. I concur with reviewer L. A. Allen (no relation) that the title of this book can be somewhat confusing; much of the content doesn't connect well for a person who is unfamiliar with Zen Buddhism and seeking an introduction."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"I was looking for a simple introduction-to-Buddhism-practice type book. This book comprises several essays that express the author's thoughts regarding concepts such as dualism, control, nothingness. However, he does not explain defintions for these topics.There is very little information about actually practicing Buddhism, which is too bad for me because there are no teachers near where I live. I suppose the essays could be good guidance for meditation, but I'm not sure if all Buddhism or just Suzuki's approach adovates using no thoughts for meditation. I just finished the book and I'm not even positive about that elementary aspect of Buddhism - how to sit; is his way the only way or recommendation. The lack of a train of thought made it difficult for me to retain his advice.Personally, I recieved more guidance from articles in the magzine \\"Shambhala Sun,\\" but was hoping for a basic source of knowledge to fill in the gaps about practicing. He introduced a sitting style, but that was about all the help I recieved from this book. Maybe some one with more knowledge of Buddhism would benefit more from this book."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"there are other books, but this is by far the best I have read on the subject of zen. do not hesitate to read it."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"If you are practicing Zen this book is pure bread and butter.
