Not infrequently some retained some of their domestication. Texas was the land of their beginning as catalysts to a lifestyle peculiarly western because of how they developed. The Longhorns were tough individuals as well as part of a breed apart, and Dobie was just the sort of person to describe them for what they were, and the men who made it their purpose to use them. Dobie is a story teller of exceptional talent as well as an historian of necessity if his stories are to carry any weight. Each Chapter deals with an aspect of the beast and its habitat from which they were removed to form enormous herds driven north by cowboys over tractless miles to railheads when they arrived or to distant markets before their coming. Cowboys were tough, but also gentle as they crooned softly to the cattle on a stormy night hopefully to prevent \\"stompedes.\\" Dobies' tales of individual Longhorns illustrates that within the being of some was a spirit that exceeded normal expectation, and contributed to human emotions in spite of themselves. The Longhorns began to fade as bloodlines were mixed to improve the breed, and as railheads came closer to the herds. For \\"improved\\" cattle had not the prowess or the ability to survive without the help of man as did the pure Longhorns. They were a breed in transition from one life style to another, but their memory remains because of Dobie and his tales. Fascinating reading."},{"Title":"The Longhorns","review":"My family raises Texas Longhorns and when I was young and wanted to know more my father gave me this book and I have learned more than just the starting of the breed but the world around them.

It sticks to only what it considers to be the classic trails."},{"Title":"Dirty Laundry: Stories About Family Secrets","review":"\\"Dirty Laundry: Stories About Family Secrets\\" is a well compiled and, for the most part, well written anthology of stories. Each revolves around a long-concealed secret, and most are entertaining, though the overall tone of the book does tend to lean toward the morbid - or at least unpleasant.The book was edited by author Lisa Rowe Frautino, who also penned its well-written but sometimes very disturbing story, \\"FRESh PAINt\\". A couple other stories of note are \\"The Secret of Life, According to Aunt Gladys\\" by Bruce Coville (\\"Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher\\"), \\"I Will Not Think of Maine\\" by M.E. Kerr, and \\"Rice Pudding Days\\" by Susan Campbell Bartoletti.To sum up: I personally am not a fan of unhappy stories, especially so many in one place, but this is still a high-quality book which makes for interesting and often mysterious reading. Still, I would not recommend it to anyone under 14 or so -- for a younger person looking for a short story anthology, I would recommend \\"13: Thirteen stories that celebrate the agony and ecstasy of being thirteen\\" (which incidentally also features an entertaining story by the aforementioned Coville)."},{"Title":"Dirty Laundry: Stories About Family Secrets","review":"As a grad school student who had to read a book on controversy in literature for class, I stumbled across this book in the library and was more than pleasantly surprised. The stories are sometimes touching, sometimes humorous and very different from one another. I think this book helps people understand that no family is truly &quot;normal&quot;. I especially liked &quot;Rice Pudding Days&quot;, &quot;Passport&quot; and &quot;Popeye the Sailor&quot;"},{"Title":"Dirty Laundry: Stories About Family Secrets","review":"I wasn't overly impressed with this collection of short stories. The first story &quot;The Secret Life, According to Aunt Gladys&quot; by Bruce Coville started the book off in a great place (although the book sleeve ruined an early shock) especially with its haunting last line. Then the stories of Susan Campbell Bartoletti, Dian Curtis Regan, Anna Grossnickle Hines, Rita Williams-Garcia, and Richard Peck all suffered from predictability and a been-there-read-that mentality. The stories were okay, and some even better than that, but reading one after the other was just too much.The next story, although entertaining, was too science fiction for me. Yes, &quot;I Will Not Think of Maine&quot; by M.E. Kerr dealt with a family secret, but you have to beleive in the supernatural to fully except the story. Currently, I'm reading for reality. I'm looking for stories that can be used to help some of the kids that I'm working for. This story is not one of them.Then came a diamond in the rough. &quot;FRESh PAINt&quot; by Lisa Rowe Fraustino (the editor) was a awesome and moving story. I can't beleive that none of the other reviewers to this date (July 14, 2001) have mentioned it. This short story was one of the longest in the book (and I hate LONG SHORT stories) but I flew through it. &quot;FRESh PAINt&quot; has a strong mystery, a strong family secrets, and a painful moment that brought me to tears. Anyone who has read the story knows what I am talking about.The rest of the stories also were pretty good and seem to be favorites of other reviewers. &quot;Passport&quot; bt Laurie Halse Anderson has a creative and sharp-tongued style that made it a joy to read. &quot;Something Like... Love&quot; by Graham Salisbury was a nice story, but its family secret was probably the weakest of the collection. &quot;Popeye the Sailor&quot; by Chris Crutcher was definitely the correct story to end the book with. Its conclusion seems to put an okay book to rest. The style of the story (it opens as a play before turning to narrative) is gripping. The story shocks you into beleiving and it ends before we know everything, but we know enough. It's a wonderful story.Overall, the book is decent. The long stretch of predictablity to supernatural from Campbell Bartoletti's &quot;Rice Pudding Days&quot; to Kerr's &quot;I Will Not Think of Maine&quot; makes the book hard to finish, but with Rowe Fraustino and Crutcher, there is light at the end of the tunnel."},{"Title":"Dirty Laundry: Stories About Family Secrets","review":"I read the entire anthology. &quot;Passport&quot; and &quot;Something Like . . . Love&quot; were good stories. Not great, but good. Every other story in the anthology, though, was awful. Some would have been disappointing from a middle schooler; in the cases of authors whose other stories or novels I had read, I found those in this anthology poor examples of their writing; in the cases of authors whose other work I had not read, this book was no motivation. Also: you at Amazon have listed the book's reading level as &quot;Ages 9 to 12.&quot; Are you sure you don't mean &quot;Grades 9 to 12&quot;?"},{"Title":"Dirty Laundry: Stories About Family Secrets","review":"This book is put into lots and lots of short stories.

But not an amazing book in a whole. If you're into the whole family traditions, family secrets thing, then I might recommend it. And also if you'd just read the good stories (above), then go for this book, but this one isn't a winner.~Atalanta"},{"Title":"Dirty Laundry: Stories About Family Secrets","review":"I think that most readers would like something about this book because each story had different qualities than all of the other stories.

London (1928) marked a huge milestone in great literature via the genre of Belle Lettres. But these are not just any letters. Katherine Mansfield has been hailed as one of the greatest writers in the 20th century, and in her short life, she humbled the likes of Virginia Woolf and others world-wide with her resolve to write out her life in short stories, critical reviews, journals and these most personal letters while dying (literally) of consumption - mostly alone, abandoned, even by her own husband, J. Middleton Murry. These volumes are the ones the public at the time received from the publisher that made such a sensation and at long last made her name as one of the literary greats - never to be forgotten. Brave, tough, brilliant and yet so sensitive to the smallest speck of beauty in this world. No one has ever taken her place."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"There's not much more to say other than my title for my review on this book. I've been ttc for a long time now. I've gotten all of my fertility testing done and nothing is wrong with me (or my husband). There's no reason we shouldn't be getting pregnant, but have been trying for several years now. We have gotten a couple of treatments done w/ injectibles, etc. One day I woke up and thought, why are we doing this, there is nothing wrong with us?! This book has helped me to realize and confirm that I don't need to go to a fertility clinic to get pregnant. I'm taking steps to better my health, nutrition, and other aspects as outlined in this book. I am hopeful that I'll become pregnant without medical help. Thanks, Julia. You have been such a great inspiration to me!"},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"After finding out in July of 2010, from a routine blood test, that I have a border-line high FSH level (14), indicative of reduced fertility, I was devastated. My husband and I have been trying to have a baby since I was 33 years old. I am now 38. Just finding out about Julia Inichova's book gave me so much hope! After reading her personal account, I have a whole new mind-set about our personal fertility issues and I am forging ahead, making my mind, body and soul healthier to increase my chances of conceiving our elusive baby. Reading this book is a great way for couples struggling with fertility problems to refocus on the positive.

I strongly recommend it to everyone that goes through this difficult journey called infertility and IVF treatment."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"A much needed book that can uplift, inspire and boost the moral of anyone needing encouragement to continue their quest toward becoming a parent. Julia's determination to not give up her longing to bring a second child to this world gave me the courage to continue my own struggle to conceive my first child. I was pretty much at the end of my rope when I came across that book. I had been trying to conceive for seven years and time and lab numbers were not on my side. Like Julia I was in my 40s with rising FSH levels, the doors were closing on me pretty fast since unlike her I had never conceived before. There were plenty of experts and information reminding me of my close to zero chances of conceiving. Her book was a living proof that yes it can be done and yes I should keep pushing toward my goal. Like her I also conceived a healthy baby against these odds. This book gave me the courage to stand up to my doctors and convince them to at least try. It paid off handsomely, I conceived a healthty baby boy by IVF at 42 with a FSH levels of 22. The simple truth of knowing and listening to your own body is often lost in the \\"experts\\" rush against a woman's biological clock. This book reminds us of our connection to nature and the imbalance we can create by loosing touch with mother earth and the mom in us. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"My husband and I started working with Fertility Doctors in January 2008. It was a soul destroying and heartbreaking journey.

Julia's books provided us with hope as well as a natural course of action that empowered us to feel better about our situation. I immediately followed her recommended diet and felt better within a few weeks. I also started acupuncture. My husband and I attended Julia's seminar on May 18th 2008 and we left there feeling better than we had in months.

This book has been a real inspiration to me and gave me a lot of hope and confidence in myself and my body. I am about to read it for the second time. It is a great book and I'd highly recommend it to anyone trying to conceive. More books like this should be written. It is a very powerful book."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"Far from adopting the attitude that &quot;all infertility doctors are jerks and out to take their patients' money&quot; as one reviewer asserts, Indichova sought alternatives when her doctors gave her no hope of conceiving with her own eggs. In conjunction with adopting a myriad of lifestyle, dietary and other changes, Indichova continued to periodically assess her medical condition with conventional Western doctors. In fact, if this reviewer had really read the book carefully, he/she would have remembered that Indichova had an appointment with yet another RE to discuss the viability of an ART procedure based her decreasing FSH levels on the day that she learned she had beat the odds and conceived her much-wanted second child!Some of the reviewers seem to have a negative attitude about anything that doesn't fall within the strictures of conventional Western medicine and thereby assign the corrollary attitude (incorrectly!) to Indichova (that she is into &quot;hocus pocus&quot; and &quot;wacko&quot; stuff and disparages Western medicine (she does not).I will agree with the reviewers who've noted that this may be a tough book to swallow for those infertility patients who are struggling with primary infertility *and* have never conceived any children. Indichova suffered secondary infertility, and until I emotionally reached the point where I desperately want a 2nd child (my first miracle baby was IVF 3 years ago), I too would have had little sympathy for someone in Indichova's position. My perspective now is definitely different, but women who've never conceived any children should be forewarned of Indichova's situation.I've been diagnosed with diminished ovarian reserve, and though my FSH numbers aren't high, I've been largely written off as a lost cause by Western medicine. I have found new hope and inspiration in reading Indichova's story, and I'm grateful that she wrote this wonderful account. I'm certainly willing to give some or most of her ideas a try! I've adopted many of her suggestions over the last few weeks and I already feel better, regardless of whether my body is producing a good egg this cycle. True that she has no scientific backup to support what she did ... maybe all those dietary and lifestyle changes did absolutely nothing toward her second pregnancy. But maybe they did. Maybe they did.This review has been edited in June 2003 to say that I am now 12 weeks pregnant with my 2nd child, conceiving 3 months after I adopted many of Indichova's suggested dietary and lifestyle changes. Thanks for the inspiration!"},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"As a 37 year old IF woman, with high FSH, I thought all was lost. Then I found this book. With an FSH of 25, and doctors all telling me that I could never have a child of my own without an egg donor, life looked very bleak to me. But upon reading this book, I decided to make some life changes. I gave up going out to lunch (and brown bagged it instead) and going to movies (nothing wrong with renting) to be able to do my acupuncture sessions. I also bought yoga tapes and guided imagery tapes, and started drinking wheatgrass. I did not do the vegetarian diet though. From 25, my FSH is now 9. While I will still go through with my IVF, I am going into it with absolute belief that it is finally going to happen for me.When I received the results, I was overjoyed. And my doctors were shocked. They continued to test my FSH because they were sure it was an anomaly. They've been disappointed in seeing that my tests remain within a healthy range. I would encourage any and all who believe that in their body lies the key to fertility to at least give it a shot."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"Although I found parts of Indichova's story inspiring, overall I found this book more annoying than enlightening. Women who are struggling to conceive their first child should be warned before reading this book. Indichova's struggle is about secondary infertility. As someone who is still hoping for one child, I found it difficult to read page after page of Indichova's angst about trying for her second child. It made me feel that she didn't really appreciate the gift and miracle she already had with her first healthy child. I know secondary infertility is a serious problem for many women and I respect that it is, but for women who have not been able to have any children, this book can be an odd and unsettling read."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"This subject matter of this book appealed to me because, after 5 years of infertility, I finally had a child. Unlike the author, this wasn't years spent taking my wheatgrass shots and doing acupuncture - this was years spent in the hands of Western medicine and finally doing IVF, which worked.Here's what I liked about the book: it is highly readable, and a nice and inspirational story about a woman suffering secondary infertility who won't take no for an answer when the medical system tells her that her FSH numbers are too high to have a baby on her own. She did her own thing, was determined, followed her instincts, and in her case, it worked. I like the idea that people need to be proactive about their medical history and path they're on. That people need to listen to their gut instinct and that they know the best thing for themselves.What I didn't like is her general tone that it's perfectly okay to turn your back on Western medicine and go it alone, and you'll have a baby. At the end of the book, she talks about a friend of hers who has \\"unexplained infertility\\" and she can't understand why this friend is still drinking wine, smoking cigarettes, etc. Well, maybe these things contribute to this woman's infertility, but I'd say it's highly unlikely. Ahem, what about all the chain smokers/ alcoholics who get pregnant? All the crack addicts?Then, there are tales at the back of the book of people who got pregnant following alternative regimes. One woman picked her own herbs and thus felt very \\"connected\\" with nature. Another had some kind of cranial massage and let go of all her negative emotions. I'm glad these women got pregnant. But, these women were in their 40s or thereabouts. If you really, REALLY want a child, you'd be ignorant to ignore Western medicine in those situations. I'm scared there are people out there who will follow a regime of acupuncture/ herbs/ diet changes, and will miss the boat when they don't fall pregnant by their mid-40s.I'm not saying these things don't help. They do. But, statistically, more infertile people are helped through IVF. Also, if you are an infertile woman trying a bunch of things, and you get pregnant, you are liable to put it down to whatever you were doing at the time. As well as pursuing IVF, I personally tried Chinese herbs, a Native American healer (!), chiropractors, etc. When I fell pregnant on IVF, I was also doing acupuncture, diet changes and guided imagery. Did these things get me pregnant? Maybe they helped. But if I had fallen pregnant another month, I would have thought that other things helped. I think, more likely, my number was up - IVF is a numbers game. I'm not saying Chinese herbs (especially) and are things don't work for some people, but for every person they work for, there are also tales of people who have a different history.The author acts as if she has stumbled upon the truth behind infertility, when in fact she should just stick with talking about her own personal story. I like this as a read, and I hope people take out of it the essence of the story - that you should follow your instinct, be proactive, be determined, and never give up. But to take her specific advice, when time ticks against most women who are infertile, would be dangerous.Some things really made me mad in this book, mainly other people's stories at the end. Here are some examples:\\"I was also concerned a bout the fibroid on the outside of my uterus, and I found a book which...said that people get fibroids when they reject their feminine side, which is what I had been doing for a long time.\\"Huh? I've heard about blaming the woman for not getting pregnant (\\"If only you just RELAXED, it would happen for you\\"), but I've never heard of blaming her for fibroids, too.\\"My friend Lisa went to Julia's workshop...I don't think she had a major problem and she actually got pregnant very quickly.\\"Wow, what an endorsement!And there are other stories of people who decide not to go the Western medicine route and take things like pulsatilla, instead, because \\"it's appropriate for people who had a hard time making decisions.\\"All very well and good - but this is supposed to get you pregnant? Dangerous, dangerous information if it's supposed to be used INSTEAD of Western medicine as a surefire cure, instead of as an adjunct.Also, a lot of these testimonials were by women who apparently weren't that infertile. A lot of them started trying to conceive very late, after years of being ambivalent, and some of them had past histories of pregnancy. I'm sorry, but if you're part of an IVF group and meet enough infertile people - people who've been trying to get pregnant for over ten years with story of hideous losses - these testimonials almost read like an insult.I will say, however, that it is good to be in charge of your own medical history and make proactive decisions. So, if readers get that out of the book, fantastic. Western medicine is certainly not infallible, and does not hold the answers to all ills. But neither does holistic medicine. For a good book about striking the balance between the two, I would recommend \\"Spontaneous Healing\\" by Andrew Weil."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"The title of this book hit home and I tried everything else, so I bought the book and followed the recommendations as best as I could. A few months after I started, I did an insemination, went to the doctor (who originally felt my chances of getting pregnant were slim to none) and found out I was already 8 weeks pregnant! (What I thought was my period the month before was apparently blood from the embryo attaching to my uterine lining.) My doctor, who still couldn't believe it, recalled all my bloodwork from the month to retest, called me in for a sonogram the next day and, lo and behold, found and embryo with a beating heart. This doctor (one of the most respected in the business) said he'd never seen anything happen like this. I'm 42, have had 5 miscarriages and, as I've said, had a pathetic prognosis. The doctor said he'd be talking about my situation in his lectures and writings and he'd be sure not to mention my name.I now have a 7 month old girl who is a joy every second of everyday.I know how tough trying to have a baby can be when EVERYONE is telling you to pack it in, but believe me, if the advice in this book can work for someone like me, it can work for you too."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"I discovered this book after three miscarriages.

I tried to get pregnant for about two years, before and afterthe surgery, to no avail. I did two IUI's, which didn't work and finallydecided on my 37th birthday to move on to IVF. My husband and I went to see a high-flyingfertility doctor in Manhattan and he gave us a pep talk about IVF, saying that Iwas an ideal candidate. He did some routine hormone tests and I resigned myselfto doing the procedure, though my heart wasn't in it. I did a day 3 FSH teston a Sunday and got a call later that day from a nurse who reported back to me thatmy hormones looked fine except for my FSH, which was worryingly high. I didn'teven know what FSH was and she said that all she could tell me is that I may have\\"premature ovarian failure\\". I just about dropped the phone. What? I askedher to please give me more information because I was very disturbed to hear thisout of the blue. She said she couldn't tell me anything else and my doctor wasnot available until midday Monday. I asked her what made her think it was ok tophone someone on a Sunday and give them half-baked information without being ableto explain exactly what she is reporting. She replied curtly, \\"What did youwant me to say, that everything was just fine?\\"She told me my FSH was 17.8 and that the \\"cut-off\\" for IVF was 12 or 14.I looked this up on the web after talking to her, desperate for information, andread numerous reports confirming this. What I read turned my blood cold. \\"You'reas good as your highest FSH, even if the number comes down later.\\" \\"No live birthsabove an FSH of 17.\\" \\"Premature menopause.\\" I went into shock. My husband and Ispent the day crying, feeling like someone just read us a death sentence. Then atone point I got up off the couch, marched over to the health food store, got myselfa huge green juice and made up in my mind that I was going to fight this. On theway home I passed Barnes and Nobles and floated up to the childbirth section tolook for any shred of information on high FSH. Julia Indichova's book Inconceivablecaught my attention and I immediately bought it and brought it home. This was thebeginning of an extraordinary process that would change my life and affirm to methe potential of my own power to change and create circumstances in my life, evenbeyond pregnancy.I raced through Julia's excellent book, which was arresting in its honesty,candor and straight-forward telling of her incredible story. The book was full ofexcellent information, sometimes deceptively simple, but what I now know to havebeen the key to what later shifted the course of my life. I was extremely impressedwith her emphasis on trusting your own resources and treating doctor's adviceas just guidance, and not the word of god. I learned, to my immense relief (thereis no way now to capture the desperation I felt at the time, I think it amountedto trauma) that high FSH as an obstacle to conception is overdiagnosed and misunderstoodand that many women like me got their own little death sentences from hot-shot doctorshappy to dismiss their chances of motherhood in a two-minute cell phone conversation(I was on 12th street and University in Manhattan when mine told me I would probablynever have children without an egg donor).I immediately logged on to Julia's website [...] and found out thatshe was having one of her workshops the very next day in Manhattan. Yippee! I cancelledmy plans and showed up to a room full of women at all stages of experience -- somewere pregnant, some had just happily adopted, some were just embarking on the conceptionroute and some had been at it for a while. In the center of this circle was a small,Eastern European magician with a disarming, irreverant manner that I instantly loved-- Julia Indichova. What she taught me that day and in the one-day workshop my husbandand I subsequently attended in Woodstock will last me a lifetime. Her well-considered,intuititve, intelligent and extremely powerful techniques are described in her soonto be published book, The Fertile Female, How the Power of Longing for a Child canSave Your Life and Change the World, which I encourage everyone to read.To sum it up, Julia believes -- and is able to transmit that belief -- that thepower of creation lies within us and while there are of course medical considerationsin the process of conception, our own ability to create a child in the world istoo often undervalued and unrecognized. This basic premise is coupled with loadsof practical advice about how nutrition, lifestyle, exercise and numerous otherfactors influence the body's power to conceive, so don't think this is justwooly advice on \\"positive thinking\\". It's also not just valuable forwomen -- my husband learned a tremendous amount from Julia as well. Julia'swisdom addresses all levels of body, mind and spirit and most importantly, acceptsthat the deep longing for a child is not something to be repressed but rather bottledand utilized as rocket fuel to bring your baby in to being. She speaks to thoseof us who are more zen about creating change in our lives, as well as those whotend to be highly motivated \\"doers\\" -- whoever you are, there is somethingfor you in her toolbox. Also, and I am convinced of this, what Julia teaches willbecome commonplace at some point in the future. It's just taking a long timefor doctors to catch up with her vision.Today I am 20 weeks pregnant with a little boy and girl (twins!). I did do IVF inthe end -- after cleaning out my body and doing Julia's \\"body talk\\"and other techniques, I ended up bringing my FSH down to 5.2 -- a huge drop my doctorsin London, my second home, said they had never before seen. They also told me thatbecause the FSH level fluctuates, I may wish to do IVF right away, to take advantageof the low number. So I did and with extra phone sessions with Julia, I navigatedmy way through fertility treatment. For me, it worked the first time and I now feellike the luckiest girl in the world. Julia will say I just got out of my own wayand let the power of creation take its course. And I think this is actually a goodexample of how combining self-belief and medicine brought me what I wanted so dearly.There are of course medical limits to the body but they are often overestimated.Julia's advice is also a formula for creating almost anything in your life thatyou really, really want. Conception can be a baby but it can also be an idea, aproject, a political movement, anything. Julia is a gem in the world and way aheadof her time. I highly recommend both of her books and best of all, time spent withher directly in one of her workshops. What she has taught me will stay with me longafter my children are born."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"This book changed my perspective about my ability to conceive. Ms. Indichova shares her unique experiences and gives hope to anyone who has had to deal with the often myopic and discouraging world of reproductive medicine. After reading &quot;Inconceivable&quot; I became more aware of my body and ways to naturally increase my fertility. I never felt better than when I was trying to get pregnant naturally! I now have a 4 month old son (conceived naturally), and couldn't be more thrilled. This book started me on my journey to motherhood, and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"I've read some of the other reviews of this book and had to comment. Yes, the author already had a child, and yes, she did have another, I'll put it out there that I was not looking for another Pollyana fertility book either. I'm still in the middle of my anger, frustration, envy...so I understand some of the other reivews.But I did love this book, because it chronicled the journey. Most fertility books set out a roadmap: \\"Do this and this and this and you'll get pregnant.\\" (no comment!) This author didn't make promises, just shared her experience. She too went through frustration, got conflicting information, and felt the pressure of \\"trying everything no matter how crazy it sounds\\" cures. The indigity of dealing with coldhearted medical doctors, odd feelings about alternative treatments, and so on. It helped me to know I'm not the only one who has felt that way. I laughed and cried with this book. If you think of it like a support group in a book, rather than a guide to having a baby, I think you'll get a lot out of it. I'm glad this author chose to share her experience, because it's much more personal than most books on the subject. I may never get as far as she did, but at least I know I wasn't alone on the road we were travelling. I did find a lot of strength in this book. I'm also sharing it with my family members who don't seem to have a clue what we're going through. (The ones dispensing the \\"just relax\\" and \\"take a vacation\\" advice...)"},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"I read this book after struggling with infertility for several years. The message of encouragement to find my own voice in this very personal journey was one I needed to hear after nothing but negatives from the medical community. I gained tremendous hope and camaraderie from this book, hope that kept me moving forward to act and/or to accept what was before me. Within a year after reading the book, and using the accompanying meditation CDs, I conceived, against all the same odds as the writer. Even the doctors were stunned. I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"Best fertility book 'hands down'. I found this book inspiring, honest and full of helpful information. If you are looking for an alternative fertility route to the medical assisted model, I strongly suggest this book.

Her story of hope has touched me like no other book I've read on this subject and it was this book which allowed me to discover the author's support circles, workshops and website community which I have found to be an invaluable resource on this difficult journey. I highly recommend this book for anyone, male or female, who is struggling with infertility. I also highly recommend her second book, The Fertile Female which provides hands-on techniques for practicing what Julia calls her \\"Fertile Heart\\" tools. Incorporating these tools into my daily life has transformed me mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually. While there are many tools regarding diet, exercise and relaxation, the most valuable and unique tools are the mind-body imagery and body talk tools. Deep within each of us who travel on this confusing, often scary journey through infertility, there exists a powerful and magnificent life force that is yearning to be heard. We can tap into this force more easily by listening to our bodies and connecting with our true self. The Fertile Heart tools exist to help us to this, and I am so grateful to have found them.The Fertile Female: How the Power of Longing for a Child Can Save Your Life and Change the World"},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"There seems to be some vastly differing opinions on this book and what it actually says.I did not experience this book as someone trying to tell women experiencing fertility to give up on doctors or IVF. Julia actually had her FSH tested frequently and continued to approach fertility doctors looking for new treatments until right before she got pregnant. She kept hoping the FSH number would come down enough that she would be a candidate. Her goal was to get pregnant with her own eggs and IVF has close to 0% success rates with women that have an FSH level like Julia's. So, IVF was just not an option for her unless she wanted to use donor eggs and that decision wasn't in the cards for her yet. While she was waiting for her FSH to come down she was having sex with her husband and she happened to get pregnant.Julia followed her own path and one thing I found interesting was that the tone of the book is that she simply stated her experience -- she was not pushing anything. It found it odd that reviewers felt more broken and more confused. She talked about the experiences she had, the things that came across her path. She didn't prescribe. I felt at times like I was reading her journal.I absolutely loved that Julie discussed the quacks that she came across. Regardless of whether one is seeking an M.D. or an acupuncturist, we experience the same challenges. Will he/she listen to me? Does he/she have the skills to treat me or help? She talked about her less-than-positive experiences with both types of practioner -- MD and non-MD. And she talked about how she located practioners.I think it is fantastic that Julia got the point across that it can take months and years of serious effort to resolve a major health issue and that it can take many different approaches. Some approaches work and some are a waste time. Julie and the rest of us really have nothing to lose by taking care of ourselves and making ourselves as healthy as possible whether we are trying to get pregnant with IVF or not.Thank you, Julia, for an absolutely wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"After reading all these reviews, I bought the book thinking I was buying THE infertility book must-have. It's OK. Not great, not bad, but not what the hype here led me to believe. I'll keep it in the library, but I'll be more careful about buying based on reviews here."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"This book is the inspiring story of a woman in her 40s the doctors said would never mother another child. She took matters into her own hands, made some lifestyle changes, read up on Traditional Chinese Medicine, and eventually became pregnant and mothered her own child. It's an easy read, and opens the doors for you to learn more about alternative treatments. If you've been through every Western fertility treatment with no success, read this book."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"Yup, acupuncture is great for fertility. Very true. Do acupuncture. Yoga too. Do yoga. Drink wheatgrass juice? Delay pregnancy and Western intervention if you're over 40? You can still get pregnant naturally with super high FSH? I don't think this is true. Maybe it happened for Julia, but trust me, if you go the route of either following her advice when you're infertile, or doing IVF, you're better off with IVF. Her advice is anecdotal at best. She's not a doctor, nor is she a scientist, an herbalist, a doctor of Chinese medicine, nor has she studied reproductive endocrinology. She is a good old fashioned snake oil peddler. She's a brilliant marketer and if you pay her a lot of money, she can tell you to do yoga, take wheat grass juice and do acupuncture and meditate. Wheatgrass juice, by the way has no substantiated claims. It was a super popular health food supplement in the 90s, like Noni juice or, wheat germ, or Acai, or Mangosteen, or anything else that pops out of nowhere and claims to cure cancer and a host of other things.Women who are dealing with infertility feel totally helpless. They feel powerless and completely out of control. They want to be able to DO something. So this book gives hope in the form of giving a laundry list of things to do to help them get pregnant. But if someone gets pregnant as a result of using this book, it's a coincidence. Reproductive health is still a mystery. If it weren't, women who were given 0% chances of conceiving wouldn't conceive naturally after adoption and all those other stories out there that you hear ALL THE TIME. And by the way, my husband and I were given a very, very, very low chance of conceiving naturally due to severe male factor and it happened. And I was certainly drinking alcohol and overexercising and taking anti-anxiety meds at the time to deal with all my stress about infertility."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"My husband found Inconceivable while searching Amazon.com for a book that might help me deal with the devastation and hopelessness I was feeling after 3 failed in-vetro attempts. When I first started reading it, I was a little bitter because the author already had a child and was just frustrated because she could not seem to get pregnant with a second child. Being desperate for a first child, I wondered how someone who already has a child could possibly help me, but I kept reading, and after a couple chapters, I realized what her real message is....trust your instincts, your eating habits DO matter, and open your mind to actively research alternative options in addition to the conventional. The bottom line is to do what you think is right for you. What an empowering feeling!"},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"I bought this for my sister-in-law, but since I'm a pregnancy/birth junkie I read it before sending it to her. I think it's a wonderful reminder that western docs do not know everything there is to know about fertility and infertility, but they tend to act like they do and present no alternatives.My sister-in-law just had her first baby a few months ago after 10 years of trying. The few years of Western fertility treatment did not work and she hadn't yet gotten around to the acupuncture I was urging her to get. It happened naturally after they came out to visit my hubby and daughter and me."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"I have high FSH, and Julia's book was wonderful!! I tried to conceive for 2 years with 1 miscarriage.

She had commented on someone else's book, and it brought me to read about her books and website. I am generally a slow reader and rarely finish a book. I started reading \\"Inconceivable\\" and found it an easy read and highly enjoyable! I carried this book every where I went and read, read and read. I finished it in one week! - which never happens for me. In general, we eat very healthy and organic, but this book, Julia's story, brought me to another level. It is soooo worth the reading! Now, I am almost halfway through \\"The Fertile Female\\" her second book, and again, am carrying it around with me every where I go! It's one of those books that you can sit down and really, really get into and you feel like you're right there in the story, too. I highly recommend BOTH of Julia's books. I've also ordered her Imagery CD and some Conference Tapes from her website Fertile Heart. They just arrived yesterday. I have not been struggling with infertility, but more \\"obstacles\\" in trying to conceive our second child. I've had a miscarriage and my second ectopic pregnancy this time around, meanwhile, I'm just getting older... now 42! So, anything I can do to preserve my fertility, and in general just be the healthiest I can be - is well worth doing. Besides all of that - I've just really, really, really enjoyed reading her books and following the exercises. They're very peaceful exercises - I LOVE IT!!!"},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"Although the author is struggling with secondary infertility she still is suffering, as we all are. I saw I was not alone in what I was feeling and she opened up my mind and heart through her journey. I found it very helpful and I read in 24 hours cover to cover."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"I bought this book because it had been recommended to me by no fewer than a dozen women who also suffer from high FSH and a concomitant diagnosis of infertility. I was incredibly disappointed.This is nothing more than the story of a woman who adopted the common mentality of &quot;all IF doctors are jerks and don't want to help you&quot; and embarked on a new age adventure in hocus pocus. Yes, some of the ideas in here are valid (healthy eating habits, working through depression with yoga and other exercise techniques), but there's no definitive lesson here for IF sufferers. Worse, it sends the message that all Western medicine is bad, and all Eastern medicine is good. And that the answers to IF can be found in your local Whole Foods market.There's never any acknowledgment that a combination of approaches can be undertaken with success--leaving the impression that all Western medicine should be abandoned and that one should contact the local witch doctor (which this author did). That's bad advice, and unfortunately, too many women are taking it.I'm glad Ms. Indichova got lucky and had her baby. It does give me hope. But I am not persuaded at all that her regimen is to be credited. Some women just beat the odds--and maybe that's what happened here. A simple nod to this possibility would have been appreciated.That's not what we get. This book leads IF sufferers to believe that the answer lies in witch doctors, accupuncture, yoga, high colonics, wheatgrass shots, strange fruit concoctions, positive imagery, accupressure and daily visits to your local organic grocer--and ignorance of any and all Western treatments. Unfortunately, while those approaches may help a patient deal with the emotional, and some physical, aspects of IF, there's no evidence whatsoever that they work. Ms. Indichova does IF sufferers a disservice by not presenting a more balanced case."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"I am,like most of the readers of the book been trying to conceive for sometime and when I saw the title and read the reviews I thought I'll give this book a try. I don't begrudge the author for wanting another baby even if she already has one and in the early parts of the book it seems OK but when she got into the yoga and the positions that she assumed and most everything else that followed it was just too much for me. I am happy for her for having conceived her second child but the idea or the assumption that if you will yourself to conceive and have some sort of positive imagery and unity with the Universe is more than I can bear. She did have a miraculous birth considering her FSH level but it was the Creator who did that for her and not an act she willed herself to have."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"While I found this book inspiring in that it promotes the philosophy you know your body better than the best specialists, it was also exhausting. I commend the author on her unyielding strength and search, but the book focuses mostly on all the remedies she tried, when in the end her miracle child was conceived in what doctors considered an &quot;infertile&quot; month. It is more conceivable to believe her child was a miracle, not necessarily a result of the efforts this book showcases."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"When I initially heard of this book I thought, it was certainly worth a try. I am 37 and was also diagnosed with elevated FSH (secondary infertility) similiar to Julia. The day the book arrived, I could not put it down. The thoughts & feelings that Julia experienced were exactly what I was feeling.I am taking Julia's advice and started a new journey to getting my body healthy & prepared for the pregnancy that I know will come in time. I have a lot of work to do due to my current lifestyle but I know if I ever feel I can't do it I can just pick up the book and read a little more for inspiration.I want to thank Julia for publishing her story.

Offering hope to anyone,any age, trying to have a baby.It's smart, funny and inspiring.Wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful!"},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"I found Julia through her website and classes originally. When I read her book, both Inconceivable and Fertile Heart, I was amazed at the amount of heart, knowledge, hope and reality she put out there for me and those of working to create a family. If you can get your hands on her imagery exercises (some detailed in book and most on her website) buy them. Amazing! The bottom line that i see in all of this is that a) anything is possible and b) you have to be committed to yourself and the process.I have read a LOT of self-help books and I was amazed at how well-written this book was. And, that julia's heart and passion come through every page. I think the main message is one that we don't always want to hear but is the key-the answers to what we want and the child that we want to birth always lie inside of us. And, that our bodies are giving us clues and information that is imperative to pay attention to and honor. As, conception and birth are just one part of the process. We want to be healthy mothers and fathers-physically and emotionally once we have these babies. Her book gives a great roadmap to believing in yourself, trusting your own body and intuition and saying \\"I am going to do this my way. And, I am my own best doctor if I really listen to myself.\\" There are a lot of tips about diet and nutrition and self-care that i highly recommend and was already following prior to this book. But, let's be real here--most of the things that are included here are practical and intuitive and I am SO glad that Julia gets into more detail as to why you should make the changes. Caffeine, alcohol, sugar, white flours, etc-we know they are bad for us and should cut them out. Julia is proof, if you read about her FSH and how she brought it down--that cutting those things out can really change the course of your life and birth journey. I feel like what Julia promotes is not just \\"here's how to have a baby\\" but here's how to find out why you want to have a baby, how you might be holding yourself back, how to explore those things and how to take care of yourself physically and emotionally along the way.

Julia's techniques and teachings are inspiring, valuable and ultimately comforting. It is not an easy answer or foolproof equation. It is a light in the dark maze of infertility, and it is about finding your own way.The work is powerful. Nutrition advice , imagery, dreamwork, notes on various infertility treatments and much much more!

We tried and after two miscarriages in a row sought help with fertility doctors. My FSH was high and they agreed to try a few cycles. Our first attempt failed and I realized I needed to look elsewhere for help, most of all for my mental state. Her words and examples strengthened my faith that I could have another baby.

She has a sense of humor amid all of the negativity she encounters- and that is a true inspiration.I was so inspired by her exploration of holistic processes that I decided to change my approach and implement some of the ideas she discusses. I started feeling more positive and empowered and decided to take a workshop with Julia. That really helped to solidify my trust in myself as an expert about my body and my fertility.I am so grateful to have found this book when I did, I really needed a boost and a sense of possibility again.

The quote about not being \\"so quick to put your eggs in a petri dish\\"? Quick? She must be crazy. Who does this without careful consideration?Throughout the whole book she runs from the dreaded IVF. Well, hooray for her if she can get a baby from herbs and relaxation.

It has opened my heart and guided me towards the first steps of a \\"recovery\\" process. It has given me confidence in my own judgement, it has guided me to open up my sixth sense. And it has, most importantly, given me back my peace! I would like to tell to all the women out there who are going through infertility that the message of this book is one of the most important life can teach you: every suffering, every difficulty in life brings with it the promise of something positive and beautiful, something that will help you grow a stronger and happier person. Every baby brings with it an important message, and you have to find out which one your baby is bringing to you."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"Someone bought me this book as I've been working with a fertility clinic trying to conceive a second child. I'm 43, and the clinic doctors are all extremely negative about my chances, even though I conceived my first child at age 40 very easily. When I went in for my IVF implant, my Doctor advised me, \\"Now you know, the chances of this being successful are still only 10% for women your age.\\" I don't know when I've ever felt so deflated. Here I was, no turning back (eggs already harvested and fertilized, $15,000 in cash paid in advance, months worth of hormone injections) and he was telling me right at this moment this probably wouldn't work. When I got the book, I thought - \\"Oh no, another depressing book about women struggling to get pregnant.\\" However, the book was nothing like I imagined. I could not put it down. The author's story was so similar to my own, and she provides hope and stories about real women who conceived - naturally - over age 40 by getting in touch with their bodies through acupuncture, herbs, yoga, diet, etc. Nothing that the fertility clinics even talk about! I read the book in one night and I've since recommended it and bought it for many friends who are going through the same thing."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"I love this book - it is wonderful! Part informative, part sad, part funny, and definitely easy to relate to. I felt I was reading my own story!!!! I identify with her desparation in trying anything and everything to get pregnant - from Chinese medicine, yoga, foods, etc. I highly recommend this book. It is a quick read and very, very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"Good book to read regarding infertility from a personal perspective. I will read it again to help me with my journey"},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"I decided to buy and read this book at a very low point in my life. I had suffered a miscarriage earlier and was trying to get pregnant again with no luck. I finally decided to see a fertility specialist after 10 months of trying (I was 37 yrs old). After all the tests were done, I was told my FSH was high and my AMH was very low pointing to diminished ovarian reserve. The doctor told me I'd have about a 5-10% chance at conceiving on my own and suggested that I should consider IVF or an egg donor. We went through a cycle of IVF that did not work. Shortly after this, I read Inconceivable..I found the book inspiring and I tried many of her ideas such as accupuncture, wheat grass, diet changes, cutting out caffeine. I was set to start my second cycle of IVF and had actually begun my lupron injections when I took a pregnancy test and found out I was pregnant on my own! I am happy to report that I had a healthy beautiful baby boy. Now I am dreaming of a second baby and will revisit this book to get back on track and hopefully get pregnant again. Good luck to all on this journey."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"Great read, inspiration and educational yet sensitive. Fertility specialists have only begun to understand the tip of the iceberg to use a cliche. This book is a must read for anyone struggling with fertility and/or wanting a strong alternative to the drug-induced rat-race called ART."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"When I purchased this book I was really looking for inspiration to keep trying to have a child. I am 39 and have a high FSH number and have been trying to conceive for 6 months. This book validated my feelings and what I felt in my heart about building a healthy body and mind. Good book I have read it twice now since purchasing it."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"Inconceivable is a very powerful book. Julia offers wonderful support from her website and books for those trying to conceive."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"I am a 34 year old woman who has been diagnosed with very low MIS/AMH and normal FSH. We had been trying to conceive for over a year when I had gone to see a FS. Although I am in the medical field myself I refused to believe that my chances of conceiving were low. I scoured the internet and medical journals for information which was not very positive. I came across Julia Indochiva's website (Fertileheart.com) and book. Although Inconceivable is about secondary infertility I still felt her struggles resonated with the core of how I was feeling: Some dispair, sadness, frustration about feeling out of control, and responsible for not giving my husband what he had hoped for. Both my husband and I read Inconceivable and felt like the book helped us take the necessary steps in taking control over our situation. Even though there was no guarantee that we would be successful, for the first time in this process we felt like we were doing everything we could in our power before reverting to western medicine to achive our dream of having a child. I am happy to say that we are now 26 weeks pregnant! This book may have not been an exact duplicate to our situation but it gave us the tools that we needed to renew hope. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"This is a beautifully written and powerful book. I never could have imagined the impact this book would have on my family's life. I already had one child through IVF (after six years of trying because of my husband's undiagnosed fertility problems) when I came across this book. I wanted to have another child and hoped to do so naturally. The book had a profound impact on my thinking and my lifestyle. Julia's book, as well as her courses, also had an unexpected effect on my husband. He was so moved by Julia's story he made major changes in his diet and became open to alternative health. While we did see major improvments in our general health and well-being we did decide to try IVF again. While I was 42 at the time and did not receive very optimistic statistics for success, it worked the first time. I attribute my healthful and uncomplicated pregnancy and natural delivery to Julia's approach. The book, which I just reread, is by no means pro-ART. However, I was able to use the approach to become mentally and physically prepared to do IVF. Julia's courses and her web site are more integrative in nature--combining alternative tools with ART for the best possible outcome. You owe it to yourself to check out this book, her web site and courses."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"I came upon Julia's book when I was dealing with severe digestive problems while trying to conceive. While traditional doctors were pushing me to use injectable drugs, Julia helped me realize that I need to regain my health before trying to conceive. I followed her juicing instructions and got myself a juicer. The green juices did what two former surgeries had failed to do. Cutting diary, coffee and white flour helped me to lose weight and become more energetic. I also joined a yoga class and my body feels more ready for a pregnancy. I feel stronger. I used to be very angry at my body for not being able to conceive. Julia's work has made that anger go away. Now I feel great about myself. I also try to do imagery exercises.Julia's book was truly an inspiration to me. I don't want to use injectable drugs. My strategy is to do everything I can to get a healthy body and then leave it in God's hands.Julia has given me all the tools I need!"},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"I was able to relate to Julia completely! This is an excellent book for anyone who wants to achieve, not just a pregnancy, but ANYTHING! She inspired me to 1) take a closer look at the &quot;garbage&quot; I feed myself and to prepare my body as a clean &amp; healthy home for my future baby. 2) to believe in myself when pursuing my goals, to use my own common sense, and not to hold so much weight in what my doctors tell me. I recommend this book to anyone who is undergoing the stresses of infertility. It is excellent. Thank you, Julia, for sharing your story."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"This book changed my life. I had had four IUI's with fertility doctors. The injections I did on the fourth IUI almost stopped my period completely and only gave me two eggs. I was told I had two folicles. My FSH went up to 14. I was really depressed. I read \\"Inconceivable\\" twice. I did almost everything she did in the book. Iyengar yoga, wheatgrass every day, her visualization CD, jumping rope, and a willful approach to my prayer life are the things that stick out in my mind the most. Her book game me so much hope. I also got \\"The Fertile Female\\". The imagery this book uses was like a candle in the dark for me. It helped build up my courage to believe in myself again. It also helped me to drone out the negative comments that the \\"experts\\" had given me. Three months after trying her healthy lifestyle I got pregnant. I am 39 weeks along. My amnio came out perfect. I just turned 41. I want everyone to know how much Julia's book has touched my life. She has made a fantastic contribution towards helping women."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"I am pregnant! 17 weeks. Via IVF. My second attempt. My first attempt after reading Inconceivable. Julia's book gave me a sense of power and direction to approach the situation my way. It rekindled my energy at a very bleak time. It gave me a sense of control when I felt like I had not control. I highly highly highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"I absolutely love this book! One of my all-time favorites (and I am an avid reader). This book provided me with strength, confidence and inspiration at a very difficult time in my life - at the age of 31, I was diagnosed with premature ovarian failure due to a high FSH reading and was told by my doctor that I would only be able to conceive, if at all, if I used an egg donor. Several other specialists in NYC re-affirmed this diagnosis. Then, I found Inconceivable. Not only is Julia Indichova an exceptional writer, but she was able to relay the exact feelings I was going through during this difficult time. I found her suggestions to improve your quality of life and health in a natural manner (via yoga, imagery, diet, etc. as opposed to taking medications) extremely helpful and liberating. Everything she said in her book completely appealed to me and I started working on improving my quality of life via the book's suggestions, despite what the doctors had told me. As of this date, I have lost count as to how many times I have read it - -every time I pick up the book I note new advice and tips. Several months after having first read her book and started taking steps to improve my quality of life, I found out that I was pregnant! I know that the lessons of Inconceivable were an invaluable tool that led me to my pregnancy. While Julia's story is also one of high FSH, anyone going through difficulty conceiving a child of their own will find this book immensely helpful. I cannot recommend it enough!!"},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"As soon as I read this book, it changed my way of thinking. I found Julia Indichova's book by an extraordinary coincidence while I was walking through a bookstore in Boston. After my infertility doctor told me I had no chance of conceiving, I went to that bookstore to browse for adoption books. Like many other women, I suffer from high FSH levels, the same infertility condition Julia Indichova suffered. This book came to my life at a moment of absolute despair, depression and anger at Western medicine. There are many books out there on infertility, but I hadn't seen one about high FSH levels, which made me feel like I was such an exceptional case, with no solution. I bought this book in May shortly after my FSH test revealed 25.5 level. I have followed the path she describes in the book particularly those she recommends for naturally boosting the body, believing in my mind that I could lower my FSH levels if I wanted to. Maybe just coincidence but I got pregnant in June. I strongly believe that her book made a big impact in my mind, and how my mind and body communicated. I am now 7 weeks pregnant and hoping that in February I will deliver successfully.Julia is an exceptional writer. She communicates the exact feelings women experience when struggling with infertility. She has a natural way of giving hope, and making changes in someone's life. She made me realize that I did everything I could to conceive and if it hadn't happened, then I was emotionally ready for adoption. I recommend this book to women with high FSH levels and everyone sharing their pain."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"This is a must read for anyone who is trying to conceive and is in need for some inspiration and comfort. This book called out to me in the bookstore and I am glad I took it home with me. Quick read! I laughed, I cried...I also gained a new understanding of the power that women hold within themselves. Julia's book motivated me in ways I cannot explain. Coming from someone struggling with the anxiety and reality of infertility, I have to say that this book gave me new hope and optimism."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"This is a beautiful book. In a powerful and yet gentle way, it has changed my life. I read it in it entirety the evening I purchased it and have reread portions many times. This is not a how-to book with a strict regiment to follow. Instead it is one woman's heartfelt story of the pain of infertility and her personal quest to find answers and solutions beyond the fertility clinics. Julia tells her story with remarkable honesty and feeling. I strongly recommend it to anyone willing to use the book as an inspired guideline with which to begin their own journey towards enhanced fertility and overall well being."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"I happened to stumble upon this book in the book store and so after trying for one year I bought the book. There's so many books out there all saying the same thing: get these tests, do this, chart this, here's what can help. What I really needed was a story of a women's journey with a success at the end. And I truly believe in the mind-body connection and had been sort of out of touch with that having been caught up in the &quot;trying to conceive journey&quot; It was an incredible, eye opening book.

She inspires the reader to listen to your own voice and never give up on your longings, wherever they end up bringing you. I read both this book and \\"The Fertile Female\\", and they really helped me through my journey. I also experienced secondary \\"infertility\\", having 2 miscarriages in a year and a half. At 38, thinking that I was running out of time (and running out of hope), I conceived naturally soon after taking Julia's workshop in Woodstock, NY last December. Thank you, Julia, for all of your wonderful work!"},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"This book is excellent for someone suffering with secondary infertility. I had minor struggles with my 1st child at 35 and was able to concieve within a yr with assistance with Clomid. We have been trying now for almost a yr and 1/2. Now at almost 38 I've been told that I have almost NO chance of conceiving without a donor egg. My FSH has been as low as 11 and as high as 42. I was released from my fertility specialist care. It was like a door was slammed in our faces. Not sure if this idea will work but what could you loose? I think it sounds a little hokey but even my MD husband thinks it's worth a shot. Eating better, taking care of yourself, doing Yoga, and getting off the pitty pot?(not sure about the colon cleanse by the way) Even if it doesnt work for me it's great to know there is someone out there that beat the odds."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"I read this book so quick, was a delight, her struggle in finding the right treatment for her was exactly what us women here feel.

Find your own way to cope and find solutions for conquering motherhood."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"It's really amazing.

I am ordering my third copy because I have given this book away twice! Through the author's experience, the reader learns about diet, exercise, stress, health supplements, and medical treatments, and how all of these relate to fertility as well as overall quality of life. Great for older women trying to conceive, but I am young and read this book while I was trying to conceive (with no infertility problems) and found it entertaining and helpful. A sensitive, useful book!"},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"This author really inspires with her tale of how she persisted through negative medical predictions to conceive her second daughter. Her story highlights the fact that averages and statistics are just that, and that we can participate in our own reproductive destinies."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"I read this book over and over trying to find out why anyone would have anything negative to say. Many women today are diagnosed with infertility and they put everything in the hands of their doctor. Many women get the scary statistics- 5-10% chance of conceiving and think of a donor egg. It is very easy for people to say this who have a genetic link to their own children. But in one sentence, a doctor can tell someone to give up the chance of having a genetic link to your child. Many women are turned away from from fertility clinics because their numbers are too high and it will ruin the success rates of the clinics. Fertility clinics are graded on their success rates. If a woman is able to utilize a fertility clinic and western medicine, then this is a great way to incorporate a healthy lifestyle and eastern medicine into the regime. There is definitely something to be said between a mind/body relationship. For those women who are unable to get medical care because they are turned away, then they have no choice but to make things happen on their own. If you are suffering from infertility or need a great inspirational story, this is a wonderful book that you will pick up over and over again."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"A friend told me about this book and I read it within 2 days of purchasing it. I was struggling with Infertility and found the book filled with hope and inspiration. Mostly, I loved how the message and tools in the book helped me regain some control and power over this process which made me feel so helpless and out of control.I was 39 when I was dx with high FSH and given a less than 1% chance for a natural conception and 3% chance with ART. The doctors wouldn't even consider IVF for me. After practicing these tools and attending the author's workshop, I became pregnant NATURALLY. I am now 40 and 6 mths pregnant. I became pregnant one month after attending the author's workshop which is an entire day of practicing these tools and being in touch with this process. It was a truly memorable day for me. I'm not sure why others feel that the author is \\"against\\" ART; I never found that to be true. There were many people in the workshop who were in the process of IVF or IUI and their course was embraced by the author. I think the message is to \\"trust yourself\\" and do what \\"feels\\" right for you even if it is contrary to what you are being told. This is an important message for life in general.

What I found left me empty and angry. While I admire the book's ultimate message - that women need to be their own advocates when it comes to health care decisions - the book offered me little on either an emotional or substantive level. Ms. Indichova already had one healthy child at the time she embarked upon her infertility journey. While secondary infertility must be very painful, that pain is not the same as that experienced by infertile women who are unable to conceive even a single child. As one dealing with primary infertility I could not help but wonder, as Ms. Indichova went from specialist to specialist, who was staying with her young daughter. The author also seemed to have an unlimited supply of funds to finance her forrays into various types of alternative medicine. Most of the women I know suffering from primary infertility not only lack an understanding of the trauma of secondary infertility, but also the funds to engage in all of the experimental treatments in which Ms. Indichova participated. I found the author's struggle to be self-indulgent. I also felt that implicit in the book was a condemnation of women who must use forms of assisted reproductive technology to conceive. The message I came away with was that if more women took the time to explore the various dietary, physical, and spiritual alternatives the author did, they would not need ART. Infertile women do not need another reason to feel inadequate."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"I found this book VERY disappointing...I don't understand why it got so many hypes?? The author already had a daughter. When her daughter was 2 years ago, she started trying for 2nd one, and freaked out when not being able to get pregnant right away after three months trying..Then she ran around to do yoga, take wheatgrass shots etc... WTF???! I wish it was that easy for me. Many women including me have been trying for years and don't have any kids...She already had a biological kid, she's NEVER had a miscarriage, she's NEVER tried/failed IUI/IVF... HOW CAN SHE name this book \\" Inconceivable\\"???!!!!!!!!!! I felt it was a joke after finish reading the book. If you like story telling, you might enjoy reading how she met her husband, how she got married, her family history and other irrelevant stories... I didn't find any useful information that I didn't already knew... she didn't provide a clear answer either... save yourself $$ and buy other better and more helpful books. Really."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"I cannot express how much of an effect this book had on my life. After two miscarriages, I was in a very dark, desperate place. Julia's story helped me realize that my health is NOT out of my control, and NOT just in the hands of doctors.It gave me the courage to change my diet, my lifestyle and my frame of mind before trying to conceive again. Instead of looking for problems, I now look for answers.I would recommend this book to anyone looking for ways to take control of their reproductive health in a natural way."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"I found Julia's approach and words of encouragement invaluable. I conceived my first child at 41 and had her at 42. We took a year to decide if we were ready to have another child and I actually did not think it would really be possible (trying to conceive again at 43). Drs typically tell you when you are trying to conceive in your 40's to go to them if you have not conceived after 3 months of trying. Instead of going to the medical community after 3 months, I did some research on line and found Julia's books. I quickly read them and then participated in some of the group phone calls that she conducts. What I found invaluable was her positive outlook, that it is possible to conceive when you are 43 years old. Most Dr's would say that this is not very likely and they typically jump to medical intervention as a solution. My husband and I had already determined that we could not spend a lot of money on infertility drugs or operations, it felt like too much to us. Julia's approach helps those women trying to conceive keep in mind that we are all in charge of our own bodies and if we treat them right and take care of them, with a positive outlook, many new possibilities open up. I am currently 44 and am pregnant with my second daughter, due in early January 2012. Thank you Julia for your wisdom, your guidance, your knowledge, and your eternal optimism. I believe all of these things helped me conceive my second child naturally, without medical intervention. If I had not accessed these tools, I probably would have given up the hope of having a second child."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"Although I am not dealing with secondary infertility I still really related to this book. The book was excellent I couldn't put it down. It gave me hope and made me think of alternative ways of treating my infertility. After 2 failed IVF's I was looking for hope in other areas and this book definitely help. I highly recommend this to anyone dealing with infertility regardless of if its primary or secondary."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"First of all, don't read this book if you are looking for in-depth info or specifics regarding a story of infertility. The reader is given pretty vague details about the author's \\"infertility\\"--only her age, FSH number, and a previous pregnancy, and no details on when the FSH was even taken in her cycle (we presume 3, but it isn't confirmed), and no other numbers from her testing, and the reader is then led to believe that a woman with an FSH of 42 (with her lab assay indicating 20 being limit for normal) can't conceive--at all.The premise of this book is false. In reality, if you read up a lot on infertility, then you are probably aware that numerous women with higher FSH can and do conceive. Even if a woman has poor egg quality and quantity, that doesn't mean that every once in a while, she can't kick out a decent egg in a given cycle and achieve pregnancy. Not common, but it happens. The difference is that assisted reproduction techniques, especially IVF, depend on a woman being able to produce a decent number of quality follicles after drug stimulation. Women with high FSH and age typically are poor candidates for IVF, because they can't generate many follicles, of a decent size, and even if they do, the eggs sometimes are too fragile to withstand the IVF process and die upon retrieval, or subsequently fail to implant. So, while it makes sense that the author was probably refused admittance to IVF programs, it seems to me that the author misconstrued this as meaning she could never have a child. If the author was literally told that women with high FSH NEVER conceive, then the doctors or their assistants were just morons. Which is also possible.In any event, I have to agree with \\"Bookcrazed\\" that this book is a tad dangerous. Not all women with infertility are going to be able to take yoga, go vegan and organic, and reduce stress, and then suddenly become pregnant after serious diagnoses and problems. And I was also very unimpressed with the anecdotes from people visiting workshops who got pregnant. A lot of them were young compared to most infertility patients or had minor issues to overcome or no diagnosis of infertility or diminished ovarian reserve. If this program really worked, we could anticipate seeing women 40-50, conceive with very high FSH numbers, after years and years of Western infertility treatments failed. And that's not what most of the anecdotes are. So, I think this book has to be careful in terms of not trying to sell snake oil to women who are desperate to conceive. And the author apparently does workshops on her regimine, so there is a financial stake in all this. If you have ever looked at fertility seminars/retreats around the country, you will note that some of them cost thousands of dollars!I also think that few people could really do this regime. The woman gives up all alcohol, caffeine, dairy, and meat. One of her big things is daily organic \\"juicing.\\" This women did not have a full time job. So, it's a totally vegan and organic diet that would be incredibly expensive and time consuming. People with full time jobs or budget limitations would have a very tough time with this. And she wasn't stressed out like people who have no kids, because she already had a toddler.She also had a much younger husband (7-8 years?) which is worth noting because many women with infertility issues may be using donors, or if they are over 40, have husbands even older than themselves, and this can affect outcomes.Having said this, I think it's a worthwhile read if you read this in the frame of mind that: 1) it is good to question doctors; and 2) getting in touch with your body and radically improving your health overall in terms of stress, counseling, some physical activity, and big nutritional changes could possibly tip the balance for some women, and even assuming it doesn't--and you should not expect it too- you will be in great shape.I think there are some more realistic books out there on this issue that are also worth reading. One I recently enjoyed is the one \\"Waiting for Daisy\\" by Peggy Orenstein. Well written. Funny, relatable, frank. Orenstein eventually conceives despite a lot of odds--one ovary, cancer, miscarriage issues, a husband 10 years old and she's almost 40, but unlike this author, Orenstein ultimately conceives when she isn't really trying, and Orenstein is frank about how acupuncture and alternative medicine did NOT work for her, and is equally critical of how Western doctors are frequently trying to sell the product more than oversee the care. I also like, Liz Tilberis' \\"No time to die\\" about her unsuccessful fertility treatments, as well as Ann Taylor Fleming's \\"Motherhood Deferred\\"--she was also ultimately unsuccessful. Makes you realize that if you aren't successful, you aren't alone."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"Julia's book is a fantastic, inspiring and empowering journey. If you have also been lucky enough to do her workshops or support group, you will find a woman who is dedicated to facilitating every woman's journey to the child for which she longs. But, there are no magic recipes, and perhaps that was disappointing to some readers. I found it otherwise. I like that she does not say &quot;drink this _______ and you will get pregnant&quot;. Instead, Julia teaches you to listen to and love your body, prepare it to receive the best and most appropriate treatment for your issues. She teaches personal empowerment, something that counters the helplessness in the fertility maze.It is work, personal work. It is hard, but it yields a result that is far far greater than you will believe.Buy, the book. Go to Julia's website and get her imagery tapes, and start your journey. You will NOT be disappointed."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"as i type with one hand, and my other supports my 16 week old baby as she breastfeeds, i find it rather profound that one year ago this month, i fell pregnant naturally! how did a 41 year old woman get pregnant naturally and deliver a healthy baby girl at the age of 42, you ask? well, after trying to get pregnant since feb. 2007, and subsequently being told repeatedly by one too many ob/gyn's that 1). i'm too old; 2). my eggs are too old; 3). i'll never get pregnant naturally; 4). if i do get pregnant, there's a 99% chance i'll miscarry; 5). donor eggs and IVF are the only options if my husband and i wish to have a baby (NO F#@%^&G; THANK YOU!)... WE GOT PREGNANT ANYWAYS by largely following the tips and secrets of Julia's profound and inspiring narrative.although i engaged in a lot of Chinese medicine (herbs, acupuncture, moxabustion), jumped rope, swam laps, drank fresh wheatgrass, did yoga, i attribute my mental fortitude to Julia's powerful book. Julia's courage and perseverance in the face of sheer adversity and her TRIUMPH is a lesson for all, regardless of whether you are trying to fall pregnant. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ALL WHO HAVE BEEN TOLD \\"NO\\" AND INTUITIVELY KNOW THEY CAN DO IT THEIR WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"As someone with many fertility problems myself and still no baby, i really identified with some of the things in the book. Since she suffered from secondary infertility and already had a baby at home, I couldn't identify with her completely. I think this is definitely a memoir and not a \\"how to\\" book on getting pregnant. She does say that in the book, that her method is completely her own and it won't work for everyone. The only thing I didn't like about the book was her unfortunate experiences with holistic practitioners, I realize it was just her experience but she made it sound like most people practicing ancient and holistic arts are crooks. I found myself happy she was able to add to her family but overall I didn't feel like the book did much for me as a woman in my 20's with PCOS. If you are suffering from secondary infertility and/or high FSH numbers then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"I read a lot of infertility books and enjoy reading personal sagas about infertility - -particularly success stories like this one. It gave me hope and made me realize how much we need to take charge of our health. I would like know more about what happens next!"},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"This book fell into my lap at an opportune time. Several lactation consultants and I had recently been discussing arrogant, &quot;fertility experts&quot; who were cruel to their patients, badgered them, reduced them to tears with every visit, forbade them to see lactation consultants- but yet, parents were grateful because the &quot;expert had given them their baby&quot;! Egads! Parents, parent hopefuls and everyone- stand up for your rights and don't let the specialists own you!I am also on a personal journey toward greater health through yoga, Nia and improved diet, (but not quite back to the heyday of my vegetarian days). My aches and pains have decreased and my energy levels improved. Julia just reinforced what I already knew but was having a hard time putting into practice.Julia had to write this book. Anyone with health issues would be well advised to read it. People need to learn to be responsible for themselves. Doctors need to understand that they are human too, and can have a profound impact on their patients, beyond the obvious. Julia won't tell you how to improve your fertility. She will tell you what she did and what she learned along the way, and help you find the beginning of your own work. That is much more valuable than a guidebook because you need to own your health.This is a very quick read. I read it in mostly one night- I was hooked. I wanted to find out more about how she was helping herself. I knew she would end up pregnant and I was eager to learn what she and her husband did- I hoped for an unassisted pregnancy.I would have liked to hear just a tiny bit about her birth and babymoon with her new daughter. Culturally we need to hear more about breastfeeding, especially following infertility."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"This book is terrible. While she discusses some excellent topics like diet, relaxation and taking control of your own health, it's at a 50,000 foot level, there is no real factual information whatsoever. And unless you have endless time and money to pursue treatments you are not going to be able to follow in her footsteps. Save your money ladies!"},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"First of all, I would like to sincerely thank Julia Indichova for writing this book and sharing her personal journey out of secondary infertility. This is an excellent yet simple book for those of us sick to death of doctors and their opinions, medicines and poking on us!Secondary infertility is a little written about subject and less talked about. I found a lot of comfort in and courage from reading Indichova's story. Read this book if you are fed up with people telling you you are too old or unhealthy to have a baby- or a second one. Get healthy, take charge of your body- treat it well and you will get pregnant!"},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"This book is a great read for those going through infertility. The author shares her story in an understandable way that I could relate to, given my experiences with the process. I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"I wanted someone to connect with, someone who's been where I have, I suppose. While I felt for her and her husband, it's just her situation which didn't match with mine. I thought I would be reading about someone who went through IUIs, IUIs with meds and IVF cycles.The author is much older than me and has a specific situation with FSH levels. For most of us women in our thirties that's a non issue.The healthy diet and nutritional information sparked my interest however I still believe everything in moderation is key.If you're on a journey where male infertility is an issue or your on the IVF path, this is not for you."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"I agree with the other reviews that Julia's story is compelling and well-told. I expected to read an inspirational story that would be relevant to my situation (ttc 1+ yrs). I have normal FSH levels, and we will be starting AI, hoping we don't have to proceed beyond that into other techniques not covered by my insurance. Julia's FSH levels were elevated, which is why she was told she wasn't a good candidate. If you also have elevated FSH, this book may provide more inspiration to you than it did to me. If your FSH is normal, this story probably won't help you that much."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"I have been struggling to conceive for over two years. I ordered this book thinking that there was some mystery cure that she had found on her path for a baby. The beginning was great and I could relate to her struggles to have a baby. For those of us who struggle just to have one miracle she was complaining about her situation when she already had one child very easily. She didn't start having children until her late thirties/ early forties. If you want to read her suggestions about fertility check it out from the library."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"First, let me say that I'm glad that the author had a success story.But, let's face it. The reality is that not all of us will be so lucky. It is almost unfair to suggest that by doing all the things that she did, we can have a baby too. It's not that simple. My husband and I have been trying for **nine** years. No live births yet. I read the book and just started beating myself up for working full-time, for not doing yoga, for not taking herbs, not relaxing enough, whatever. I am sorry to say that regretted this purchase and am giving my copy away."},{"Title":"Inconceivable: A Woman's Triumph over Despair and Statistics","review":"If you don't know anything about infertility this book will give you an idea what those families go true. Otherwise, we all know what options we have,,,Did it gave me more hope - no! We all are different, we all have different finance limits, we live in different towns,,,and finally - the author already has a child so I don't think she would know the pain childless families go true.To bad I spill smt on my book so I can't resell it (pages got wrinkled)...If someone interested, can give it for free just pay the shipping."},{"Title":"No More Victims","review":"This is the book that youth groups should mass order. Peretti recounts his own childhood growing up as a victim of both cystic hygroma (causing stunted growth and a speech impediment, among other problems) and bullying. He shares with painful detail how constant bullying effected his self-image (\\"I thought I was a monster\\") and how the school system typically does little or nothing to protect the weak. Even further, he illustrates his view of the world as governed by a higher system of rules, explaining why \\"Might makes right\\" is both a dangerous and a flawed philosophy. Peretti even confesses his own faults as an occasional bully, his failures to stick up for those weaker than himself. This is a super-quick read that will challenge adults to a new awareness of the bullying problem and will benefit every teen/pre-teen reader, whether he is a bully, a victim, or someone caught in the middle who doesn't know how to change \\"the way things are.\\""},{"Title":"No More Victims","review":"This is such an awesome book and maybe one of Peretti's best. He speaks of the dangers that our words and actions have on the outcome of ones personal as well as emotional life, if our society and schools keep going the way that they are. I definitely recommend this book to everyone who feels they are 'different' inside. Actually, everyone still in highschool and college should read it before it is too late."},{"Title":"No More Victims","review":"I was moved beyond words after reading this book. Peretti has a way of touching you and challenging you to meet the issues of our day with the love and compassion of Christ."},{"Title":"No More Victims","review":"Why do tragedies such as the one at Columbine occur? Can we make our schools safer places to grow and learn? \\"NO MORE VICTIMS\\" should be required reading for everyone who cares and even for those who think they don't. I love Frank Peretti for writing this book!"},{"Title":"No More Victims","review":"I HAVE READ THIS BOOK & THE \\"\\"LEADER\\"\\" EDITION---THE TRUE STATEMENT IS THAT IT S H O U L D BE HANDED OUTTO EVERY STUDENT GOING TO SCHOOL (&PARENTS;&TEACHERS;&ADMINSTRATORS;)-----IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN--UNFORTUNATELY---BUT THERE ARE LESSONS TO LEARN HERE."},{"Title":"No More Victims","review":"I bought this one as well for my daughter, and she said it was a good book, but it was for younger people. I did not know that when ordering it for her, also it would be nice to know how many pages in the book, as this was a very small size and page book."},{"Title":"No More Victims","review":"As a school principal, I think this book is filled with good information for kids in grades 5-8. In fact, No More Victims is required reading for our incoming 7th graders. Parents can read it along with their kids and have some great discussions about bullying from a variety of perspectives.Peretti's book The Wounded Spirit is a great read for parents and youth workers that deals with the same topics on a level more appropriate for adults and older teens."},{"Title":"No More Victims","review":"Anyone involved at any point in the public school food-chain should be required to read this. It is a masterpiece. The first chapter describes the hell of it all in such a vivid way that I was crying to hard to keep reading. It's a short read, but life-changing."},{"Title":"No More Victims","review":"This book should be required reading for EVERY administrator, EVERY teacher, & ANY OTHER person who works in any school in the USA!!! And, Yes, I mean every single one of them -- period."},{"Title":"No More Victims","review":"This is a small book packed with a powerful story that makes a person think about the effects of how we treat other people."},{"Title":"No More Victims","review":"I liked this story, because Frank is one of my favorite Christian writers, and it was kind of an introduction into his life and why he thinks and relates to people."},{"Title":"No More Victims","review":"Great books about how we are all made different,.. we look different, think different, but despite those differences we are still made in the Image of God,.. and sometimes those differences that cause us mortal pain,.. can bring spiritual victories.ViVa Le Differance!!"},{"Title":"No More Victims","review":"Frank Paretti tells his story about bullies in the past, his birth defect, and how to manage bullies. Frank tells concrete ideas in dealing with bullies."},{"Title":"No More Victims","review":"No More Victims is an abridged version of The Wounded Spirit meant for tweens. Both are powerful non-fiction books about the need to take a stand against bullying, based on his on experience as a child. Excellent writing, important topic well covered. In a very personal, vulnerable, readable style, he deals with important topics in this context, such as why God allows suffering. For good readers over 15, I'd recommend The Wounded Spirit instead."},{"Title":"No More Victims","review":"I fouund the book something that most people can relate to in one way or the other. It was and easy read that held my interest."},{"Title":"Moving Out (The Virginia Commonwealth University series for contemporary poetry)","review":"I have no idea (24 years later) why it was that I found myself in Waterville, Maine, attending classes at Colby College. But just last month, I came across David Walker's book of poems and recalled in my mind's eye this very same man, tall and angular, bearded and bespectacled, lecturing us on modern poetry.As far as I'm concerned, he could have spared us Anne Sexton and Hart Crane, and stuck with his own beautiful poetry. His &quot;Moving Out&quot; is about family and relationships, and in David Walker's case that means familial relationships that reach back hundreds of years in Maine/New England history. His voice is true, his language sharp and haunting. What he has to say about the human condition should be heard by everyone.One poem that touched me very deeply is &quot;A Prayer for my Daughter.&quot; As a college senior, it would have meant very little to me. But, today, with my own charming nine-year old daughter, this poem stirs a very deep emotion. What father hasn't worried about a child unprotected, left to the chance and circumstances of an uncertain life? In this poem, David Walker captures just this dilemma when he says (and I paraphrase), &quot;At night I hear the dogs barking... how quickly they would heel by my side for a bone tossed careless from my plate.&quot;This book came out almost a quarter of a century ago. I hope he's still writing!"},{"Title":"Bandeaux Creek","review":"you'll like Bandeaux Creek.In every family it seems like there has been a bittersweet choice about giving up the farm and moving to town.Bandeaux Creek captures what the migration from farm to city meant through the eyes and hearts of the people who lived it in the 1920s in rural North Carolina.Yes, there is a diva protagonist Maggie Lorena who we sort of love and hate in Scarlett O'Hara way, but mostly it's the sense of power and loss and redemption that we experience as the characters have to leave the land for the towns and some make it back and some never do."},{"Title":"Genealogy of the Howes Family in America: Descendants of Thomas Howes of Yarmouth, Mass. 1637 - 2004","review":"Can I give it 10 stars? I was delighted with this book, beautifully illustrated, excellently researched, truly an heirloom."},{"Title":"Telling Secrets: An Artist's Journey Through Childhood Trauma","review":"This book is an eye opener for people who haven't experience childhood abuse. For those who have, it points the way to redempetion and growth."},{"Title":"Brigham Young, the man and his work","review":"Although this book is called \\"Brigham Young: The Man and His Work,\\" it would be better called, \\"Brigham Young: His Work.\\" As Taylor notes in the introduction to \\"The Last Pioneer: John Taylor, a Mormon Prophet,\\" In the 500+ pages of this book, not once does Nibley mention that Brigham Young had more than one wife.Moreover, I'd refine the title in two more instances: \\"Brigham Young: His political work, a documentary history.\\"Admittedly, Brigham Young is a man who defies categorization. Religionist, colonist, politician, historical figure: he is all of these, and much more. So any one-volume biography is going to miss something.But Nibley's focus is narrower than his title indicates. In fact, the book is mostly a series of cited documents (hence my inclusion of \`a documentary history' in my proposed refined title), with first person connecting sentences.So as you read, you feel like you are standing next to an eager archivist who is giving you a sneaking glance at his collection. Thus it is not quite history, lacking analysis.But this does not make the book bad.(This chatty approach may be a Nibley family characteristic. Hugh W. Nibley wrote \\"During the winter of 1921, when President [Charles] Nibley was writing his reminiscences at Ocean Park, California, he used to read the manuscript to the family of the author in the evenings, telling as he went the much better stories left out of the official biography. This was one of them, and has since been repeatedly confirmed by Preston Nibley, who had it from the same source\\"Brother Brigham Challenges the Saints (The Collected Works of Hugh Nibley, Vol 13), Ch. 13, n 1).So this book is good if you are looking for a survey book, or an alternative toBrigham Young: American Moses. And if you want to know Brigham Young's external accomplishments--cities founded, tours and preaching circuits made, and his teachings as a prophet and as a governor. It's a mix of secular and spiritual. But then again, Young always denied there was a hard and fast line between the two.But what if you want to know Brigham Young the man? Part of the man is here: again, there are ample primary sources in the book. And his ideas can be found inDiscourses of Brigham YoungandTeachings Of Presidents Of The Church - Brigham Young.But If a person is interested in the complex (to say the least) family life of the man, it's not here. A supplementary read isBrigham Young At Home."},{"Title":"New Marketing Manifesto Hb","review":"In short this is a really refreshing read. It explains the new trends in emerging 21st centuary brand. Cetral to the theme is the customer centricity of brand building."},{"Title":"The Storm","review":"I read this book as an e-mail book and was very impressed with the first work by this author. She was able to build characters and keep them consistent in their behavior throughout the work. I am looking forward to more works by her. I'm now buying it in hard back to re-read."},{"Title":"The Storm","review":"I'm a huge fan of Della's work in the area of fanfiction online and am now an even bigger fan of her original writing. This book is amazingly unique and a spellbinding read: I didn't put it down for 48 hours! Incredible 3D characters, beautifully described settings and a brilliant plotline make this first book in the Gates of Transformation series a joy to read.So buy it! Buy it now!"},{"Title":"The Storm","review":"This is not your typical supermarket time-waster fiction. Ms Boynton takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotional adventure. The trials and tribulations of the main character would seem outre and extreme but they follow logically from the premise - what if your soul were snatched from the void just as it left your body, only to be attached to another person's body - someone of the opposite sex? What can compare with this kind of extreme identity crisis? Thus begins a trek to find, hold and reconcile identity with internal knowledge, external form, and society's expectations.The author's style is rough and unpolished - which suits the work well. The story moves too fast to stop and dawdle on niceties of style. It's not PC and not romantic, just raw. I consider it a rare work striking to the core of experience."},{"Title":"Closing the Ring","review":"Churchill writes narrative as well as he gives speeches. The fascinating thing about this volume is the not yet recognized decline of Great Britain and its empire by Churchill. Even though Britain played a big role in the war it is slowly being moved to the margins. This was apparent during the Tehran conference when Roosevelt refused to meet in private with Chruchill because he was concerned it would look like the Anglo-Americans were conspiring. Great reading.However, this scanned version of Churchill's history is chock full of misspelled words. Couldn't someone at least proof read it before putting it out there in digital form?"},{"Title":"Closing the Ring","review":"As I've written elsewhere, this edition of this wonderful series is badly produced for the Kindle by the use of a optical scanner that errs often. The producers did not even apply a spellchecker, which would have caught some significant percentage of the errors."},{"Title":"Closing the Ring","review":"Book is very well written and is a must for true WWII history buffs. Possibly a little too detailed at times. The Appendix section is a must read for a true history buff. Many of the tables and charts are not readable on my Kindle."},{"Title":"Closing the Ring","review":"This is Churchill's personal view of the politics, strategy, events, personalities and pressure points of the middle segments of WW II. It is very clearly written, and quite specific in detail as to exactly what the factors were that influenced the decisions made in this phase of the war. Churchill's relations with both Roosevelt and Stalin are covered in detail, and his hopes and fears at each point clearly outlined. The extent to which he anticipated Stalin's later behavior is very interesting, as well. The influence that the availability of LST's had on the timing of various campaigns is interesting, particularly in light of his involvement with the vehicle, mentioned in \\"Their Finest Hour\\". This is one of a series all told from his standpoint, encompassing pre-war and wartime circumstances."},{"Title":"Closing the Ring","review":"I am reading this whole series of books and they are very good. I love history and can't get enough of it. I have found that non-fiction is much more interesting than fiction, and I love biographies and auto-biographies."},{"Title":"Closing the Ring","review":"Churchill on Churchill is a great read for the fan of biographical history. In this day of sound bites and one liners this is so intense and broad based as to be a page turner in the truest Shakesperean tragic tradition. We know the results but the process is engaging. A great complement to writers such as Barbara Tuchman. A panorama of history with geopolitics from a different age and time."},{"Title":"Looking At Pictures","review":"I checked out this book from the library because, as an adult, I felt I didn't know enough about paintings to appreciate them fully when I visited an art gallery. This book briefly covers a large number of aspects of art including color, perspective, portraits, and landscape. The paintings used as examples are many and varied and they are beautifully reproduced. I learned many things but as I read, I came up with many more questions the book did not answer. However, I am a 36-year-old college graduate. I believe that the book is quite informative for its recommended age group: 9-12. I am getting a copy for my artistic nephew's tenth birthday."},{"Title":"A Modern Herbal (Volume 2, I-Z and Indexes)","review":"This is the best and only reference for the history, culture and use of thousands of herbs.

Furthermore, plants are more and more used by cosmetic industry.You should keep in mind that even \\"harmless\\" medical plants can course dangerous allergies if the hole plant is used.

You are looking for today's information on herbs. After all, only the latest and greatest will do. And, here it is on Mountain Valley Growers recommended book site. What could be better? Not much! But, this is not a book hot off the presses. This two volume encyclopedia goes back 60 years, when two women put their individual skills together to create a work that should be on every herb gardeners shelf. The writer Maud Grieve and her faithful editor Hilda Leyel created a work that has not been duplicated since. We use this book at least once a week here. Each plants many common names are listed as well as the part used and its habitat. They give us a growth description, talk about the chemical components of each herb and advise us on the medicinal action of these components and how they are used. If other species of the same genus are used that is included. Every time I pick these books up I learn something new and I have been reading and studying herbs for 20 years. Two of my favorite sections are on lavender and hops.

A lay herbalist for many years, I've thumbed through countless books that censor themselves for fear of legal action. Their listings for certain &quot;toxic&quot; herbs saying nothing more than two sentences on how a particular herb should be avoided at all costs.In A Modern Herbal, we get a peek at a pre-litigious era, where herbs were used and studied with caution, but certainly not discarded entirely.I particularly enjoy cross-referencing herbs I enjoy (melissa, st. john's wort) in both this book and modern books (Susun Weed, Michael Tierra, et al) to get a fresh perspective on the tried and true.Beyond the wealth of information, I've also enjoyed the writing style. I've read passages out loud to my sweetheart for a good chuckle."},{"Title":"A Modern Herbal (Volume 2, I-Z and Indexes)","review":"This is Volume I (A-H) of a two part paperback version of Mrs. Grieve's book. The text is tiny and it is a REFERENCE book -- but one that can prove useful for those interested in learning more about the many uses of herbs. If you're a serious herbalist, this is the dictionary.Many herbs (leaves, roots, fruits) were used for medicinal purposes by traditional people, and plant extracts still make up a large share of the inventory of modern pharmacies. Owing to a virtual monopoly on plant sources, big pharmaceutical companies charge the average customer $$ (mucho dinero) for plant extracts our grandparents cultivated and harvested from their kitchen gardens for relatively little or no cost.If you have the space, you might grow some herbs --especially those used for food. Also, farmer's markets and community food co-ops are good sources. Although I live in an urban area, a food co-op 5 blocks away carries many of the holistic medicines and herbal remedies I use--at much less cost than I would incur at the local grocery or health food store.

Traditional approaches may be dated according to some folks, but for many of us, they do not have the &quot;sell-by&quot; date which permeates modern society. Many of the old remedies have never been subjected to the &quot;scientific&quot; testing of modern times or USDA approved. However, the curative and/or prophylactic properties of herbal substances have been known for centuries, and information about their uses has been handed down from one woman to another. I have been fortunate because I have had relatives who knew the old ways, and passed them along. (Like passalong plants.)And, while modern pharmaceutical companies will not tell you this, they are 1) using old methods--only now you must pay big bucks and buy the plant extract over the counter as a perscription drug -- for example, Valium is derived from the root of the Red Valerian, Digitalis from the Fox Glove, and Poppy juice--well--you can still buy that on the street--it's called heroine; 2) testing the properties of plants used in folk remedies and marketing the stuff as fast as they can--Echinacea, and Ginger for example.So, read the information in this REFERENCE book and form your own opinions."},{"Title":"A Modern Herbal (Volume 2, I-Z and Indexes)","review":"I have several shelves of herbal books in my den, and I have to say that none are as complete and informative as this two-book set by Maud Grieve. As a relatively new student to phytotherapy (herbal therapy), I am finding these books to be the reference that I go back to again and again for the most comprehensive information. These books not only describe the medicinal uses, chemical compositions and harvesting techniques of the herbs, but also the useage history and everyday (aka non-medicinal) recipes and useages. It should be noted, however, that these books are from England, and the focus of harvesting locale is often unrelated to my own North American terrain. As well, they are several years old and may not reflect the most up-to-date studies. Nonetheless, I would HIGHLY recommend this set to anyone who has even a cursory interest in the herbal area, as an integral part of your reference library!"},{"Title":"A Modern Herbal (Volume 2, I-Z and Indexes)","review":"If you just have a love of herbs and plants or are a serious student of herbal lore and research you need these books. (both volumns I &amp; II)I don't know how many times I have been pulling my hair out, from trying to find a specific herb and what its either used for or what it was used for, only to end up with going to one of the two volumns by Maud Grieve and finding them. Silly me, for not checking with these two books first when I started getting stumped.The research done in the books is extensive, some of the medicinal uses are outdated, or the plants aren't used anymore. For a set of books to last and be reprinted, and still be in print after 50+ years is astounding. Ok its astounding to me, you might not be so astounded, just slightly impressed.Not only do you get the plant descriptions within these books, the plants that are poisonious are marked as such. Virtually everything you might think you need to know about a specific plant is here. Exceptions being the modern research. One great thing I have found though is, once you have located the elusive plant of your desire, it makes it 100% easier to track down its modern uses if there are any.If you don't have these books, regardless of your interest in plants, you should. The price is wonderful, the information fantastic."},{"Title":"A Modern Herbal (Volume 2, I-Z and Indexes)","review":"I was fortunate enough to find both this and volume 2 for a very cheap price at a used bookstore. The price was more than worth it. Discusses the medicinal, culinary, cosmetic and economic properties of a large variety of herbs, beginning with aconite and ending in the H's. The materia medicas have been broken into 2 parts, but the full index is available in both versions. Strangely enough, above the index on each page it doesn't say list of plants, but lists of plates. If anyone could explain this to me, I'd appreciate it.Overall a very worthy reference aide. Not the one I turn to the most but one I do use quite a bit. Information is not spared on herbs, and each gets at least a page, with tiny text. Sometimes an old poem or piece from an ancient Materia Medica is given as a treat, such as with Culpeper and Gerard. There really aren't many recipes and formulas in these books but the ones given can be useful. For instance, apple butter, Almond butter, Almond milk etc ( much is written on almonds )I especially enjoyed all the folklore details included here, very nice in rich history. Diagrams adorn many pages, in black and white, all helping the old feel appeal.A great choice for reference materials, now considered classics."},{"Title":"A Modern Herbal (Volume 2, I-Z and Indexes)","review":"I knew M.

But what I found more interesting was Hewitt's personal transformation as a result of his separation from the civilized(?) world.

Guthrie's \\"The Way West\\" (1949) is a western historical novel that describes a journey on the Oregon Trail in 1845. In 1950, the book received the Pulitzer Prize, and in 1968 it was made into a movie. The book is part of a series of western novels by Guthrie (1901 -- 1991) of which this book and its predecessor, \\"The Big Sky\\" are the best known.For many years, my work had a great deal to do with the American west and with American history. If I had known this novel, perhaps I would have had a fuller, more informed perspective on what I was about. In a simple, rough prose, Guthrie explores the characters of the early American pioneers who risked the arduous journey to Oregon and their motivations for doing so. The book describes the hardships of the journey in terms of difficult terrain ranging from desert to rivers and mountains, illness, stampedes and rattlesnakes. Much of the novel is about the relationship between the settlers and the various Indian tribes. The book is replete with scenic descriptions from sand and barenness to majesty. The story at times moves forcefully and with drama and tension while in other places like an old wagon train it seems to plod along. The book is told in a third-person narrative voice, but Guthrie frequently gets inside his characters as they discuss or meditate on intimate thoughts.The book begins in Independence, Missouri in 1845 as a group of residents gather together to risk the long journey. Most of the primary characters get introduced early, and they are fleshed-out and differentiated as the book progresses. The three major figures are Tadlock, an ambitious, agressive former politician from Illinois, Lije Evans, a farmer with a wife Rebecca and 17-year old son, and Dick Summers, a former mountain man familiar with the ground who is hired to pilot the wagon train to Oregon. Leadership and its nature forms a strong theme in the book. Tadlock initially is chosen as the leaders of the expedition, but the travelers rebel at his arbitrary and frequently harsh decisions. A reluctant Evans becomes the leader in his stead and gradually gains the confidence and wisdom that comes with maturity. With his knowledge and tact, the mysterious Summers is the key to the successful navigation of the trail.The book describes the many different reasons that people often pulled up roots and undertook a long, dangerous journey with no guarantees at the end. The search for a better life, restlessness, and a belief in the United States, among other things, played roles. Near the mid-point of the book, Evans meditates on his own reasons and \\"yonderings\\" for the trip and those of his companions.\\"Again he felt greatness, smallness and greatness both among such wild riches. And, seeing the train widing behind him, he thought with pride of it, of the onwardness of its people, of their stubborn, unthough-out yondering. It wasn't a thing for reason, this youndering, but for the heart, where secrets lay deep and mixed. Money? Land? New chances? Patriotism? All together they weren't enough. In the beginning, that is, they weren't enough, but as a man went on it came to him how wide and wealthy was his country, and the pride he had talked about at first became so real he lost the words for it.\\"Much later in the journey, Evans reflects again on the gritty persistence required to undertake the trip and to reach the goal:\\"Now when they were about to come to it again, to lower down the bluff and try the ford, Evans told himself that if any train could get to Oregon, this one could. It had the best pilot that he knew of, best man and pilot both. Its stock was poor but no poorer than would come behind. Its wagons were as good as others would be by the time they reached the ford. But it was the men he counted on, the men and women and spirit of the company. They had their faults, he knew. They had their differences and sometimes spoke severe, what with sand in their teeth and worries in their heads, but they wished well for one another and they hung together. Lere where sometimes he heard the trains split up, old On-to-Oregon stayed one.\\"Besides describing the hardships of the journey and the nature of leadership, the novel perceptively discusses gender roles, (women receive a large, highly sympathetic portrayal in the book for their efforts on the trail, for their fortitude, and for their relationships with men), sexuality and its difficulties along the way, religion, and the tortured relationship between the settlers and the many different Indian tribes en route and at the destination in Oregon.\\"The Way West\\" seems to me part of a long tradition of American \\"road\\" novels from \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" through \\"On the Road\\" in addition to being a historical novel and a western. The book offers a positive, largely heroic vision of the American ideal, as befitting a winner of the Pulitzer Prize. Although the characters are frequently flawed and selfish, their collective story and vision are inspiring. \\"The Way West\\" is a moving novel that will encourage reflection on character, the settlement of the American west, and the American experience.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"The Way West","review":"this is the best book about the history of the western movement other than a text book that I have ever read....and I deal in western literature. It is a Pulitzer Prize winner and you will find out why within the first chapter. The book takes real life events that faced the pioneers and puts them into a novel using fictionalized characters......like living what it was like to \\"go west\\" thru the eyes and feelings of several families.A wonderful read if you can handle to never ceasing travails."},{"Title":"The Way West","review":"This is the second book in a 6 part series and the writing style and story line don't miss a beat. It changes direction with different characters, but it is as if you are reading one big book. Guthrie has a way of taking the reader into the time and places of his characters that makes one endeared to them. I did find myself wanting to hurry and get done because I was getting bored toward the end; I get bored easily. Anyway, Guthrie is great and his books are some really good \\"guy\\" type of books."},{"Title":"The Way West","review":"I rated Guthrie's The Big Sky five stars and gave this book four stars. One character, the mountain man Dick Summers, is carried over from the previous book. I don't wish to give away the story so will just say that the story was well-written, well developed and just about fully realistic. If ever a case could be made for reincarnation, then Guthrie would be the poster child. Hard to believe he could write these books without having experienced the people and places firsthand. That's high praise. Next up in the trilogy of Dick Summers is Fair Land, Fair Land. I will be reading that one shortly. As for the first two, they are highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Way West","review":"This book was chosen as a selection for our Pulitzer Book Club, where we read a Pulitzer Fiction Book six times a year. Being a decendent of a family that came by covered wagon to California and having family living near Barlow Trail in Oregon, I really appreciated the author's depection of the daily struggle and successes of the families coming from Missouri to Oregon. The book group, as a whole, felt that the characters were not developed enough and the book was written more for youth. I disagree. These people were not on the whole educated people but they were people desiring a different and better life not only for themselves but for the United States. I am glad I read this book and I hope to give the whole trilogy to my family."},{"Title":"The Way West","review":"I just finished reading this book last night and I loved it! Although the plot is kinda slow, the descriptions and details of the On-to-Oregon's trip are breathtaking and make you feel like you are in a wagon yourself. I haven't read The Big Sky, but I do really like the character Dick Summers. I'd have to say that Mercy McBee was my least favorite character (save for Mack)but the ending was fitting I suppose :)"},{"Title":"The Way West","review":"In my opinion, this book portrays exactly what it must have been like to have traveled over land in a covered wagon. I could almost smell the dust, and feel the jolts and bumps of the wagons as they rolled across the land. The characters become alive as the journey starts. I hated to finish the book, and yet, could not put it down. It was excellent reading!"},{"Title":"The Way West","review":"Probably the finest book ever written about pioneer settlers moving west. Stirring renditions of what it was like to battle the elements for survival. A true account of the West set with fictionalized characters. If I were to pick one book about the Western movement, other than a text book, to have in my library, this would be it. Gut renching chapter about trying to save the life of a little boy who was bit by a rattle snake with no medicines other than crude remedies they had heard of to use. Other passages just as gripping. No wonder it won the Pulitzer Prize"},{"Title":"The Way West","review":"I'm glad a used book store I go to had this old tattered book for sale. I agree it was a little confusing in the beginning with so many characters, but eventually you become completely at home with them through Guthrie's simple and beautiful writing. I experienced an exciting ride along on the wagon train to Oregon with a greatly varied cast of pioneers. The hardships, and the ingenuity of the people to overcome them are simply amazing. I don't normally pick up westerns, but the fact that it was a pulitzer prize winner caught my eye."},{"Title":"The Way West","review":"I thought the story mediocre at best. Why this won the Putlizer instead of The Big Sky is beyond me. Gutherie is a obviously a passionate writer about his beloved west but when it comes to telling an action story, he does not hold a candle to Harry Combs who wrote Brules or The Scout. I thoroughly enjoyed The Big Sky but found The Way West somewhat tedious. Towards the end, I was scaning instead of reading.

Although in the moments when something does happen, I sort of found myself not caring because there are so many characters, mostly non-descript, to which the reader never attaches. Even the death that greets the caravan happens to characters you've only just met so that you're never very struck by the peril.However, the book is clearly written with some passages that inspire interest in the old great West. In particular, I was taken by one passage: \\"Again he felt greatness, smallness and greatness both among such wild riches. And, seeing the train winding behind him, he thought with pride of it, of the onwardness of its people, of their stubborn, unthought-out yondering. It wasn't a thing for reason, this yondering, but for the heart, where secrets lay deep and mixed. Money? Land? New chances? Patriotism? All together they weren't enough.

But, rest assured that this is not the case of \\"The Way West,\\" A.B. Guthrie's follow-up to \\"The Big Sky,\\" and the second of six books in The Big Sky series. How good are these two volumes? Well, the first has been designated \\"the best novel of the American West\\" by the Western Literature Association. \\"The Way West\\" won the Pulitzer Price for fiction in 1950. Which is the better book? Impossible to tell, they're almost like two books in one. \\"The Way West\\" begins where \\"The Big Sky\\" ends in 1846 as Dick Summers, a true mountain man introduced in the original, is living as a farmer in Missouri. His sickly wife has just died and he is urgently asked to be the guide for a wagon train departing from Independence to Fort Vancouver in Oregon. What follows next are months of exciting adventures among the Indians, rattlesnakes, stampeding buffalo, raging rivers, and other obstacles they have to surmount in the quest to the west. The pacing of \\"The Way West\\" is similar to \\"The Big Sky.\\" Quiet passages wherein we get to really know the many principal characters of the book interspersed with tension filled episodes of action. The details of the trek, the dialogue, the characters are so real that this book compels the reader to keep turning pages late into the night. It's amazing to discover and reflect on what these settlers went through to expand our country from sea to sea. I can't say enough good things about these two books, and once I take a breather, I'll move on to the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Way West","review":"This book changed the way I read novels. I used to read mostly fast-paced books with lots of excitement, \\"page-turners\\" that propel you towards the ending. Although The Way West has a good story line, it did not develop in the way I expected. I kept waiting for the Indian attacks and shoot-outs, standard fare for a novel about a wagon train, but they never quite came. In the meantime I started to appreciate the way the author got into the minds of the characters, how well he described their lives and journeys.This book is not so much about telling a story about a wagon train as telling the individual stories of the people in it. The book describes their day-to-day lives, their attitudes and motivations, and gives insight into the times in which they lived. The landscapes of the early west are painted beautifully. Guthrie does all of this in a writing style which is very readable.Most novels today use techniques to keep you on the edge of your seat, so that when you finish a chapter you want to dive into the next. They manipulate the reader and compel you forward to the finish line and - if the author is crafty enough - to the next book in the series. This is much more about selling books than creating art.I found that when I reached the end of a chapter in The Way West, I was often inclined to return to the start of the chapter and read it again. After reading this book, I started looking for books of greater substance, that create lasting images. Guthrie's other books fit the bill nicely.The Way West is a beautifully written book. Slow down and enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Way West","review":"This sequel to The Big Sky continues the story of Dick Summers. It would be very beneficial to first read The Big Sky. I actually found The Big Sky more interesting and if possible, better-written, than The Way West. Both books are extremely interesting and hard to put down. The Way West tells the story of a wagon train on its way to Oregon. Dick Summers, an experienced mountain man, agrees to lead the group to Oregon. This takes place in the early days of the Oregon Trail when men were still working out the exact route they would take. There are six Big Sky novels of which The Way West is the second. I am currently reading the third book in the series, Fair Land, Fair Land. It is every bit as good as the first two. All of these books are historically accurate and, once again, very hard to put down. I highly recommend The Way West!! Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"The Way West","review":"The Way West is the second in the series of great Western novels by A.B. Guthrie. The story picks up in 1846 in Independence, Missouri, jumping off point for the Oregon Trail.Former mountain man Dick Summers is coaxed out of farm life and back in to the saddle as the pilot of an early wagon train bound for the Willamette Valley. Summers is an American archetype - doesn't say much, doesn't get excited, knows how do the important outdoor things, he's beyond mere competence, but not braggy, even-tempered, yet underneath it, a compassionate man. Elijah ('Lije') Evans, the main new protagonist, becomes an unlikely leader of the cavalcade.Guthrie introduces the characters that populated the Old West - big and small, courageous and cowering, mostly ordinary people. The book is excellent in historical detail - you feel like you are climbing Independence Rock along with Brownie Evans or crossing the Snake. The reader gets a real sense of the extreme difficulty of these early wagon train trips. To quote Dick Summers, \\"It ain't easy, but it ain't beyond doin' either.\\"Highest recommendation for anyone interested in the American West."},{"Title":"The Way West","review":"I read this book because I so loved Guthrie's' first book, \\"The Big Sky\\". This is the one that won the Pulitzer though.I have never been taken into a persons impression of the country around them or the grief at losing a loved one or any other emotional high or low place the way Mr. Guthrie could in this story.In fact, if you are a writer or student of good writing or have any kind of appreciation for amazing prose like I have never found it anywhere in my life, then you simply must read this book. It's amazing that he can capture the wandering mind; the guilt and isolation, brotherhood and comradery, the follies of the heavy mind through lack of experience vs. the been there done that of the seasoned individual in an idiom unmatched.So why the 4 stars you ask? Well should it be 4.5 stars? Frankly I wanted a touch more action. I loved the writing style . It was an experience and should be part of a true connoisseurs bookshelf. The writing was slightly better in this tome, but The Big Sky was a better story in my humble opinion."},{"Title":"The Way West","review":"I read The Big Sky two decades ago and was enthralled. Because I thought it impossible to top, I shied away from the sequel. But, while vacationing with my now adult daughter in Durango a week ago,I saw this title, and unable to buy her The Big Sky due to lack of inventory, I bought this for myself and had it completed in three evenings. It is a taut, moving, unromantic, yet inspiring account that brings the necessary humanity to our ancestors. While so many of us sit passively in awe of the pioneer achievements, books like this, with it's overriding realism avoiding angel and devil stereotypes, make me realize that there go you and I in another era. The heroism, strength and weaknesses of these characters is within and around us. Keep your map handy, especially if you are from and familiar with the West. You will travel right with them."},{"Title":"The Way West","review":"A.B. Gutrhrie has a mastery of the days of the mountain men and the first pioneers to cross the great divide to settle the far west. The feeling of being along the trail, the trails and joys of the people, and the land they crossed, can not be presented in a more expressive manner than by Guthrie. Most of all, understanding Dick Summers and his love of the untaimed land, wildlife, and people, wanting it not to change, but knowing his is part of the reasons in will, brings a deep feeling of sorry to anyone who feels as he did."},{"Title":"The Way West","review":"The Way West is the \\"epic saga\\" of a wagon train heading west to Oregon and although The Way West was a bit hard to get into, it was a real page-turner. At the beginning of the novel, the characters all blend together and it was hard to differentiate between them all. However, after the wagon train \`hits the trail', A.B. Guthrie does a fantastic job at portraying the individuality of all of the pioneers through tone and imagery. The McBees, the 1800s equivalent to \`trailer-trash', are represented as such when Guthrie makes Hank McBee out to be an arrogant, hot-headed, ignoramus. Likewise, I almost cried when the Fairman's sick boy Tod gets bitten by a rattlesnake and dies. Guthrie does a brilliant job at characterization throughout the entire novel.In fact, it is Guthrie's characterization that portrays the prominent (in my opinion) theme of the novel, that morality is subjective and cannot be used to effectively judge character.When I first picked up this book, I expected it to be a stereotypical western, complete with hostile Native Americans and disease-ridden pioneers. However, I found that Guthrie was very realistic about his wagon train and stayed away from typical motifs often found in westerns. Although I would probably not read it again, The Way West was an enjoyable novel and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a quick read."},{"Title":"The Way West","review":"An outstanding story of American pioneers. This book is timeless. You feel like you are part of the wagon train on this incredible journey over the Oregon trail in 1845. This isn't some light Hollywood yarn. It is an immensely satisfying story rich in character development. You just don't want it to end. A classic."},{"Title":"The Way West","review":"Basic ReviewI was told to read the way west as a highschool [kid]. I'm glad I did! I havn't read The Big Sky the first in the series I only knew that is was a series after I read the way west but I still eaisly followed. Guthrie is an author that convey feelings and messages is little words a compelling gift. He also has a way with discription and makes understand the characters personality and way of thinking completely. I have long since been interested in the Oregon Trail and life of the pioneers and will gladly read the whole series. This book tells the harsh truth but without sentiment meaning it didn't bring tears to my eyes but made me stop and think. By the end of the book I was thankful for modern times though it made me reflect on modern families.About the BookThe book starts out telling the story of Lije and Becky Evans and son Brownie after they get \\"the fever\\". They decide to go west to Willamette Valley Oregon to help settle the territory for America (joining a wagon train with people of different backgrounds and storys). Dick Summers and ex-mountain man agrees to go along and piot the train it encreasingly becomes his story. He falls in love with the mountains and old trails once more they don't understand it is part of him and at first envy how he knows and can do everything with little. If it were not for him the train would of gone through more trials and hardships than it did. He becomes best friends with them and there is a sence of loss when the mountains reclaim him. I want to know what happens the Evans family Guthrie wrote it that way and I was amazed I would like and appreciate a book written in 1950. I recomend this to everyone and history buffs finding it hard to get good books on the Oregon Trail before 1850+. The Way West had found a place in my heart and I declare it a classic by my standards for teens to adults. I know that everyone will approve and enjoy this book.

For, have not many of us as children felt drawn to an inanimate object which seemed to radiate warmth to us? Well, yes, that's a pun; but you see what I mean.I always thought that this story would have made a wonderful family movie -- August, feverish and seeing visions the night he is told by his father that the stove is being sold; the dance of the objects in the storeroom at the palace, and Hirschvogel's majestic speech to them; August's meeting the king; and perhaps a re-fashioned ending in which August is allowed to return home to his family for Christmas.

Sometimes, the puns and literary license Walser take can be willful and test a reader's patience, but the sheer force of his philosophy and world view contained in these miniaturist stories are awe-inspiring, and are on par with the delirious vision of Kafka. Walser is a kind of a writer who can turn from anger to unbearable tenderness within a sentence. Many of these stories will move you and frustrate you at the same time, but all the risks he takes are still, and I suspect always will be, thrillingly modern and relevant. I only wish his excellent reworkings of fairy tales (I'm thinking especially of 'Snow White') could have been included in this volume. Walser has been neglected for far too long, and the longer his work languishes in obscurity, the world is that much more at a loss."},{"Title":"Selected Stories","review":"Unplug the phone, cancel all your appointments, put the cat out -- okay, you can keep the cat. But Robert Walser's wonderful \\"Selected Stories\\" must be read in an atmosphere of silence, with complete attention. You owe it to yourself to have a chance to appreciate this utterly distinctive voice. Others have called him a \\"comic Kafka,\\" and others have complained that he is not a \\"comic Kafka,\\" so perhaps we can stipulate that he is \\"the writer who is not a comic Kafka.\\" He is, indeed a good deal more hospitable and accessible than Kafka, but he is not always comic in \\"A Little Ramble,\\" (which might be my favorite of these collected short items), he can stop you in your tracks. I haven't read Walser's novel, \\"Jakob von Gunten,\\" yet (though I certainly plan to) but I wonder if Walser's peculiar talents aren't particularly suited to a form that is ephemeral, almost furtive.Read \\"The She Owl,\\" which has a gentle charm. Read \\"Parisian Newspapers,\\" which has an edge. Oh, read them all, listening to catch Walser's extraordinary voice. And aboave all, read \\"A Little Ramble,\\" which might be the best onc-page story in the language."},{"Title":"Selected Stories","review":"\\"Wandering, what a brilliant, light blue joy you are!\\"If the absolute inevitable truth of every word of that sentence isn't immediately clear to you, you may not be the kind of reader who will be knocked off your feet by Robert Walser, whose typical prose piece is always a kind of wandering. The most acclaimed piece (and the best, I think) in this collection is in fact titled \\"The Walk,\\" a perfectly honest title that serves to summarize the plot.If you're one who needs beginnings, middles, and ends...If you insist on naturalistic dialogue...If you want at least a modicum of happening...you may not be the kind of reader who will rave about Walser to your friends, as I have been doing since I started reading him a couple years ago.Walser was roughly a contemporary of Franz Kafka, who read and seems to have been influenced by Walser. Although Walser wrote four long pieces usually labeled as novels, his most characteristic works are short sketches, two to ten pages, only rarely resembling anything most people would call a story. Some of Walser's work was published in his lifetime, and he had a coterie of distinguished fans like Hermann Hesse. Then, after 1933, when he was committed to a \\"madhouse,\\" he was as forgotten as a politician's promise. His rediscovery began with American and English readers, especially translator Christopher Middleton.By our times, Walser is widely perceived as a pioneer surrealist; his work certainly has surreal effects, but his intentions, as I read him, were never to extend reality but merely to capture it as he alone saw it. That he was, perhaps, slightly mad and certainly eccentric did refract his vision in unexpected and original colors. His subject, even when writing in his not-fooling-anyone disguise as a simple man, was always his own strange, joyful, aimless personality.Catch the word \\"joyful\\" there! Walser is NOT a depressing writer. He's a man enchanted with everything, from mustard to mountains. He's wry, salty, silly, satirical, and sooo penetrating.The translations in this collection are close to the character of Walser's \\"wandering\\" German. There's another collection - Masquerade - translated by Susan Bernofsky. I prefer Bernofsky somewhat for syntactical cleverness in translating, but this collection includes The Walk, the most picturesquely brilliant of all Walser's prose.Some critics have said that Walser was a columnist before there were columns, and it's easy to imagine Walser being a huge success reading his pieces on NPR, but for all their apparent inconsequentiality, Walser's works have a profundity that will accumulate as you read."},{"Title":"Selected Stories","review":"Robert Walser. I came to this Teutonic scribner by way of a jackass professor I had in graduate school. In his class on Modern European literature we read \\"Jacob von Gunten,\\" a 1st person neurotic diatribe about a man enrolled in a servant's college. Unlike the professor's lectures, I enjoyed certain passages of that work immensely, especially the transcendental moments where the main character describes how he melts into the shuffling masses in the city where he lives. Other sections were less engaging.I believe that Walser's short stories, at least the ones collected here, are better able to display his literary gifts than that novella. Clearly the masses are an issue he enjoyed writing about, and there are several stories that deal vividly with the dehumanizing reality of city living, as well as office work. Clearly, Walser writes most prolifically in the fist person, a voice that is often driven by angst and inflected with various neuroses (Walser himself ended up in a mental hospital). But what I enjoyed most about this collection were the stories that differed from his normal style. Stories like the \\"She-Owl,\\" \\"Balloon Journey,\\" and \\"Kliest in Thum\\" are some examples. These are short third-person pieces, often only a page and a half long, which tell simple stories as they bend perception, causing the reader to see the world with new eyes. I find these short pieces more entertaining than the fist-person stories, which tend to be heavy on the solipsism and lack structure (see \\"The Walk\\"). There is something Borges about the economy of these stories, and maybe some Cortazar in their oddness. This collection rewards a thorough reading. And afterward the reader will get a better appreciation for Walser's influence upon two of the world's greatest writers - Kafka and WG Sebald. Does Walser eclipse his literary offspring? I'll leave that up to you to decide. But one thing is clear, Walser's literary reputation needs to be reinstated -- and this collection helps."},{"Title":"Selected Stories","review":"Robert Walser's stories are unlike anything you'll ever read, and some readers might quarrel with calling them \\"stories\\" in the first place. Of course, \\"Selected Feuilletons\\" (or \\"Prose Poems\\" or \\"Sketches\\" or \\"Miniatures\\"), while perhaps more accurate, don't have the marketing zing of \\"Selected Stories\\"--and no alternative title captures the modernist quirkiness and range of Walser's flights of plotless prose. One moment he might be writing about the \\"mere silliness\\" of women's trousers (\\"In trousers the poor dears can stride much more comfortably to the voting booth\\"); in another piece, he might describe something as uneventful as a quiet walk through the mountains (\\"We don't need to see anything out of the ordinary. We already see so much.\\")He is too often compared to Kafka, his contemporary and fellow modernist and while it's true Walser influenced the younger writer, I find this comparison quite misleading. Kafka is too busy describing the encroaching walls in a nightmare that never ends, while Walser is outside picking the flowers for a story that never begins. And the dark cynicism that pervades Kakfa couldn't be more distinct from Walser's breezy landscapes. This is not to say that Walser's pieces don't turn gloomy--they do; instead, his gloom tends to the pensive rather than the oppressive, and he relieves the darkness with the lightest of touches. A similarly misleading and imprecise comparison might be to call him an existential Thoreau.I read this book all the way through in a few days; that was a mistake. (It doesn't help that I'm not predisposed to this school of modernist writing, and there's no doubt much of Walser's wordplay is lost in translation.) As with certain modernist or imagist poets of the period, a little bit can go a long way, and there is a crushing sameness (dare I say, cuteness?) that burdens Walser's writing when it is collected and considered en masse. Sampling the book several months later, however, I'm willing to admit that, by not dipping into the book over a longer period of time, I missed some of the aphoristic wit and the lyrical charm. So, oddly enough, although I had originally tossed this collection into the pile for the local charity, I've decided to keep it, to revisit these pieces a second--or third--time, at a more leisurely pace."},{"Title":"Selected Stories","review":"This collection of Walser stories gives you a rough estimate of his creative project-namely, an accumulated micro-portrait of a life devoted to wanderings, observations, and obscurity. Walser was a literary genius whose life is shrouded in madness and tragedy-but his fiction is teeming with poetic life. These sublime musings are musical and woven with sinuous transitions and appellations of the ordinary. They are at once miniatures but they are never strictly minimalist. One could go on and mention his impact on such giants as Kafka, Benjamin, and the like, but you should simply discover the brief texts for yourself. Christopher Middleton's translations are faithful, but occasionally awkward. There is no easy way to translate Walser, but they are still worth reading even if one hasn't any German."},{"Title":"The Princess Diaries, Volumes I & II: Mia Tells It Like It Is (Princess Diaries)","review":"Though I am definitely several years past teenage-hood myself, I still like to read the occasional young-adult book, if for no other reason than to think back a few years when life problems were a lot more fun.I picked up this edition, which combines both the first and second books of _The Princess Diaries_ series, last night for a bit of light reading and managed to finish the entire thing (400 some-odd pages) in less than a day. It's been ages since I've wanted to do that with a book. Both books were easy to read and extremely fun.Mia Thermopolis is an average teenage girl. That is, until her dad shows up to tell her that she's next in line, after him, to rule a small European country. Things start happening pretty quickly after that as Mia comes to terms with who she is and how a Princess is supposed to act (thanks to on-going Princess Lessons with her Grandmere, the dowager Princess).All of the characters, from Mia's austere Grandmere, to her slightly flaky Mom and over-the top best friend Lilly are well-drawn, believable and even likeable (each in different ways, of course). A good book can be based on one very strong character, but in my opinion the thing that makes a great book is an entire cast of wonderful characters. You will definitely find those within the pages of these books.What really made me love both of the books so much, though, (even more than just a great cast of characters) was the humor. Ms. Cabot's writing is light and fresh and just what I've been needing for a bit of a pick me up. More often than not I found myself laughing out loud every few pages.I look forward to reading the next books in the series and plan to also look up Ms. Cabot's other work. You should do the same, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Princess Diaries, Volumes I & II: Mia Tells It Like It Is (Princess Diaries)","review":"My daughter has enjoyed reading this book series. While some have objected to the frank subject matter, the truth is that it addresses the world our tweens and teens live in. It's honest and is probably comforting for many young girls to read, in that they discover others have the same feelings they do. Whether your girl agrees or disagrees with how Mia lives her life, this series can open opportunities for parents and their daughters to have honest discussions about the decisions teen girls must make."},{"Title":"The Princess Diaries, Volumes I & II: Mia Tells It Like It Is (Princess Diaries)","review":"This series of books, of which these are the first three, is entertaining and addictive. I found the character of Mia delightful in a neurotic-teenage-girl kind of way. (Please forgive my redundancy.) From the first I realized that my children were too young yet to enjoy this series - it is inappropriate for anyone pre-teen or younger - but after reading the entire series so far, I've decided that I don't want my children reading it even when they are older.As the series progresses it deals with more and more serious issues in ways that I'm finding less and less responsible and moral. I can overlook the heavy-handed political bias but the moral prejudices worry me. The idea of virginity as anything worthy of saving is laughed at and the concept of waiting until marriage is considered ludicrous even by \\"silly,\\" romantically deluded Mia. Worse, Mia's desire to keep sex as something special is shown as possibly destroying what is supposedly a healthy, potentially life-long, true-love relationship (even though at the point where she is considering having sex she is still under legal age).For any parent who does NOT share the author's values, I would strongly recommend keeping your children and teens as far away from these books as possible. They are too engaging and enjoyable. With all the references to pop culture the world of these books feels like the \\"real\\" world, only lacking in any sort of common sense or traditional values as far as sexual and personal relationships are concerned. If you do not want your children confused by the supposedly \\"modern,\\" hedonistic and self-centered attitudes these books take for granted as normal and proper, it is better not even to let them start reading the series. Once begun, it will be difficult to stop."},{"Title":"Raven","review":"you have to read this book, it's a wonder that this autor is yet translated in english.

It is not a book a non-techical can easily read. I was looking for some theory about manifold design and the book gave me a good impression of the available methods.

The writing is concise but not dry, with the author recounting his personal experiences with ruined VW engines. It has a sense of history, considering the 3.4L Jaguar engine first used in 1948 sufficiently modern to use as a benchmark to measure the late-Nineties Daihatsu against.Some later sections run to several pages of calculations, so you won't read everything, but you'll still get a good qualitative understanding due to the author's own command of the subject."},{"Title":"Engines: An Introduction","review":"This book makes me wish there were a six star or that I'd never given a 5 star to any other product. Lumley goes into very good detail about how to calculate various aspects of engine performance. Then he gives simpler rules of thumb one can use instead. He'll commonly show how those rules of thumb compare to that empirical data both noting how well they compare but then show where they fall short.This book seems as if it might belong in a sophmore class for engineers pursuing a degree related to automobile engine design or in an upper division class for engineers pursuing other lines of work. Just a superb book. I've flags marking equations on about every other page. His writing is clear, concise and simple. An example of the simple language which does not become simplistic is:\\"When the flow velocity through an orifice reaches the local speed of sound, a change in the pressure downstream of the orifice can no longer be communicated to the flow upstream of the orifice.\\"I suspect that even graduate engine designers could use the equations in Lumley's book for estimation of performance. A designer of intake ports, for example, might use such empirical rules of an engine's \\"breathing\\" in order to sketch characteristics only turning to more detailed calculations and simulations when certain that a design fell within realistic bounds.As a software engineer I find this book invaluable in creating the sort of basic simulation which is close enough without cutting corners too much. A simple example is the fact that the speed of sound only rises 1 meter/second from 0% to 100% humidity while a change in temperature has a broader range of change. To reduce the complexity of the calculations, he removes the consideration of of humidity. Even if travelling from a rain forest to a desert salt flat, the difference isn't worth considering except in the most rigorous calculations. The number and kine of examples like this are to numerous to consider in this short review."},{"Title":"Engines: An Introduction","review":"The book is an excellent source for engineers and students as a technical refresher on engine basics."},{"Title":"The Wordsworth Dictionary of the American West (Wordsworth Collection)","review":"This book is invaluable to me as I work in a Museum that specializes in western exploration and life.

The Death of Attila concerns the relations between Huns, Romans and various Germanic tribes in the latter days of the Roman Empire. Characters from different backgrounds struggle to connect, but ultimately, in this book, ethnicity is destiny. This is one of the best historical novels I have read."},{"Title":"The Death of Attila","review":"Cecelia Holland has written a masterful novel that conjures up vivid images of the ancient barbarian world. The main theme of the work is the friendship between Tacs, a Hunnish tribesman and Dietric, a German king's son and the challenges and broken taboos such a friendship represents. Attila himself appears in tantalizing glimpses, a figure of awe and power, yet human withal. This is a novel of real people with everyday problems, not the typical bombastic historical epic usually written in pompous prose from a Roman perspective. The Romans in this novel are bit players, slyly petitioning for the goodwill of a ruler whose empire at its height was far larger than theirs. As Attila says in the book: 'The Romans are not important'. What appeals the most about the story however is its interplay of characters, the cosy companionship of Tacs and his fellows, the discovery of Hunnish and Germanic life as Tacs and Dietric are introduced to each other's world, and the spare, laid-back prose in which it is written. This book would make a great film or play provided it was rendered in the spirit intended by the writer, but I feel that would not include Hollywood (a more European handling perhaps). Cecelia Holland is a natural storyteller, something rare these days. And the Death of Attila is a book that will forever remain in my top ten."},{"Title":"The Death of Attila","review":"I've been a fan of Holland's ever since her first novel, written while she was an undergraduate and published the year after; that was in 1966, a year ahead of me. I've been collecting first editions of her works for years, and she remains, in my considered opinion, the best historical novelist writing in English today. Still, I like best her earlier stuff, most of which is set in various corners of medieval Europe. This one is about the last days of Attila (in AD 453), who formed the diverse Hiung tribes into a nation, and the almost immediate disintegration of his empire without him to hold it together and impress his will upon it. But the story itself focuses on Tacs, a young warrior and something of a ne'er-do-well, though brave in battle and intensely loyal to the Kagan. Then there's Dietric, son of the subject Gepid king, Adaric, who's fascinated by the Huns and becomes friendly with Tacs. There are Tacs's cronies, Monidiak and Yaya and Bryak, also single, who join him in annoying their neighbors, and The Fluteplayer, a great shaman and sort of a surrogate father to Tacs. And there's the Roman monk, Aurelius, who hopes to convert the heathen Hun but ends up understanding them much better than he expected. Holland, as always, puts you right in the midst of the people, showing you how even the strangest of strange cultures makes perfect sense to those immersed in it."},{"Title":"The Death of Attila","review":"The Death of Attila, ISBN 9780595501557, an Authors Guild Backinprint edition printed by iUniverse, Paperback $16.95 by Cecelia Holland is a story about the roving hordes of barbarians and their constant interest in attacking Rome.The story opens with Tacs, a member of Atilla's horde, returning home with the dead body of his friend to provide proper burial. The two men had been on recognizance for Atilla's army in the aborted attack on Rome and had been left behind when they pulled out. His return alone and alive is a monumental accomplishment that increases his favored position with Atilla. Adaric, King of the Gepids, an eastern branch of the Germanic people is an excellent tactician who is aiding Atilla in planning another attack on Rome and is camped nearby. Dietric, his son, is intrigued by the Huns and slowly develops a friendship with Tacs, in spite of the hostility between the different tribes. More of Tacs' friends are introduced and we follow activity through a number of adventures before, during and subsequent to the demise of Atilla.Several theories exist with respect to Atilla's death and the one employed here is the one accepted as most logical.My rating of this book will, no doubt, be unpopular. Unlike the other reviewers, I have never read any of Holland's books, but have read much about the Huns per se and their history. As an initiate, therefore, I am not sure why this book was selected for reintroduction to print except for the author's popularity with her audience - obviously a good reason, but one not obvious to the uninitiated. Also, as an aside, the cover on the new publication (with the man in full body armor) apears to be a \\"stock\\" product and does not seem to be relevant. However, these matters aside, The Death of Atilla is an interesting read about a turbulent time when every tribe seemed to hate every other and the Christian faith was just beginning to make inroads on the pagan world.

Manhold, award winning fiction/non-fiction author."},{"Title":"Tarcadia","review":"I'd heard about this book from a friend, and while it took some doing to locate a copy it was worth every bit of effort to do so. What an amazing telling - I literally could not put this book down once I began that first page... heck, I was hooked from the very first line. Written in first person, the words fly by - as if the speaker were sitting right in front of you, telling you all about those times and adventures and what it meant to live among the tar ponds and what it mean to be boys growing up near and around Sydney Harbor, Nova Scotia. The experiences described are rich in detail and color - the personalities as three dimensional and as real as if looking at your own hand in front of your face - and my own world, after having been expanded by the experience of reading this book, has been unquestionably enriched. It's not going to be everybody's cup of tea, of course, but if there's any bit of an adventurer in your soul, and especially if you're open to living (even vicariously) a slice of life in Sydney (a rather unique corner of Nova Scotia), then by all means indulge yourself in the experience of this novel. One of the best I've read in years. (Be clear: I genuinely loved the book and am thrilled to recommend it - nothing more.)"},{"Title":"Tarcadia","review":"This engaging story of a young boy coming of age in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia is simply a delightful gem of fine writing. Michael Chisholm simply glows with realistic pubescence with all the humor and aching that can bring. His brothers, sister, parents, along with all the other aptyly portrayed Cape Bretonners, remind this writer so much of his own late boyhood and of the time spent on Cape Breton near the titular tar ponds. Beyond the underlying theme of death and loss, the novel also speaks volumes regarding the ecological equipoise of the steel mills, the coal mines, and national pride. Campbell's descriptions of the cityscape of Sydney are also spot on and make this writer long to visit that city again. Gaspereau Press has packaged this delightful book attractively as well.

Shortly before his death, he changed his will so that half of his $105 million dollar estate will go to a daughter he fathered while serving in Vietnam. He had never met this daughter and a condition of the will is that she be alive and living in the United States.Private Investigator, Adam Bruno, son of a bookie, is hired to find the woman. However, since Marshall's family stands to lose half of their inheritance, they aren't helpful. In addition, Matt's friends are from the war and don't like discussing those days with anyone.One of Adam's strengths is his persistance and he gets around to interview Matt's combat buddies. He makes progress but just when he gets a lead on the missing woman, something stands in his way. Adam doesn't know who it is but the person attempting to stop the investigation doesn't stop at murder. In addition, Matt's family and lawyers claim that he is taking too long, not doing his job and should be replaced.This is a touching story that was well done. Adam is an easy character to sympathise with, he's honest, determined and an all around good guy. The conclusion was particularly well done and is a scene that should be on film.Recommended."},{"Title":"The Codicil","review":"This book was recommended by a former Peace Corps volunteer,my friend Rhonda. I cannot thank her enough. I found it to be engrossing and very interesting. I hated to finish it. I wanted the story to go on and on. I always do that with books I really enjoy. I liked all the characters. They seemed believable and as far as the foul language goes, just visit any shopping center or public place and you'll hear much worse. Sorry if it offends you, but that's how society speaks; it's realistic. I would not have minded if it were twice as long as it is. My only problem is the attitude of the characters related to the Vietnam era and their reactions to the war. I am a Nam vet myself and I have none of those negative attitudes. I think the book would have been more representative if all the ex-Nam era people had different outlooks and opinions instead of the same attitudes. I heartily recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read.

He instructs them that there are to find the Vietnamese woman he loved and their child. That child will inherit half of his sizeable estate, fifty million dollars. The problem is, there are people who do not want them found. Mr. Torpor has created characters you learn to care about, a story that sometimes gets entirely too close to what we might imagine what the Vietnam war was like, and what has happened to the guys who fought there. All loose ends are accounted for. I like that in a story."},{"Title":"The Codicil","review":"I'm squeamish but was able to read the gorier parts without much problem. For me, it was a reminder of what war is all about: the ultimate expression of human cruelty which exists and manifests everyday somewhere in the world--maybe just down the block from where you live. Tracking the deceased character and the living character through this realm of human horror as they seek human love and human justice was a good story. &quot;War and Peace&quot; it wasn't but it was a good yarn!"},{"Title":"The Codicil","review":"Topor's legal thriller has a straightforward plot that never loses its momentum.With virtually nothing to go on, and $50 million at stake, lawyer-turned-investigator Adam Bruno is hired to find the Vietnamese child of a former American captain.The former soldier, Matthew Marshall, returned home to become a telecommunications tycoon worth $100 million. Nothing was known of any illegitimate child until the codicil to his will, made recently and unknown to the partners of his heavy-hitting law firm, comes to light when Marshall dies suddenly of a stroke at his country retreat. The codicil, devastating to Marshall's widow and three spoiled children, provides that the original bequests stand if the Vietnamese child can be proved dead or back in Vietnam.Marshall, a man of vast charm and many women, led a compartmentalized life - his home, the cabin where he went to be solitary, and the secret but long-term New York apartment where he brought his various women. None of his friends or his family recall any mention of his Vietnam experiences, though he did take his children to the Wall in Washington.But, visiting Marshall's country retreat, off-limits to family and friends, Bruno encounters a dangerously crazy Vietnam vet, bristling with weapons and paranoia, who guards Marshall's empty home. And Bruno finds a room dedicated to photos and memorabilia of Vietnam. The people in the photographs are identified only by nicknames and as Bruno begins the painstaking process of identification, most of them seem to be dead. Those still living insist Marshall, upright and married, would never have had anything to do with a Vietnamese woman.Running into one stone wall after another, Bruno's case gets a sudden shot of adrenaline when he receives, anonymously, a letter in Vietnamese, written to Marshall by a Vietnamese man who clearly was searching for the missing woman and child.Slowly, doggedly, Bruno pieces together a dark and painful story, crisscrossing the country by jet and computer. Despite setbacks, false trails and dangerous developments, he digs through layers of lies and complex connections. And, naturally, the family back in New York would like to see him fail and will stop at nothing - perhaps not even homicide - to preserve their inheritance and the power they've come to think is theirs by right.While there's nothing particularly original about the story, Topor's straightforward style suits his narrator protagonist - a resourceful, clever, determined fellow, a loner with very individual but firm scruples. Bruno is likable and only ruthless when nothing less will satisfy. A page turner."},{"Title":"The Codicil","review":"If you begin this rapid fire thriller in the evening, be prepared to stay up late. Screenwriter Topor has woven a realistic package of twists and surprises that is hard to put down.When wealthy Matthew Marshall dies, the heirs to his $100 million dollar estate, his wife and three children, find that a codicil has been added to his will. Marshall is bequeathing half his estate to a child they never knew existed, a child he fathered in Vietnam. During his last visit to Vietnam, Marshall had tried without success to find Cricket, the child's mother.Savvy, street smart private detective Alan Bruno is hired by the estate's attorney to find the child. As he begins to discover Marshall's life over the past 30 years and his Vietnamese connection, Bruno is stymied with each new lead. He is aided in his search by a Puerto Rican-Vietnamese interpreter, who finds more information in old letters than words would indicate.Suspense builds as the plot escalates. After a stunning parade of shocks and shivers, Topor skillfully ochestrates a satisfying conclusion."},{"Title":"The Codicil","review":"As a practicing Attorney, I found the book well done. The main character Adam Brono was very believable, but his background was a great deal more developed than mine, and I have ben handling probate cases for 48-50 years. I was sorry to see the book end, because by then I had established a great relationship with all the characters."},{"Title":"The Codicil","review":"I've read many, many novels, mostly thrillers, and this ranks among the very best. On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it a 10. It's first a really great story, told in the first person by someone who is very good at the job he is hired to do in the plot. A few reviews say his language is too crude or rough or some such. Nonsense. He tells the story in a logical and methodical fashion with an appropriate choice of language. I first read this book a number of years ago and kept my copy. I ran across it yesterday, and I decided to read it again, not something I often do. I couldn't put it down until I finished it again. The guy who said it took him two months to read either had an awful lot of other things on his plate or he's a moron. The story grabs you and you're with the protagonist/narrator every step of the way. You like the \\"good guys,\\" and you dislike the \\"bad guys,\\" so the authors must have done his job. I wish that Mr. Topor had some other offerings, but he does not. I thank him mightily for this one. If you like a great detective story, you'll thank me for recommending this book."},{"Title":"The Codicil","review":"Topor won me over with this finely crafted story. Among the pulp I have encountered, it is the best read out there. Few novels keep me up past midnight, but this one did. I hope he writes many more."},{"Title":"The Codicil","review":"The story never slows down and the characters are portrayed as genuine, real people rather than spotless, flawless untouchables. The main character was quickly shown to have a greedy and potentially nasty personality, which was a refreshing change from the usual &quot;I'll take your case for nothing&quot; type. The plot was unpredictable, and entrancing. I await his next book with high expectations and impatience."},{"Title":"The Codicil","review":"I think that the author is a decent writer but his characterizations of soldiers in Vietnam are really detrimental to the memory of the men and women who served in that war. I think using that brutality to exploit the war in order to sell fiction is pretty sick. I would like to know if this author even served on the ground in that war? I know that atrocities were committed but have the decency to report them factually in a book that is not fiction out of respect for all concerned."},{"Title":"The Codicil","review":"I'm amazed that the other reviewer (so far) did not like this book. It was one of the fastest reads I've encountered. I literally could not put it down. Indeed, at one in the morning, my eyes would sag and I would have to fight to keep them open, I wanted so much to see what happened. Codicil is a richly layered, gripping novel. Topor's ear is precise--his dialogue is superb, as are his insights. The only regret I had when I finished the book was that I had reached the end. Well done!"},{"Title":"The Codicil","review":"It started as a good read until I got to the part where ex-GI Tim Cleary is introduced. I read a bit further but finally threw the book away in disgust. With Cleary, Topor has ramped up the Hollywood version of the nutsy American GI to an atrocious level. I pitched the book at Page 95 when he has Cleary state how to treat Vietnamese women. \\"Hit her, stomp her, f... her, blind her, gut her.\\" Torpor did not have to let his mis-guided prejudice spoil what otherwise might have been a good story."},{"Title":"The Codicil","review":"Five hundred and sixty-four pages. 253,800 words... of sheer tedium. Webster's II Unitversity Dictionary defines torpor as: Torpor (tor'por) n. Lat. 1.) ...A state of mental... insensibility.Topor's Codicil fits that definition beautifully. In fairness the tedium may be outweighed by the tenacity of Topor in finishing this exercise in excellent writing. However, he does so at the expense of the reader. Miss pages 554 through 557 and you have missed the entire ending. Plus the prelude TO the ending. It comes not so much as a shock as a relief. Codicil is a book designed as a sure cure for the terminal insomniac."},{"Title":"The Codicil","review":"The first time I read this book I stayed up all night because I could not put it down.

After reading it, I wish he had more novels for me to discover.It has a great pace, and fits somewhat into the cat and mouse category. The search and chase for the info leads protagonist Adam Bruno across the country, back in time and in contact with a wide array of potential leads. It is easy to follow the logical pattern. The procedure is clearly delineated and makes sense.The characters were cleverly drawn and it was no problem to cheer for Adam Bruno. He showed street smarts, resourcefulness and imagination; tinged with just enough sarcasm directed at his smug adversarial employer.I did not find it excessively gory or profane. People who have been thru what many of &quot;The Codicil&quot;'s characters experienced do express themselves in this fashion. I found it realistic and not overdone.It is truly a page turner that took less than a weekend to read. Great stuff!!!"},{"Title":"The Codicil","review":"Overall &quot;The Codicil&quot; was riveting (to me, even more so than &quot;The Testament&quot; and this coming from a devoted Grisham reader). However, I would not recommend it due to the excessive and very unnecessary vulgarity and gore. It seemed at times that the author was going for the shock factor by trying to see how disgusting and violent he could get with his descriptions. Maybe that is what sells books and movies to the general public these days, but for me it's absolutely ridiculous to go to such extremes. I would not read him again."},{"Title":"The Codicil","review":"This could be a good story but I am so disgusted by the crude and obscene language that I am having a difficult time forcing myself even to skip through it fast enough to learn the ending. Are there any other readers out there who feel this way or are we just expected to accept this trash talk as the norm? I got this book because it has been compared to John Grisham's &quot;Testament&quot;. Reading Torpor certainly reaffirmed my admiration for Grisham. Grisham's characters can express the full range of emotions without foul language. Bye, now, it's back to Grisham with a little Jane Austen on the side for me!"},{"Title":"The Codicil","review":"The Codicil is an interesting premise told in a style Jack Webb would be proud of...just the facts. Here is a typical Tom Topor word picture: &quot;I walked into the room. It was about 1500 square feet.&quot; Wow, I've been in a room just like that! This book is populated by one dimensional characters with embarassingly stereotypical dialogue. The bad guys are rich republicans, the vietnam vet is a redneck lunatic, the women are all smart sex objects, the black cop is a street talkin' James Earl Jones who gets to punch up some ridiculous rednecks, etc, etc. There is no style to this novel. It just simply tells details through corny dialogue and researced facts. It's obvious Topor was a reporter because this story reads like a newspaper article. There is no more insight into these characters than you would find in the average &quot;People&quot; magazine human interest fodder. At the end of this book I couldn't care less if all the characters died. And what is Topor's obsession with coffee? No telling how many times various characters coffee making routine is described in excrutiatingly boring detail. This book of bland beautiful people behaving in stereotypical roles, speaking cliched dialogue all leading to the most sophomoric ending since &quot;He was run over by a large brown truck&quot; is certainly destined for a Hollywood treatment. All I can say to that is, &quot;Awesome, dude.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Codicil","review":"Very boring. This took me 2 months to muddle through and I'll never know if the story line could have been interesting, because the author tended to not stick to his subject. You could have cut this book to less than 100 pages and improved the story quite a bit. The rest was all fluff and political commentary and boring. The author fails to come up with even one character worth liking. The characters he tries to get you to like were usually the most reprehensible. How this got published, I'll never know."},{"Title":"Cousins","review":"This is the story of twin sisters Molanda and Neola. They may look similar but their personalities are completely different. Molanda is a hard working divorced mother of Rockean. Neola is the mother of Shaq. She loves her son and nephew but has loose morals. Rev. Isaac Joshiea is the new minister in town. He discovers that there is such a thing as love at first sight. Neola starts to feel jealous because she felt Molanda was stealing her thunder. Neola makes a play for the good minister and gets beat down by Molanda. In reading this book you will laugh so hard that your sides will hurt. Rockean and Shaq were the smartest characters in the whole book. The two cousins knew everything that happened in their family. Many times they gave advice to their mothers and it turned out to be very sound advice. You will meet Ray Ray, Neola estranged husband who never gave up on her, and Taylor, Molanda's no good ex-husband. Once you start reading this book, you won't put it down until completion."},{"Title":"Cousins","review":"I don't know how to express all the emotions I had when I read this book. I am not an African American, instead I am a White woman. This is my first time reading a romance novel written by an African American and it most deffinately won't be my last. I've been looking for the love that's through this book all of my life. No romance novel I've read has ever touched me so deeply. I thought I was the only one who desired a love like Molanda prayed and waited so patiently for. I thought I was the only one who felt pain because I have yet to experience such a love. This author is not writing from mere fantasy. The feelings are to real. They are my feelings.I just learned something about life. Love, Passion, Feelings and Desire are not restricted to color. -- They are universal. Thank you for helping me grow Ms. Dick. You are truly a credit to your profession. I would love to see this book made into a movie. Then maybe, just maybe I can finally stop reading your book. I've read it so many times already.

Most notably, the rise of wireless computing. Today, an updated version of this book would give this prominent mention. Due to its popularity. And also due to the ability for someone remotely to view your wireless activity. Likewise, an update would also go into how you can take your wireless device (usually a laptop) and find hot spots in various urban locations.

I will probably read it again when I have more time."},{"Title":"To Err Is Divine: A Novel","review":"Anna Levay is a quiet person. You might not even notice her if you passed her on the street. She's heavy-ish and sixty-ish, a widowed schoolteacher with a cordially estranged son. She's the terror of her classroom, but a fond memory to two (going on three) generations of students. She's one of the little people in a pervasively corrupt village where only the big people do more than scrape by. Like everyone else in her world she muddles by well enough, just hoping not to attract attention from anyone important.And, quite abruptly, she's a saint or something like it. That embarassing halo was her first clue. It wouldn't go away, but at least no one else seemed to notice. Then the miracles started piling up unintentionally, including mysterious behaviors of animals when she came near, magical (and overly personal) growth of her plants, water into wine (not the done thing in a school environment), and miracle cures. But Anna is a sensible woman with little time for miracles, and a vague wish that they'd just go away. Sensibly, she seeks out a doctor to see if her sainthood can be cured - not that she's so explicit about a state that she barely believe in herself. The doctor, however, is one of the town's venal in-crowd, and quickly realizes the commercial potential of her miraculous cures.Agota Bozai's story is a gentle stroll through the life of this ordinary woman as extraordinary things start to happen around her. She's honest, unassuming, and easy to like. As a result, she make the perfect counter to the petty power trading, embezzling, and scamming so rampant in the post-Soviet world. It's not a satire, so much as a wry look business-as-usual when something and someone very unusual appear among them. The right reader will find a lot to like in this little book.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"To Err Is Divine: A Novel","review":"While taking a bath, a 59 year old school widowed teacher, notices a peculiar golden aura around her head, and at first tries to hide this halo..Eventually, she realizes that hardly anyone notices it. While wandering the beach, thousands of fish flock to the beach for a real fisherman's holiday. But the hotel/tourist industry, and local politicians investigate this very strange occurence. Even strange things also happen in the local church, and the priest is not sure whether a miracle really happens or not. Finally, a doctor notices her very unique powers, and the powers that be open a posh and expensive medical/ health center. The rest is a fun page turner with many bizarre turns, a mix of pointilistic realism, and the possible supernatural. Very enjoyble way to spend a few hours!"},{"Title":"To Err Is Divine: A Novel","review":"The book delivers a good feeling of what it is like to live in a former communistic country.

Way back in the dark ages of baseball, when a batter struck out, it was said that he had &quot;struck.&quot; Letters were used for scoring then just as they are now, but the letter &quot;S&quot; was already being used for sacrifice, so they assigned &quot;K,&quot; the last letter of the word struck, to stand for &quot;a player who missed the ball in three swings.&quot;Here's one for our British cousins: &quot;'S - - t' said the Queen.&quot; The following has never been proved but it makes a great story.

You won't find here but common people, and that's what makes the tale so touching and realistic. The book is beautiful and is beautifully written, with a sober yet elegant and poetic style. The trains are an essential part of all the characters'lives in their jobs and their personal memories, and are related to the fight of Czechs partisans at the end of the II World War, which is the time the novel is placed. The novel is both dramatic and comic, and Hrabal's sense of humour is one of his most remarkable features, following the best tradition of Czech's Literature, particularly Jaroslav Hasek. The mixture of drama and comedy, as well as the human touch and tenderness which envelops the characters makes this novel very moving to every reader. This work is a little and brilliant jewel, definitely worth the trouble reading."},{"Title":"Closely watched trains (An Evergreen black cat book)","review":"Bohumil Hrabal's Closely Watched Train is a beautiful book whose lingering impact on the reader is greater than one would suspect from looking at its length - 85 pages. It is the story of a young man, Milos Hrma, an apprentice signalman in a Czech village railway station during WWII. The term closely \\"watched trains\\" refers to German military (soliers, prisoners, and munitions) trains that must be watched, tracked closely to ensure a smooth passage. Failure results in close (and often deadly) scrutiny by the Gestapo. As the story it unfolds that young Milos had recently attempted suicide after his first sexual experience ends disastrously. The scars on his wrist reflect the internal scars and humiliation suffered as a result of his sexual failure. The rest of the book focuses on his desire to achieve manhood, by means of a succesful sexual conquest or through some \\"other\\" means. Milos' quest is ultimately succesful yet with tragic consequences. An act of simple heroism marks the story's climax. Along the way Milos has a near fatal encounter with a Gestapo officer after an incident involving a closely watched train. The understated description of this encounter is a brilliant piece of writing as the officer and Milos closely watch each other's scars before the officer decides to spare his life. The above summary does not do justice to the concise, sparse tone of Hrabal's prose that conveys great depths of meaning in the course of the story's simple narrative.This is a beautiful story, beautifully told. I also recommend the movie (available on Amazon)after reading the book. It won an Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 1966. The screenplay was written by Hrabal and altough not totally faithful to the book's narrative it is well acted and serves as a nice complement to the book.I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Closely watched trains (An Evergreen black cat book)","review":"A basis for a 1967 Oscar winning movie (dir. jiri Menzel) Hrabal's book is drawing a parallel between the loss of innocence of a youth Milos Hrma, and the Czech people during WW II. The experiences of Milos, an apprentice with a small railway station in the middle of Bohemia, tells you more about the role of Czech people, collaborateurs, middlemen, resistors, under the German occupation than an Encyclopedia. Beautifully written, in the best Central European tradition of irony and self-deprecation."},{"Title":"Closely watched trains (An Evergreen black cat book)","review":"Hrabal's short novella \\"Closely Observed Trains\\" (the title under which it is published in Britain)is set in a railway station in a small town in Czechoslovakia in the winter of 1945. Although the war is coming to an end, the country is still under German occupation, and the book's title refers to the special military trains which need to be kept under close guard as they travel to the front.The central character, Milos Hrma, is a young apprentice traffic controller, and the opening scenes of the book tend towards the comic, as Milos describes the attempts of his colleagues to get on with their everyday lives, seemingly oblivious to the historic events taking place around them. Milos's boss, Station-Master Lansky, is a ridiculous figure, obsessed with promoting himself both in the social hierarchy (he lays claim to aristocratic lineage) and in the hierarchy of the Czech railway system. Despite his eagerness for promotion, however, he pays more attention to his hobby of pigeon breeding than he does to the requirements of his job. Lansky's subordinate, Dispatcher Hubicka, is equally neglectful of his duties, although his main obsession is pursuing women; he is facing disciplinary proceedings for the offence of misusing Government property by using the station's official stamps to decorate the backside of an attractive young female telegraphist.As the story progresses, it takes on a darker tone. We learn that Milos has recently returned to work after three months in hospital following an unsuccessful attempt at suicide. The cause of this attempt was depression brought on by impotence and his inability to consummate his relationship with his girlfriend. The latter part of the book has two themes- his continuing obsession with losing his virginity and the plot he forms with Hubicka to help the Czech Resistance by destroying one of the Germans' special trains.The expression \\"tragi-comedy\\" is perhaps over-used in literary criticism, being all too often a category to enable the lazy critic to pigeonhole works that resist neat pigeonholing- certain of Shakespeare's plays, for example. It seems to me, however, that the adjective \\"tragi-comic\\" is indeed an appropriate one to use about \\"Closely Observed Trains\\" because of the contrast between the tragic situation of the Czech people under the German occupation and the many comic incidents that take place, such as Hubicka's adventures with the telegraphist, or Lansky's habit of shouting his criticism of the morals of society down the ventilation shaft in the station kitchen. The same incident, indeed, may have both comic and serious overtones, as when Lansky, in protest against the German invasion of Poland, kills his German pigeons and replaces them with Polish ones- an act both cruel and ridiculous. The book is full of gruesome but absurd details, such as the three dead horses thrown from a train and left by the railway lines. This is a book of less than a hundred pages, but Hrabal is able to fill that space with a fantastic amount of detail, both trivial and serious.The central theme of the book is the various strategies people use to survive in the tragic circumstances of war and occupation- courageous acts of resistance, petty acts of defiance (such as using the metal from a downed German plane to roof rabbit-hutches and chicken-coops) and continuing to pursue the trivia of existence. Sometimes they use a mixture of all three. One can easily see why the Communist authorities disliked Hrabal's work; they had no objection to tales of heroic deeds in the fight against fascism, but these had to be viewed through the simplistic ideology of Marxism-Leninsm and placed in the context of the class struggle. Hrabal's world was more complex and less ideological. There is a place for courage in that world, but also a place for compromise and for the apolitical details of everyday life. Seen in this context, Milos's bravery seems both more impressive and the book's ending more poignant. This is a fine piece of writing and, given that it was written under Communist rule, a brave one."},{"Title":"Closely watched trains (An Evergreen black cat book)","review":"Hrabal's short novella \\"Closely watched trains\\" is a delight. In English translation it has just about 90 pages, yet in these 90 pages a story is told, which could be extended to an Oscar-winning movie and is an absolute masterpiece.Milos Hrma, the main protagonist and narrator, is a railway apprentice during World War II in the German-occupied Czechoslovakia. He is in love with Masha, the ticket controller and his whole life is centered at the provincial railway station with the supervisor Lansky, whose passion are pigeons and ambition - to became accepted into aristocracy, and the promiscuous dispatcher Hubicka, Milos' teacher and role model.The book starts with some family history and moves back and forth in time, as Milos recalls the events that led to his suicide attempt (from which he just recovered). As the story develops, we get to know the solution to his problem. We get from the light to the serious matters and back in the matter of a few pages. The prose is condensed and rich, evoking powerful imagery with few words.The character of Milos is as complicated and full of contrasts as only the youth can be - he is innocent, insecure, romantic, silly, but incredibly brave at the same time.The bittersweet Czech humor is here at its greatest, as well as the typical melancholy, which together with Hrabal's mastery of the language and his great observations and criticism of the national character, war circumstances from the perspective of the remote town, and the emotional turmoil of the protagonist, give the amazing mix, which will never get outdated and always be a pleasure to read - in other words, a perennial classic."},{"Title":"Closely watched trains (An Evergreen black cat book)","review":"Hrabal needed to show optimism. He published this book in the heyday of socialist realism. It is actually a sanitized version of a much wilder story, which was unpublishable.The avant-garde has a tendency to be unfair to those who are tolerated by oppressors. Hrabal barely made it to the printing press, but he got vilified by his friends. Would you believe it, this outrageous piece of brilliant short fiction was attacked because the government allowed it to be printed. It was considered \`prettified'.This shows how twisted our minds get under stress.The story is set in early 45, the Germans are losing the war, the Czech village, where the narrator works with the railways, is watching events closely. The story is filled with Hrabal's usual eccentrics. The great grandfather who got his invalidity pension from the K&K; army at age 18 during the 1848 revolution and then lived to get beaten up regularly by the envious neighborhood until he died from a beating at 105. The grandfather who tried to stop the German invasion by hypnosis (and in the process caused a situation similar to the famous Tiananmen photo of one man standing in front of a tank; success did not come in either case), and was at least the only one who even tried to stop the tanks. The father who collects old metal scraps for who knows what purpose, a retiree from being a locomotive driver.But I don't want to tell the story, Hrabal does it well already, and it is not long.Of course this is a war story, and it is funny and gory and heroic with tongue in cheek. And don't forget, with these Czechs and specially with Hrabal, there is no life without sex, and not much death either. It is absolutely brilliant and among the best of its class, right up there with Conrad or Crane (didn't I just review something about cranes? Odd)."},{"Title":"Closely watched trains (An Evergreen black cat book)","review":"Bohumil Hrabal's novel (or novella, more precisely) Closely Watched Trains first hit the scene in 1965. It is the story of the curiously naive railwayman/kid Milos Hrma who overcomes his sexual impotence by succesfully consummating intercourse with an older woman. This intimate and seminal life event of Milos is beatifully and sensitively detailed amid occasional description of WWII, an event that was looming over Milos and his surroundings. This novella is a joy to read."},{"Title":"Closely watched trains (An Evergreen black cat book)","review":"American and English readers will, if they are of a certain age, remember the film adaptation of this novella in the mid-1960's. Perhaps they saw it at a student film festival or in a local \\"art-house\\" which specialized in showing foreign films (and it was a great era for films from France, Sweden, Mexico, Japan, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Italy, and Poland - I apologize if I have slighted the cinematic prominence of other nations in that heady time.) Hrabal wrote the screenplay for the film as well. This took place during the several years of liberalizing ferment within Czechoslovakia that culminated in the Prague Spring of 1968, a burst of optimism that was to be quickly squashed like an unwelcome insect.So the novella is known through both its film version and several English-language editions which have been published intermittently during the past forty years. The story is one of youthful heroism blossoming in the local context of everyday activities, but also in the increasingly desperate overall political and military context of the last months of World War II, when it seemed that the Protectorate might be used by the Germans to throw up a suicidal, last-ditch defense against its converging enemies. With the exception of the narrator's recollection of meaningful events in his young life, the entire story takes place within the confines of a railway station where its major characters are employees of the state's railway service. (The station and its employees are a fictional re-creation of the train station at Kostomlaty - a small town near Nymburk, Hrabal's hometown -- where the author worked during the war. He reveals this and the genesis of two of the book's major scenes in \\"November Hurricane\\", one of nine autobiographical essays in the collection \\"Total Fears. Letters to Dubenka\\", published posthumously in an English translation in 1998.)As well as a hero's tale the story is also a sexual comedy, with its farcical central episode of Dispatcher Hubicka's imprinting official railroad stamps on the charming buttocks of telegraphist Virginia Svata. This deed has hilarious implications and results - photographs of Virginia's decorated buttocks are circulating, and based on these there is a promise of a film career for the young woman. A ridiculous railroad administrative inquisition takes place in order to establish the legality of such an act. At the same time Stationmaster Lansky, who heartily disapproves of the behavior of his underlings, is being petitioned by the local aristocracy to introduce Hubicka to them socially - he is a man after their own hearts. (A minor point: While her last name is \\"Saint\\", J. Skvorecky points out in his Introduction that Virginia is not an apt translation of her first name, Zdenicka. He may have missed a tricky bilingual etymological boat here, since the prototype of Zdenicka is probably Saint Denise, celebrated for the staunch defense of her own virginity; so the translator caught this irony with the suggestive English \\"Virginia\\". On the other hand I may be deluding myself on this point, but Skvorecky does mention the symbolic nature of several characters' Czech names - none of which, by the way, come across in any English translation!)It's just the kind of bold and whimsical act that makes the narrator and hero-to-be, Assistant Dispatcher Milos Hrma, admire Hubicka all the more (and, by comparison, lose confidence in himself, for Milos has had a little problem with premature ejaculation, preventing the fulfillment of his love for fellow employee Masha; it's made him uncomfortable with himself to the point of attempting suicide). Events conspire to lead Milos into his heroic act (blowing up a German munitions train headed to the eastern front). His participation in this exploit comes almost as an afterthought to his successful sexual escapade with an older woman who arrives at the station on a Resistance mission, delivering the bomb to be used to Hubicka. In fact, Milos' tryst with Victoria Freie gives him the confidence to imagine that he can undertake great things. He does and, as a consequence, he dies.Some readers will probably react to the book's ending with reserve or skepticism, finding it too heroic in the sentimental mold - as the fire-bombed Dresden boils up into the western night sky and the munitions train explodes a few miles to the east Milos lies dying in the snow, fatally wounded by a German train guard whom he has shot (and Milos finds a common bond of humanity with his victim even as he \\"mercy-kills\\" him). In spite of this rather cinematic ending, Hrabal closes the book with one of his typical coarse, comical observations that is very deflating: \\"Sie sollen am Arsche zu Hause setzen.\\", quoting the train engineer who has just dropped off a bedraggled collection of Dresden residents who escaped incineration.If you are such a skeptical reader made unhappy by the book's ending, you can reappraise its effect by now going back and reading the Introduction written by Hrabal's fellow Czech novelist, Josef Skvorecky (don't read the Introduction first). He not only discusses the uneasiness of readers over the book's finale, he explains just how it came about as a somewhat forced rewriting - forced by the political circumstances of the time -- of an earlier version of the story, a much grimmer and more brutal version known as \\"The Legend of Cain\\", written in the late 1940's and never published. That story not only tweaked the \\"hero-requirements\\" of the Communist bureaucracy's conventions of \\"socialist realism\\" in fiction, it also assailed some of the pieties of Czech nationalism. In other words it was a double-barreled shot bound to backfire on Hrabal. Reading this Introduction is indispensable to a fuller understanding of \\"Closely Watched Trains\\", and it explains the particularities of the practice of \\"cultural politics\\" and literary criticism within an aspiring totalitarian state (in the interest of fairness to what he feels is a work whose literary merits are undervalued, Skvorecky is just as hard on some of the dissidents who dismissed this novel as he is on the government which allowed it to be published then banned it).The language is typically Hrabalian, i.e., fluent, colloquial, floating high ideals on low imagery, and inclined on occasion toward the rhapsodic (the rhapsody of the adolescent self discovering itself in a difficult situation). The translation by Edith Pargeter captures these qualities. The Northwestern University Press editions that started in the 1980s have the Skvorecky Introduction, as does an earlier publication of the novella by the Viking Penguin Press."},{"Title":"Closely watched trains (An Evergreen black cat book)","review":"A classic work, true to Hrabal's technique of penetrating deep into the psyche of a &quot;little person,&quot; who is seemingly unimportant, but reflects a whole society. The ending of the book is different than the movie, with an amazing, and complex moment of acceptance and accusation both, as Czech and German lay dying together. Hrabal's symbolism compresses surreal poetry and social codes together, and like &quot;Too Loud a Solitude&quot; this slender book can say a lot more than many bigger ones."},{"Title":"Closely watched trains (An Evergreen black cat book)","review":"do you remember, as a child, watching trains pass by? i'm guessing that you counted every car, reading the words on some; looking in the windows of others. this, to me, could stand as the definition for innocence and it feels as if the adult counter part of this process lies somewhere inside milos hrma, the narrator of hrabal's novella. milos is a young railroad apprentice who insulates himself against the reality of world war ii. he cowers when faced with authority and he fears that he is impotent. those fears are eventually silenced as he confronts a trainload of nazis and realizes the consequences of war. he lays bleeding and gripping the hand of a dead german soldier, who is both his victim and his murderer. hrabal has written an understated and poetic tale of german-occupied czechoslovakia that lives in your mind long after the eighty-five pages are read."},{"Title":"Closely watched trains (An Evergreen black cat book)","review":"This is not just another interesting little book from \\"The Other Europe.\\" This is a world masterpiece. This is an anti-war manifesto to be compared with The Red Badge of Courage and All Quiet on the Western Front in its emotional impact, and better than either of them in its poetic luster and compact structure. Yes, I saw the movie, decades ago, when it won the Oscar, but fine as the film was, I never got around to reading the book. That seems to have been the norm. After 'discovering' Hrabal's 'Too Loud a Solitude,' I fully expected to appreciate 'Closely Watched Trains.' But I had no idea...CWT is a classic novella in the strictest European sense. It depicts a single scene, an event at a railroad station in rural Czechoslovakia near the end of World War 2, in 1945, precisely and peripherally the very day of the fire-bombing of Dresden. The event is the well-planned bombing of a German munitions train by Czech partisans. The action is narrated through the stream-of-consciousness thoughts of a young railroad apprentice, Milos Hrma. Milos's thoughts, like yours or mine, are not bound by sequence or significance; much of the story remains fragmented and confused in his telling up until the indescribably poignant climax. Trains and characters barge through the station, sirens wailing, voices screaming, engines and humans both bound by the tracks toward their destinations. Milos has just returned to work from hospitalization after a suicide attempt; he had failed his own criterion of manhood in his first sexual encounter with a girl he's loved since childhood. Thus, CWT is a tale of initiation into manhood. But it's also a song of the author's vibrant love of humanity -- of humor and individuality, of the beauty of sex and human contact, of simple courage and complex heroism, even of the possibility of canceling the prefix from the word 'inhumanity' and recognizing the enemy as your double.I seldom read Forewords to novels, but this time wanting the 85 pages of CWT to last longer in my mind, I turned back to the preface by Josef Skvorecky and learned that some avant-garde writers of the post-Prague Spring era had criticized Hrabal for making CWT too sentimental, too 'acceptable' as socialist realism. Oh well! The stubborn half-sight of idealists never fails to miss the whole story. Hrabal was indeed censored by the Communist state, and much of his writing was repressed or published only clandestinely. But he was also widely read, by both professors and bus drivers. The one tenet of socialist realism that he heeded was to write for everyone. Closely Watched Trains is virtuosically literary in style and structure, yet powerfully in touch with the feelings and thoughts of an ordinary young guy. Milos Hrma would have relished his own story."},{"Title":"Closely watched trains (An Evergreen black cat book)","review":"In this coming of age story set in German occupied Czechoslovakia toward the end of WWII, Hrabal reveals great range as a writer, from lyrical fantasy to farce and brutal realism.

Hrabal wrote the screenplay."},{"Title":"Closely watched trains (An Evergreen black cat book)","review":"Closely Watched Trains is a vivid, often hilarious, devastating kick in the gut. Although written (and banned) in Soviet-era Czechoslovakia, the story hasn't lost much in translation or the passage of time. War tragedy and humorous youthful sexual burlesque rarely go out of style; taken together, if written well (as Hrabal does), the tragedy and humor amplify one other. Narrator Milos is a naive young apprentice train station agent near Prague during the German occupation. Having failed to please the girl he fancies, he decides that since he \\"isn't a man\\" he must take his own life. Milos's mentor and coworker Mr. Hubicka happens to know a lot about seducing the opposite sex, and becomes embroiled in allegations of a particularly \\"creative\\" sexual assault. Meanwhile the war, though distant and removed, rolls evidence past Milo's eyes in the form of strafed carriages, casualty wagons, and secret SS reconnaissance trains that must be \\"closely watched\\".It's hard to capture in a few words why I found this book absolutely brilliant. The chronological back and forth initially confused me, but once the the author's vivid imagery, acute characterizations, brutal yet somehow beautiful violence and uproarious humor all snagged me, and I couldn't put this one down until the final blood-drenched page."},{"Title":"Closely watched trains (An Evergreen black cat book)","review":"SPOILER ALERT:Milos Hrama is a 22 year old Czech railroad apprentice in the closing days of WWII.

It addressed salvation and relationship with God in angst with emotions saved people still experience even though they have given their lives to God. Just like with Eve, temptation can be stronger than reason and logic, and certainly one does not count up the cost or consider the consequences of their actions until after it is all said and done.Eva Clemente met her Adam and tried hard to keep her focus and loyalty to her relationship with God and her obligations to her church, but once she began to spend time with Adam, natural human desire to be wanted and loved became priority and she threw caution to the wind. The very night she decided to 'just go for it' led to the worst time in her life. Learning of a shooting spree at her sons' college the next morning after her decision, Eva had a hard time dealing with the guilt. Especially when both of her sons were injured in the melee. Because of what she did, Eva believed none of it would have happened had she not been with Adam.By story's end, Eva was able to come to terms with her natural human feelings in perspective of who she is in relationship with and to God, and deal with the tragedies she suffered. Not due to what she had done, but because of her own guilty feelings in light of what she did. She found that God is yet a forgiving God and will restore you when you have acknowledged your wrong and help you get up and continue to live.Although this is a fiction novel, I would recommend it, especially to new converts in Christ, to let them know that there are times when temptation of the flesh can be stronger than we are for that time. But redemption is always available to you if you are sincere and true about who you are in God.

Eva Clemente is a professional, saved Afro-Latina woman who is happy with her life. She has survived a failed marriage, a bad relationship, raising two sons and all the drama that can always be found when you have an extended family. And despite the urging of her sister and her best friend, she is uninterested in a relationship with a man. Adam Black is a probation officer and cancer-survivor, carrying a load of bad female experiences. While he adores his mother and his sister, he has a less than positive view of other women.When these two meet, it is more than obvious that they share a mutual attraction. However, Xenia is reluctant to enter into a relationship with Adam because he is more of a Mr. Right Now than a Mr. Righteous. Adam's life experiences have left he questioning whom God is and why does he allow people to suffer. While Xenia life experiences have made her know who God is and to see suffering as an opportunity to grow spiritually.There are many underlying themes that run throughout the novel-abstinence, racism, infidelity and spiritual, emotion and physical healing. I found so many things to love about this book. It was a moving and well-written story bout two mature adults who learn more about themselves and each other as they grow close to God. I really loved the author's use of scripture and poetry to move to story along. But the one thing that I really loved about the novel was Adam. Adam is one of the most positive African-American male characters I have read in a long time. As the novel progressed, I fell in love with Adam right along with Eva.Xenia Ruiz is definitely an author we should keep on our radar. CHOOSE ME is based on her own personal experiences and I admire her courage and honesty in sharing her story.Reviewed by: Sabrina Hall for [...]and The GOOD GIRL Book Club"},{"Title":"Choose Me","review":"In this the story of Eva and Adam, we are treated to a wonderful tale of the journey of two mistrusting, yet gentle souls. Eva is a dedicated Christian who is serious about her religion and is looking for \\"Mr. Righteous\\". As she waits, she is unapologetically practicing celibacy. In her patient wait, she has racked up 5 years of celibacy which she sometimes wears as a badge of honor.Adam is a former Christian who due to a number of tragedies in life and love has walked away from a close relationship with Christ. When Eva and Adam meet, thanks to the matchmaking of Eva's sister and friend, they are attracted to each other.The story follows them as they try to navigate around the roadblocks established due to Eva's dedicated walk with Christ and the mistrust they are both harboring due to past relationships. There story has additional layers added due to their cultural differences (she's a Latino, he's African American), the drama-filled lives of friends and families and their uncertainty about how to move forward in a way that pleases them both.What a wonderfully delightful tale of two mature adults navigating a rocky romantic road. This author is a brilliant new addition to the multicultural, Christian fiction genre."},{"Title":"Choose Me","review":"It is Ruiz' clear prose that sets apart the voices of the two memorable characters in her debut novel, Choose Me. Eva Clemente is a professional, saved Afro-Latina woman who is happy with her life \`as is'. Celibate, she is uninterested in a relationship with a man. Enter Adam Black, a probation officer and cancer-survivor, carrying a load of bad female experiences; more than enough to make him distrustful and wary of women. However, despite their protestations, these two find themselves attracted to one another and amidst maneuvering through day-to-day life, grapple with the resulting feelings. Choose Me, is a moving, must-read, well-written story of two mature adults, who when dealt tumultuous life-blows, discover a deeper relationship with one another than initially conceived, by learning to choose God first."},{"Title":"Choose Me","review":"It's been a while since I have read this book but I just saw it the other day in a box in my second bedroom. It was excellent reading! The author engaged me and I had a clear depiction of every direction she wanted to take the reader. Reading in a second time is on my list. I feel like I will discover more and enjoy the writing all over again."},{"Title":"Choose Me","review":"I was so happy to have come across a copy of this book, which i picked up while browsing for other books.Choose Me is more than a story about a woman and a man, It touches on real life issues dealing with marriage, divorce, family, and faith.I like it because it's not your typical boy meets girl, they fall in love and live happily ever after.I could relate to the characters and was pleased with how the book ended.I am an avid reader and there's nothing I dislike more than a poorly written book, and so if you are by chance reading this review, rest assured that this book is worth your time."},{"Title":"Choose Me","review":"I can not tell you how awesome this book is. It is such an inspiration for single Christian women to stay faithful and righteous as you wait for the right man to find you. It took me no time to read this book because I could not put it down. I liked it so much I bought 3 more copies and passed them out."},{"Title":"Choose Me","review":"I can not tell you how awesome this book is. Its such an inspiration for single Christian women waiting for their \\"Boaz\\". It took me no time to read it - its a wonderful story. Im definitely encouraged!"},{"Title":"Choose Me","review":"In Choose Me, Eva Clemente has survived a failed marriage and raised two sons on her own. With her sons away at college, she is not searching for Mr. Right but for a righteous man of God. Eva became celibate 5 years ago to refocus on herself and to prepare for what God wants her to do. Eva was about to give up hope on finding a good Christian man until she meets Adam Black. Adam has a strong Christian faith until he comes down with a serious illness. He's found something wonderful in Eva but can Adam be in a celibate relationship?Choose Me is a moving debut novel by Xenia Ruiz. One of the things that makes this novel shine is the diverse background of the two main characters. Eva is Afro-Latino and Adam is African-American but it is not the main focus of this story. Ruiz showed great vision by showing how difficult choosing celibacy can be for someone who was once a sexually active adult. Choose Me is not a quick read, but that's what good about this novel. This story is told in a gradual, unhurried fashion that gives you time to appreciate the deep love that develops between Eva and Adam. Choose Me is beautiful and poetic, and Xenia Ruiz has the knack for telling a refreshing, emotional story that will hopefully be the start to a long career."},{"Title":"Choose Me","review":"This was a very good book . I read it in one day. You won't be able to put this book down, it's definetly a page turner. Hard to believe this is Ms. Ruiz's first novel. Very well-written book. I look forward to her next novel."},{"Title":"Choose Me","review":"Finally, a book that speaks to me! CHOOSE ME is the book that I have been waiting for - an interracial love story between an Afro-Puerto Rican woman and an African-American man. After reading the same old stories about women looking for Mr. Right, Mr. Right-now, & Mr. Good-Enough, CHOOSE ME's strong female character, Eva Clemente, is a welcome surprise; she is waiting on \\"Mr. Righteous.\\" Adam Black, the male protagonist, is one of the most positive African-American male characters I have read in a long time. As a fellow Christian Latina who abstained until marriage, I loved this inspirational novel. Unlike other Christian novels which shy away from realistic encounters between men and women, CHOOSE ME goes \\"there\\"-this is NOT for those faint-at-heart, old-school Christian readers. This is an awesome read!"},{"Title":"Choose Me","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. I did find the main charecter a little dogmatic and judgemental in her Chirstian beliefs and as a Christian I found that \\"Eva\\" rode a fine line between incredibly liberal and a bit too... conservative. Reading her was like a bipolar, spiritual experience. Her ability to quote scripture and deliver lots of spiritual advice to others was in great contrast to her choice of mainstream music and a hippie alternative lifestyle. BUT---- overall I found the book to be very entertaining, and I loved the men in the story line. It was truthful, honest, and enlightening."},{"Title":"Choose Me","review":"I agree with previous reviewers this book is worth reading, and I also read it fast! Engaging characters? Yes! The author did a good job creating a multitude of special worlds: Chicago (for those of us who don't live there); saved Christianity (for those of us who don't attend that type of church) an interracial church (rare outside of fiction) and even an interracial set of friends. Nicely done.I was taken aback by comments from one reader who thought Eva's hip liberal lifestyle was a contradiction to her Christian values. Oh dear, that never occurred to me! Jesus was no conservative in his time, now that I think about it. Thanks, Ms. Ruiz, for highlighting this issue, even if it never crossed your mind that anyone would question whether God loves hip liberals too.Oh well, I can't help it, there are some things I wish were just a little different. I was fascinated when we learned that Jade's suiter, Achille (can't remember how you spelled it)anyway he was a celibate Christian too. I was frustrated that Adam would not discuss this in more detail with Jade. Yes, they were brother and sister who don't talk about sexual details, but they seemed close and this could have been a chance to learn more about Achille and also a great discussion between Adam and Jade. For example, in Adam's POV he notices he thinks it's a great idea for his sister's suitor to be celibate, (as opposed to his girlfriend) but he doesn't explore this thought or seem to learn from it. A lot left on the table there.The sexual encounter between Adam and Eva didn't need to be SUCH a bummer, after all that buildup. By that time they knew they both cared deeply for each other, much more than either had experienced in previous relationships, and they were too smart not to realize it, also too smart not to realize how precious it should have been. We all could have used a break from Eva's relentless determination not to enjoy anything, ever. She stopped having a good time way too soon.By the end, I was starting to think she was so mean to Adam that maybe they would break up for good, after all. She made him wait nine days before she said \\"yes\\" to his proposal! I was mad at her by that time, and stopped being on her side. Or at least when she finally said yes, I wanted some indication that she had learned something about love between a man and a woman -- that God is not absent from their relationship, that God wants them to be happy, that God wants good things for us while we are here under the sun, and that sometimes it's our job to recognize something good - in fact I felt she was sinning when she turned away from Adam two or three or four times too many. She never learned this lesson. I hope she learns it in their couple's counseling. And why on earth would she want a long engagement? That was way too harsh!Ms Ruiz, I enjoyed your writing and I can see you looking at me with a skeptical expression from your photo on the back flap of the book. These are only my comments, and I'm working on a novel myself, for whatever that is worth. Congratulations on your accomplishment and good luck with future projects."},{"Title":"Choose Me","review":"The story of Eva, a staunch Latina Christian woman, who is celibate and meets Adam, who is recovering from cancer and he is at odds with God. They want to be together; however, they each are struggling with their own issues. Life happens and they try to make the best of it. They must come to grips with their love for each other and with their spirituality. A good mixing of spiritual beliefs and day-to-day issues. I enjoyed the way Ms. Ruiz handled God, spirituality and celibacy."},{"Title":"Way Everlasting: A Study in Psalm 139","review":"The Way Everlasting by Edward J. YoungPsalm 139 is one of Scripture's most thorough statements concerning the majesty of God in his omniscience (knowing everything). E. J. Young's exposition is devotional but, where necessary, he deals briefly with the main attacks, which are made by the critics on this Psalm. Dr. E. J. Young (1908-1968) was counted a most able teacher in Old Testament scholarship. He had a speaking or reading knowledge of at least twenty-six languages, and most of these had been self-taught. He was able to pursue studies in Ugaritic, speak German fluently, and preach in Spanish. From 1937 he was professor of Old Testament at Westminster Theological Seminary, Philadelphia, standing in the tradition of the old Princeton Theological Seminary along with such predecessors as Robert Dick Wilson and Oswald T. Allis. First published in 1965, this mini-commentary is a fine piece of work and will be of benefit to a wide range of readers. It is an excellent tool to help in personal devotions: You will discover insights that will enhance your understanding of Psalm 139. As Joe Young (as he was known to friends)remarks: \\"Psalm 139 is a prayer of David in which he exalts the majesty of God. God is all-knowing and God is everywhere present.\\" Only when we have let the psalm speak for itself, can we pray with the Psalmist: \\"Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.\\" This work gives a good, solid exposition of this portion of Scripture; it is written in a clear and concise style."},{"Title":"Collins Greek Phrase Book and Dictionary (Phrase Book Dictionary & CD)","review":"I downloaded the CDs to my iPod and learned Greek while I was traveling to work.

Invaluable."},{"Title":"The Great Book of Tantra: Translations and Images from the Classic Indian Texts","review":"For the reader who would enjoy a book which contains an overall treatment containing history of tantra, some tantric scripture and descriptions of tantric worship, this is quite possibly the best choice. I was delighted with the series of colorful ritual paintings loaded with hidden tantric meaning. The other blatantly erotic paintings did not detract but seemed to be simply a publisher's attempt to sell the book to a larger market. (The author asked the publisher not to include any erotic pictures.) These more erotic illustrations were perfect examples of works done by skilled painters and craftsman and could be enjoyed as such. The most fascinating aspect of this book is the manner in which tantra is not only compared with other religions and mythology, but how the author has shown that tantra has evolved from these sources. This book is written simply enough for the novice but also contains more specific information of interest to an advanced reader."},{"Title":"The Great Book of Tantra: Translations and Images from the Classic Indian Texts","review":"This book is really two books.The first, an eclectic (and hopefully reasonably academic) collection of thoughts and writings from around the world, more than that I cannot yet say, having recieved the book this morning.The second, a collection of asian pornography, -some of which is 'tantric', little or none of which from classical Indian texts' gathered by the publisher to 'spice' up the text. The footnotes under most of the pictures look pretty much made up, seem to be unresearched or ill-researched, and bear little or no relevance to the copy.Had I seen that the publisher decided to promote the subject heading as'Sexuality/Art', I would have not bought the book.I will not buy books published by Destiny again.For those of you who think that Tantra to do with sex, I recommend you look at the world around you, and ask yourself \\"What is? What is not?\\" Why? Because you are grasping at something that isn't there.I sincerely hope that the copy is considered and provocative.

It is to be treasured however for those who admire Watts and his unique and highly influential body of work because it was his first published book on Zen Buddhism.It is clearly a young man's book. When it was reissued some twenty-four years later, Watts was asked to revise it, but he declined, saying that it would require a rewriting of the book. He allowed that his expression herein of the philosophy of Mahayana was flawed, but I think the real shortcoming--if we can call it that--in The Spirit of Zen is simply the fact that the very young author did not understand Zen in the way he would in years to come. For an older man to rewrite a younger man's book, even though that younger man be himself, is to create another book, by another person. Watts knew this, and that is undoubtedly the real reason he declined. So he let it stand as it is with its flaws, but also with its strengths.From my point of view those strengths are the felicitous prose, the clear expression, the fresh enthusiasm and the ground-breaking insights from a Western point of view. The weakness is in the young man's misunderstanding of the role of the koan and of the experience of enlightenment. Quite frankly, Watts dove in and wrote what he knew, but what he knew was not yet enlightenment. We can see this in his expression about what he calls \\"trance\\" in meditation where he is discussing the use of the koan and zazen in Zen practice. He remarks that \\"the aims of Yoga and Za-zen appear to be rather different.\\" (p. 80) He was wise to quality with \\"appears\\" because most people today would say that the goals are identical, that is, freedom from the delusion and restraint of ordinary conditioned consciousness. On the same page he describes \\"trance\\" which he then associated with the yogic practice, as \\"static and other-worldly\\" adding that \\"the Chinese mind [meaning the early Zen mind] required something altogether more vital and practical.\\" Although I am not an authority on Watts, having read only a handful of his books, I would bet that he seldom if ever used \\"trance\\" in this sense again. The word has become almost pejorative in this usage mainly because practitioners know from personal experience that meditation involves any number of states of mind, and to reduce the experience to \\"being in a trance\\" is misleading. Meditation (which really is zazen--\\"just sitting\\") is an experience unique to each individual, not translatable, while being as \\"vital and practical\\" as you can get, whether the approach be yogic, Christian mystic, whirling dervish, koan-inspired or whatever.One can also see Watts's struggle toward an understanding of the use of the koan. He writes that the disciple \\"arrives at a state where the dilemma of life [is] enshrined in the Koan...,\\" missing the \\"is.\\" (p. 49) While the koan is central to the Rinzai school of Zen, the real essential is zazen. My personal feeling is that the koan is for young aspirants, especially those with a strong intellectual bent. What Watts apparently doesn't quite see here, as all the ancients insist, and as Watts himself writes, is that Zen IS meditation. Indeed, the word comes from the Chinese \\"ch'an\\" which comes from the Sanskrit \\"dhyana,\\" both words meaning, right in front of our faces, \\"meditation\\" (which Watts knew, of course). The truth--a truth seldom expressed--is that teenagers do not meditate except willy-nilly (unless of course they are saints or geniuses). So Watts still did not know.Regardless of these imperfections; indeed in light of them, we can see the precocious nature of Alan Watts's understanding. Certainly he got the essence right. He recalls on page 49 an old Zen saying, \\"Do not linger about where the Buddha is, and as to where he is not, pass swiftly on.\\" Also \\"The only difference between a Buddha and an ordinary man is that one realizes it while the other does not.\\" (pp. 48-49) This last expression (from Hui Neng) reminds me of the idea of bliss in yoga and Vedanta. We ARE bliss. What we have to do is realize it. That makes all the difference.Watts also shows here a mature understanding of the psychology of religion, noting, for example, on page 61 that \\"morality should not be confused with religion...\\" In the chapter, \\"Life in a Zen Community,\\" he also acknowledges the \\"evils of monasticism\\" without dwelling on them. In general he shows a clear groking of the central idea of Zen, which is, be concrete, be here now and in every moment, and do not mistake the pointing finger for the moon.More than anything perhaps we can see in this book the beginnings of Watts's great scholarship, a scholarship that made him one of American's foremost authorities on Eastern religions. This is particularly evident in his emphasis on the debt that Zen owes to Taoism expressed in the chapter, \\"The Origins of Zen,\\" which would become a full blown exposition in his celebrated The Way of Zen, which I recommend the reader read after this volume.Incidentally, I should like to say that it was this book that allowed me to really appreciate the allegory of the herding of the ox (mentioned here, but completely expounded in other books, especially, Suzuki's Manual of Zen Buddhism). But I will save my \\"understanding\\" for another time. Suffice it to say, as Watts writes on page 60, recalling the Buddha's dictum, that the raft of Buddhism is only for getting across the river. Once on the other side, it can be left behind.--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Yoga: Sacred and Profane (Beyond Hatha Yoga)\\""},{"Title":"The Spirit of Zen: A Way of life, Work and Art in the Far East","review":"This slim volume, written during its author's nineteenth year, is remarkable for it's intelligence and the insight it reveals into a subject that little was known about at the time. Originally published in 1935 in London, Alan Watts' The Spirit of Zen demonstrates a maturity of perception far beyond its young writer's years.For the reader who is already familiar with Watts, it provides us with a rare glimpse of the master in his formative years, and shows, even at this young age, the ease with which he was able to describe the indescribable, an ability that became his stock in trade.The current volume, in its third edition, published in 1958, has luckily been unrevised in the main with only additions to the bibliography for the discerning reader to pursue.As an introduction to Zen Buddhism it achieves its goal astonishingly in 123 pages during which it covers a little of the history of Zen; the heart of what Zen attempts to accomplish--enlightenment; the principle techniques that it uses--zazen and the koan; what life must have been like in a Zen community; and the affect it had on Asian civilization.This book shows Watts in the midst of quickly seeing into and revealing to his readers the heart of its subject, as though to give them the key before they even have the chance to open the door and look, unassisted, for themselves.As Monica Furlong states in her 1986 biography Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts: &quot;It is easy to sense the pleasure with which it [The Spirit of Zen] was written, a particular sort of freshness and enthusiasm that is infinitely touching....But the book remains an important one for those interested in Watts...he [has] managed to state, in a rudimentary way, most of the ideas that would interest and occupy him for the rest of his life.&quot;Of course, the best way for the uninitiated reader to sample the flavor of Watts' supple insight is to allow the author to speak for himself. In the following passage Watts sums up the spirit of Zen as well as what became for him the central theme behind the most magical of his writing:&quot;For the Koan is not a means of inducing trance as if some kind of trance were the highest possible attainment for human beings; it is simply a means of breaking through a barrier, or as the Zen masters describe it, it is a brick with which to knock at the door; when the door is opened, the brick may be thrown away, and this door is the rigid barrier which man erects between himself and spiritual freedom.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Spirit of Zen: A Way of life, Work and Art in the Far East","review":"Alan Watts writes a down-to-earth overview of the fundmantals of Zen absent of the latest hype given this recently popular philisophy.

After this, you could go onto another book written by Watts called \\"The Way of Zen\\". This book was pretty easy to understand and doesn't go into anything that is too confusing. It's a quick read though, so I don't think I'd recommend buying the $30 version. I picked mine up at a used book store for much less than half that.

Overall pretty good though."},{"Title":"The Spirit of Zen: A Way of life, Work and Art in the Far East","review":"When I was in my teens I wanted to be a writer when I grew up. I am a writer now, many years later, even though I still haven't grown up.I found this book by Alan Watts, who wrote it c. 1935, while he was in his late teens. The teenaged Watts thereby became the inspiration for MY late teens, and I read his entire canon.In 1935, Zen was barely known in the West, and even at seventeen, Watts became a major exponent and author on the subject because he wrote this book. He himself admits in the pages ofIn My Own Way: An Autobiographythat his early celebrity made him pretentious and oft-times foolish at that age. Still, THE SPIRIT OF ZEN set Watts' feet on the path he would follow until his untimely death. Although he never became a formal Zen practitioner, his books have opened the door of Zen to many people who have gone on to do just that (including Yours Truly).This little book discusses the history and philosophy of Zen. Written with the kind of exuberance only the very young feel, Watts is thorough in his presentation; though cocksure of himself to a fault, he admits of only one interpretation of the material presented---his own.Still, this is a very easy and quick 150 page read for a person whose eye is caught by the word \\"Zen\\" and wants to know more about it."},{"Title":"The Spirit of Zen: A Way of life, Work and Art in the Far East","review":"I recently got into Zen, and found its beliefs to be very interesting.

I enjoy not only the stories but the thought that right wins out in the end. I think this writer says a lot that us older folks and even younger people should think about and then learn that if you are right stand up for yourself. Smoke is a man, that fights for what he beleives in. In todays world we have forgotten what our ancestors fought and died for. This makes me think and what more could you ask of any author?"},{"Title":"Pursuit of the Mountain Man (Thorndike Western II)","review":"Don't read this book....unless you're prepared to read the ton of otherbooks in the \\"Smoke Jensen and Preacher\\" series. This author writes a bookbefore breakfast and another just before dinner. They're plentiful andhighly addictive. Suspend belief and enjoy.Smoke Jensen, in particular, shoots or fist fights around a hundredhard cases per book and they all highly deserve the mayhem he delivers.In spite of this high fiction (most famous old West gunfighters onlykilled 3 or 4 men in their entire lives) you'll soldier on with theseries because Smoke Jensen is the stuff heros are made of and thewriting is crisp and moving.Just don't say you weren't warned when you find that you spent your wholesummer (or winter) in a comfy chair with 50 or so of these read booksstrewn around you."},{"Title":"Pursuit of the Mountain Man (Thorndike Western II)","review":"Great story, easy reading lots of action and suspense.

So, I was really looking forward to delving into this new series of books.I was really disappointed. Not because it was not readable - it was. But, because I quickly lost interest in the main character. I did not see the point in reading about him. So, I stopped after 65 pages since......He is unstoppable - he cannot be outdrawn in a gunfight.He can't be outfought in a fistfight.No one hunts better than him.No one rides better than him.No one tracks better than him.No one shoots better than him.No one is smarter than him.No one can beat him.In fact, no one is even a challenge to him at all.Well, if that's the case, why even read the book?I would compare it to watching Superman take on a 3rd grade basketball team. Why watch? You know the outcome and its bound to be ugly.In this case, I knew who was going to win and there was no point to reading anymore. There was no challenge for him to overcome. There was no compelling reason for me to continue."},{"Title":"The Mystery Library - ESP","review":"This was an especially interesting book. It is a quick read but it is loaded with background information that is vital to understandfing the world of E. S. P. Extrasensory Perception is a gift. Not everyone has been chosen for this gift. The very reason that it is a gift makes some people feel neglected if they were not chosen. People rather deny the existence of this gift and hope that your gift will go away as a result. Netzley has done a great job explaining the various types of E. S. P. My gift falls in the category of telepathy and a little of clairvoyance. She aptly describes it as in the former the ability to send and/or receive the thoughts and/or feelings from the mind of another person. Clairvoyance she describes as having the ability to &quot;see&quot; events or objects not with the eyes but with the mind. She also explains that psychokenesis or (PK) is the ability to alter matter (like bending a metal fork or spoon) not with the hands but with the mind.Some scientific research is revealed as several studies have been done to prove or disprove E. S. P. Too bad that our science has not caught up with our special gifts. One day they will, but until then, I will enjoy my gift even if science cannot prove its existence.

And it jumps from a personal journal to a robot to a random human hundreds of years in the future to... well, I can't even describe the finale. The tectonic plates are *spoiler* sentient?

Our hero and heroine had a great set-up, a good chance to get to know each other and it felt wasted in the need to wrap up the mystery. The time that Nick and Lucy spent together was mostly concentrated on the dilemma that originally brought them together, not on getting to know each other. Thus, by the time I reached the end of the book, Nick and Lucy were together forever and I was left wondering why. They never had &quot;The Sex&quot;, they barely had the intimate talks. The bachelor auction that is emblazed on the cover seems like it was slipped in there as a hook, not as a necessary part of the story.But, there are good things about this book. I enjoyed Ms. Gabriel's characterization. Love the fact that our hero has something interesting in his past, and Ms. Gabriel handled it well.

With none of the joyful dance of ideas and language of \\"Collapsium\\".As with Dune: read the first, then stop."},{"Title":"The Wellstone","review":"Prince Bascal is frustrated as the heir to the solar system-wide Queendom of Sol because everyone is immortal so he can never become the ruler. Currently the bored royal attends summer camp at a remote locale where \\"troubled boys\\" are exiled so that they can gain an appreciation for civilization after time in the wild. However, Bascal has had enough of the confines of Camp Friendly and with several other campers, he uses Fax Technology to escape to Denver on planet Earth.Bascal and cohorts cause havoc until the Constabulary arrests them. His mother Queen Tamra lectures him on behavior of a future monarch, but Bascal points out he will never be the ruler. Having a taste of revolt and sneaking an earthling female Mary into his entourage, Bascal begins a revolution against the ruling party while the government bungles in their efforts to stop the wild bunch from winning the Fax Wars.THE WELLSTONE is a wild futuristic satire that entertains while pushing the audience to think through to outcomes of current solutions to problems. The story line hooks the reader the moment Bascal and horde escape camp using Fax technology. Their subsequent adventures are fun to follow as if Wild In the Streets occurred across the Solar System. The key characters seem real enabling fans to believe in Fax Technology and immortality though wonder why we do. Will McCarthy provides a winner that will leave the audience applying his logic to modern day issues in order to estimate the outcome not just the output.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Wellstone","review":"I really liked THE COLLAPSIUM, but this sequel is even more fun and leaves me hoping for more. The ending is open enough for another sequel.While THE COLLAPSIUM had a \\"Tom Swift\\" type quality, this one is a boy's adventure story retold for adults. While satirically light hearted, it does have a disturbing underlying theme reminding me of THE LORD OF THE FLIES.This adventure is quite independent of THE COLLAPSIUM and just as enjoyable whether or not you've read the earlier book.The conflict between the main two characters fuels the book. Like THE COLLAPSIUM, the themes of immortality and of cloning duplicate selves are thoroughly examined, especially in light of the psychological effect on human nature. This time, it's the effect on young people being raised with expectations of immortality that's spotlighted.Highly recommended to all science-fiction fans, and to those periphally interested in the genre."},{"Title":"The Wellstone","review":"The Wellstone is the sequel to Wil McCarthy's The Collapsium, set some time later. Tech called fax filters has led to practical immortality (or immorbidity), which is a problem for the children. What will they do when they grow up? Their parents aren't about to vacate their jobs, for the most part. Some of these kids turn delinquent as a result -- or perhaps they would have been that way in any case. A number of kids are being disciplined by confinement to Camp Friendly, a \\"summer camp\\" located on a tiny \\"planette\\". One of these kids is the POV character, a young engineer named Conrad Mursk. Another is the Crown Prince Bascal, the son of Bruno de Towaji (hero of The Collapsium) and the Queen. Bascal is extremely talented, a noted poet and a born leader, and he is very rebellious, as well as very spoiled. He incites the boys to an act of sabotage -- they escape via fax to Denver and release a dangerous substance that turns programmable matter to junk. They are soon captured, and Bascal's furious parents return them to Camp Friendly, with even stricter confinement (no working Fax gates).But Bascal is not to be thwarted. With Conrad's sometimes reluctant help, with the help of a semi-accidental recruit, a teenaged girl named Xmary who was arrested by mistake in the earlier incident, and with the continued help of Bascal's less intelligent henchmen, he hatches another audacious plot. They use the properties of programmable matter to create \\"homemade\\" solar sailship from the planette, and they head for the nearest working Fax gate. But a surprise awaits them there ...I thought this even a better book than The Collapsium. It lacks the previous book's almost insouciant inventiveness -- the \\"Tom Swift\\" nature I referred to above. But the characters are done better, in particular Conrad himself, and Bascal as seen by onrad. Bascal is an interesting creation -- a nice mixture of admirable and dangerous characteristics. Conrad and Xmary are nicely handled positive characters -- their frustration at heir lot as children in a world with no room for them as dults is well portrayed. The book remains inventive, and often funny, with a dark undertone (reinforced by a downright grim prologue and epilogue) that lends a certain (forgive me!) gravitas to the theme."},{"Title":"The Wellstone","review":"The Wellstone is the second novel in The Queendom of Sol series, following The Collapsium. In the previous volume, Bruno foils a plot to destroy Sol, is crowned King of Sol, and replaces the fragmented and compromised Iscog with the Nescog, based on Sykes' designs for the Solar Collapsiter Ring. Of more importance, that which was lost was found, and he marries the recovered Tamra.In this novel, a few decades have passed since the marriage; King Bruno and Queen Tamatra have a son, Prince Bascal. A born leader, he is most often found leading his companions into trouble. His parents have sent him to Camp Friendly on a miniature planet in the Kuiper Belt and he takes over the camp, terrifying the director and counselors, and then breaks out to return to Earth.The prince has come back to Earth to start a revolution (which is a surprise to his fourteen male companions). They gather upstairs in a cafe outside Denver and start partying. The prince gains the confidence of a local girl, Xiomara Li Weng, and aspires to attain access through her to a network of young people in the Denver area. He is planning to trash the Queendom or, at least, the wellstone in it.As the group is becoming organized, the Constabulary appears and place the escaped youngsters under arrest. At least, the cops think that they have all the escapees, but they fail to notice that one of the arrested boys is really a girl, Xmary, and so Feck is still at large. The revolution continues.This story is told from the point-of-view of Conrad Mursk, one of the prince's companions. Conrad (as Radmer) is also the protaganist of the framing story, wherein he travels to a miniature planet to retrieve Bruno de Towaji to correct a problem with the &quot;squeezed&quot; Luna. The framing story occurs much later than the central tale, so far in the future that Bruno's thoughts have worn deep paths through his brain. For some reason, the facsimile machines and the collapsiter web no longer function, so Radmer has to fly through space in a brass ball, using chemical explosives to propel the craft and manual navigation to guide it; he almost misses the king's planetoid, whereupon he would have been lost in space forever.This story is about the generation gap and immorbidity in the Queendom of Sol. The prince is a royal personage who may never reign, for his parents will potentially live forever. Moreover, his parents have been elected to the positions of Queen and King, so he might not be selected as King even if they abdicate.Like many seventeen year olds, Bascal is trying to find his place in society and in life itself, but he sees no future in it for himself and his friends. Of course, his parents don't fully understand his complaints and the arguments have gone on so long that everybody is frustrated. The prince is ready to just start breaking things.This novel is not quite dystopian, but it does illustrate the other side of material paradise. The basic premise is much like Heinlein's Beyond This Horizon, that material plenty and long life are not enough. Once mankind's physical needs are met and even luxuries are available to all people, what will each individual do to fill their lives? Most people have a need to achieve, but only a few individuals have the ability to create new things. What do the less talented people do to make their lives meaningful? If they cannot create, do they destroy things? This theme has been used before, but it worth repeating.The framing story is interesting, yet confusing. Maybe it will lead to the next installment in this series.Recommended for McCarthy fans and anyone else who enjoys hard science fiction about technologically advanced societies inhabited by realistic characters."},{"Title":"The Wellstone","review":"I think this book would stand well on its own, but it is equally amazing as a sequel to The Collapsium, which seemed impossible to top. I rarely have the feeling that I can't put a book down, but this one kept me up all night and home from work the next day. The realism and depth of this society, and its fascinating uses of technology such as programmable matter and solar/laser sails, do not stop the book from being both funny and moving at the same time. What is it really like to be immortal, in an immortal society where every need is fulfilled? McCarthy's answers are surprising but ring true. Wow."},{"Title":"The Wellstone","review":"I was first introduced to Wil McCarthy via his book BLOOM. I really enjoyed this and find myself recalling much of the imagery involved. It was a great tale.The Wellstone series (Collapsium, Wellstone, Lost in Transmission, To Crush the Moon) are proving to be a bit more effort to get through, but they are worth it. I recommend you start from the beginning, certainly, as the world that Wil McCarthy creates is pretty darn incredible. Like any good tale what makes it most compelling is not the high-tech gadgetry and such, but the reflections on the human condition. For example, if you could make copies of yourself at will, what rights would those copies have? Or if everyone were virtually immortal, what would this do to the ability of our children to mature? If we could genetically modify ourselves (even radically), what would the definition of human actually mean? These may seem like easily answered questions, or like questions that other authors have already explored, but Wil McCarthy puts his own unique perspective into these books and points out some valid and disturbing probable results.My only criticism would be that at times some subjects, some threads in the story, seem to be dragged out a bit more than is called for. I get a sense of sluggishness that hints at the likes of Terry Brooks (endless description...ugh) or Stephen R. Donaldson (endless character introspection...mercy). Fortunately, Wil McCarthy never quite succumbs to such digressions, but he skirts the territory a bit too close for my complete comfort.If you liked Bloom (and who wouldn't?), then take on the deeper more relevant topics in the Wellstone series."},{"Title":"The Wellstone","review":"This is a very interesting sequal to Collaspsium, continuing Mr. McArthy's well thought out \\"science-magic\\" witha good dose of Lord of the Flies. He has moved the series in a quantum direction and I'll reserve further judgement until I finish book 3.If you enjoy hard science fiction with high brow humor then you should certainly like this novel."},{"Title":"The Wellstone","review":"I was perhaps expecting something...different after reading the first book of the series (COLLAPSIUM). It was a tale of adult intrigue, romance, science fiction and an exploration of how longevity affects our society. The totally inappropriate title (WELLSTONE) suggest a foray into the wondrous possibilities of this miraculous material but alas we are left with a young male coming of age story.This is not to say that the plot is bad or that the action is not authentic. As the father of two teenage boys, the author nails it on the head with his descriptions of group rivalry, efforts to be liked, the innner thoughts of teenagers, their moods and quick jealousies and inability to control their mouth or their actions. But it needed to be more than this. The one outstanding device was the use of Conrad, the reflective lad who never tried to fool himself although he did manage to fool others. The opening and the closing featuring the matured young man (who for some reason changed his name) are like bookends, enclosing a wild tale of rides to the heavens, group pranks and enough angst to build a wellstone cathedral.Perhaps this was only a preliminary tale for the next in the series. Hopefully the boys will have matured and their actions will be more attuned to adult conduct. This is a good - though not great - read."},{"Title":"The Wellstone","review":"I couldn't stand this book. Well I read the whole thing, but it was painful. Prince Bascal is such a psychopath it really was no fun to read. Conrad's character was well done, multi-faceted and believable and I'm glad to have gotten to know him but on the whole this book came terribly close to ruining the series for me."},{"Title":"The Wellstone","review":"How can this book be a sequel when it: 1) the main characters in Collapsium only make a cameo appearances, 2) when the Collapsium storyline jumps 80 years into the future doesn't even follow a natural flow and 3) when the basic formula from Collapsium isn't adhered to?The majority of characters in Wellstone are teenagers, one of whom is Bruno's son, the prince. Bruno himself makes a simple cameo as the king of the Queendom and plays no major role. The teenagers are cookie cutter material compared to the invention of Bruno from Collapsium. Bruno was a driving force in Collapsium and really complimented McCarty's mix of hard science and wry wit. However, without Bruno the plot from Collapsium doesn't flow into Wellstone nor are the key ingredients adhered to. Wellstone reads NOTHING like Collapsium and if you enjoyed Collapsium, be happy that you did and stop the series where it started. The problem-solution progressive method of writing in Collapsium heralded back to George O. Smith's Venus Equilateral and proved to be an effective writing style for McCarthy. In Wellstone, this method was, again, used but not as obvious as it was in Collapsium. The teenagers needed use their intelligence to find ways of thwarting their captors, their elders and even each other.All in all, it was a semi-interesting book but calling it a sequel to Collapsium simply because it uses the same science and uses a few characters in cameo doesn't mesh well."},{"Title":"The Right Fit: A Novel","review":"James and Emma have gone though two years of trying to have a baby with no sucess, So they decided to adopt.

Going the international route they decide to adopt a Russian child, but deciding on what country to adopt from is the easiest part of this process! Emma and James go through extensive background checks, parenting classes and a wait list the size of Russia itself all to get the child that they have dreamed about but will this child be the right fit for Emma and James?I thoroughly enjoyed 'THE BABY TRAIL' because Moriarty's depiction of a woman struggling to get pregnant seemed very truthful and there were no easy answers at the end. In 'THE RIGHT FIT' however, the same determination that Emma had to conceive a child in 'THE BABY TRAIL' seemed a bit over the top in 'THE RIGHT FIT' and the ending seemed a little too neat and predictable for my taste. However, the secondary characters are just as lovable and the story of Emma's best friend Lucy and new boyfriend Donal is once again a real treat. Can't wait to read the third book in this series 'FROM HERE TO MATERNITY'!"},{"Title":"The Right Fit: A Novel","review":"It is best if you read this book after the first in the three part series.

Do yourself a favour and try it."},{"Title":"Soundscape","review":"I would guess that if you are a \\"sound professional\\" you will likely be familiar with much of the content in this book, or at least will have well-developed opinions about what's discussed. For non-professionals like me, this book provided a wealth of theories, ideas, explanations, suggestions, and examples--something I thought didn't exist until I ran across a reference to it in the art magazine, Modern Painters. It's not a \\"how-to book\\". Even so, it's a book that gave and will continue to give me plenty of ideas about different ways of integrating sound and SILENCE into my video projects. Even if you don't intent to make videos or movies yourself, this book will give you clearer notions about sound theory that will help crystallize what you might have already grasped intuitively but couldn't put into words, e.g., the notion that music is a vector. It's also about how the sound track for some well know movies was developed, Apocalypse Now, for example, and how the movie business works with regard to sound and the music score.There are chapters by David Lynch, Walter Murch, Randy Thom and other accomplished editors, directors, and sound designers. Just the chapters by Murch, Lynch, and Thom are worth the cost of the book! There are a couple of pretentious chapter authors but they are quickly discovered within the first few pages of reading and can then be easily skipped without consequence. Similar to silence, these dud chapters stand out all the more because they're in the context of such outstanding ones.Here are a few of the conclusions I came away with after reading the book. Silence can exist only to the extent that the possibility of sound is present. Silence is a metaphor for thought and can also induce thought in the viewer. Music sound loops can be disconcerting because they don't lead us anywhere. It's not just my hearing, many Hollywood movies have poorly produced sound tracks! Sound is 50% (or more) of a movie. Sound can determine what you see and vice versa. Dialog needs to be understood even if it's not important for the story.If you are making videos or movies of any kind or are an artist interested in incorporating sound into you work, this book is a real find. The same is true if you are just interested in film or if you are a movie reviewer. It's one of those books that caused me to both see and hear movies, and the world for that matter, in a different and more enchanting way. What more could a person ask of any book."},{"Title":"Pietro Annigoni: Monograph","review":"Annigoni is a painter out of time -- a 20th century realist painter on canvas and fresco who is indebted to the Italian \\"Great Masters\\" tradition -- Titian, de Messina, and Giorgioni come to mind. He was most-remembered in his lifetime for an expressive and fairly heroic portrait of the young Queen Elizabeth II. And his portraits of woman are absolutely arresting.This is not to suggest that he merely holds a mirror up to nature for, despite all the technique in his work, this is painter who -- while forswearing abstraction -- has a dynamic, expressive, and personal view. And this book showed me that he excels in much more than portraiture! Certainly, there are portraits here -- and the weakest of them have a formulaic cast to them -- but this book shows us an artist who produces amazing work in multiple mediums, including sculpture.Rasmo's \\"monograph\\" is a measured and lively defense. And a short one, for 90% of this book is taken up with full page illustrations. Given that this is a book from the early 1960's, the quality of reproduction here is excellent -- glossy plates with a great amount of detail -- about 40% in color.Book details: large format hardback, about 300 pp, 6 pounds!

There is no book that I have reviewed this year that I recommend more highly.This is the story of Martin. Martin is a Russian man who spends his days mending shoes and his nights in the pleasurable reading of the Bible. One night, after reading how a rich man invited Jesus to stay at his house, Martin wishes that he could invite Jesus to his house and wonders what he would do if Jesus actually showed up.The rest of the book is the story of what happens when Jesus comes. It is a story told with wonderfully spare language.

Terrific plot with twists that will surprise you and bring you into the current decade with the fall out, of the Vietnam war. Highly reccommend this book to anyone who enjoys history mixed with fictitious literature."},{"Title":"A Buffalo's Revenge","review":"I found Bob Lupo's novel about the Vietnam War to be a real page turner. I couldn't put it down and read half the book at frist sitting. The descriptive images that the author used, made me feel like I was back in the jungles 35 year's ago, when I was a just a young man there myself.Bob Lupo's novel is a good study in human relationships - in the most trying of situations. Although it deals with race relations - I found it was more about emotional and personal spiritual issues that at are basic to all men. I found myself thinking much deeper about the whole experience after putting down his book.I highly recomend this book to veterans of any war - or to those who want to get a feel for what it might have been like. Although the story line is not one comon to anyone's experience that I have ever meet - it uses the situation as a way to reveal the inner warrior, that those who fought there might relate to.This book would make a great movie, if it was ever discovered by the media. This book is well worth spending some time with. I rate it 5 Stars!"},{"Title":"A Buffalo's Revenge","review":"This fast-paced, turbulent novel focuses on passionate men and women, both American and Vietnamese, caught in a seemingly surrealistic web spun by the war in Vietnam during its intensity of the late sixties. From the author's own firsthand experiences, Lupo skillfully captures in the characters and plot that unparalleled ferocity of close combat---the dread, fear, and doubt---the despair and depravity---that creates a special camaraderie making the horror almost bearable for mortals thrown like coal into the very bowels of a burning hell on earth.Ominous events unfold in War Zone C (Tay Ninh Province) just miles northeast of Saigon near the Vietnamese-Cambodian border. Three young 25th Infantry Division soldiers befriend some local brothel girls in Tay Ninh City; the hometown of the Buddhist 'Cao Dai' militant sect and prime strategic target for local 'Charlies' and their NVA comrades, infiltrating like ants to honey through the infamous 'Dog's Head' border crossing tributary of the Ho Chi Minh trail. The GI's are told by the commie-hating girls of a plan to attack the 'Holy See' Cao Dai temple in Tay Ninh when South Vietnamese President Thieu is scheduled to give a political speech. This bit of round-the-bout intelligence sets the stage for the decimation of the crack NVA 350th Regiment in a monumental battle with few US loses.Great stuff for starters, as Lupo leapfrogs events into an intriguing, page-turning story. The three GI's: Doc Luane, James Jaggers, and Pee Wee Anson, are promoted for outstanding 'undercover' work (no pun intended), and, as things often work in the 'Green-machine,' their boss and guardian-angel, Colonel Anson, is promoted to general and assigned to Saigon. Under the circumstances, this couldn't have happened at a more convenient time it seems with Luane, Jaggers, and Pee Wee fighting for their lives against the VC while managing to get married to their Vietnamese heartthrobs. The good general has them transferred to the relative safety of Saigon, just before Tet of 68'. We all know what erupted then.During all this melee, the girls become pregnant, and Lupo explores the unique personalities of Luane, Jaggers, and Pee Wee Anson now rubbed raw with primeval instincts bared. This is staged against a testy background of racial tensions and negative feelings surfacing against the war, coupled with the bitter catalysts of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy's assassinations back in 'The World'. Doc Luane with his death-wish, Jaggers killer-instinct, and Pee Wee's hatred must somehow be resolved for good to prevail over evil. They bond together in a common goal of somehow getting their expectant brides out of harms way by whatever means possible---even if it means working in the rather shady backdrop of CIA vagabond, Bill Jenkins. Without giving the poignant ending away, I just might say that the author makes the adamant point of America being at war thirty-five years ago while still rattling its sabers in 2003 against an evasive enemy in which there can never be a clear-cut victory---a 'Buffalo's Revenge,' so to speak.From both a literary and editorial perspective, the book is well organized in placement and sequence of characters and events. Diction, idiomatic construction, and maintaining a proper tone with difficult subject matter deserves special mention. The dialogue is excellent! Mr. Lupo has a talented ability to reproduce everyday speech---both American and Vietnamese---especially the half-humorous and half-hostile exchanges of men who live and work together in constant fear. Conversion of the text to that of a screenplay would give full justice to the author's literary finesse of brilliantly creating a catharsis out of the dismal abyss created by all wars. A 'dang' good Vietnam war era read---highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A Buffalo's Revenge","review":"When I first started reading this book I felt as though I was in for something geared toward Vietnam Vets or possibly toward just people from that era. I was pleasantly surprised to find the themes and ideas perfectly valid for today's world climate. The strengths of the book are in Lupo's description of the Vietnam landscape, and the mood and feelings of those involved in the conflict. The interaction and dialogue among characters seems a bit disconnected, but I realized that this is probably for effect- You don't really sympathize with any character except maybe Lusane. The relationships that develop make you feel uncomfortable at times (the marriage of the soldiers to the Vietnamese women, for example) Just as I thought that the book was developing into a typical anti-war anthem, I realized the true underlying theme: The effects of racism. This is what makes this book still relevant in today's world events. I highly recommend this book for an interesting perspective on the Vietnam Conflict and it's effect.

So don't expect a book of the dimension that usually does justice to these types of photos. Let's just say that I wish I had a much larger format with which to enjoy the author's work.That said and out of the way, the author/photographer hits the mark exactly with a very intriguing facet of Old Mexico and the charming colonial city of San Miguel de Allende. Cities like this have an ancient patina to them, something that only history and time can impart. Like most art, you either get it or you don't, and this author gets it.The book isn't a metaphor to life inside the city, it is exactly what the title states - a collection of beautifully photographed handcrafted doors. But there is more; even if you have not made the journey to Old Mexico, you begin to know it by the faces of these doors. Much like human faces, there is embedded in each a perspective of a life lived and served, and serving, such that the reader/observer begins to wonder about the depths of the soul of each residence.I have been to San Miguel de Allende on one of several motorcyle journeys through Mexico. It is a land of enchantment, wonderful history, lively tradtions, excellent food, and most of all, a rich culture and some of the most vibrant, friendly people in all the world. They literally open their hearts - and doors - to all who travel and visit with humility and respect.This book deserves a larger footprint to display the author's work.

However Marie Borroff's amazing translation adds that beauty and eloquence which only a master translator can produce. Borroff uses an alliterative meter which will get you tongue tied if you try and read it out loud. For example the first line is &quot;Since the siege and the assault was ceased at Troy.&quot; She also gives us beautiful rhymes at the end of each stanza, like in lines 1236-1240: &quot;My body is here at hand,/ Your each wish to fulfill;/ Your servant to command/ I am, and shall be still/.&quot; The story is full of symbolism, and confronts us with a tough philosophical question. You have to read the book to find out what that is however. The book also deals with the problems inherent in the institution of chivalry, and especially courtly love.

That's awesome."},{"Title":"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (A New Verse Translation)","review":"&quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; is considered one of the finest Arthurian romances in English. It belongs to the so-called Alliterative Revival: the organizing device of the line is alliteration, the beginning of several words with the same sounds (&quot;foemen fled&quot;). Unlike most Arthurian romances, which deal with the end of Arthur's life and his death, in &quot;Sir Gawain,&quot; Arthur is still a youth, and the court is in its springtime. The main plot belongs to a type folklorists classify as the &quot;Beheading Game,&quot; in which a supernatural challenger offers to let his head be cut off in exchange for a return blow. The poem is chock-full of games and exchanges.Dr. Borroff studied under E. Talbot Donaldson, who translated &quot;Beowulf&quot; to prose during the same period at Yale.

And what an interesting little book it is. As the title indicates, it is a new verse translation (published in 1967) of a poem by a mediaeval poet who lived about the time of Geoffrey Chaucer.There is a short introduction about how the poem came to be preserved in the library of Robert Cotton, the great Elizabethan antiquary, as well as a description of this Authurian Romance with its theme of the ideal of knightly conduct - of courage, loyalty and courtesy. Equally interesting in this brief introduction is a discussion of the alliterative style of the poem, and the principles the translator had to follow to ensure that her translation into Modern English would be able to adhere as closely as possible to this style. There is a short section at the back of the book on the Metrical form of the original poem which provides a detailed description of the \\"alliterative long line\\" of the poem and samples of the original Middle English version for comparison with the translated version.The poem is about 2500 lines long and the alliterative style can probably be best appreciated if it is read out aloud. I am not going to go into the tale because that might spoil the fun, but it was an unexpectedly enjoyable read and I learnt more than I expected about the form and style of poetry of medieval times.I have a copy of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales in my library, and perhaps I may renew my acquaintance with that, even though the English which Chaucer used is quite different (and perhaps more modern) from that of this poem - something which might be explained by the fact that mediaeval knights of England were mainly of Norman blood, whose first language was primarily French rather than English. According to my readings on the history of Norman England, it was not until the 14th century that the \\"English\\" nobility really started to adopt the use of the language of their native English servants and serfs.If you like Arthurian Romances, this translation is easy and most enjoyable to read.

For example, Paris is depicted as a poor fellow who runs off with the woman of his dreams and gets here pregnant while awaiting the dastardly forces of her true husbands to come and force her back to Greece. The truth is, Paris is a cuckold, a thief, and a usurper; an all around vile spirit who get exactly what he deserves when Troy is sacked by Odesseus [the Son ofGod, aka the Son of Zeus, king of the gods]. Oddesseus is the true man who remains true to his wife and family and shows a passion for his love of his wife never exceeded when he slays the usurpers of his own kingdom when his return is delayed some 20 years. To portray Paris as any kind of hero whatsoever is sickening. Oddeseus retells his story of the Illyad and the Oddessey to his son, Telemacos, and therefore that act makes Oddesseus also Homer [the traveler or wanderer]. And, as far as we know, Oddesseus is the only one to survive the Trjoan War and the return home, further proof that Oddesseus is, indeed, Homer. Schliemann concurs in 1246 B.C. digging level as the true uncovered Troy.

You might try Hans Moravec's nonfiction speculations, or Dan Simmons' Endymion Series, or Robert Jastrow's now classic &quot;The Enchanted Loom: Mind in the Universe&quot; to name a few."},{"Title":"Genesis","review":"I think Author pushed his own brain to the limit to create these human-like avatars of quantum chaotic celestial gods. Author says most of life processes proceed on a quantum level beyond human comprehension.. The story reminds me of Herman Hesse's GLASS BEAD GAME with the change that Galactic Brain Nodes are the players and poor human consciousness gets to be the glass beads. Poul Anderson realizes this when he says some games are beyond human words and some works beyond music. To make the incomprehensible less so the Author resorts to myth and metaphor. This doesn't work for me but Author had no other option given the outer space he was shooting for. Few writers attempt or succeed so well in finding patterns of comprehension in the swirling chaos of modern day linguistic strange attractors.The bright human characters in this story have become too dissipated for the normal reader to relate to. The characters are all humming \\"is that all there is?\\" Who can sit shadow watching, star gazing and waiting to be uploaded or assimilated into a galactic brain? It seems a stretch that God Gaia, God Wayfarer or Alpha would get teary eyed about a human love couple but then viewers still do choke up at these Hollywood endings. Still the conflicts are excellent and the mythical metaphors exceptional. I especially appreciated that an uploaded human mind is likened to a gene in the chromosome of a galactic god.

Is artificial intelligence the same, less than, or greater than real intelligence? This book will certainly spark your imagination in these areas.The bad: Some of the plot is too thin, or too unexplained. There are points that should be shoved in your face but aren't. Some moments are anticlimactic.Overall: It this book all that it could have been? No. Am I sorry I read it? Not at all.

Poul Anderson tries to do the same here a few galactic revolutions (and hundreds of millions of years) on.It's no longer possible to separate humans from computers. Formerly biological intelligences get uploaded into immortality, then downloaded when they want to experience existence as living beings again. Minds join and separate at will. The universe (or the galaxy, at least-it's not entirely clear) is well-explored.Against this surrealistic backdrop, one of the main minds of the universe (call it Alpha) wishes to check up on the mind that's still on earth (Gaia). The latter is refusing assistance in helping to save earth from collision with a massive interstellar dust cloud a few thousand years hence (an eyeblink in this era). Why? Well, Alpha downloads an emissary and sends him along to find out.Saying much else would start giving things away, but let's just say Gaia is doing some interesting experiments. And let's say, too, that there's still room for love in what may seem a sterile universe.It's not always an easy read and ends in an unsatisfying way to me.

Finally, once the _computers_ have conquered the stars, Earth is remembered. However, the intelligence in charge of the Sol system has grown more and more evasive and secretive, so Christian Brannock is called upon to investigate and find out what secret the computer of Earth is hiding.This is a story of the near and far future. It is a dystopia, where humanity, in search of comfort and ease, surrenders its future to technology. But, with the disappearance of striving and overcoming, the flame of humanity is snuffed out. Do the computers care about the love of one couple? No. But do the computers care about the striving and advancement of life?

It is a fairly tame and disjointed love story (what was it with Poul Anderson and love stories in his last works?) that spans billions of years of human history (and that of the AIs left by humans after they disappear).As humans expanded into the solar system, Christian Brannock was there with his expert robotic skills necessary for the exploration of inhospitable places (like Mercury).On Earth, humans create a central AI to take care of the Earth and its inhabitants. Lucinda Ashcroft is its liason with humans. When it is determined that all life will be at risk in 9,000 years, it is the Central AI's job to ensure that Earth survives.A little while later, it is determined that only AIs will ever be able to explore the galaxy, and they are sent out on millions of years long exploration trips. Bored, Christian Brannock chooses to be absorbed by an AI so he travel to the stars on one of these missions. Lucinda Ashcroft is eventually absorbed by the Central AI.Over a billion or more years, the AIs sent out to explore the galaxy become a great Galactic Brain communicating on a galactic time scale as a collective one. The Central AI on Earth, now known as Gaia, is one of the collective Galactic Brain.Another Billion years or so with the Earth near the end of its life as the sun begins to expand, another member of the Galactic Brain, Alpha (the AI that absorbed Christain Brannock) decides that Gaia is not being completely forthcoming about the goings on on Earth and decides to send an emmisary and it instills the essense of Brannock in its core.Thus begins the love story of Christian and Lucinda as they are downloaded into simulacrums to interact during the investigation.While The Boat of a Million Years examined human history, Genesis seems to ignore it. When all is said and done, billions of years pass and the reader learns nothing of what is to come for human history.>>>>>>>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;A Guide to my Rating System:1 star = The wood pulp would have been better utilized as toilet paper.2 stars = Don't bother, clean your bathroom instead.3 stars = Wasn't a waste of time, but it was time wasted.4 stars = Good book, but not life altering.5 stars = This book changed my world in at least some small way."},{"Title":"Genesis","review":"In a genre noted for epic scope and lengthy timelines _Genesis_ by Poul Anderson really stands out. A billion years passes in the course of the novel though as one might imagine the reader does not follow along all or even most of what transpires in this setting's history.Reminding me in some ways of another excellent novel of his, _Starfarers_, Anderson handles the huge sweep of time in the book in several ways. For many of the individuals involved, they are traveling near the speed of light and relativistic effects mean that a few years for them translates into tens of thousands of years for the outside universe.A second way the author deals with such vast timelines is a plot device he used also in _Starfarers_; vignettes. In both books, Anderson would illustrate how human culture and history has progressed over huge amounts of time with what were basically short stories, portraits of humanity at a given place and time along the novel's continuum and as in _Starfarers_ tied in with the one of the novel's main themes.There was a third way the billion-year time frame was handled. Unlike in _Starfarers_ most of the main characters aren't human, they were either originally human and had their memory and personality uploaded into a machine consciousness or were artificial intelligences to start with. In this setting, actual physical human beings are too fragile and too expensive to travel the stars themselves, and instead uploaded humans and artificial intelligences make the journey instead (a similar concept used in the excellent trilogy by Sean Williams and Shane Dix that began with the novel _Echoes of Earth_).Though the novel begins in the relative near future, the main character being the astronaut Christian Brannock, busy with exploring the planet Mercury and an early pioneer of working in close partnership with a robotic artificial intelligence, the majority of the novel takes place in the far future, the results of such pioneers as Brannock and others. After a series of vignettes that show the progression of human history on Earth with the rise of increasingly powerful (and dominant) artificial intelligences, most of the novel is set in the far, far future. The artificial intelligence that controls Earth, named Gaia, has been strangely silent in the vast community of artificial intelligences that spans the entire galaxy and one of these artificial intelligences dispatches an emissary along with a downloaded human consciousness - the original Christian Brannock, one of the first people ever uploaded - to explore what is going in the birthplace of all galactic civilization. Additionally, it would seem that the Earth's biosphere is failing and the galactic network of intelligences wants to know what Gaia proposes to do about that, though again, Gaia is nearly silent on the matter. What will the emissary (named Wayfarer) and Brannock find? What was Gaia hiding? Does Gaia have some sort of sinister plan or is it just something the galactic community cannot understand unless one of its own sees for itself?A major theme explored in the novel is the nature of free will. As the machine intelligences through the course of a billion years become more powerful, intelligent, capable, and responsible for more and more details of life on Earth, is that a good thing for all concerned? Is the prevention of suffering, chaos, and evil always in the best interest of humanity? To get the good in humanity - friendship, charity, artistry, courage, leadership, love - does one have to allow for the bad - suffering, selfishness, greed, cowardice, and tyranny? The machine intelligences have achieved a great deal, a truly impressive body of knowledge and a civilization that is already spreading to nearby galaxies, but what have they lost in this pursuit?As is it hard to have a novel where the protagonists have knowledge far above and beyond any human is capable of, usefully the novel is presented largely through the eyes of the various human characters. In the far future setting the main characters are the intelligence and personality of Christian Brannock and a downloaded intelligence that Gaia provides to interact with him, a woman by the name of Laurinda Ashcroft."},{"Title":"Genesis","review":"Poul Anderson, one of our great science fiction writers, takes us on a journey of a billion years with this yarn.

Great resource for information in general."},{"Title":"The !Kung San: Men, Women and Work in a Foraging Society","review":"This 1979 book contains the findings of four years of fieldwork done in the 60s and early 70s by the well known American anthropologist Richard Lee (and others) among the !Kung San, a hunter-gatherer group living on the border of Botswana and Namibia in Southern Africa. All realms of !Kung life are documented in great detail, including the Kalahari desert environment they live in, its plant resources and animals, the tools the !Kung use, their hunting skills, the division of labour between men and women, and much more. It doesn't stay with written descriptions of the !Kung (which always have the danger of subjectivity), but the information is supplemented with a large number of tables and figures with quantitative information, like relative hunting success of !Kung men, caloric and protein levels in the !Kung diet, and !Kung homicide statistics. Some of the information might surprise you. The lives of hunter-gatherers are often thought of as \\"nasty, brutish, and short\\", but the !Kung show hardly any signs of malnutrition, it turns out they need to work only 12 to 21 hours a week to get enough food, and there are quite some !Kung over 60 years of age. Studying a hunting and gathering lifestyle is very important because humans have lived like this for about 95% of their existence and so it contains valuable information about were we come from. Unfortunately, in the world there are hardly any people living like this anymore. Lee reports that at the end of his fieldwork even the !Kung were, for better or worse, changing their way of life quickly with the arrival of agriculture, shops, beer, and a cash economy."},{"Title":"The !Kung San: Men, Women and Work in a Foraging Society","review":"This excellent book is a detailed account of every aspect of life in the \\"foraging\\" (hunter-gatherer) society of the !Kung San people of southern Africa.For me, the central importance of the book lies in that it shows what is POSSIBLE in terms of human social organisation. Defenders of capitalism tell us that it is futile to try to create a more co-operative and equal society because they claim that human society has always been, and always will be, unequal, class-divided, competitive and driven by the innate selfishness of human beings.But for over ninety percent of the time that Homo sapiens has existed, until the development of agriculture twelve thousand years ago, all humans lived in hunter-gatherer societies. These societies were classless, egalitarian and co-operative. (Marx and Engels called this type of society \\"primitive communism\\".)Of course, present-day hunter-gatherer societies are not exactly like their prehistoric equivalents. For one thing, none are untouched by more \\"advanced\\" societies. For another, the only remaining hunter-gatherers today live in marginal areas of the world: farmers and more developed societies have taken over the best bits. Nevertheless, studies by social anthropologists like Lee, combined with the work of archaeologists, can give us a good idea of how hunter-gatherers lived in the past.Incidentally, there is evidence from the archaeology of bones that our hunter-gatherer ancestors had a healthier diet and life-style than later farmers. No wonder that one social anthropologist has called hunter-gatherer societies \\"the original affluent society\\".Lee shows that the hunter-gatherer way of life is one which combines co-operation, equality and respect for individual freedom. Hunter-gatherer \\"leadership\\" only exists in terms of respect for someone's expertise. Leaders give advice, not orders; they do not accumulate more wealth than anyone else; and arrogance is not tolerated. These egalitarian attitudes are not the result of some abstract moral \\"goodness\\" of the people. They arise from the real, co-operative way of life that the people lead.Another aspect of these societies that should be mentioned is the equality of the sexes. Men do most of the hunting and women mainly do the gathering, because the latter are often breast-feeding or pregnant. But gathering is at least as important economically as hunting, so this division of labour does not lead to inequality between the sexes.Lee's book is an academic study, but the political lesson that I would draw from it is that only by getting rid of capitalism and taking collective democratic control of society can humanity combine the benefits of modern technology with the co-operation, equality and freedom that we see in hunter-gatherer societies.Phil Webster.(England)"},{"Title":"Constantine: A Great Christian Monarch and Apostle","review":"Constantine's faith leaps through the pages of this book as pure and strong and equal to the Apostles.

In his day, Tillich was held in high esteem not only among theologians, but by experts in many different fields for his incredible breadth of knowledge, his insight into culture, and his humanity.'Liberal Protestantism' sought to reconcile the gospel and the Christian faith with contemporary cultural ideas, rather then set the two up against each other. Religion is, for Tillich, the best of culture. (An alternative view, for example, is that of Karl Barth, who saw the gospel as fundamentally a critique of culture - as the Word speaking from outside ~to~ the world, not within the world). So, for Tillich, there should be signs of God everywhere, not just in Christianity, and religion and culture and closely connected.God, for Tillich, is not therefore the anthropomorphized God of the Old Testament, who has a personality and creates and destroys and judges in an almost arbitrary fashion. Instead, Tillich sees God as 'the ground of being'. God is the very fundament on which rests everything that is. God is the Abyss.The problem with man, for Tillich, is his 'finitude'. Man's life is finite, his body makes him finite, his capacities are finite, yet he craves to transcend these, to be unlimited, to be God. This is impossible; rather one should accept one's finitude courageously. This is what Jesus did singularly and perfectly - he never sinned, because he always accepted the finite nature of his being; he faced death courageously. Tillich's christology is therefore a 'spirit christology' (Jesus was led by the spirit) rather than a 'logos christology' (Jesus was God incarnate, the Word made flesh).The last important thing is that Tillich makes use of his famous 'theory of correlation'. This is how the 3 volumes of his ~Systematic Theology~ are set up. According to this theory, things in culture are correlated with the theology; theology provides the 'answers' to the 'questions' posed by culture. So his five sections (divided among the 3 volumes) are called: 'Reason and Revelation', 'Being and God', 'Existence and the Christ', 'Life and the Spirit', 'History and the Kingdom of God'.Tillich's writing is for the most part easy enough to read for the layperson - just don't get bothered by particular tricky bits. I would recommend it to anyone interested in theology; it has influenced a generation of theologians."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology, vol. 2: Existence and the Christ","review":"There isn't much more that I can say besides WOW! Paul Tillich uses a modern existential analysis of the human condition, and then a radical reinterpretation of the Christian tradition to understand and conquer the bleak condition of existential estrangement.In this volume, Tillich examines the conditions of existence and the feature of Christianity which makes it distinctive among religions: the Christ. Explaining that all religions are meant to diagnose the human condition and to provide ways to reunite man with his essential being. He shows how sin, guilt, and pride are marks of the estrangement of man from his essential self and how religion has consistently and traditionally explained this facet of his existence.However, he then begins his reinterpretation of the Christ event as the &quot;bearer of New Being,&quot; where Christ is the model for all to reunite themselves with their essence - to exist without being overcome by estrangement.In the book, Tillich uses an easy-to-read and uncomplicated prose to explain his ideas. No where near as complex as other thinkers, but easily as intelligent and dense, Tillich's Systematic Theology is the best attempt at a systematic reinterpretation of the Christian message I've ever read, and is a must-read for anyone interested in a discernible and acceptable rendtion of the Christian story in the world today."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology, vol. 2: Existence and the Christ","review":"In Tillich's first volume of this series, he discusses the sources of theology as he sees them - scripture (both text and the events behind the text), the overall church history and tradition, and the wider traditions and history of religion in the world. Tillich has a problem with seeing experience as a source, but rather prefers this to be seen more appropriately as the medium through which the sources are understood and analysed. Tillich introduces norms and the rational character of systematic theology - Tillich is in many ways writing for philosophers who have discounted the validity of theology in the modern world; by emphasising the aspects of reason and logic in his system, he carries more weight in that community. Tillich also develops his famous Method of Correlation, a dialectical system of engagement between the temporal situation and the eternal in an ongoing process.Tillich explores the various aspects and relationship of reason and revelation, including ways of trying to make sense in a rational manner of revelations, including what constitutes final revelation. From here, Tillich proceeds with his ontological constructions - one of the keys to Tillich's overall theology is contained here, in which God is the \`ground of being'. Some have accused Tillich of being an existential atheist, because they have heard that Tillich claims that God does not exist - while it is true that, for Tillich, God does not exist, it is not true that there is no God; Tillich defines the term \`existence' as being \`that which is created', and as God is not a created being, God cannot exist. Rather, God is something greater, something deeper - the ground of being. God also becomes the only appropriate \`ultimate concern' (another key element in Tillich's theology) - that concept is developed in that volume as well.While one could read the second volume without benefit of the first volume, it could be tricky. Volume two is primarily Tillich's Christology. Tillich has a small section that relates the second volume to the first, and restatements some major points from the first volume, but very quickly jumps into the concepts of existence/existentialism and Christian theology, developing from there concepts of sin and human estrangement (setting the stage for Christ and salvation/redemption in the new being of Christ). For Tillich, the central question of the age is one of meaning, and Christ is meaningful, as a New Being, who has a uniqueness and a universality, but not in typical Christian theological ways.Tillich, in his three-volume series on Systematic Theology, addresses the overall problem of meaning and meaninglessness in modern times. Written in the middle of the twentieth century, Tillich's theology is greatly influenced by the intellectual developments of the late nineteenth/early twentieth century philosophies, including such schools of thought as phenomenology (Husserl, Heidegger, etc.) as well as existentialism, and in particular issues such as \`the death of God' philosophical/theological speculations. Tillich's theology is also significantly influenced by (as are the intellectual developments of which he was part) larger historical events such as the first and second world wars. Tillich, a native of Germany, saw meaninglessness first-hand in the trench warfare of the first world war, in which he served as a chaplain. He also saw problems in the rise of the Nazi party, not just for political and cultural issues, but also theological issues (such as the idolatry of the state over God).Tillich, spirited out of Germany during the rise of the Nazi power, spent the remainder of his career teaching in universities and seminaries in the United States. This second volume of his major work in Systematic Theology was produced in 1957, while he was teaching in the United States - it is dedicated to his friends at Union Theological Seminary, where he first taught after leaving Germany.Tillich's theology is continued in two other volumes, the first volume produced in 1950, and the third volume in 1963, a few years before Tillich's death in 1965. Taken together, the three volumes represent a major theological force in the twentieth century, and one that is bound to continue to have impact for generations to come."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology, vol. 2: Existence and the Christ","review":"This second volume was released in 1957; the other two volumes in the series areSystematic Theology, vol. 1andSystematic Theology, vol. 3: Life and the Spirit: History and the Kingdom of God.Tillich notes in the Preface, \\"So many have asked for and urged the speedy publication of the second volume of 'Systematic Theology' that I am afraid that its actual appearance will be something of an anticlimax. It certainly will be a disappointment to those who expected that the second volume would contain the three remaining parts of the system.\\" He then adds, \\"The problems discussed in this volume constitute the heart of every Christian theology---the concepts of man's estrangement and the doctrine of the Christ. It is therefore justifiable that they be treated in a special volume in the center of the system.\\"Here are some representative quotations from the second volume:\\"in the Genesis story ... Man is caught between the desire to actualize his freedom and the demand to preserve his dreaming innocence. In the power of his finite freedom, he decides for actualization.\\" (Pg. 35)\\"Reinterpretation is also needed for the terms 'original' or 'hereditary' with respect to sin. But in this case reinterpretation may demand the rejection of the terms. Both point to the universal character of estrangement, expressing the element of destiny in estrangement. But both words are so burdened with literalistic absurdities that is is practically impossible to use them any longer.\\" (Pg. 46)\\"This is the only paradox and the source of all paradoxical statements in Christianity.... that Jesus is the Christ.... it is paradoxical, that is, against man's self-understanding and expectations. The paradox is a new reality and not a logical riddle.\\" (Pg. 92)\\"faith can guarantee only its own foundation, namely, the appearance of that reality which has created the faith. This reality is the New Being, who conquers existential estrangement and thereby makes faith possible.\\" (Pg. 114)\\"Only by taking suffering and death upon himself could Jesus be the Christ, because only in this way could he participate completely in existence and conquer every force of estrangement which tried to dissolve his unity with God.\\" (Pg. 123)\\"As a divine act, Regeneration and justification are one. Both describe the reunion of what is estranged.\\" (Pg. 179)"},{"Title":"Systematic Theology, vol. 2: Existence and the Christ","review":"In this continuation of Systematic Theology, Tillich reveals the deepest inner secrets of God, Christ and the Spirit. Very enlightening on the subject of The Spirit and the Trinity, and very important for those wishing to connect Christ with the preservation of consciousness. Tillich is brilliant in describing how the Trinity reaches out into the world to create and preserve all conscious life. Fantastic work - I cannot say enough positive things about Tillich. For an easier intro to Tillich, see such works as The Eternal Now, The New Being, and the Shaking of the Foundations. See also the works of Jurgen Moltmann."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology, vol. 2: Existence and the Christ","review":"Tillich plumbs the depths of Christology and a uniquely Christian existentialism.

We like a bridge over troubled waters. We needed a bridge into the new millennium. Bridges have a hold on us in a way that other examples of civil engineering do not. And we often don't notice them as we use them. Although I had traveled on the Natchez Trace Parkway many times, upheld by a bridge in Franklin, Tennessee, I had never looked down and appreciated the span until alerted to it a couple of years ago. It is a beautiful, big, parabolic concrete arch which I now get off and admire fairly often. According to _Bridges: The Spans of North America_ (Norton) by David Plowden, I am not alone. This bridge \\"is unlike any heretofore built in America and has been the recipient of innumerable awards.\\" Calling attention to the bridges we take for granted, and telling a history of American bridge building, Plowden's book is fittingly big, and displays his beautiful black and white pictures in large format, splendidly reproduced. It is properly sized for the coffee table, but the text is appropriately comprehensive, and as worth reading as the pictures are worth admiring._Bridges_ is divided into chronological sections based on the materials used: stone and brick; wood; iron; steel (divided into three time periods, since there are so many steel bridges); and concrete. Erecting a stone bridge was expensive and time consuming, especially compared to using wood. There are more miles of wooden bridges than any other type in America, although Plowden has little good to say about the \\"cult of the covered bridge\\" which has obscured the trusswork he thinks is the important part of these wooden bridges. Iron was used for bridges for only a short time, and iron bridges are the rarest of bridge artifacts. Concrete bridges are the way to go for the main bridge-building impetus in America, the highway system. Reinforced concrete does extremely well for piers to hold bridges up, as well as for the flats that carry traffic. Plowden spends many pages on the most famous type of bridge, the steel spans, and his pictures of the Golden Gate Bridge and the Brooklyn Bridge present them in new ways, and he hurtles through the engrossing stories of their construction because they are relatively familiar. The stories of lesser known bridges, such as the wonderful Eads bridge in St. Louis (built by Captain James Eads, of few engineering credentials and no bridge experience) bring to light many surprising difficulties and solutions the bridge builders came up with.Plowden's history serves as a demonstration of engineering problem-solving. Each bridge is unique in purpose, location, and difficulties of completion. This is true even in replacement bridges. Many of these beautiful photographs show bridges that are no longer existent. There have been bridge failures, of course, but usually bridges built in the nineteenth century show signs of distress, and are called out of commission. Sometimes railroads simply no longer need a particular link. There are, however, new vistas for bridge building, especially in the straits and bays that have needed bridges and now have proposals for bridges meeting new engineering and economic abilities previously unavailable. Plowden is confident that utility will continue to be combined with beauty, and his handsome book supports such confidence."},{"Title":"Bridges the Spans of North America","review":"America's bridges are beautiful. This book provides a history of the materials used for construction, the designs of a great many American engineers, and photos of many, many bridges. There is also a comparison of the bridges of America and those of Europe. Now somebody needs to bring all this up through the outstanding bridges of very recent years."},{"Title":"Bridges the Spans of North America","review":"I bought this book because I like to see pictures of beautiful bridges, and I knew the author's reputation for great photography. However, there was a huge bonus -- the author's entertaining and informative stories behind the building of the important and/or beautiful bridges. Some parts of the descriptions could be dry at times but it is easy to skip to the next paragraph if you fell like you're getting bogged down. He also devotes time to why the bridge was important in the development of bridge architecture. Plus, you'll get stories about the people who designed and built the bridges. The author clearly has a love affair with this form of architecture -- he sees the art as well as the functionality aspects of b ridge building. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Bridges the Spans of North America","review":"In his Preface, Plowden writes \\"One does not need to be an engineer to appreciate the idea of a bridge, or its beauty; there is no more overt, powerful, or rational expression of man's ability to build.\\" He then goes on to convincingly demonstrate the truth of his assertion. Featuring a large selection of 11 by 10\\" B&W photos (some a century and a half old), he uses them to brilliantly complement his authoritative text. The only fault I can find with the book is that there are no color photos. But my gripe is minor when compared to the rewards of reading through this masterpiece of bridge literature. A \`must read' for anyone interested in North American bridges."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"Scott Berg's biography of Max Perkins is a warm, sparkling account of America's greatest editor in the prewar period, the midwife for works by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, and Thomas Wolfe in the twenties and thirties, when big-time publishing converged on New York. Berg's book is cunningly organized: the reader steps at once into the rough and tumble of editorial work at Scribner's, leaving Perkins' early life, marriage, and family to be described in concise digressions taken only after we get another satisfying dollop of publishing history. Unhappily, once Perkins has delivered his discoveries to the public, the rest is mostly about their boozy extravagance (Fitzgerald), bullying ego trips (Hemingway), and petulant indiscipline verging on insanity (Wolfe). So even if, for this reason, you stop two-thirds of the way through, your curiosity about this key figure in modern literary history will be very well satisfied."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"Scott Berg has rescued from obscurity, &quot;the writer's editor&quot; Max Perkins. Idiosyncratic, compassionate and brilliant, Mr. Perkins edited the writers that taught this century to read. This account is as humane and fascinating as its subject. This book, its author and its subject are enjoyable and (extremely) appreciated."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"Maxell Perkins was not only the editor behind the novels of Thomas Wolfe, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Ernest Hemingway, but also each's best friend. Prefering to stay in the background, Perkins brought an infallible sense of structure to each project. He also had the patience of Job, which was necessary when dealing with Wolfe's endless writing, Fitzgerald's endless drinking, and Hemingway's endless bravado. But, Perkins work with the three literary giants was only the tip of the iceberg. He also brought to the fore James Jones's FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, Rawling's THE YEARLING, Taylor Caldwell's DYNASTY OF DEATH and many others. A very readable and informative biography--and as Perkins would have liked it--wonderfully written by A. Scott Berg."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"I found this classic in the library the other day and what a treat it was to read. To read--but not to accept. It's a sad but inexorable fact that editors today are more salesmen and paper pushers than shapers of authors. What comes through in Berg's fine biography is that writers like Scott Fitzgerald and Thomas Wolf would likely fall through the cracks if they toiled at the desk now. Although Perkins is best known for his troika (the first two authors mentioned) and Hemingway, I had not known that he was largely responsible for Douglas Southhall Freeman writing his multi-volume history of Robert E. Lee. This superb work is as disciplined and fascinating as its subject."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"Berg's work rallies all aspiring authors to the cause of sainthood for Max Perkins...maybe even deification. He tracks Perkins's career vis-a-vis the literary careers of important 20th century American authors. Gives a peek at the largely ignored man behind the curtain...and stands as a monument to his contributions to our literary heritage. A must read for anyone who enjoys books."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"Max Perkins was the great editor at Scribners who handled quite a few of the finest writers of the twentieth century, F. Scott Fitzgerad, Hemingway, and Thomas Wolfe being especially noteworthy (and dealt with at length in this biography). One might envy such a man with such a job, but Berg makes it clear that having to deal with the likes of these authors was like walking around with a huge millstone around Max's poor neck. His job was endless and thankless (Wolfe actually betrayed him). You see from the many letters quoted that many of them are blatant pleas for money. Saying that Perkins had to coddle some of these authors like children would be putting it mildly. Berg does an admirable job relaying Perkins's life and hard times.

Scott Berg did an astounding job of it, and I suspect it didn't happen over a few months. Other reviews, (save for one long one and critical one here, that reveal the ending of the book and should be edited to remove that section), do a grand job of reviewing the book."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"Max Perkins, Editor of Genius [\\"MPE\\"], A. Scott Berg; E.P. Dutton (1978)On a gloriously deep-blue page within the cover, Berg inscribed his best wishes to a reader... & dated it, \\"March 1980, Santa Barbara.\\" March 1980 was Hell Month. \\"I sure hope this isn't an omen\\" was my uneasy reaction.It wasn't. MPE is splendid. Despite its mistakes, this is a quality work & I'm grateful that this used book surfaced in the Lyrical Ballad. But I wish that editor Tom Congdon had stepped away from his desk to acquire perspective, or had stepped up to the plate with more insight. Almost all of MPE's remarkable deficiencies could have been easily remedied.It's too bloody long. Berg spent altogether too much time detailing the life of Thomas Wolfe (a writer passionately detested by later generations of American high school students) & his bizarre relationship with Perkins. If you like selfish, witless, drunken, mean-spirited & pathologically egotistical writers, this will be your epiphany. Dive in.(Wolfe's index entries run two pages long. Who is the subject of this book - Perkins or Wolfe?)The space wasted on Wolfe could have, instead, been used to include Malcolm Cowley's April 1944 The New Yorker magazine's profile of Max (published three years prior to Perkins's death, resulting in his well-deserved fame, which he had previously spent decades avoiding with \\"pathological self-effacement\\"). And Berg could have spent more time with the other remarkable authors edited by Perkins, such as Marcia Davenport & Marjorie Rawlings.\\"Perkins maintained a public position of silent neutrality, but to special friends such as Scott Fitzgerald & Elizabeth Lemmon, he told all\\" (p. 326).\\"Perkins maintained a silent neutrality, but privately, to Fitzgerald & Lemmon, he told all.\\"The first sentence above is what Congdon left intact. The second is essentially the same information minus the redundancies.Berg has already spent the better part of 40 pages detailing Perkins' relationship with F. Scott Fitzgerald (editor-author) & Elizabeth Lemmon (his lifelong platonic romantic interest). At this point, who needs to be told that they were his \\"special friends\\"?And the context of \\"public position\\" had already been established in the story of Ernest Hemingway getting the drop on Max Eastman in Perkins office, when the media sensationalized the fight in the next day's newspapers. \\"Maintained a strict neutrality\\" is sufficient.Congdon easily could have trimmed Berg's meandering overemphasis on Wolfe & the dishy \\"special friends\\" schlock-tinged reference without harming the book at all, ending up with a taut manuscript of @ 400 pages - the reading of which would have been so much more enjoyable.Also: The photo text-captioning design & print size is a disaster, & most of the photos selected are dreadful (in the group portrait of Max's five daughters, they look like they're witnessing a hanging).In another, I believe that columnist Franklin P. Adams is standing next to Max, his wife Louise Perkins, & Aline Bernstein (Wolfe's crazy married mistress). Adams is unidentified, ignored altogether - despite being the one closest to the camera, the physically largest of the four, & a notable talent in his own right.The \\"baseball manager\\" photo of Elizabeth Lemmon is appalling; the two-page, background-of-black-ink montage of photos & Max's sketches looks like a refrigerator collection of kindergarten crap.And the ending of the book is remarkably inept.James Jones, one of Max's final prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, in the revising of From Here To Eternity discovered that \\"Perkins's writing lessons were making sense. 'Eventually...the concept of a paragraph came to me for the first time. I realized the power I held to raise or lower a reader's emotional level by where I ended a paragraph.' \\"And seven years earlier, Hemingway, one of Max's earliest authors, had come up with \\" the idea of concluding [For Whom The Bell Tolls] with an epilogue.\\"Despite both of these warning beacons in his own book, Berg did not end the story with his understated but moving, \\"As Tom [Wolfe's] deathbed letter to Perkins became his last written words, so did Max's own memorial to Thomas Wolfe become the final words that he edited.\\"It ends, instead, with the emotionally flat & pointless account of the final years of Louise Perkins life as a drunken widow, finally dying by her own inadvertent hand with a lit cigarette that ended up torching her home.Jones's discovery - stated by the author only fourteen pages earlier! - of the power obtained over readers by deciding where a paragraph ends, was then ignored in the crafting of the conclusion of Max Perkins.The demise of Louise Perkins belonged in a next-page epilogue - Hemingway's device - where the subdued tone that had wrecked the ending, would have been, instead, perfectly appropriate. She mattered, but she never truly figures as a central figure in the telling of this story, & only merits inclusion in the second half of the book (due to her increasingly eccentric behavior).(In that vein, anything that didn't pertain to Perkins & his authors should have been either scaled down or altogether jettisoned - just as various \\"excellent\\" sections of Wolfe's promiscuous writing had to be tossed from the massive raw manuscript of Look Homeward Angel, so that the book could be finally published.)But at a deeper level, no editor could have saved \\"iceBerg\\" from his Achilles heel - his emotional remoteness from his material.Wolfe could be charming, but was mostly volatile. Hemingway could make Wolfe look like Little Bo Beep. Aline Bernstein's binges were unforgettable. Yet, the only page on which the volatility & passion of Max's authors, acquaintances, or Max himself can be found was when Marcia Davenport exploded & confronted Wolfe with the truth, of what kind of a person he truly was:\\"I think you're a rat...ungrateful & treacherous. That dedication [to Perkins, in Of Time & the River] was disgusting. It didn't mean devotion to Max, it was just spilling yourself...you have no devotion & no loyalty either. Where would you be without Max & Scribners...?\\"(The odd feeling of having been here before arose, with immediate recall of Rodric Braithwaite's soggy noodle account of the Nazi invasion of Russia & the siege of its capitol in \\"Moscow 1941.\\" The first guy to lose his temper was Stalin, @ 80-100 pages into the story. Surely that could not have been the case.)At any rate, the last page is the telling page. Not only does Louise not belong in the crescendo; the action is flat & lifeless. As the Perkins house blazed, \\"on Sunday, February 21, 1965, firemen were summoned...\\"Firemen are not \\"summoned.\\"They are called by frantic people often in a state of panic. Family members might be trapped in the flames. Firemen, swearing, bolt to the waiting truck. The engine kicks in. The firehouse doors fly open. Then that truck, with sirens blaring & lights flashing, tears down the road at dangerous speeds so that a terrifying fire can be fought to defeat by men who in saving lives may lose their own.*****I'm seldom, if ever, impressed by the endorsements featured on dust jackets, but the following, by Hemingway scholar Carlos Baker, is brilliant.Aside from the beauty of the writing, considering the countless falsehoods printing on other dust jackets, I guarantee you, this is the only one that I will ever quote in its entirety with respect:\\"The anonymity that Maxwell Perkins sought & partly achieved in his lifetime has continued to prevail in the thirty years since his death. This excellent & warm-hearted biography of one of the great literary editors of our time now brings Perkins's career & personality out of the zone of shadows & into clear & revealing light.\\"Mr. Berg has made literally hundreds of fresh discoveries & has woven them into a continuously entertaining & often moving narrative that shows Perkins exactly as he was in his personal life as well as in his association with the many leading American writers whom he discovered & skillfully nurtured into fame & fortune.\\"Almost perfect. But the one phrase that just doesn't belong, in this otherwise entirely deserved tribute to Berg's skill & perseverance, is \\"warm-hearted.\\""},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius is one of the best non-fiction titles I've read in a long time, and will likely be one of the best books I'll ever read. Berg (with the help of his own editor) truly is a genius: he pulls us directly into the story, introducing us to Scribner's Max Perkins at the zenith of his editorial career, then plunges us into his first acquisition -- F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Beautiful and Damned -- before taking us, methodically, through Perkins's life. An intrepid biographer, Berg tells us only what we need to know about Perkins's early life, getting to the good stuff: his discovery of Fitzgerald and Thomas Wolfe and his work with Ernest Hemingway. We also find out about Perkins's work with other remarkable authors, including Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings (The Yearling), S.S. Van Dine (the Philo Vance mysteries), and Arthur Train, creator of the mythical DA Ephraim Tutt. I laughed out loud at the story about how many believed that Tutt existed after the publication of his \\"autobiograhpy,\\" complete with photos.We learn of Perkins's patient relationship with the frustrating Thomas Wolfe, a mammoth talent and physical specimen who could not contain his own enthusiasm. Berg suggests that, as Perkins discovered, Wolfe wasn't writing \\"books,\\" he was writing one book, which would have encompassed thousands of pages if he had not died early -- a profound insight into the heart and soul of a dynamic author.We learn much of Papa Hemingway as well, including some insights into the macho author's home life. Elements of Hemingway's unpublished fiction suggest that the bullfighting fan, fisherman, and big game hunter might have enjoyed switching gender roles in bed with one of his wives.Fitzgerald comes off as one who excelled in being pathetic, a man who suffered desperately with his wife, Zelda, alcohol, and simply living large. Berg gives us a tender portrait of Perkins's greatest find.As with all excellent biographies, Max Perkins: Editor of Genius examines only what made Perkins who he was: the editor of the twentieth century. Perkins preferred to sit on the sidelines, championing his authors. Often, he sits on the sidelines in this book as well, but this only makes sense: he was famous for his work with his more famous authors. It wasn't Max, it was his interaction with these great authors that made him all great.As some reviewers have pointed out, Max would have enjoyed thsi book."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"If you are an admirer of F.Scott Fitzgerald, Ring Lardner, Thomas Wolfe, Earnest Hemingway, Marjorie Rawlings; basically any significant American writer of fiction during the first half of this century--buy the book. Here's how I would put it: If those authors could send ONE, just one posthumous request for you to purchase a particular book, &quot;Perkins: Editor of Genius&quot; would be my sincerely expected choice. Why? Because he wasn't just the &quot;editor of genius&quot;: he was their friend. Maybe in some cases like Mr. Wolfe's, the only REAL friend of a lifetime. Fitzgerald wrote in his last years, &quot; Max, you are the only person who has never lost faith in me.&quot; Even after Scott Fitzgerald's too short existence, Max was a warrior for a reputation which he confidently predicted would survive the fads of that time. This is a study for those of us who can only regret never meeting him, a study in accepting the short-comings of others with understanding; and demanding the best from ourselves. Words are cheapened by their use in describing Max, because their cousins are seen so often where the object is so less deserving, but buy the book. Mr Berg paints a wonderous, living picture, whose thousand words I believe venerable Perkins would have approved--if somewhat sheepishly."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"Max Perkins was the conductor of the most outstanding literary orchestra ever assembled. He orchestrated each players performance into a sound of America that still plays. The players were from all segments of our society, male, female, protestant, catholic, mid-west, south,east coast, loners, extroverts, introverts, warriors, lovers; a spectrum of background, all from whom Max Perkins could whittle out classic literature. His love of writing and writers was his primary concern; financial success of the book, while important, was not his ultimate priority. There were times he allowed writers to get books out of their system, which he believed might not be successful, because he knew that the writer had to get by that story before they could write their best work. Intuition yes, but absolute understanding of each writers strengths and weaknesses. He gave himself to writing and our country's literary legacy reached it's summit with his stable of writing talents. A.Scott Berg in his own way has written a classic biography about a classic editor who edited classic writers. It was the golden age of writing and editing, a time before television and sales completely dominated the art of language expression."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"This is a wonderfully written book, very informative and inspiring for authors, editors, agents and anyone else involved or interested in publishing.

By no means was that a wasted effort! This biography is very well written and opens up new vistas to readers of great fiction from the 20s and 30s.Perkins was the editor for Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and Thomas Wolfe. These are the three which get the bulk of print spent on them. You see that Perkins was much more than an editor and went to great lengths to help these writers discover as much of their potential as possible. He never wanted to credit for these and felt that the editor should always be hidden in the background.Aside from the authors mentioned above, I found that Perkins also assisted authors like Bourjaily, Jones (&quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;), Rawlings (&quot;The Yearling&quot;), and Sherwood Anderson (although there was a bit of a falling out).A. Scott Berg inserts a lot of information into the text, yet it is still very readable. Even in sections when I felt there was more Thomas Wolfe than needed, I still went through the book without wanting to put it down.Even if you are not big into editing, just to hear a &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; view of some of your favorite authors will make this book worthwhile to you."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"Scott Berg has written a wonderful biography on one of the most important men in American literature, Max Perkins. Berg's book is well-written and very entertaining. It is more than a biography of Perkins, it is also a biography of Hemingway, Scott Fiztgerald, and Thomas Wolfe, and a portrait of America during the first half of the 20th century. This is one of those books that I could go on and on about. It is a book that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Max Perkins: Editor of Genius","review":"Shy, sensitive, but extremely loyal to the authors whose works he edited, he not only saved the House of Scribner's from a premature demise, but also redefined the job description of an editor. Without his willingness to show authors how to cut and polish their lumps of coal until they finally emerged as shimmering diamonds, our library shelves would display woeful gaps. I cannot imagine a literary world without the books of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Will James, Arthur Train, Thomas Wolfe, Ernest Hemingway, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, Ring Lardner, Taylor Caldwell, Alan Paton, the anthology by Professor Copeland of Harvard which formed such an integral part of my youth, &quot;The Copeland Reader,&quot; and so many others."},{"Title":"Malice in Maggody","review":"The Maggody series is absolutely one of the funniest set of books I have ever read. You'll find that the storyline is secondary to the people that live in this town. I find myself wanting to know more about the lives of the people that live there then finding out who the murderer was. For those of you who've been to rural communities you 've most probably seen the washing machine on the front porch right beside the tv and sofa, the half dozen junk cars rusting in the yard, the several dozen bald tires etc. For those of you who haven't, her description of Maggody are really based on facts. A truly comedic version of the movie, 'Deliverance'. I have read this series three times and I still get a side-splitting kick out of them. The story starts off with the introduction of Arly Hanks, the Chief of Police of this small town. She's about the only normal one. The other characters that show up frequently in the series are Arly's nosy mother and her sidekick who happens to own the only beauty shop in town, the Mayor and his wife who are also cousins, a 'hell and damnation' preacher who is constantly hoping to witness or listen to any unusual sexual activities, a moonshiner and his pet sow that watches tv and gets her own recliner, a young man named Kevin Buchanon and his well rounded wife and lots of polecats. There are loads of quirky characters who are a hoot to read about. Even their names are hysterical - Siffalus, Petrol, Diesel, Peteet and many many more."},{"Title":"Malice in Maggody","review":"I swear the characters in all of the Maggody books are REAL--Joan Hess has done an absolutely AMAZING job of populating Maggody with delightfully human and real people with a flawless eye towards their foibles, their inadequacies, and their sensitivities. Those readers from anywhere else may scoff, but I grew up in a small town near the Ozarks, and I KNOW the characters in these books are real. They are the people I grew up with and the relatives that show up at my family reunions. I could easily let myself get homesick if I weren't so busy laughing at their antics."},{"Title":"Malice in Maggody","review":"Maybe I'm missing something here. This is my first book in this popular mystery series and I just don't get it. All the characters represent some type of Southern stereotype, the detective work is haphazard at best, and the ending is reminiscent of something out of the Dukes of Hazzard, where everything just happens to fall into place. Wow! This was the third book book in the series, if they are all like this I am amazed it has continued."},{"Title":"Malice in Maggody","review":"I found this book in a box of old paperbacks that my grandfather had in his basement. The only reason I read it was because I liked the cover (never judge a book by its cover) and it was not as thick as most paperbacks and fit easily into my purse. This event turned into an absolute love for Joan Hess and Maggody. I can't tell you how many times I laughed out loud while reading this book. Cute plot twists and the characters are classic."},{"Title":"Malice in Maggody","review":"You're a redneck if... You don't see the humor in this, the first, in the Arly Hanks Ozark mystery series. Seriously, this book rises or falls on the readers willingness to enjoy some corn-pone silly humor. Some days I can do it, other days I can't. Fortunately, I read this in a good mood and was able to enjoy it (tho I swear I never watched the Dukes of Hazzard). The characters are caricatures of southern small town life.Still, it's only a three star effort in my book. The mystery component is rather weak - certainly not a page turning suspense novel. I'm willing to give the series another try as several later books in the series have garnered Agatha nominations."},{"Title":"Malice in Maggody","review":"You know you're living in a small town with simple folk when the smartest resident manages to pass the GED exam on the third try, and her biggest ambition lies in a beauty school at the state capital.Okay, so fictional Maggody, Arkansas isn't that archaic, but it certainly has its share of interesting folks, most of whom are name Buchanon (you'll just have to read the book for the explanation). Keeping, or trying to keep, order among the good citizens of Maggody is sheriff Arly Hanks, a native who fled and eventually reverted for a quieter life. Fat chance.All the malice in Maggody seems to be happening at once, with an escaped rapist threatening to make his way back to town to his ex-wife, the would-be beautician (the novel's victim), and the mysterious disappearance of a state official come to survey a nearby reservoir as the home of future sewage, and one wonders if Arly will flee back to the serenity of Manhattan.She doesn't, though, much to the delight of mystery fans, and the &quot;malice&quot; in Maggody turns into hilarity in its final scenes."},{"Title":"Malice in Maggody","review":"I live in the Ozarks myself (albeit a ways north of the border from Ms. Hess), so I can vouch for the fact that yes, people like the inhabitants of Maggody, Arkansas, do really exist. But it was a bit painful to see so many of them concentrated in one spot. Maybe it's just wishful thinking, but I hope Hess wasn't going for total realism in this book. (But if I have to wonder, I suppose it's a moot point.)So, some of it was just a tad too far over the top to be comfortable. But the puzzle was done well, and I did enjoy it a great deal, in spite of myself."},{"Title":"Malice in Maggody","review":"I must say, I really got more than a few chuckles reading this, the first installment in the Arly Hanks Ozark mystery series.After the failure of her marriage in New York, Arly moves back to Maggody, Arkansas her hometown she was always trying to escape and takes a job as the local sheriff. She gets very little, much-needed relaxation when a local EPA person who was about to release a report okaying the dumping of sewage in the town's favorite fishing hole, suddenly disappears. Believe me, it just gets crazier from there on. The town is populated with a ton of wacky locals who add charm and humor to the intriguing mystery. The ending is completely madcap and wonderfully entertaining. Not a book to read in public if you're embarrassed about laughing out loud!Somewhere between the realm of cozy and soft-boiled, this is the first in a series you shouldn't miss. Kudos to Joan Hess!"},{"Title":"Malice in Maggody","review":"Meet Chief of Police, Arly Hanks. She's back home in Maggody, Arkansas, population 755, recovering from a nasty divorce. She wanted some quiet time to decompress and gather her wits about her, and that's just what she got. Life in Maggody is slow, really slow. There's no crime to speak of, and about the only action she ever sees is a car wreck out on the highway, once every month or so. Her biggest chief of police decisions usually involve where to set up the speed trap, in the school zone, or at the signal light. So it comes as a big surprise when two real crime cases fall her way on the same day. First a former Maggody resident, now housed at the state correctional institution escapes and looks to be heading home. Then an EPA contract specialist sent to sign the paperwork for an unwanted sewage treatment plant that the residents of Maggody are sure is going to pollute their swimming and fishing holes, goes missing. Add to that the murder of a local, and it looks like Arly is going to have to buckle down and get busy, fast. With the whole town tight lipped and stonewalling her investigation, it's going to take all her cunning and training to sort out all this mayhem and madness, and get to the truth..... Sit down and get comfortable, Joan Hess is about to take you on a roller coaster of a ride through the Ozarks. This is a light, comical mystery, easily read in one sitting, that will have you smiling, chortling, and laughing out loud. Her entertaining story line is well paced and clever, and her writing is crisp, witty and full of irreverent dialogue and back-woods southern humor. But it's Ms Hess' well drawn, engaging and original characters that really make this novel stand out, and once you've gotten to know Maggody's finest and not so finest, you'll be hooked for sure. Malice In Maggody is the first of a marvelous and delightful series. Do yourself a big favor, start here at the beginning, and read them all."},{"Title":"Malice in Maggody","review":"This is just the type of mystery I love. Small town filled with eccentric characters, lots of humor, not to mention plenty of sex! I had seen this series for years, but always assumed it was a very cozy, sweet little series. Wrong! Laugh out loud funny in the style of Kathleen Taylor's Dakota series. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Malice in Maggody","review":"If you start to get a little tired of the fast-paced suspense thrillers, the gritty mysteries and the noir police procedurals; if you miss a good, old-fashioned mystery, with charming people in a charming place; check out the Magoody series. While my previous sentence might make you think this series is too \\"precious,\\" I can assure you that it is not at all. These are well-written mysteries - even murders - but done with a back-home country twang that you can't help but love.Arly Hanks - after going through a bitter divorce and leaving her job as a police detective in New York City - moves back home to Magoody, Arkansas, and takes over as chief of police. It is a quiet job in a very small town (which population I can't find again now that I want it, but it was smaller, I remember, than my own home town, which boasted about 700 people in town and another 300 throughout the country thereabouts ...) where nothing ever happens.Until now. There is need for new waste-relocation sources for a neighboring town, and when the EPA OKs the dumping of sewage into Magoody's favorite fishing hole, people are up in arms. The EPA bureaucrat who is supposed to show up and get all the paperwork signed ... doesn't show up. And then a barmaid - young, pretty and about to \\"escape\\" to cosmetology school - turns up dead.This is a really fun series - I've read three or four of them - and although they are somewhat hard to find, they are definitely worth the effort to get and read. Don't miss out!"},{"Title":"Malice in Maggody","review":"This is the first book in the truly hillarious Arly Hanks series.

Highly recommended for cozy mystery lovers!"},{"Title":"Malice in Maggody","review":"Generally I read pretty heavy murder mysteries (James Patterson, John Sandford, etc.). But now and then I like to take abreak from novels that are of course fiction, but are close enough to reality to make you uneasy. The Maggody books aremurder mysteries but they are also little gems of cartoon like comedy set in a one stop light town on a not so busy highway. If you're looking for an easy read and a pleasant diversion you should spend a little time in Maggody."},{"Title":"Malice in Maggody","review":"_Malice in Maggody_ is light, comical, yet keeps you on the edge of your seat. Arly Hanks is definetly NOT the &quot;Nancy Drew&quot; type, which is one reason I liked the book so much. Her relationship and interaction with the other characters in the book, especially with her mother, is very believable. Though it is not difficult to read, the &quot;mystery&quot; is captivating. You can't wait to read just how she will figure everything out. This is definetly a &quot;Must-Read!&quot;"},{"Title":"Malice in Maggody","review":"This is ground zero, the first in the Maggody series and now rather difficult to obtain (the first hardcover edition sells at a premium as a collector's item). Actually you don't get a lot of extra detail about Arly Hanks that you wouldn't have figured out from the later books. This is not a roman fleuve (pardon my French) like, for instance, Sue Grafton's alphabet series that we read almost as much to follow what will happen next in Kinsey Milhone's life as for the plot of the individual book.The series is set in a a small town in the Ozarks, populated by simple country rubes, where Arly Hanks, a displaced and divorced New Yorker is chief of police. The stories are told partly in the first person by Arly but switch to other characters' points of view. There are the usual faults that we criticize Joan Hess for. Delia is funny because she is fat and eats a lot. Brother Verber is funny because he is a blatant hypocrite. I suspect that Hess is faux naif (French again) and the cartoonish drawing of supporting characters is a deliberate ploy to fix the town of Maggody in our minds. She never makes any bones about saying what a depressing place Maggody is, and often describes stark tragedy, yet the effect is somehow cheerful and reading a Magoddy book is a delightful relaxation."},{"Title":"Malice in Maggody","review":"Joan Hess is a delightful, fun read. Her Maggody books are very light hearted murder mysteries (if there can be such a thing). They are cozy mysteries, she is kind of a smart alec southern writer. I often break into snickers because as another southerner I relate to her characters. The character types are in all small southern towns.

They also formed my defense to do the right thing while to maintain the time to market or to choose.Personally I think, these principles address the requirements of good product development processes, and one of the instances is his Stage-Gate. That is, I do need to understand the principles in a sophiscated way to faciliate its benefits in my real life with my grasp of previous experience and other theories or rules.In addition, this book provides some general concepts used in industry product development process. Whereas, the most valuable forceful points come from the six principles."},{"Title":"Product Leadership: Creating and Launching Superior New Products","review":"The value of this book lies in two major aspects. Cooper is a world expert at the product development process, and focuses on the elements needed to make that process successful (rather than just explicating the steps). He does this by pointing our the critical sucess factors. Six of these focus on the process elements that are necessary, and seven more focus on critical elements for execution. However, just as important, Cooper makes use of his vast background in consulting and his knowledge of the workings of many companies, and fills the book with commentary on the usage and limitations of the process, using examples from real companies, and &quot;Key Points for Management. He is one of the few consultants who has developed a process who also teaches the reader how to make it valuable to his own needs."},{"Title":"Product Leadership: Creating and Launching Superior New Products","review":"I purchased this book primarily on the positive ratings. Anyone who has spent time actually developing new products would see that this book is a recipe for gridlock, stonewalling and endless corporate posturing in any American company. The author's assertion on the widespread adoption of his Star Gate process is also dubious. It appears this book was written by consultants for other consultants. Product, marketing and brand managers should avoid.If you want a book on how to develop products I would suggest the Fast Forward MBA in Project Management. While not specific to product development, it gives you the background and tools for more effectively manage big projects (e.g. product development)."},{"Title":"Product Leadership: Creating and Launching Superior New Products","review":"This is a good book about developing a new product Process. I recommend it for anyone working to develop a product development Process. It has less to offer directly to product managers, entrepreneurs or anyone on the front lines of launching new products.The subtitle of this book is a misnomer. There are few specifics regarding &quot;Creating and Launching Superior New Products&quot;. As that's why I purchased the book, the first 100+ pages were..... disappointing. A more apt subtitle/marketing proposition would be &quot;Developing and Managing New Product Development Efforts&quot;That said, &quot;Product Leadership&quot; will be a very useful resource to me for several reasons:1) Comprehensive checklists of what to consider when working with new products2) A clear framework for Managing New Product Development (Stage-Gate).3) A terrific introduction to product portfolio managementPros- Clear, consise, well-written by an expert and well-edited- Breezy helpful checklists easy to revisit as needed- Clear, simple frameworks help focus on the big picture for the company.Cons- Few case studies or anecdotes- Not much here about how to actually create and launch the new products"},{"Title":"Product Leadership: Creating and Launching Superior New Products","review":"In a world where senior management has limited time to absorb a wide variety of new ideas, Product Leadership provides an overview of the key issues in new product management.

Cooper's Stage Gate forces the best out of the planners and keeps the momentum focused on winners. What it also does is make best use of R&amp;D money so you can be sure these valuable dollars are constantly working hard for superior results. Even the Finance people can get on board this process quickly and enthusiastically.This is a must read for anyone involved in the strategic planning process no matter what the company."},{"Title":"Product Leadership: Creating and Launching Superior New Products","review":"I purchased Dr. Cooper's book on recommendation of an attendee at one of my seminars. He commented on the similarities between the book's 'stages' and 'go/kill' gates (decision points) and the FDA's medical device design control requirements. After having read the book, I must agree. Dr Cooper recommendations confirm my own experience in project leadership, developed in the '80's at a large multinational pharma/device manufacturer, modified by the recent requirements for 'design control' mandated upon the medical device industry by the FDA (and similar to ISO 9000). I've always stressed the use of regulatory requirements to achieve business goals, not just to satisfy some regulatory entity. Dr. Cooper clearly shows how adding such similar discipline to the product development cycle, especially at those starting phases (R&amp;D) where many scientists, engineers, and senior management feel control stifles creativity, does just the opposite. His (and the FDA's) system add predicability, decision making over a company's entire product development portfolio, to reduce cycle time, reduce overall product devel. costs, ensure the 'voice of the customer' is part of the design, and increases tremendously the chance of a successful new (or line extension) product. I highly recommend the book."},{"Title":"Product Leadership: Creating and Launching Superior New Products","review":"Cooper's previous books have covered different aspects of the demanding task of managing the development and introduction of new industrial products. We heard he was preparing a slim volume suitable for high level general managers, and this is it. Cooper's writing ability guarantees an absorbing read, and his vast amount of practical experience in companies guarantees that you learn how to make the advice really work. My only criticism is that this book needs to be slimmer still for a generalist audience, though it does have key-point boxes running through."},{"Title":"Product Leadership: Creating and Launching Superior New Products","review":"Excellent text book style on the product development process. First part of the book is a bit dry and technical but does its job of highlighting the necessities of succesful product development and management.Later in the book the principles are applied in more real examples that are easier to comprehend.Overall a very good book for Product Managers new to the task or looking to refocus their energy. There are other books just as good and a bit less technical so don't end your reading with this book."},{"Title":"Product Leadership: Creating and Launching Superior New Products","review":"Robert G. Cooper capitalizes on his long hands-on experience to analyze the key elements that make the product development process across industries successful. The key strength of Cooper's book lies in the systematic approach that he adopts in identifying the dos and don'ts of the product development process. Cooper helps readers understand the usage and limitations of that process. Unlike Clayton M. Christensen in The Innovator's Dilemma, Cooper unfortunately does not make a very clear distinction between sustaining and disruptive technologies and their impact on the product development process in his otherwise excellent book."},{"Title":"Product Leadership: Creating and Launching Superior New Products","review":"Here is a book that concentrates on the senior managers (including the CEO) and their roles in the company's new product efforts.

But here you'll find them in a condensed form. And most important: The book has many &quot;Key points for management&quot;.

About the year 200 AD, these traditions - revolving around the interpretation and illustration of the Torah - were collected and written down in the Mishna. Over time, additional traditions, or Gemara, were also preserved. The two main groups of Jews, Palestinian and Babylonian, over the next couple hundred years, collected their Mishnaic and Gemaran traditions along with other authoritative rabbinical sayings into, respectively, the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds. The Babylonian Talmud runs about 30 volumes!R. Travers Herford had a love of and respect for the Talmud. In his introduction he reminds the reader of this history of the Talmud, the often religiously charged atmosphere in which it was written, and the faith of the Jews who passed it from generation to generation. He reviews that massive work and capably, with commentary, lists possible references to Christ, his disciples, Christianity and Jewish dealings with Christians. In his commentary he notes from which \\"layer\\" of the Talmudic tradition the statement is made thereby giving some sort of dating to the statement.Herford has been criticized for seeing too many references as being related to Christ. Frankly, I see that as a benefit because at least Herford allows you to examine the citation for yourself. I use Herford with other commentaries on the Talmud."},{"Title":"Christianity in Talmud and Midrash, (Library of religious and philosophical thought)","review":"I'd like to be able to say that standards for citing sources was lower in the past than it is now, because that would give Mr Travers an excuse for 482 pages of unreliable information. I have no sources to cite for such an excuse however, and so I'll have to go with the fact that even today, people spend lots of money on fad diet books that get debunked months later.I've personally debunked Herford's claims, and the copy of Babylonian Talmud I used has the same text as the 1324 Munich manuscript, which is available online as page images easily readable once you get used to the script.1. In every case where he is mentioned, it is clear that Jeshu ha-Notsri lived in the time of King Alexander Jannai, which is 100 years too early. The only way Herford can refute this is to call into question the accuracy of the Talmud on the subject, and it's the only place he does.2. Herford cites pages of both Talmuds which don't exist. Cases include Bavli Yoma 66d (all Talmud pages are numbered either a or b) and Yerushalmi Taanith 65b (the tractate ends on 27b and was never subject to censorship).3. Herford is clueless about Jewish history and has R. Akiva seeing Jesus while sitting among the elders in the marketplace. Given that R. Akiva was born about 50 CE and had a grudge against the rabbinate which was only resolved about 90 CE, that is a physical impossibility.4. He claims several times that the rabbis identified Balaam and Jesus without citing one classic Jewish writing which says so. That marks the claim as either a bare assertion fallacy or a tradition passed down among Christians for some period of time which is unknown because he doesn't cite any Christian sources either. Either he made it up or he plagiarized.The only reason for reading this work is to know where all Herford's mistakes are so you can prove him wrong.And for that you don't need to buy the book, you can read it on Google."},{"Title":"A year with two winters","review":"This simply is a beautiful book. I realized this once I started reading it aloud. The rhythm and sounds of the words come together in a way that is understated, not overbearing. The usage of language, imagery, current events of the time in Colombia that were difficult to report on pretty much make for an important, and beautiful book. I am surprised that this book has not gotten more recognition."},{"Title":"The White House: Actors and Observers","review":"This lovely book, published at the time of the 200th anniversary of the occupation of the White House, consists of a compilation of essays written by a panel of distinguished writer-historians. It contains over 100 illustrations, including the earliest photos, taken in the 1840s.The introduction, entitled \\"Like No Other House\\" says it all!The White House is unique: a \\"private\\" family home, the hub of our government, a tourist attraction, and a place of ceremony. It has been the scene of some of history's most important events and some of history's most important figures have stayed under its roof.The White House has survived: from the burning by the British only 14 years after John and Abigail Adams moved in through many periods of neglect and mismanagement.The book focuses more on personalities than on politics, especially the First ladies, who are given great credit by many of the essayists.Beginning with John and Abigail Adams' short residency, the first essay follows Abigail on her long journey from Massachusetts to the \\"marshlands of the Potomac\\", where she found a barely furnished house with no wood to heat it, an unfinished staircase, and plaster walls that were still damp.Dolley Madison managed to combine simplicity with high style with the help of architect Benjamin Latrobe. The Madison's tenure was cut short when the British burned the Executive Mansion, as it was called, in 1814.The house was rebuilt as a national symbol, but by the time the Lincolns moved in over 100 years later, it was a shabby place. The once-elegant public rooms had threadbare rugs, dirty upholstery, faded draperies, and few amenities. Mary Lincoln immediately took upon herself the transformation of the President's house, traveling to New York and Philadelphia during wartime to look for rugs, wallpaper, china, and crystal and having much of the furniture restored. Despite her efforts, during public events, people actually cut off pieces of the wallpaper, rugs, and curtains for souvenirs.Theodore Roosevelt \\"remade the presidency and reinvented the White House and his models for both have lasted a century\\" according to the essayist who wrote the section about him. He changed the name from the Executive Mansion to the White House and added the West Wing for executive offices. Unfortunately, the renovation was finished too fast and was mainly cosmetic. Only 50 years later, a massive structural rebuilding had to be undertaken.I learned much more about those who have occupied the White House, but will control myself and not go into any more of that here! Believe me, this is a book that you will learn from, even if you think you know American history fairly well."},{"Title":"The White House: Actors and Observers","review":"\\" The White House\\" is a very well put together book. I would recommend this book to people who are interested in the White House and who are just starting research about the people who lived in or the building itself. The stories about the People who have lived in the White House are very well written and detailed with interesting facts. They all seem to flow nicly together."},{"Title":"The White House: Actors and Observers","review":"Upstairs at the White HouseI am enchanted by the stories of the first families that occupied the White House and how they made their own homes and contributions within the walls. The interaction of history and history in the making is what makes a place like the White House unique. This book included many new to me stories, as well as some excellent photos and illustrations. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Go West, Inspector Ghote","review":"Nirmala Shahani, only daughter of an Indian magnate, has dropped out of the California college where her wealthy father has sent her to put the cap on her education before her marriage to the sone of his business partner.

So Inspector Ghote finds himself in Beverly Hills trying to persuade her to return with him to Bombay, and with the help of Fred Hoskins, a beefy ex-cop - attempting to prove that the Swami With No Name is a confidence trickster instead of an Indian holy man. But Ghote is faced with a puzzle to rival the legendary rope tricks of his native bazaars: how a man could be killed and the murder weapon be made to vanish in a windowless room whose only exit was watched...by the good Inspector himself!"},{"Title":"Tersias the Oracle","review":"Since the beginning of time, people have always wanted to know the future. But wanting to know the future takes a nasty turn in G.P. Taylor's \\"Tersias the Oracle,\\" his third book set in a grimy, 19th-century London. While it's not as horrendously preachy as his last two, it's still a flaccid adventure with cartoonish characters.The comet Wormwood has just narrowly missed London, and teen highwayman Jonah is back to robbing -- a cursed knife and mysterious alabaster box. Elsewhere, seedy Magnus Malachi makes money off a blind beggar boy, Tersias. Tersias is accompanied by an invisible imp, the Wretchkin, which lets him see the future. As a result, the sinister Lord Malpas -- whom Jonah robbed -- wants Tersias' help.But there are other people who want Tersias' visions for themselves, including a cult called the Solomites. Their leader, Solomon, soon kidnaps Tersias and Jonah's friend Tara, and keeps them both prisoner in the Citadel, with the intent of brainwashing them both. To rescue his friends, Jonah will have to shape up and join forces with Malachi.Yes, this is a sequel of sorts to Taylor's previous two books, \\"Shadowmancer\\" and \\"Wormwood.\\" The good news is, he has eased up on that smack-in-the-face religious content, which dripped from every page of his previous novels. The bad news is, that's the ONLY improvement.Taylor's books are still riddled with rambling descriptions, pompous dialogue (\\"She is a woman, flesh and blood!\\"), and cartoonish action scenes. The plot meanders all over the place, and there are long stretches where it seems like Taylor doesn't have the slightest idea what to do next.And his taste for melodramatic, powerful bad guys hasn't waned. Just forming a killer cult isn't enough -- Solomon has to have flesh-eating locusts too. And Lord Malpas has a family curse! And Malachi changes from bad to good for no real reason! As hard as he tries to restrain himself, Taylor can't get past the goofy villains, and so whatever shreds of a coherent plot were in there.And the characters don't help -- it's virtually impossible to like any of them, especially since the hero, Jonah, is a selfish brat; it's hard to see why Tara is so nuts about him. The title character is a pompous bore who doesn't seem to find it disturbing that he has an imp in his head.While GP Taylor has toned down his unsubtle religious matter, his stories are still amateurish and ridiculously cartoonish. Tersias may see the future, but it's a good thing he didn't foresee \\"Tersias the Oracle.\\""},{"Title":"Tersias the Oracle","review":"I am a avid reader of fiction. Be it fantasy, historical, or Christian.I have read G.P. Taylor's other works Shadowmancer and Wormwood. I find his writing to be extremely decriptive; very cinemtic. He is very talented at placing the reader in the middle of the story. He effectively communicates this gifting in Tersias the Oracle. I grew to know London. Even though I've never been there before, I think I just might recognize it if I was there. That is G.P. Taylor's style of writing. I did feel he developed the main characters quite well in this most recent work. I grew to love Malthias (I'm not sure if that is the name for sure. It's been a few weeks since I read it). At first this character is a despicable excuse for a human being, but he soon grows into a respectable decent individual. This is G.P.'s way of communicating God's grace and redemption, and he does quite a fantastice job if I must say.On a seperate note, I did not care for the ending. I rated it four stars since I felt it was too brief and left me with too many questions. Shadowmancer and Wormwood left me feeling that way as well. Nonetheless, all of his books make a good read. I recommend them all!"},{"Title":"Tersias the Oracle","review":"Review by Mike DoyleI love all of G.p. Taylors books! They are so different then regular fantasy. I love it how I feel like I have been transported to london and I am actually there right a long side the Jonah, Tara and Solomon and all the other characters. I love how G.P. Taylor combines spirits and humans together. Buy this book it was very good. Also if you have not read Shadowmancer or Wormwood I really think you should. Thoses books are really good but they are also different, but in a good way. So its not your average fantasy book but there great ones.Can't wait for G.P. Taylors next one in September: The Curse of Salamander Street: A Sequel to Shadowmancer."},{"Title":"Tersias the Oracle","review":"I am so into fantasy and I love G.P.Taylors books.

I bought several books (Bomfin, Tavakoli, Choudhry) about credit derivatives but found they limited their discussion to just the specific products (TRS, CDS, CDS Index, Baskets, Synthetics, etc.) and their pricing analytics. Chaplin's book is the only one I've read that provides a broader view of the credit derivatives market. For instance, when he discusses the vanilla CDS product he includes such detail as the ISDA based agreement that must be signed by both seller and purchaser, the history of how the terms of the agreement evolved, and how a 'credit event' defined in the agreement is actually settled.Chaplin's book is the 'how things really work' book of the credit derivatives market. A great resource."},{"Title":"Credit Derivatives: Risk Management, Trading and Investing (The Wiley Finance Series)","review":"This book gives a very good insight into the world of credit derivatives. The main products are decribed from a trading as well as from a pricing point of view. The software that comes with it, demonstrates various pricing methods as well as problems and deficits, these modells have.A must read for everybody who wants to get an insight into the world of credit derivatives.Well done!"},{"Title":"Credit Derivatives: Risk Management, Trading and Investing (The Wiley Finance Series)","review":"I bought this book following misleading title and comments posted here. What I expected the book to contain is not only ISDA documentation and some description of some types of CD but also how to model CD for pricing and hedging. Unfortunately even few formulas presented at the book are not correct (e.g. f. 9.10 at p. 86). The author does not explain how to calculate recovery rates (he seems to believe this is only an assumption without any link to balance sheet!) and does not mention about expected time CD holders have to wait for payoff in case of default. There are only timid attempts to give some approach for pricing models (without Monte Carlo method, Black-Sholes world, measurement of credit risk and explanation why investors should not pay much attention to credit ratings assigned to CD). Taking into account unwinding credit crunch emanating in part from inadequate risk pricing by shaming rating agencies, we should not model CD much based on date from any rating agencies. The book provides a reader with nothing but calculation of probability of default through transition matrices which don't depend on risk-free interest rates.I found only common wording in form of blah-blah and nothing more, some charts and math attached at appendix are absolutely irrelevant to the main text. Thus I feel disappointed with that I bought. It is not worth money I spent for it. I have rated this book with two stars due to ISDA documentation (it may help those who tend to deep into legislation) and description of some types of CD.Unfortunately there is a lack of good books covering CD modeling.If you are a quant, don't buy this book."},{"Title":"Credit Derivatives: Risk Management, Trading and Investing (The Wiley Finance Series)","review":"A well written and concise book. Geoff Chaplin has the ability to express complex concepts in a clear and lucid manner. One off the most problematic areas of credit is the area of correlation. Geoff does an excellent job of explaining the problems and developing solutions to include conventional solutions from the street.It is very apparent that Geoff has the practitioner's background to go along with the academic experience.An excellent teaching tool. Should be a part of anyone's book shelf involved in credit derivatives or with the aspirations of entering that field"},{"Title":"Credit Derivatives: Risk Management, Trading and Investing (The Wiley Finance Series)","review":"Outstanding reference for serious traders, analytsts, and desk quants. Valuable insight into market structure, data sources, and practical implementation of pricing models. Overall I think the text is much better than its peer group for single-name credit derivatives with good overviews for CDS-Bond basis trading, CDS forwards and curve trading, Digital recovery and recovery oriented trading strategies.The material on correlation, baskets, and tranche trading is fine, but probably not that much better than many other texts, as the correlation space is already geared for a more quantitative crowd and there are many fine books that already cover that material.That said, for a practical approach with quantitative depth for single name trading, it is by far the best text on the market."},{"Title":"Credit Derivatives: Risk Management, Trading and Investing (The Wiley Finance Series)","review":"This book is a rehash of stuff that has already been said about this product. It is clear that the author did not close transactions but viewed credit derivatives as an academic. Nothing new is said. He could at least have written in an original fashion but decided to write about already exposed concepts in a very dry manner."},{"Title":"The meaning of treason","review":"William Joyce was Lord Haw-Haw. Everyone in London wanted to see him. He was brought to trial in September, 1945. His features were misshapen. People had heard the voice for six years. Like Roger Casement, William Joyce was Irish. Joyce had left Oswald Mosley's movement. He was charged under the Treason Act of 1351 with three offenses. He had lived in Ireland and, through his father, actually had American citizenship. When Ireland was granted home-rule, the Joyce family had to leave the country since family members had supported the English cause. Of course the English showed no gratitude and, not surprisingly, the family suffered heavy losses. The Joyces turned to fascism. William Joyce may have been an alien, but he had been treated as a British subject, and he owed the Crown allegiance. When he moved to Germany in 1939 he was the holder of a British passport.The case moved from Old Bailey to the Victorian Gothic styled Law Courts to the House of Lords at the Parliament Houses, exquisite medieval architecture blended with mediocre Victorian Gothic. William Joyce had not seemed to fit in anywhere. He was educated but seemed not to be. He would never have held a conventional academic position. Joyce, moving to Germany, recruited speakers for radio broadcasts in the camps of British internees. Joyce's employer was the Concordia Bureau, part of Goebbels' Propaganda Office.Most of the members of the British Free Corps, a unit organized to fight with the Germans, were men gathered from the POW camps. Thomas Haller Cooper, former member of the S.S., was tried for treason. The son of a German mother, he had recruited men for the British Free Corps. A British agent had observed his acts. All in all the civil authorities brought four major figures, William Joyce,the previously mentioned broadcaster, John Amery of the British Free Corps, Walter Purdy, an informer, and the Cooper, noted above, to trial for treason.Prior to capure Mr. and Mrs. Joyce lived in the German forests. William Joyce had not bothered to learn identifying details pertaining to his forged passport. He had been wounded and was ill from malnutrition and exposure. In his statement he claimed his acts had been motivated by a desire to reconcile German and English interests. After his wartime experiences he came to feel that Brixton Prison was not such a bad place. William Joyce was only one growth from a fascist stem. Rebecca West contends he was a newer type of facist leader, someone drawn from an unremarkable home. He suffered from a failure to please. (Sir Oswald Mosley was an aristocrat with a flaw.)Some months after Joyce was executed, Allan Nunn May was prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act for giving Atomic Energy Project research to a Russian agent. He received ten years at penal servitude. John Amery had lived abroad by necessity since he was a bankrupt. His family supported him. He had been an aide to Franco. In his trial for treason he pled guilty. It was a case of mandatory execution since no alternatives to death were present in the act.The author also describes the military trials for treason she observed and the flawed characters of those defendants. Interestingly she portrays the post-war landscape of England and the damage to notable civilian structures caused by the night bombing campaigns of Germany. Her analysis of the issues relevant to the matter of treason is first rate."},{"Title":"The meaning of treason","review":"You have to be a Brit to appreciate this author's style of writing.

I am most impressed with your gift of writing John! Looking forward to \\"Bluff\\"!"},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"Fast Track by John DeDakis' seems too accomplished to be a first novel. The protagonist, Lark Chadwick, is convinced that the official ruling of suicide in her aunt's death is dead wrong. She is compelled to prove this, convincingly, by uncovering her nebulous past in a small Midwestern town. In the process, she alienates her fragile support system and antagonizes her editor and potential mentor. Her tenacity however, propels this mystery to a very satisfying conclusion. Refreshing to read and care about a deeply flawed victim--more gratifying is to champion a fearless young protagonist,warts and all. I especially enjoyed suspecting almost everyone right up to the last couple of chapters. Can't wait to read Mr. DeDakis' next project."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"The smooth flow of the plot combined with the realistic connection to the characters made you want to read the next chapter. The depth of the personalities developed, combined with the twists was amazing.

Heroine Lark is just the right mix of spunk and innocence to have you relating to her, then cheering for her. Everyone in the journalism biz knows a Lionel or two. Anyone who has gone through grief can benefit from the inner tube analogy John DeDakis writes. You won't need a bookmarker for this book b/c you won't be able to put it down until you are finished. I received this book a couple days before Christmas. To all my gift recipients, I apologize for my sloppy wrapping---now you know I was up late at night, reading instead of wrapping!"},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"This book is an absolute pleasure to read! At the risk of sounding trite, it was one of those captivating reads in which you sacrifice sleep because you are so absorbed in the plot. John DeDakis created such vivid protagonists that many readers will easily identify with and ultimately root for. There were many plot twists, which truly keep you on your toes and make it impossible to put the book down! You would be doing yourself a disservice if you do not immediately read the book! This book is perfect for anyone who's interested in an extremely gripping mystery novel with characters you quickly empathize with!"},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"Set in Southern Wisconsin, \\"Fast Track\\" is the story of 25-year-old and strong-willed, strong-minded Lark Chadwick solving a mystery surrounding the car/train collision that had orphaned her as an infant. Beginning with her traumatic discovering of her Aunt Annie (who raised her after the death of her parents) dead from carbon monoxide poisoning, Lark's search for answers takes her to Pine Bluff and the scene of her parent's fatal car crash. Lark convinces the local newspaper editor Lionel Stone to allow her to write a follow-up story to that accident. In her research for that article she discovers lies, scandals, and something for which she is being targeted for murder. Superbly written and entertaining from beginning to end, \\"Fast Track\\" by John DeDakis is a full-length, highly recommended, unabridged mystery/suspense novel presented in ArcheBooks Publishing's magazine-style format called 'ArcheBookZine' and laid out in a two column format that transforms what would otherwise be a 300-page hardcover book into a 96-page magazine."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"This is one of the most exciting and readable books I have read in a long time. To use an overused cliche, I couldn't put it down. Keep churning them out."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"From the first page the action takes off and captivates the reader. It was hard to find a chapter where I could put this book down for a break. John has a great writing style and he makes the characters seem as real as the places described in these Wisconsin towns. This book would make a great action/mystery movie. You will enjoy it too."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"DeDakis' debut novel is a page-turner, full of interesting sub-plots, suspense, and energy. One can easily imagine this as movie material, because it is very visual and action-filled. The protagonist and narrator is a young woman, and DeDakis easily makes the transition to a woman's voice. He clearly understands her motivation and her character. She, Lark, is a likable and appealing figure, and she, foibles and strengths combined, makes the entire novel attractive and interesting. The 300 pages of this mystery go by fast, and mystery lovers will find it compelling. This reader hopes for more novels to come from this author, whose profession is editing the early morning news for CNN."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"Lark Chadwick is a likeable, naive young woman who gets a rude awakening into real life. There were times when I wanted to smack her for the stubbornness she displays, but I had to keep reading just to find out what was really going on.

Totally unexpected!I love to read and have always enjoy a good suspense novel! All of the suspense novels that I have read over the past couple of years have been disappointing because I was able to figure out the ending. NOT Fast Track! This novel kept me guessing until the end. Every time I thought I figured it out, I was proven wrong. The greatest point was realizing that what really happened was not even close to what I ever guessed! A true suspense novel that kept me wanting to turn the pages until the end!I am very much looking forward to reading \\"Bluff\\"!"},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"Fast Track held off the daily grind while it's writer kept my interest with every page. I like to think I'm clever enough to figure out endings but the sidetrips in this story are so good it made the plot-detective in me happy to just enjoy the ride. It wouldn't have done any good anyway, DeDakis is crafty till the end. A big part of the fun too is that his characters are so well done, it's like knowing the people next door, then finding out they have very deep and dark closets."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"When I met John Dedakis in a Barnes & Noble bookstore, I bought the book expecting a story about a hardcore, investigative MALE journalist with years of experience. Instead we get the refreshingly young and troubled Lark Chadwick, new to the journalist scene with personal tragedy to overcome as she investigates the secrets behind her mother and father's death in a train accident which she was fortunate to survive in her infancy. The tension and engaging content kept me reading quickly to the end. Lark's mentorship with the older journalist gave such practical tips, I would recommend it to all journalism students and investigative writers alike. I look forward to more work by John Dedakis."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"This is a great book! I found it difficult to put down. I was very surprised at the ending, what a twist! I was not able to pick out the suspect..very good!(and I am in Law Enforcement. No one fools me...) It took me by surprise! I especially liked the descriptions of the characters. I felt like I could visualize them and by the end of the book, I felt I actually knew them. DeDakis was able to use all my senses throughout the entire book.It's obvious that DeDakis spent the necessary time on creating a masterpiece. This story is an adventure. This author is well on his way to becoming an icon, a writer placed in a text book of great literature. I am looking forward to more of his work."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"Captivating, interesting, and suspenseful, Fast Track is a page-turner with complex themes and detailed characters. There are so many surprises throughout the novel that I couldn't put it down. I was constantly engaged, questioning what would happen to the main protagonist, Lark Chadwick, next.

The story of Lark Chadwicke trying to find out what really happened the night her parents died is well written and fast paced.

Do surprises lurk around every other page? You betcha! Do you want to read a really good mystery? Of course you do. Well, you're in luck. John DeDakis's excellent first novel, \\"FAST TRACK\\", is ready for boarding. In the grand tradition of great mystery writers, our author gives us a terrific protagonist, a marvelous collection of intriguing supporting characters, a locale that you can get your arms around, and a twisty-turny story that won't answer all your questions until it's darned good and ready to. How many books have you read that you wish would continue past the last page...that you're sorry to finish? Well, \\"FAST TRACK\\" is one of those books. Further, it's one of the few books I've read where a male author thoroughly and delightfully gives us a female lead character. In fact, all of DeDakis's characters are thoroughly described, but in as few words as I have ever seen it done. Now, that's a real gift to the reader, as well as to the author. And in the style of the fine mystery writers of the past several decades --you know, guys like Grisham, Clancy and Patterson-- DeDakis gives us the short-chapter treatment. So you really are on the fast track all the way. Last words: buy the book, but don't loan it to your friends; you'll probably want to read it again."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"Very enjoyable read, look forward to the next one. Would make an excellent movie."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"As one who prefers novels that have engaging and credible story lines, I found this book to be fully entertaining. Of course, my familiarity with the setting added to my enjoyment, but this was augmented by the strong plot pace. Indeed a page-turner, I finished the book inside of 2 days. I read many similar novels a year while travelling, and judge this one to be on par with the best of them.

The story continues to resonate with me as if it were continuing to be told. This story was in me; I was in the story, I was the story.As the story teller, Lark, took me through her days searching for answers to her personal history, I became her. When she looked at the Priest, I saw him. When she noticed tail-lights following close behind on a dark Wisconsin highway at midnight, I felt the driver gaining on me, I saw cornfields on either side of the road: no place to run, no place to hide. I breathed heavily when desperation grabbed hold. When her grandfather steadfastly refused to enlighten her, I was just as angry as she was.The author didn't tell me a story, he fed it to me. When Lark cried, I felt the tears; when she laughed, I knew why. I smiled as I sat in my favorite chair and waited for the next page to bring more for me to savor.I liked this book. I'm glad I was so into it. --"},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"I can't wait for John DeDakis's next novel. This one was fast-paced, unpredictable, and kept me reading until the end.

A must read."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"This is a perfect novel for a several-hour plane trip. (Thank you, Kindle!) The plot is intense and involving. The supporting characters are likeable AND believable. The main character, Lark, is a bit frustrating -- but worth the effort to get to know. And I really do feel like I know her.

As a UW grad, the southern Wisconsin setting hooked me immediately. Initially, I assumed this was going to be a story where the feisty young heroine bests the crusty old journalist with her unorthodox methods and cheerful pluck. Wrong. Never assume anything in this book. Every time I thought I had something figured out, De Dakis threw in a curve and took me in a whole different direction. The ending was one I never saw coming, yet made perfect sense.The setting was familiar and comfortable--De Dakis is obviously at home here. He knows the terrain and the people. Even the minor characters are well-drawn. I felt the emotional impact of the train crash in the memories of the engineer, even tho he has only a small part in the book. The same was true with other \\"bit players\\"--real people reacting to living in a real world.Like I said in the title, Fast Track would be a great start for a series. Can't wait to see what De Dakis does next."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"Fast Track was packed with mystery and suspense and held my attention from beginning to end.

As a first novel it's great - only thing I would change is the commentary one one character's wardrobe - rest is great - read it all in one sitting! Am looking forward to the next one and I CAN'T WAIT for the movie!"},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"\\"Fast Track\\" is probably not a book I would have picked up off the shelf had I seen it in a library or bookstore; mystery novels are not really my cup of tea. But I thoroughly enjoyed this one! It was incredibly relatable and engaging. DeDakis strikes a comfortable balance between his journalistic background and creative fiction, although sometimes I felt as if Lark was telling me every emotion she was experiencing, rather than allowing me to figure these out through her actions. The ending was refreshing, because I was half expecting her to end up married to the reporter (gag). It certainly has movie potential and I'm anxious to read through the next installment. Overall, nicely done!"},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"I was at the book store looking for the lastest Patterson book then I met Mr. DeDakis. I ended up buying Fast Track instead and I can say I was very pleased with the choice. The story unfolded very naturally - nothing hurried or forced. Johnny D. kept the story flowing nicely, with just enough suspense for me to spend my entire afternoon reading just to find out how the story ended. Very nice book - I'll be watching for future titles by this up and coming author."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"Before you even open the book, the amazing photograph on the cover lets you know you're in for a ride. I can't wait for the rest of the series to be developed!"},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"Fast Track was an excellent thought out, fast paced thriller. Lark the main heroin in the book is an excellent thought out character. I really felt her pain, compassion, and confusion as she went through the painful process of sorting out a 25 year old family mystery. Fast Track had more twists and turns in it then any book Ive read all year. If your looking for a fast page, twist and turns thrill ride of a book with all the elements(intrigue, suspense, etc..) then I would definetly recommend you try Fast Track you won't regrett it. I didn't."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"Fast Track is a can't-put-down read from the first page to the last. The narrative is compelling, the pace is rapid, and the next surprise is just around the corner. The story twists from the Wisconsin state capital of Madison to the county seat of Pine Bluff, a short distance away. Your heart will be in your throat as Lark,the 25-year-old heroine, copes with suicide and murder. John DeDakis' first novel is a winner. I highly recomend it."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"DeDakis has, like his predecessor, \\"embraced all human experience, the conflict of life itself\\" in this book -- love, deceit, fear, anxiety, anger, embarrassment, insecurity, there is little that every reader cannot identify with in one way or another. And we experience all this at the height of page turning, unrelenting must read mind control. Well done, John. May you write many more, just let me rest a moment before you hand me the next one!"},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"Want to read a mystery novel with bone crushing scandal, heart breaking betrayal, and forbidden love? Dedakis's first novel is nothing short of a gripping, page turning read that haunts you well after you've finished reading the book."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"I just finished \\"Fast Track\\". What a good read! I got so frustrated every time I had to put it down. I loved all the twists and turns - I suspected every character at some point. I would love to see Lark mature into a seasoned reporter. I am looking forward to the next John DeDakis book!"},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"Quite a page turner. It was a wonderful suspense filled mystery, with characters that are both believable and compelling. Lark faced dangers, unanswered questions and dark family secrets with determination and compassion. It made me wonder about the family skeletons my own parents didn't tell us about. FastTrack would be a great thrill ride on the big screen. The story unfolded like a major motion picture. In my mind's eye I could see Lark facing the oncoming train in surround sound!"},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"I purchased Fast Track after reading the back cover and also meeting the author. He told me of his motivation for writing the book and so I decided to give it a try. Mystery and suspense is my favorite genre. I was very impressed with the way the book was written. The details included made me feel like I was watching a television show each time I open the book. The story line was fantastic and it was nice that the subject of having FAITH was intertwined. I can't wait for the next novel."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"I love books I can \\"crawl into,\\" books that hold my attention and involve me emotionally with story andcharacters. This is one of those books. Not only is the story plot exceptionally well developed, but the characters are fully human and honest revealing all of their weaknesses and flaws which this reader, at least, understood all too well. I hope John DeDakis is busy writing another novel in this series. I'll be standing in line to buy it."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"Like many others who have written reviews for this book, I too found it thoroughly captivating. Like many others, I was also completely delighted by the twists and turns of the plot that never allowed you to predict the outcome of the book, down to the very last page. I really enjoyed how social norms were addressed in this book. It is very modern in addressing social issues that are occurring, even in our very own personal lives today. It is very easy to identify with the characters while reading through the book. Internal fears, overcoming personal monsters, as well as the need and desire to find self-identity are very powerful issues that grip every person who wishes to be successful in his or her own way through life. A main theme throughout this book is not jumping into conclusions and delving deeper in to issues before making judgments. This not only holds true for the characters in the book, but for the reader as well, as it twists and turns the reader through the plot. Anyone who picks up this book will not be able to rest until the final outcome comes into view. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"I could not put this book down! I did not want the story to end. Dedakis makes the novel flow at a rapid pace while still developing the charactors in a way you feel like you know them. I can not wait for a 2nd novel."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"Just in case you're wondering if John DeDakis' book is worth it -- I can tell you without hesitation YES! The story is great. It sucked me in and kept me up half the night as I poured through the story. It's one of those books that, as you read it, leaves you thinking, \\"just one more chapter and I'll turn out the light.\\" You just never actually reach for the light.Lark, the heroine, becomes a fast friend to the reader as you feel her pain, triumphs, fears and pressures in her search for the truth about who she is and how she came to be that young woman.It's so realistic I started wondering if it was true. And there's even a surprise twist at the end. Spend the money on this one. You'll want to read it again and again."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"My wife and I read aloud to each other every night. During the past 30-ish years, we have read lots of book to each other. Some of these books were good and some were not. Fast Track by John DeDakis fits easily in the \\"very good\\" category.It was easy for me to spot that DeDakis has talent when it comes to writing and spinning a thriller as we started reading his novel. He also knows something about how reporters work. So do I because I teach journalism courses at a regional university.This made a great read more fun because as I was being drawn in to the story, the lead character, a developing reporter, would make a classic journalistic mistake. My wife would read that part aloud and I would blurt out something about the problem our rookie reporter was making. Then I would explain to my wife \\"why\\" that was problem. Sure enough, DeDakis' editor character (Stone) in the book would pull the reporter aside in the next paragraph and point out the problem. After a while, it became a game for me to see if I could spot the potential problems the rookie reporter was committing before DeDakis had his editor character address the issues with his reporter.The bottom line is that Fast Track is a solid read with lots of plot twists, good characters and suspense. What you get as a bonus is a book that delivers the lessons of good reporting, interviewing and the importance of checking facts. While this is a work of fiction and well worth reading, anyone working in the mass media should pay attention to what character Stone says as he grooms his new reporter because he sounds very similar to the editor who groomed me when I started in journalism.After reading Fast Track, I know that in addition to be a good writer, DeDakis is a solid reporter.Well done!"},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"This is a great book. It will hold you from start to finish. Intriguing characters. I loaned it to a friend and she stayed up past midnight reading it. I highly recommend it to all."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"and spent the next several hours reading it from cover to cover. There was no way I could put it down! The characters are likeable, believable and the story grabbed me from chapter one, page one. A wonderfully comfortable read - the story is riveting and John's descriptives made visualization so easy. He truly has a way with words, and this book is one I will read again and again (when I can get it back from my family members!)"},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"I started to read Fast Track two days ago and could barely put it down since except to sleep, eat, or work. The storytelling was so engaging and well crafted. The pace and story arc also make it great for becoming a feature film. I can relate to much of Lark Chadwick's beginner reporting experiences as an aspiring journalist myself. I also made sure to take note of Lionel's tips!Mr. DeDakis beautifully exemplifies the healing power of storytelling in this novel and has a great understanding of the human person that must come from personal and journalistic experiences. The theme of forgiveness always strikes a chord in my heart and I'm sure it does in most other readers. I can't wait to read Bluff!"},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"This is a page-turner from beginning to end. Good plot and pace populated with an interesting assortment of characters. Loved it."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"This is a good fast-paced read. DeDakis is great at assuming the voice of a young woman. The plot twists and builds in an entirely believable way and then comes together seamlessly at the end. Once you get started with \\"Fast Track\\" you really can't put it down-- just as a good read should be. Now I'm moving on to John's other book, \\"Bluff.\\""},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"I read \\"Fast Track\\" recently on a flight between Cleveland and Seattle. The story - and writing - held my interest so well that I had the quickest flight ever between east and west coasts. I'll look for more books from DeDakis to make future flights enjoyable. I was surprised to find that I liked the BookZine format. The book fit neatly into the seatback pocket of the plane. It opened easily and held to the opening pages, unlike a small fat pocketbook. It slid easily in and out of the satchel I carried, too. I'll spread the word that DeDakis makes \\"fast flights\\" with the engaging \\"Fast Track\\"!"},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"I enjoyed this book despite the fact that I'm not an avid mystery reader. Throughout, I suspected everyone from Father Dan to the Mayor to Roy Miller to, I think, the Stones at one point! It's nice to have so many suspects - keeps the reader guessing. I especially enjoy \\"watching\\" relationships develop (as well as the emotional development of the protagonist) in the books I read and this book gave me that, all under the guise of a mystery."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"Fast Track kept my interest from start to finish! I really enjoyed the conversations and narration written in it. The plot and sub-plots kept me guessing and so intralled I even took a day off of work to finish it. Fast moving and interesting."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"John Dedakis' \\"Fast Track\\", makes a winner out of a first time author. The novel is fast paced , where there is no skipping lines,and your attention is rivited to its conclusion. A good mystery,to get yourself into."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"Typically, it's pretty hard for me to really enjoy a book, but Fast Track made it easy! And that's quite a compliment. It doesn't take long to get drawn into this mystery, for it's a gripping page-turner that you simply cannot put down. This book is an exciting and fun read for almost anyone. I'm ready for a sequel!"},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"If you are looking for suspense, drama, mystery, a good book that you simply can't put down... this is it! It kept me on the edge of my seat until the very last page. John Dedakis is a skilled writer and I look forward to reading more of his work!"},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"John is a modern Agatha Christie -- just when you're sure you know what's going on, he takes you off in a completely different direction. Yet he makes all the twists and turns appear completely logical. He's woven an interesting and complex tale, with every end neatly wrapped up in the end, including who was in the mysterious dark car. I look forward to reading more about Lark."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"A really good read.The plot keeps you turning the pages to discover the next twist. It has all the elements of a good story: diverse, interesting, believable characters; mystery and romance. The writer obviously had personal knowledge and good research of facts to make it convincing."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"From the first few pages to the end, the reader is drawn into the story. The characters are full, well developed and very familiar to anyone who lived in or visited the Midwest. The heroine would have been a friend of mine. The story twists and turns many times, yet is believable and unpredictable.I could close my eyes and see the countryside and small town diners. If you attended the University of Wisconsin, this is a must read for nostalgia!"},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"Fast Track is a really good first novel. The author is clearly very comfortable with action, and the sections where the book is moving along the plot line are terrific. The book takes a little bit to get into, but once the story is developed, the pace is great. The plot builds to a really exciting conclusion that makes you want to read more about these characters."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"FAST TRACK is a well-crafted thriller with an ingenious plot and memorable characters. Fast-paced and richly textured, it reads like a runaway freight train. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"In this review of \\"Fast Track: A Novel\\" by John DeDakis, I would address the author directly.Dear John,After a June 2009 full of rain, a July weekend day kissed by sunshine was excellent for the annual Crafts & Fine Art Festival filling the main street of Haddonfield, New Jersey.You were wandering along the booths, wearing a black T-shirt imprinted with the famous drawing by Edward Gorey of an elegantly dressed seated man reading to an equally elegant small boy. The caption said \\"Real Men Read.\\" \\"I like your T-shirt,\\" I said.With my somewhat look-alike Michigan brother standing beside me, I joked to you: \\"We're twins, two years apart.\\" \\"Then you're not twins,\\" you said. I loved it.Now there's a man, I thought, who listens and analyzes, does not respond with an easy chuckle at weak humor, and who is challenging besides. My kind of man.Your wife, Cindy, was a little ways away, doing her own thing, talking with someone, yet close enough to be with you, John, \\"her man,\\" so to speak. You waved her over. Then she, you, and the rest of my family had fun getting acquainted.All this was prelude, of course, to my seeing your book, \\"Fast Track: A Novel By John DeDakis,\\" in magazine format, which at 8 by 11 inches is slightly larger than a news magazine but with much heavier covers and pages. Quite attractive. The full-size font is clear black on quality matte white. Reading the double-column width of the text on each page is easy and no different from reading in a hardback.The \\"bookzine\\" cover has space for a picture of your CNN television colleague Wolf Blitzer, someone else, and their good words. The back cover has a short excerpt, and a picture and brief bio of yourself.Your novel's cover is ominous. The viewer's eye is virtually lying on a shiny rail, while three bright lights of a train appear fast approaching. \\"Quick, get out of there!\\" The combination of tension and suspense follows through to the very end of your novel, a real page-turner. Your writing is intelligent, elegant, and simple -- overall excellent. You know the vernacular. And I wasn't bothered one second that you were assuming a woman's voice.Totally nondidactically, you bring into the story the best of what it takes to be a top-flight investigator and newsman. Lark Chadwick, her irascible mentor Lionel Stone, and all the other characters become real people. Conflict and compassion barrel along. Enough said. I won't summarize the basic story, which is thoroughly covered in the other reviews, but I will say you are a great read! Most engaging.Sincerely, Nico in Cherry Hill"},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"Fast Track starts out with action and the plot unfolds with breakneck speed. The main character, Lark Chadwick is a cauldron of contradictions and complexities. These internal conflicts make you fall in love with her and root for her to the end. You will not be able to turn the pages fast enough"},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"I had heard a review about Fast Track and it stirredmy curiousity. I wasn't disappointed. The story linewas one that kept me turning pages quickly. If therewas a negitive, its that I didn't want to put it downuntil the story was finished. I gave Fast Track a 5 STARand hope all those that read this review will also readthis book."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"In his debut novel, John DeDakis develops the \\"Lark Chadwick\\" character into one that is destined to have a long, adventurous life in literature. The story takes unexpected twists and turns, and all the characters are intriguing, yet believable. I tore through this book, excited to find out what would happen next. I'm downloading \\"Bluff\\" now, and hoping John writes quickly, so we'll have more Lark stories soon! :-)"},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"DeDakis keeps things refreshingly simple yet relatable in the first installment of his Lark Chadwick series, Fast Track. As you read the novel, you are able to quickly piece together information without feeling like the author is making fun of you for not being able to understand things sooner. However, this does not mean the mystery is a simple one to solve. On the contrary, you will be startled by the solution!His characters are fresh, and his plotline has the perfect balance of excitment, mystery and timing. The sentimental moments are warm, and the action scenes are poignantly tense. Characters are written in a manner that makes them feel very much alive. Many times it felt as though I may have met the protagonist, Lark Chadwick. I could relate to her follies, feel the constant rush of her emotions and felt that if I wanted to, I could pick up the phone and call her. Aside from the well written characters, DeDakis' skill in describing locations was also quickly recognized. It was obvious that locations were researched and/or familiar to the author. There was never a \\"Wait, where are we now?\\" moment, which is always nice when trying to solve a mystery. It also shows dedication and that time was invested on part of the author.The book as a whole is a fantastic read. Things are quick moving, never boring, and always going somewhere. I tried many times to find a spot where I could conclude reading for the night, such as at the end of a chapter or even a section, but never could. This results in you fussing that you have to go to sleep and waking up the next day wondering when you'll next be able to sneak in a read.The magazine format is something that I had never seen before, but was an instant fan of. The novel is able to be slipped into a briefcase, backpack, etc without taking up a large amount of space, but is made from substantial paper as is any other novel, so it will not get easily ruined. This allows for quick reads on the subway, in between meetings/flights, and so on.DeDakis' overwhelming talent in writing realistic yet fictional work is one that should not be missed. Pick up a copy for yourself (and a friend or two!). I guarantee it'll be on your \\"Favorites\\" shelf for a long, long time."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"One criterion I base the quality of a novel is if I can hear the character's voice in my head and can see the world he/she lives in. John DeDakis does an amazing job transporting you into the world of Lark Chadwick. I found I could vividly see through her eyes and hear her thoughts. Providing an entry into a character's world is hard enough for any author and here DeDakis adds on another level of complexity as he decides to write in the voice of a 20-something young female. Though I would think this to be especially difficult for a male author to tap into such a character, you easily get connected to her and the journey she is undertaking.From the moment I started reading I was hooked and before I knew it the weekend was over and I had read straight through to the end. The story never lags and with each chapter you are eager to see what will happen next to Lark. The anticipation for the end builds up to a result that one would not have expected and had me reading faster so I could turn the page and see what was going to happen next.Make sure you have time available when you read the book because you won't want to put it down.After reading this first novel by DeDakis I am now hooked and will have to see what adventure Lark is undertaking in his second book. I also hear a third book is in the work as well.This is a must read!"},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"This is the kind of solid writing we don't see enough anymore. Tightly written and a total pageturner! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"I very much enjoyed this book! First, I wasted a lot of mental energy while reading, trying to figure out placements in Madison. I was finally able to stop that mental interference and just enjoy reading. After a time, I thought, \\"Oh, these scenes are perfectly set up for a TV serial or movie!\\" All the time, of course, trying to follow the threads to the mystery. Next I realized that Lark reminded me a lot of Catherine Norland in Jane Austin's \\"Northanger Abbey.\\" Lark reminded me of Catherine in her propensity to jump to conclusions, creating additional stumbling blocks to her solving the mystery.Especially gripping are the opening scenes and a facedown with a train. Dedakis' insights and ability to portray them make many scenes very moving."},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"In the opening hours of October 19th, twenty-five-year-old Lark Chadwick finds her aunt Annie Chadwick dead in the home they share. While death by carbon monoxide suggests a classic suicide, Lark is suspicious. As she reflects: \\"Suicide. The word stuck in my throat. I couldn't believe that Annie would even consider the ultimate rejection of life and hope. The ultimate rejection of family and friends. The irrevocable rejection of me.\\"To distract Lark from her grief and what might be developing paranoia, a friend suggests she explore some puzzles from her own history. Orphaned as an infant, she has only the sketchiest information about how her parents were killed. In the 13 days between October 19th and October 31st, our heroine learns lessons that will last a life-time, discovers strengths she didn't know she had and sets a course for her future.In his first novel, Fast Track, long-time newsman John DeDakis takes the reader on a rapid-fire, exciting, twisting tale full of mystery, red herrings and split-second action. Once you pick the book up, you won't want to put it down until you have all the answers.Writing in the first person voice of a young woman, child-of-the-sixties DeDakis has set himself an interesting craft challenge. As a woman, I found Lark's voice convincingly feminine - and I mean that as a completely sincere compliment. On the other hand, being of his own generation, I was less convinced that the author understands how women a generation younger than ours experience relationships - but I'll leave the verdict on that to people who grew up in the eighties and nineties. (I'm hoping I'll get some direct feedback, which, of course, means I hope many of my younger friends - as well as my age peers -- will read the book!)Whether you read for the engagement of the read or for craft as well as pleasure, I suggest John DeDakis' Fast Track is a perfect choice for an October weekend (or any other time, of course)!And John's publisher is up on all the latest and greatest, so you can order the book in the traditional hard-back format or in a soft binding that has a magazine feel or, for the digital avant garde,Fast Track"},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"I'm a big Mary Higgins Clark fan, but John Dedakis takes suspense to a whole new level with \\"Fast Track\\". It's definitely a page-turner - there was never a time I was bored. Dedakis creates a strong yet vulnerable and attractive character named Lark (what a name!), whom I can relate to in many different levels. Her age group... her stubborness...her boldness...and vulnerability. In addition to her mysterious journey, I think there's a strong message in the book. No matter how much despair you are in, you must have hope - and there WILL be a light at the end of the dark tunnel. Overall, it was a fantastic read. My only regret is that the book cover design could be more exciting!"},{"Title":"Fast Track","review":"John DeDakis's Fast Track is a smart \\"whodunnit\\" that starts quickly and clips along. It's a murder mystery relying more on plot and relationships than theatrics and gore. The use of first-person perspective is an interesting approach that allows the reader to feel more connected to the characters than a detached third-person would. Fast Track uses suspense, place, and time to develop this story. I recommend adding Fast Track to this summer's reading list."},{"Title":"Downtown: A novel","review":"Besides the excellent 87th Precinct novels, Ed McBain has also written several crime and detective novels. Of these, &quot;Downtown&quot; is the best, as well as one of his best, period.&quot;Downtown&quot; starts on Christmas Eve as Florida orange grower Michael Barnes, in New York on business, runs afoul of bogus cops, thieves, the mob, and a slimy movie producer. McBain piles on the action and absurdity at a furious pace as Barnes sinks deeper and deeper into the worst New York has to offer. McBain has always been adept at infusing his hard-boiled fiction with a sardonic humor that borders on the ludicrous. In &quot;Downtown,&quot; he proves he can still walk that tightrope as he balances the hilarity of Barnes' situation with a lean, hard-hitting narrative style.In fact, McBain's humor is so deliberately distracting, you don't realize it when he turns deadly serious. Michael Barnes may be bounced from one jam to another, but he too has a dark side, like most McBain characters. When pushed enough, he too becomes as deadly as his foes and as hard-boiled as any Raymond Chandler creation. &quot;Downtown&quot; is another example of Ed McBain at his best. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Downtown: A novel","review":"Reminiscent of the &quot;Out of Towners,&quot; this business trip to New York is tough on the hero but endlessly entertaining for the reader. Definitely one of McBain's best"},{"Title":"Downtown: A novel","review":"Have the tapes, which were \\"free\\" at a library sale. Should'a been paid to take them for free. The would-be humor requires a laugh track. The recording includes all the \\"he/she said\\"s following each moment of dialogue from the book. Endless - and what I have is abridged. Reading the written guaranty for your latest purchase would be more entertaining. And most likely better written."},{"Title":"Downtown: A novel","review":"If you like Ed BcBain novels, don't listen to this early one. I did so on BOT and if I hadn't already enjoyed some of his later ones,I would NEVER have read another . There are lists and lists and lists. The segment regarding stolen goods states what items are on each table....which lasted over 1 mile of walk/listen time. Most sentences come in pairs and the second repeats up to 50% of the words in the preceding one. Each character is a stereotype. There are flashbacks to Viet Nam ... which have no relation to the story at hand, even by a long and generous stretch. The elements of a McBain story are there. They just don't connect."},{"Title":"Chinatown","review":"In this story, with beautiful jewel-toned illustrations reminiscent of Hopper's paintings, a young child, accompanied by his grandmother, shows the reader various aspects of his life in an urban Chinatown. The busy urban setting takes on the elements of smalltown life as the pair cross a street, watch tai chi practicioners, greet the street cobbler, and visit the produce market, the fish market, the herbalist, a kung fu class and other fascinating places. The story culminates at a parade celebrating Chinese New Year. The colorful pictures, rich with detail, and simple, informative text give lots of opportunities for discussion. My two-year-old son has loved this book from the first time we read it, and requests it over and over again."},{"Title":"Chinatown","review":"Cultures and customs are explored in Chinatown by William Low.Young readers visit a city within a city, where streets of herbalists, tai chi masters, and outdoor fish market abound. This colorful section of New York City will prove fascinating to young eyes as they're introduced to people with a different heritage.As always, knowledge and understanding promote friendship."},{"Title":"Chinatown","review":"I live in San Francisco and used to teach second grade . . . I read this book to my class every year before our annual Chinatown field trip and it was always a smashing success. It's a beautifully written, beautifully illustrated story, that really immerses children in a cultural world that is different from the one in which most of them live. It inspires a lot of wonderful conversation about Chinese history and Chinese-American culture, but doesn't other-ise it . . . it's very approachable and welcoming."},{"Title":"RISING CURVE","review":"Many people are aware of the thesis of Herrnstein and Murray's \\"The Bell Curve,\\" regarding IQ, its bases, its consequences, its correlates. This edited volume reviews relevant literature and joins the debate over the nature and implications of IQ.The editor, the well-known researcher Ulric Neisser, notes in a brief preface, some of the issues addressed in this volume (p. xiii):\\"It turns out that there is another side to the story, one that leads to quite different conclusions [from Herrnstein and Murray]:* Scores on intelligence tests are rising, not falling.* The Black-White gap in school achievement has closed dramatically in recent years.* There is no convincing evidence that any dysgenic trends exist.\\"One takeoff poignant for this volume is the so-called \\"Flynn Effect.\\" In an early essay in this volume, Flynn himself notes the central point ) p. 26): \\"Data are now available for 20 nations and there is not a single exception to the finding of massive IQ gains over time.\\" In essence, over the past 80 years, evidence indicates that people are getting more and more \\"right\\" answers on IQ tests. That is, raw IQ scores have been rising systematically and substantially. While the average IQ score remains 100, the actual intelligence of people across cultures has increased, in terms of rising raw scores.This volume explores a number of issues: (1) what are the trends in IQ?; (2) What factors have affected this increase in intelligence? (e.g., enhanced nutrition? Other research outside this volume even suggests that computer games might be related to this increase); (3) What trends are there in racial differences in IQ in recent years? (4) Are there \\"dysgenic\\" trends in intelligence?All in all, the volume raises quite a number of important questions. Does it answer these? Not conclusively. But sometimes just raising questions is an important contribution. For those interested in an intellectual and research-based book on IQ, this is a good starting point."},{"Title":"RISING CURVE","review":"Although I am not a professional psychologist, it is my opinion that psychometrics is the dirty little secret of this discipline. This book was published as a reaction to Herrnstein &amp; Murray's _The Bell Curve_, and includes (somewhat) recent primary-source scholarship on the state of intellectual norming, from the Flynn Effect to Lynn's dysgenics hypothesis. Every aspect of intellectual norming is covered, from the nutritional hypothesis to other SES correlatives.Forget that the bell curve is a statistical convenience. The ostensive purpose of this text is not to show that psychometrics is invalid, but to show that Herrnstein &amp; Murray were selective in their studies on intelligence, and that intelligence is on the rise. To the layman, however, it shows that psychology actually grapples with racial differences and believes that norming is a valid measure of human intelligence. It made me realize that the caustic reaction to Herrnstein &amp; Murray was not because their suppositions about the measuring of intelligence were wrong, but because they made public many of the embarassing(can I say racist?) underpinnings of psychometrics.Even if psychometrics is not inherently racist, the continued sorting of individuals on the basis of race and class has no effect but to stigmatize and socially divide. However, I understand that it is part of human nature to continue conducting such studies.This book is enlightening. If you're in the field and you read journals, however, it is nothing new.

I spent thousands of dollars bringing expensive consultants in to look at the Institute of HeartMath and their products. As the director of an advanced research lab responsible for finding breakthrough technologies that would help take my then 25 Billion dollar company to the 100 Billion dollar mark, it was important to make sure HeartMath was legitimate and that the products or &quot;tools&quot; as they were called, worked.An immanent and respected scientist I brought in to investigate the scientific methodology applied in the Institute of HeartMath's Research Labs not only gave them a glowing bill of health, but ended up becoming a member of HeartMath's scientific advisory board. An expert in behavioral psychology I tasked to investigate the claims that IQM could enhance employee performance is now involved directly with bringing HeartMath &quot;tools&quot; to sports figures he consults, including a PGA pro on the current tour who is using the HeartMath &quot;tools&quot; to help him improve and sustain his game. People from the corporation's &quot;University,&quot; the training arm of the company I brought in to investigate the feasibility of the application of the tools, ended up selecting HeartMath training as the exclusive stress reduction and control program, replacing all other less effective forms for corporate employees. The division who's factory I used as a test-bed for our formal scientific study ended up offering the HeartMath tools to all its employees.Anecdotally, the young golf pro has never seen himself play better. Despite the hotly competitive environment and pressures of a young newcomer to the pro tour, he has yet to shoot a single game over par. The division that adapted the HeartMath tools factory-wide has recently been the corporation's most profitable and highest growth division, so far outperforming it's sisters that it was single handedly responsible for keeping the corporation profitable through tough economic times brought on by the recent Asian monetary crisis. I have my two favorite stories representing the best of what happened at the socio-economic extremes we tested in the scientific study: One story is about a factory worker who tells of going to a baseball game where a really offensive fan who had been heckling the players and officials all during the game started in when my factory worker's child came up to bat.The HeartMath &quot;enabled&quot; factory worker said, &quot;I was able to Freeze-Frame, and just chill-out when this person started saying things about my kid. There he was, right next to me, bad-talking my own kid. I did not hit him, I did not get arrested, and I did not miss work on Monday since I didn't go to jail.&quot; How's that for real-life from the lower strata of Maslow's hierarchy.Contrast that with the story of the Patent Attorney who, during the study, lowered his blood pressure at the same time doubling his work output. That part of the story is astounding enough, but add to that his personal family tragedy where his premature twins lived only a few days in intensive care then died. All this happened to this young professional during the time he doubled his work output and went from hypertensive to normal blood pressure.From Chaos To Coherence is a must read for businesses today. Responsible business leaders will read and heed it. The HeartMath tools are going to become as important to business in the remarkable times ahead as product quality assurance and meeting customer needs have in the past few years. Making quality products is no longer reserved for a few prestigious product lines, it has become players stakes in today's business game. As soon as your competition starts applying the methods and processes described in this book and embedded in the HeartMath &quot;tools&quot; you will have to apply or fall behind.And what a glorious set of standards the application of the principles outlined in From Chaos To Coherence is going to provide for modern business. Imagine empowered employees who are happier, healthier and more productive. When attitudes of care and appreciation are genuinely applied within the members of your workforce, imagine what it will do to your bottom line. The health care savings are enormous and the effects on absenteeism and employee job satisfaction are potentially marvelous. But where I see the most effectiveness is in the attitude of empowered employees reflecting care and appreciation toward each other, their families, and YOUR CUSTOMERS. The effect on the bottom line of a business that walks its talk in customer satisfaction is what will set a &quot;HeartMath empowered business&quot; ahead of the rest. Once customers learn the experience of working with a business where the individuals care and appreciate them, customers will start to demand that experience in every transaction with every business.Get a copy of From Chaos To Coherence and start enjoying the results on your business now."},{"Title":"From Chaos to Coherence: Advancing Emotional and Organizational Intelligence Through Inner Quality Management (registered trademark here)","review":"I'm convinced the most of us have adapted to the chaos we live in.

Leaders like Jack Welch of GE and Steven Covey have already told us that what will be critical to success in the future is &quot;soft stuff with hard results&quot; and From Chaos to Coherence shows us how to do that with ease, grace, and success!For any CEO, VP, Manager, Staff, Front Line worker- the simplicity of the concepts, the scientific foundation of the technology, and the ratio of success achieved by major organizations makes this book worth the read.The simple premise of exercising, on a consistent basis, the innate positive qualities of basic human nature is consistent with the success we see Fast Companies having. With the increasing mental and emotional chaos written about in many articles, business magazines, newspapers, and management books, this book by Childre and Cryer is not only refreshing, but also provides practical solutions carefully laid out in what they call the four dynamics of inner quality management.I have already started applying their simple processes to my life and my business problems and am experiencing immediate improvements in my mental clarity, productivity, and emotional state, particularly in high pressure situations.

As I read this book the words &quot;This is it&quot; kept running through my brain. These principles of Internal self-management are the antidote to the illness I see in too many organizations. Very talented individuals with a desire to do their very best are losing their spirits and hemorrhaging under the perception that they &quot;can't manage the pace&quot; anymore. Stress and overwhelm feed cynicism which quickly leads to breakdown. Doc Childre and Bruce Cryer have show us the map to restore and sustain organizational vitality and wellness. How to thrive as individuals and then thrive as teams and organizations. I clearly see that these tools are practical, have scientific underpinning and have been field-tested and proven. Imagine the impact on quality, climate and profits if an organization was able to transform even 15% of its Chaos into Coherence. If each organization has a &quot;collective brain&quot;, it should be processing its information coherently and creatively, and the lifeblood of that organization (the spirit of its employees) should be coursing thru this oganism with full hearts. Bravo to Doc Childre and Bruce Cryer for showing us how to enter the 21st century with the tools to make this a reality.

To me, this is more a personal management book which I learnt some new ideas and revisited some present ones, all in a highly comprehensible, interesting and easy reading manner. Some points for your reference are:-1) The heart is not just an organ for pumping blood, but with the second largest amount of neuron (the same type of cell for the functioning in our brain). We do have a lot of it in our digestion system as well, a possible explanation to our heart and gut feelings.2) Stress affects our production of hormones and drains our energy. Extended period of stress leads to maladaptation and thus premature aging and health problems. I like the author's refering to the fish in the highly contaminated Hudson River.3) The analogy of the natural frequency in nature (ref the resonance for string instructment) to the need for dynamic balance inside a human and thus an organisation for optimal performance.In short, though I dont believe the approach prescribed by this book can help much to improve the culture of many big corps, I do regard this as a very good book and I do recommend this to any business person who still has the heart for improvement."},{"Title":"From Chaos to Coherence: Advancing Emotional and Organizational Intelligence Through Inner Quality Management (registered trademark here)","review":"Balance and Coherence in the corporate world?

For one, out of the 150 pages only 2 are devoted to online play. The majority of people buy this just to play online.

Farrell takes off his novelist's hat and delivers a straightforward homage to the game. Unlike George Will and others who have exhibited an unfortunate tendency to overanalyze baseball and lace their writing with social commentary, Farrell reminds us that we attach ourselves to the game as kids, and forever after our love for it comes from childhood.Most remarkable are Farrell's clear and unadorned memories of the White Sox games that he saw as a boy growing up on the South Side of Chicago. He devotes a great chapter to detailing a no-hit game he saw pitched by Ed Walsh, one of his many childhood heroes. You feel with him the mounting excitement as Walsh approached recording the final out of his gem.Farrell also brings vividly to life the 1917 White Sox, the &quot;No-Hit Wonders,&quot; who batted just .228 as a team but who went on to win the World Series handily. His admiration for the team is plain (and he writes convincingly of the strengths of individuals on it), but he doesn't back away from expressing the disappointment the infamous 1919 team delivered him. At the same time, we get from Farrell the point made much later by Eliot Asinof in &quot;Eight Men Out&quot;: that owner Charles Comiskey's economic abuse of the team contributed to the decision to throw the Series.Fans of the White Sox will appreciate the portraits of Ray Schalk, Eddie Collins, Joe Jackson, Buck Weaver, Nick Altrock and many others. Farrell shows he was a close observor of the nuances of the game from a young age and never slips into mere idolatry.Overall the book is a fine evocation of baseball when the game and its players were more tightly integrated into the communities it served and fascinated. Farrell turns his writer's eye to the past and returns with memories bathed in the light of childhood."},{"Title":"Fire on the Waters : A Novel of the Civil War at Sea","review":"While the story is much shorter than the book (i.e., a lot of description), it certainly kept my interest.

Here is the ruthless and powerful financier; the independent-minded young heiress, his ward; the callow but emergingly courageous youth, his son; the hotheaded engineer, dreaming of technological change; the noble but superstitious fugitive slave; the sage and terrible naval captain, true to his orders in spite of his Southern principles (he holds no brief for slavery, mind you); the sage and gracious naval lieutenant, true to HIS orders in spite of HIS Southern principles (HE holds no brief for slavery, either). It would seem that slavery had nothing to do with Southern principles, but in any case, novelistic principles have nothing to do with this book: during the course of this tale, none of these characters changes in the slightest.One would think, from the rate at which the officers of Poyer's fictional USS Owanee flock to the Confederate cause, that the wardrooms of the navy were teeming with Southern sympathizers. But the pre-Civil War navy was an institution dominated by New Englanders, and of the officers from the South, only about half chose to leave the navy. Poyer's Owanee, a warn-out vessel whose fictional captain eventually joins the rebellion, is a misleading stand-in for the USS Pawnee of real life, a redoubtable ship whose captain, Commander Stephen C. Rowan, served with distinction throughout the war, eventually commanding the Navy's most powerful ship, the New Ironsides. (Rowan later rose to the rank of Vice Admiral.) A technical curiousity is that Poyer gives his Owanee an unusually shallow draft, which was indeed characteristic of the Pawnee, but only gives her five guns, though the Pawnee mounted twelve.The most misleading part of the naval account comes last, when a Confederate schooner catches the USS Cumberland and the \\"Owanee\\" by surprise in the Potomac and inflicts considerable destruction before gliding away unharmed. That no such engagement actually took place is, perhaps, nothing to be held against a writer of fiction. But historical fiction should at least be plausible. When, at any time in the history of sail, did a mere schooner get the better of two United States line ships?It seems that in Poyer's Civil War, these non-slavery-upholding Confederates could sail rings around mere Yankees. We eagerly await the sequel, when we expect to see the destruction of the Kearsarge by the Alabama and the ironclad Virginia's triumph over the Monitor."},{"Title":"Fire on the Waters : A Novel of the Civil War at Sea","review":"Excellent and well written account of the early days of the Civil War."},{"Title":"Fire on the Waters : A Novel of the Civil War at Sea","review":"I decided to try this book because I am a fan of historical fiction in general; naval fiction (O'Brien) and Civil War (Shaara) in particular. I actually picked up a Country of Our Own first and was only partway into that book before I went out and purchased this one to start over at the beginning.I was very pleased. There are several interesting characters, the main ones being Ker Claiborne, the conflicted Southern officer and Elisha Eaker, a young Northern idealist. The setting is superb. We get a real sense of the building anxiety and tension among shipmates as political events unfold. I would say that this book has a little less action and is more character focused than most in the genre. But you get the sense that much more action is set to occur in the next installment. Here the big question was would there or would there not be war. We readers all know that a bloody explosion is coming but the characters in the novel can't quite see the future.My only complaint about this novel is the whole storyline involving Elisha's fiancee, Araminta. It really doesn't contribute much at all. I get the feeling it was put in as filler to provide a change of scenery, given that the events of the book only cover a couple of weeks' time.

He has now taken this a step farther, giving us insight into a more unfamiliar time in the navy's history -- the transition from sail to steam. Once again he has painted vivid images of life in the navy at the time, meshing actual characters in our navy's history with his fictional characters to create a compelling story.Apparently this is the beginning of a new trilogy and I can't wait for the new novels.

It covers the start of the war through the ship-burnings at Norfolk. I really would give it a &quot;four and a half&quot;; it would get a five if not for the sections involving Araminta, which I found much less convincing than the rest.Poyer is one of the only &quot;military fiction&quot; authors who knows how to string words together. He writes evocatively, even artistically. His descriptions of ships and battles are particularly good. Setting is excellent, with a few anachronistic moments overshadowed by the wonderful description, both technical and sensory, of Civil War-era steam/sail warships.The characters here are appealingly tormented, particularly Eli, whose affliction with consumption is a very nice touch. Ker Claiborne, who must decide whether or not to join his seceding state, and the ahead-of-his-time young engineer Theo, are appealing as well. Less believable is Eli's ex-fiancee Araminta, who seems a little anachronistic in her independence and is certainly a bit annoying, though probably &quot;period&quot;, in her do-gooder tendencies. I did find some of the dialogue, especially &quot;dialect&quot; dialogue, to sound a bit too British.The plot is very exciting, with huge amounts of action. Occasionally the part of the plot dealing with family relationships gets a little melodramatic, not to say purple.I think this is an absolutely wonderful book which not only helps to fill a gap in Civil War literature but which, because of its good writing, will appeal to readers not normally interested in the period."},{"Title":"Fire on the Waters : A Novel of the Civil War at Sea","review":"If you know Bernard Cornwell and Richard Sharpe, and if you know Patrick O'Brian and James Aubrey, then you'll really like and appreciate this book.

In my opinion, his best work so far is Thunder on the Mountain. It is an historical novel of the Depression era, describing a wild-cat strike at an oil refinery in Pennsylvania. This book succeeds brilliantly in the same way: it evokes an era. Mr. Poyer has done his homework, and many threads of the Civil War era are articulated in this book, particularly the confidence of Northerners at the outset of the Civil War that the rebellion of the Southern states would promptly be put down, which was the prevailing opinion at the time, as strange as that may seem to us who know how cataclysmic that struggle turned out to be. I admire Mr. Poyer's novels of the modern Navy. But here he goes beyond his characteristic acumen in developing characters, as his protagonist wrestles with the elemental struggle of liberating himself from dependence on his wealthy father, through the epiphany of horrendous loss of life in warfare. As always, the dialogue sparkles. This is a worthy book, and I share other reviewers' eagerness for the publication of further works in this trilogy."},{"Title":"Fire on the Waters : A Novel of the Civil War at Sea","review":"Fire on the Waters, the latest from acclaimed author David Poyer, earns a well deserved Bravo Zulu (Naval Shorthand for Outstanding Job)for the superb job he has done on this Civil War tale of two navies.

This novel will be a Navy classic alongside such books as the Sand Pebble. It brings into the reader's face the struggle between those who wore the uniform between their allegience to their respective states or to their country. It was only after the Civil War that Robert E. Lee is said to have remarked that before the war he was a Virginian and afterwards he was an American. This novel is a glimpse into that gray area just before full hostilities broke out. It is captivating and it will keep you turning pages. If you can only read one historical Navy fiction this year, then this is the one.CAPT David E. Meadows, USNAuthor of THE SIXTH FLEET series"},{"Title":"Fire on the Waters : A Novel of the Civil War at Sea","review":"This Civil War novel by retired navy captain David Poyer was certainly a good introduction to his writings. &quot;Fire on the Waters&quot; , although is heralded as the introduction to a three volume series , does much more than serve as a vehicle to introduce the requisite cast of characters ; it certainly gets the characters in their places and definitely distinguishes the &quot;good guys&quot; from the &quot;bad guys&quot;.From the start we are introduced to young Elisha Eaker , the son of a New York financier Micah Eaker , who joins the navy as an officer-volunteer. As he reports aboard the U.S. Navy steam sloop Owanee , several other primary characters in the drama to follow -- primarily Lieutenant Ker Clairborne , the executive officer , and Commander Trezevant , the Captain of the Owanee -- are brought into focus. The regular Navy men are somewhat taken aback by young Eaker , since the man appears to be in poor health as well as inexpreienced.Eaker has volunteered for several reasons : to escape his totally domineering father and to either postpone or avoid an arranged marriage to his cousin , Araminta van Velsor. In addition , we find that &quot;Eli&quot; as he comes to be named throughout the story , is also suffering from tuberculosis!Captain Trezevant allows Eli to sail on board the Owanee due to the political climate -- many of the lower officers on board the sloop have resigned their commissions and headed South prior to the looming outbreak of hostilities in 1861. The first real mission is a voyage to Charleston , S.C. in the relief of Fort Sumter. Eli amanages to distinguish himself to the satisfaction of the &quot;regulars&quot; and is accepted aboard and commissioned properly.At the outbreak of war , many others leave the Union Navy and because of their loyalties to their homes and families join the Confederacy.To reveal any more detail than this would belabor the issue and reveal too much that the reader should discover on his own. Altho I labored a little adapting to the author's style at the start of this book , I found the novel to be highly entertainingand rated it four stars. Only a few warts on this one. Recommended."},{"Title":"Fire on the Waters : A Novel of the Civil War at Sea","review":"Fire on the Waters is the first novel in a projected series of books set during the Civil War. The action of the entire book takes place during the month of April 1861, but there's no lack of conflict and danger. The fictional U.S. sloop-of-war OWANEE begins and ends the novel at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, but in between she attempts to bring relief supplies to Fort Sumter, hunts a Confederate battery on the Potomac, and plays a critical role in the destruction of the Gosport Navy Yard.The novel focuses on Elisha Eaker, a tubercular young volunteer officer who joins the Navy to achieve independence from his domineering father, a wealthy New York merchant who is as ruthless with his family as he is with his competitors. Poyer's creation of Eaker as the protagonist is a smart move, because it allows the reader to see OWANEE and her crew through the new officer's inexperienced eyes. We get to learn the working of OWANEE's engine room, for example, as it is explained to Eaker by the ship's chief engineer. It's an effective technique for introducing readers to a time and technology that lies beyond most peoples' experience.One of the fun things about Fire on the Waters is the parade of historical characters that appear throughout the book. Virtually every important person connected with the U.S. Navy in April 1861 is present, including Gideon Welles, Hiram Paulding, Benjamin Isherwood and Charles Wilkes among others. Some, like Gustavus Fox, play a pivotal role in moving the plot along, while others add important color to a scene or event. The Army is represented, with Eaker's brief encounter with Major Anderson and Captain Doubleday inside beleaguered Fort Sumter, and Horace Greeley and Frederick Douglass even make brief cameos. It's a credit to Poyer's skill at crafting the plot that the regular appearance of these figures doesn't seem like a historical novelist's attempt at name-dropping; rather, they all turn up in a plausible sequence of events and never steal the scene from the main focus of the book, the fictional officers and crew of U.S.S. OWANEE.Even without the dust jacket's announcement of Fires on the Waters as the first in a series of novels, it's obvious that the book was written with that intent. Two major characters in the book \\"go South\\" during the course of the novel, leaving unresolved plot threads that will have to be sorted out later. One or the other of these men, no doubt, will be conning C.S.S. VIRGINIA into Hampton Roads two or three novels hence.A significant sub-plot in the novel involves Eaker's cousin Araminta Van Velsor, who is betrothed to Eaker and who is also struggling to get out from under the stifling \\"protection\\" of Eaker's father. This story is less fully developed than Eaker's, and appears to exist as much for the sake of a change of scenery in the novel as for anything else. Miss Van Velsor is not fully explored as a character. Her rebellion against her uncle's domination is mildy interesting, but it's difficult for her personal struggle to count for much in readers' minds when contrasted against the momentous events her cousin is witnessing. One hopes that she will play a more important role in future volumes of the series.Poyer's book is a good read, and unlike O'Brian's over-adulated work, it never seeks to impress the reader with the author's command of obscure linguistic or culinary trivia. There's not a pretentious word in this book. If you want a good sea story on a subject that has been almost entirely overlooked by"},{"Title":"Fire on the Waters : A Novel of the Civil War at Sea","review":"The story and characters are brilliant, and evoke the time in a way that connects with modern readers. However, Poyer has taken it on himself to use long dashes \\"--\\" instead of quotation marks. This is something that I couldn't get used to, in part because there is no mark to indicate the END of a quote. --Go below, Eli said. The first time I read a line like this, I think that it's someone telling Eli to go below. It's actually Eli speaking. 99% of the time there is little confusion, but basically you have to de-code every line of dialogue. A real pain in an otherwise first-rate book."},{"Title":"Fire on the Waters : A Novel of the Civil War at Sea","review":"I read one of David Poyer's earlier, modern naval books, probably 10-15 years ago, and wasn't impressed with either it or him. I guess in the interim he learned to write, or I became more tolerant of his foibles, because I thoroughly enjoyed this book.The story begins in 1861, with the U.S.S. Owanee. One of the main characters of the book is the ship's executive officer, Lt. Ker Claiborne, a Virginian who is unsure of his loyalty to the Union, but certain of his determination to keep his oath of loyalty to the Navy, the flag, and his ship...at least as long as he's a serving officer in the Navy. As the book starts, the ship is joined by a volunteer lieutenant, a New York blueblood who's talked his way into the Navy by exaggerating his skills as a yachtsman, to escape an overbearing father.The ship then sails south, and almost starts the Civil War by participating in a rescue or reinforcement mission to Fort Sumter. When that fails, the ship returns first to Washington, then Newport Naval Station, where they ultimately tangle with the first rebels towards the end of the book.This is one of the better naval novel's I've read in a long time. The author has adopted Charles Frazier's habit (Charlie Huston uses it too) of preceding everything anyone says with an em dash rather than using actual quotation marks. I'm not sure what the point of that is, but it works here, for the most part. Perhaps I'm getting used to it.I enjoyed this book, and I'm proceeding on to the second one in the series right now."},{"Title":"Fire on the Waters : A Novel of the Civil War at Sea","review":"The time is the opening days of the US Civil War. Secession is imminent but has not yet happened and many still hold out the hopes that it will not. The issues of the day, however, are driving people apart, even people who have worked closely with each other. This includes the officers and crew of the sloop of war, OWANEE, just back from the Africa station.The ship is tired as are her crew. She was expected to be put into ordinary but now has to scramble to take on the missions assigned to her as the nation prepares for rebellion. Matters are not helped by the fact that the crew is composed of northerners and southerners, whites and blacks. The loyalties of the southerners are in question even when they go above and beyond the call.Into this mix is introduced a frail young yankee man as a gentleman volunteer. He has his own issues in addition to those of the country. He has the head knowledge of a sea officer but no experience. Neither is he familiar with the customs of the navy. He wants to serve, however, because he is escaping a controlling father and because he wants to prove himself. He is also a fierce abolitionist.The entire action of the novel takes place over the course of just a few days. The ship is sent to the relief of Ft. Sumter and then dispatched to Hampton Roads to aid in the evacuation of the naval base. During the course of these actions the aspiring sea officer changes from a timid boy to a responsible man.This is certainly not the best naval fiction I have read nor is it the most interesting. It is quite readable, however.One small thing stood out for its nuisance value. The author uses a long dash \\"-\\" to mark quotes instead of quotation marks. I found this a bit distracting but it did not harm anything."},{"Title":"Fire on the Waters : A Novel of the Civil War at Sea","review":"Another winner by David Poyer with &quot;Fire On The Water.&quot; A Nation at war with itself as a Southerner fights battles within himself as well as on the high seas!"},{"Title":"Fire on the Waters : A Novel of the Civil War at Sea","review":"This is going to be a most interesting series because it is the rarely novelized naval side of the American Civil War, the war seen from off shore, and shows the awkward mid-19th century transition period between sail- and steam-powered ships. This first novel deals with three weeks of turmoil and unsettling time in April 1861 as the Civil War came into being, people began to sort themselves out, and incompetence was rampant. This parlous state of affairs makes for a rather unsatisfactory novel. There's hardly a competent person on view and all are confused. This is probably realistic but makes for more frustration than satisfaction on this reader's part. It will undoubtedly make more sense as the larger series unfolds, for David Poyer is an excellent author of novels of the modern navy and of diving. I don't know why people claim this will only be a trilogy; if so it will have to be most highly selective of events, given the level of detail and incident displayed here. Although it seems the central character is to be a volunteer New York officer--an abject, tuburcular pappa's boy who is so naive he appears to be a &quot;cool customer&quot; under fire--the story is also chopped up among several other characters and their viewpoints: Southern Federal officers who must decide where their loyalties lie, an enthusiastic steam engineer, a Black gunner, casual bigots of the time, and a sheltered feminist abolitionist. Because Poyer doesn't play the omniscient author, we all stumble through this first book together. We can expect to see these characters again, each providing a markedly different perspective on the war, from below and above, from home and at sea. Some of the Southern gentlemen may come back aboard Confederate ships as opposed to the exclusively Federal ones here, and there are hints we can expect to see ironclads and Adm. Farragut in future volumes. Certainly more than enough for two more books! Sounds and colors are described in iron hard metallics. Much of the story is grey-toned, frequently taking place in fog or night or firelight, much exacerbated by the unsettled, and unsettling, times when all was rumor. We see conflicts between sections, father and son, financier and ward, black and white. Poyer is excellent in scenes of storm, shot and shell, and fire, whether ashore or on the water. Several passages, like stoking a boiler or the swaying out of ship's boats, seem to be inserted for atmosphere or to show off Poyer's knowledge of period minutiae. The book has been composed with a nice old-fashioned look: a spidery typeface, analytical chapter headings, antique jargon, and (annoying) m-dashes instead of quotation marks for spoken words. The cover art is useful."},{"Title":"Progress in Irish: A graded course for beginners and revision","review":"I have studied modern Irish off and on for many years, and I have found that this book is a marvellous workbook for the beginner in learning Irish. However, it is necessary to have a dictionary and a grammar book available as well as this one. This book is wonderful for those people who already have a few hundred words of Irish in their vocabulary and have a basic grasp of pronunciation.This book is very simple in format. It contains a series of numbered lessons that slowly increase in complexity. Most of the lessons present a few new words, and then give advice concerning grammar in plain terms as well as some lessons that utilise the new terms.The lessons build on all the previous lessons in the book, so the learning process is quite logical. Further into the book, the sentence structure becomes a little more complicated, but the bits of advice on usage and sentence formation are quite adequate if a beginner has a handy Irish grammar book nearby. Lessons are presented in English and Irish; do not worry about getting lost quickly. This is not an 'immersion' sort of text.There is a glossary of Irish terms used in the text located in the rear part of the book. Nouns are noted with their proper gender, which is helpful at a beginner's level.The only real lack of information in this book is a guide to pronunciation or sample phonetic transcriptions. However, that data is very easily found in this Irish dictionary:Focl&oacute;ir P&oacute;ca (Focloir Poca in Anglicised letters)publisher: An G&uacute;m (An Gum in Anglicised letters)ISBN: 9781857910476latest edition: 1992The Focl&oacute;ir P&oacute;ca is available at many different bookshops online, though it has to be bought used rather than new these days.

Now that I have read this as well, I see that it may be even better than the other two!The wry sense of humor characteristic of Twain definitely is most in evidence in CT Yankee. All 3 of these works deliver Twain's wide understanding of human nature in different times and sociological conditions, and his admiration of human nobility and greatness of heart in adversity. Joan of Arc unquestionably is the most inspiring of these tales, being the story of the greatest hero (or heroine).

I have a slew of these kinds of books in my library; I hate not knowing the answer to a question (or more precisely, not being able to find the answer to a question). Covering a wide range of inventions, this book gives short, concise explanations of their origins. My only real complaint is that they don't cover enough, and sometimes obvious inventions are left out. For example, the airplane is omitted, and the Wright Brothers probably would have liked to have been included.

Those of us that know the Green Lantern stories from the 1980s through present day will love to see how the author respects the characters and situations. Those new to the stories will enjoy how the tale unfolds.One caveat: you need to read Books 1 and 2 for the whole story to make sense. The author answers questions left by those two.

But no one actually know much about this church, besides the legand. I would really like to know more about it. Anyway, I read this book in less then a day, its one of those books that once you start reading you can't stop its so good. I HIGHLY recommend this book, to everyone, young &amp; old. It is truly great, a BIG THANKS TO L.A. FLICK!!!For those of you that don't know that legend of Katy's Chruch--*The lengend goes that Katy's Church was named after Katy (VanDine I believe) it says that her Finance', a soldier was en route home to marry her when she received word that he was killed, distraught over this she hung herself in the big oak tree outside the church which by the way is still standing today, in her wedding dress!!*Local folk have said that there is no truth to that, it is nothing but an old legend. There were no reports of anything happening at the church, and the only suicide that has happen around here back them was in the woods about 5 miles from the church.*There have always been people you have come close to the church and reported weird happening. But, in all of my years living here and being near hear I have never witnessed any supicious happenings. But I have heard people say things like, there were unexplained sightings, you can hear people saying your name in dead silence, when sitting in your vehicle with the keys lying on the set beside your, your radio will start playing, your headlights blink, wipers come on, and horn blows, people have heard Strange noises, saw floating orbs, and unknown sources of light are often present in the cemetery behind the church. Also, blood has flow out of the boarded up windows at times. Reports of seeing her walking the road between her house and the church as well as people seeing her at the church. And her headstone runs opposite of all the others, although I have lived her I never actually checked to see if that was true!Again thank you for the wonderful book L.A.

Flick was inspired to write this novel by legends and rumors surrounding an old church very near where I live. Her story is fiction, but haunting just the same.

You know that there is something you haven't been told yet, and you desperatly want to know what it is. So you keep reading to the very end, which twists and surprises you. Her characters are very real, and as you read, you will be left feeling as if you are one of the townspeople, wondering what really happened in that old church.Though the story is fiction, you can almost imagine going to Talmer to see the church to find out what it really feels like to enter Katie's church.

Congratulations on a wonderful book, Mr. Mayer!Get the book and read it with a child."},{"Title":"Shibumi and the Kitemaker","review":"Even though I love the Little Critter series, my favorite book of Mercer Mayer's has always been East of the Sun, West of the Moon with it's colorful and detialed illustrations. With this new book, Mercer Mayer worked with a Mac computer and I am AMAZED with the rich textures and warm realistic quality. No cool technical stuff here...this story too is from the heart and magical!"},{"Title":"Shibumi and the Kitemaker","review":"I highly recommend this book to any fan of Mercer Mayer's work or to a fan of Japanese culture. Although Mayer admits in the note in the book that this story is not based on any known Japanese folklore, it reads just like a folktale should and has enough of a Japanese flavor to make it acceptable to at least Western readers. (I wonder what a Japanese reader would think.) However, the real star of the book is the illustrating. Mayer is excellent at capturing moments from the story in a single illustration, incorporating many elements into a composite that is itself a story. I would recommend his rendition of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; as a further example of this. The style is rich with color and texture, and each illustration has balance and dynamic symmetry. He pays as much attention to the background and the borders as he does the foreground and the main action. You can delight in a small detail like the pattern of the emperor's kimono, or how each of the many kites flying at the end of the book is different.Mayer also dared to do all the illustrations for this book on a computer, using Adobe Illustrator and a variety of other software. I am impressed with the result, although a few minor things bug me about some of the illustrations. For instance, in a few spots, objects in the distance appear to be sharper, more in focus, then objects in the foreground. It seems to me that this should have been addressed before publishing the book as it goes against our normal way of seeing. But that aside, I commend Mayer for trying his illustration skills in a new medium, and admit that Mayer on a bad day is still wonderful to look at.The minor glitches with the illustrations, and the fact that the story could have been a bit more poetic, keep this book from getting five stars. Still, it is worth buying. It is a beautiful book."},{"Title":"Shibumi and the Kitemaker","review":"Just recently we discovered Mercer Mayer and we love his series \\"Little Critter\\". I looked for other books he had written and saw this one. It is so beautifully illustrated that it was joy to look at it. My daughter said right away \\"What beautiful pictures\\".The story is beautiful, very sad but saying a true story of how the world is. It is a very similar story of the Buddha story where he left the beautiful palace because he felt pitiful to the suffering people outside of the palace. Every book has a short description of what happens in the book. This book's description is not accurate on the first few pages. It says: \\" After seeing the disparity between the conditions of her father's palace and the city beyond its walls, the emperor's daughter has the royal kitemaker build a huge kite to take her away from it all.\\" Once you read the story, you can see that this cannot be any further from the truth. Because she asks the kitemaker to build her this kite, so she can change the city. A very wonderful, well written story. We have become fans of Mercer Mayer and I am getting more of his books of this kind."},{"Title":"Shibumi and the Kitemaker","review":"This looked like a beautiful book but it didn't keep my 4 year old daughter's interest. I could barely stay awake through it. The story is good and I like the illustrations but, unlike with some dramatic tales of adventure, my interest slowly waned with each twist and turn of the plot. I understand Mercer Mayer took a hiatus from writing children's books -- I'm glad he's back and look forward to his next one. But I wouldn't buy this book."},{"Title":"Well Preserved: Pickles, Relishes, Jams and Chutneys for the New Cook","review":"This is excellent for new cooks and really good for old cooks...experience old, not age old as a lot of us refuse to age. New cooks to preserving will find step by step instructions. Old cooks will find new recipes...the pickled asparagus was undescribable. The spicy hot green beans added to a Bloody Mary can't be beat. On a cold winter day while cheering the Chicago Bears (even IF they lose)you experience that good &quot;I made this&quot; feeling!"},{"Title":"Well Preserved: Pickles, Relishes, Jams and Chutneys for the New Cook","review":"Why would you want to eat mass produced canned food when you could easily preserve your own at home? You'll know what went into them: fresh fruit, less sugar, without preservatives and full of color and flavor. This book has many recipes and color photos, also a collection of recipes using preserves from earlier chapters. Basics of preserving are explained... equipment, jars, processing and storing. Canning food can be a lot of work, but it's so rewarding to have a pantry of flavors from the summers bounty. These chutney's are full of spices and innovative combinations (ginger, currants, figs, vinegar, sugar, honey, onion, dates and citrus). Jams, preserves, conserves and jellies can be used for glazes and sauces. It's easy to preserve food for your own pantry and ideal for gifts. Something you've made yourself is more appreciated, especially when it's as tasty as the recipes in this collection."},{"Title":"Well Preserved: Pickles, Relishes, Jams and Chutneys for the New Cook","review":"I found the directions clear, concise and easy to follow forany cook. I enjoy the variety of recipes offered in this book becausethey weren't just the &quot;usual&quot; ones. Yes, there are the some of the typical recipies too. The use of spices, herbs and combination of ingredients will spark your imagination and desire to preserve your own food. A very good book."},{"Title":"Well Preserved: Pickles, Relishes, Jams and Chutneys for the New Cook","review":"I read many books on preserving before I found this one. Other books had boring ingredients and uninspiring recipes. Once I read the recipes in Well Preserved I knew I was ready to make my first attempt at jam. My fist batch was delicous and easy. I have since made chutneys, jellies, and marmalades; all turning out perfect.

Find out in this well-done, rhyming text filled with kids illustrations and &quot;letters&quot; and &quot;documents&quot;. For example: one child crafts Shakespeare's will...very interesting! Lois Burdett is a genius! Perfect for teaching about Shakespeare - for kids and adults! Buy It!"},{"Title":"A Child's Portrait of Shakespeare (Shakespeare Can Be Fun series)","review":"I purchased this book because I was attracted to it and I intended to put it away until I could pull together an interesting unit study on Shakespeare. However, my two boys (7 and 9) could not stand to go to bed without me reading it to them first!! They were instantly attracted to artworks and writing done by kids their age and wouldn't let me pass a single page without reading everything! They enjoyed finding the spelling errors and I was certainly surprised at how many they caught, as I am sure they would've made many of the same ones. My boys asked, after reading the book, if we could study Shakespeare for school THIS week! Yikes, I have got some quick planning to do. This is a wonderfully inspiring leaping off point for a trip into the world of Shakespeare. At the end of the book, one of my sons said it well, \\"Hey mom, he wrote drama and he lived drama, too!\\" I think they got it."},{"Title":"A Child's Portrait of Shakespeare (Shakespeare Can Be Fun series)","review":"My 9 year old was curious about Shakespeare so I ordered this book as well as three others in this series for her, and she loved them. She can't wait for me to order more for her."},{"Title":"A Child's Portrait of Shakespeare (Shakespeare Can Be Fun series)","review":"My son who is 2nd grade loved it and ate it up. After reading the book together, he and I played rhyming games just as the book was written about Shakespeare in rhymes!

Great way to introduce Shakespeare to children."},{"Title":"Digital Video for Dummies, Third Edition","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to enter the world of editing videos for my business. I found it very helpful. It compares several different editing software on the market, focusing on the simplest and most popular. I have since been able to edit several videos and feel I got adequate training to get started and also save money in the process. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting a cursory overview of how to edit video and what software to get."},{"Title":"Digital Video for Dummies, Third Edition","review":"I bought this book, because I want to make my own video. However, the book I got was a 2nd edition, which most things is the book were too old for nowadays. some basic things are ok, but technology parts like devices and programs are just too old"},{"Title":"Digital Video for Dummies, Third Edition","review":"This book scores on so many levels I can't recommend it enough for beginners. As somebody who bought their first camcorder and will be making shorts which will involve editing software, I needed a 101 overview.And boy, did this ever fit the bill. Written in a breezy, easy-to-understand style, the book first deals with what you should look for in equipment. It then moves into basic filming techniques but most importantly, the beginner mistakes that are all too common (bad lighting, zooming in during a shot, etc.). Even though I have a basic knowledge of film making, I found these tips extremely helpful.But what really makes this book worth every cent is that it is basically a user's guide for iMovie, Windows Movie Maker and Adobe Premiere. If you're new to editing, you're probably going to start with the super-basic Movie Maker or iMovie, and somewhere down the line move up to the more advanced Adobe.For every editing step it shows how this is done in each respective program--a virtual user's guide, complete with tips and enhancements.It also covers advanced editing tricks, adding audio, lighting tricks, you name it.If you want a primer for beginners, this couldn't be more perfect. It was so interesting and easily readable I read the entire book in one day."},{"Title":"Digital Video for Dummies, Third Edition","review":"Sadly this purchase is a waste of money because the prograammes and equipment bear no relationship to what I already purchased prior to getting the book."},{"Title":"Digital Video for Dummies, Third Edition","review":"&quot;3rd Edition&quot; I would recommend this book to anyone interested in becoming a Video Editing Guru. Now there isn't much fame or glory in such a title, and I'm not implying that after reading the book you will be able to instantly break into the &quot;Pro&quot; video editing business either. But it does give you some useful information on how to digitize those video clips and turn them into a respectable home movie or corporate presentation.The book is very much based on Apple's &quot;iMovie&quot; and Pinnacle's &quot;Studio 8&quot;. You'll skip around a bit because of the 2 different programs it explains, but you're really just getting 2 books in one if you ever decide to dabble in the 'other' program. If you're using a video editing program other than these, you may want to pick a different book.Well organized and &quot;dumb-ed down&quot; enough for the beginner. The projects and included clips on CD Rom keep it interesting. I learned about many tips that I plan to use all the time in my projects now. Good work Underdahl!Based on what I've seen in this book, I would definitely check out the Adobe Premiere Dummies book by the same author if I decide to move up to that program. I'm confident that I would not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Digital Video for Dummies, Third Edition","review":"I wish I had bought this book initially.I was pretty new to digital video.

Well, it was antique, relatively speaking, so when I picked this one up, suddenly things started to make a lot of sense.Also, the author seems to be able to cover three editing products without a lot of repetition.

Simple easy to read and apply!"},{"Title":"Digital Video for Dummies, Third Edition","review":"I have my first digital video camera and, for the first time, the option to edit my long and boring captures. While I am very experienced at editing digital photos, this is an entirely new field for me. It seems to me that this \\"for dummies\\" version is still too advanced for me. I need one \\"for complete morons\\", apparently. This is a reflection on me, not on the book, which seems to be very thorough.It goes into more detail than I need. I don't capture video with my phone; I don't have capture problems; the odds of my ever needing nightvision videos are nil; I'm not sure I need to know what the NTSC standards are, and on and on.All I really wanted was a step-by-step way to:*use the software that came with my camera to cut out unnecessary areas and restitch the remainter;*suggestions on how to make a video capture flow, more or less seamlessly, despite the editing;*ditto with the soundtrack;*an overview of easy video editing programs that I can upgrade to if I should ever outgrow my camera's software (which doesn't look likely right now.)*workflow suggestions as to how to backup and preserve video (I don't have that much faith that DVD's are still going to be in use a decade from now), so I wanted a general overview of options and suggestions.I got the first four. It was a bit more technical than I wanted, but that may be because I didn't realize the full software/hardware implications, let alone the standards, frame rates, aspect ratios, interlacing, capture cards, or video converters issues--and I've still purposefully avoided the \\"advanced video editing\\" chapter. It seems to me that people, not too much brighter than I and with similarly-equipped home computers, have managed to edit their videos w/o knowing all this. Actually, ignorance is bliss sometimes and I'm not sure I want to know. (But if YOU want to know it, it's all here).The issue of archiving and preserving video is not addressed. The author does suggest external hard drives as a way to save space on the internal ones. Maybe we have to endlessly keep updating our captures (super 8 to vhs; vhs to dvd; dvd to ??). I was hoping that some specific strategy to make the process easier and foolproof. It probably isn't fair for me to expect to have this issue addressed in a \\"for dummies\\" book, but preserving these memories going forward is the primary reason I shoot movies, and I'd like to think that there is someway that I can ensure that today's babies will be able to see their movies 30 or 40 years from now."},{"Title":"Digital Video for Dummies, Third Edition","review":"If you're thinking about buying your first digital video camcorder or up-grading, or you're want to learn how to edit video using your computer then this is a great book. The author does a great job explaining technical things that go along with digital camcorders and making movies. You really need to understand how digital video works in order to be able to make terrific movies and how to work with your camcorder and computer software. Even though this is a 4th edition (2006) it has some information about Blue-Ray and lots about High Definition (HD) which is a big step up from analog video and standard difinition video. After you read this book, and apply many of the techniques, you'll be able to make much better videos than before."},{"Title":"Digital Video for Dummies, Third Edition","review":"This book is good if you're an absolute beginner, but I was hoping for alot more info.

However, I wouldn't go so far as to describe the photographs as 'breathtaking' as does another reviewer. There are many of them, all interesting, but almost all (apart from a brief intro sequence) only quarter or eighth page size. As a result, there is no image as impressive as the front cover.

Every page contains sharp insights&Ntilde;for example, her suggestion that the broken column that the Baron de Monville built as his house at the Desert de Retz outside Paris in the 1780s portended the revolution that would sweep away the civilization he cherished.

From what my teacher told me and the few chapters I did read (they're pretty long chapters, by the way) the author tends to go on and on, verging on losing the readers attention at times.

This particular book is very deep and comprehensive, involving what we all know about art, namely we depict, in picture after picture, through sculpture and beyond...not just man's triumphs but also man's deepest, anguished hours. Why do we do this? What is the connect of pain to pleasure? What drives us to create and recreate, even the deepest sorrow. For example, how many many paintings, how much art, has been created that has the crucifixion as its central and ongoing themes? The author begins this book with a meditative piece on Auschwitz and throughout, the author's commentary on art, artists, the historical context, raises important questions about pain, art, and the need to transcend and \\"endure\\". I find the book's title itself compelling because it's so about art, how we endure the slings and arrows of outrageous fate and what lasts, even, beyond us, as a legacy of pain and hope, into the future. As a reminder? Beyond a reminder?Yes, I would recommend this book highly for its depth, its scholarship and its humanity. It's not a book one can read right through because it's dense and should, I think, should be taken slowly, chapter by chapter. Let it simmer. Let it shimmer. And then let go and come back."},{"Title":"Enduring Creation: Art, Pain, and Fortitude","review":"I did write an essay/review of this for the Michigan Quarterly Review; this also included an e-mail interview with Prof. Spivey.(I am an essayist and literary critic.)

But it's also the story of a remarkable woman who builds a remarkable family and not only lives on, but thrives. This book is proof: we all have strength and creativity within us that may not make itself evident until we need it. It's also proof that Susan Parker is a gifted writer. The pages sing with laughter as well as pathos. The book will make you rejoice in Susan's humanity, and your own."},{"Title":"Tumbling After: Pedaling Like Crazy After Life Goes Downhill","review":"I saw Suzy Parker at a book reading in Seattle and she said, \\"One thing you learn being in the disabled community is that there is always someone worse off than you.\\" And she shows us some of these people--with a clear eye and a sense of humor. What I really love about her story is its truth. There is no self-pity. Even when she says \\"this [stinks], I wonder if I can make,\\" she just plows ahead.The story is accessible and never maudlin even when it is grim. And there is plenty of humor and adventure to pull the reader through the tight little chapters.This story is the real deal--a great read, a compelling story, and a few lessons along the way."},{"Title":"Tumbling After: Pedaling Like Crazy After Life Goes Downhill","review":"I was totally captivated by this book, which will stay with me. Susan's Parker life was turned upside down when her husband had a bad accident which paralyzed him from the shoulders down. This book is vignettes of her life since. Her writing reminds me of funny adventure travel writers like Tim Cahill, Pico Iyer, Bill Bryson and Doug Lansky. Her journey is not to a foreign land, but her life with a quadraplegic in Oakland, might as well be. Her description of how she built and found a new life is captivating, funny and moving."},{"Title":"Tumbling After: Pedaling Like Crazy After Life Goes Downhill","review":"I picked this book up with about 15 others from the new non-fiction section at my library in preparation vacation reading. I got through my entire selection, but this is the one book that, in a truly meaningful way, became part of my consciousness. I then had the opportunity to choose a book for my bookclub, and it was a no-brainer: Tumbling After. I think the book just speaks to a place in one's heart.Although at times I wanted to shake Suzy Parker, there was never a time in the book where I couldn't relate in some way to her. Since none of us know what lies ahead in life, we can all imagine ourselves in Suzy Parker's shoes, and I would hope that I would handle any situation of the same magnitude with similar grace, honesty, and humanity. When white, middle class Suzy finds herself in the position of forming a &quot;new family&quot; with folks whose background and lifestyle were formerly not even on her radar, it proves beyond doubt that &quot;love is thicker than blood&quot;. She faces up to her biases very bravely, and finds true friendship and camraderie.Lastly, but just as importantly, I laughed hysterically throughout, which was hard to explain to family members who inquired of the subject matter of such an apparently funny book (quadraplegia? - huh?). But I just loved Suzy Parker's soul."},{"Title":"Tumbling After: Pedaling Like Crazy After Life Goes Downhill","review":"Told with deadpan humor, Suzy Parker relates the story of her life after her husband's near-fatal bike accident. While it is Ralph's accident that is the catalyst for the change in their lives, this is the story of Susan Parker.After the accident, the plans for an athletic retirement are replaced with endless trips to doctors, pharmacies, and the never-ending routine of caring for a quadriplegic. Many of their old friends offer advice but not much else, other fade away entirely. As the family being to sink into despair, new friends and associates come to help her adjust to the new lifestyle. Susan freely admits that many of these people are not the type of people she has ever known much about before nor would she have ever chosen to associate with had she not left the privileged world of the white upper-classes.I found this book to be full of funny anecdotes that were well told. Ms. Parker tells her story with as much humor as possible and a great deal of candor. It is a quick read and well worth your time."},{"Title":"Tumbling After: Pedaling Like Crazy After Life Goes Downhill","review":"Susan Parker's memoir of her husband, Ralph's accident and it's aftermath is the best thing I've read this year. It's funny, sad, shocking, and completly compelling. This is a book I couldn't put down and continue to think about. I want to know more about these people!"},{"Title":"Tumbling After: Pedaling Like Crazy After Life Goes Downhill","review":"I cried, I laughed, I sighed and then I laughed and cried again. I picked this book up and could not put it down. I thought the book gut wrenching. A literary friend of mine to whom I sent the book said &quot;What a wonderful book you sent me, what a searing story.&quot; Susan Parker has written a wonderful book of life and dreams gone astray and picking up the pieces after."},{"Title":"Tumbling After: Pedaling Like Crazy After Life Goes Downhill","review":"The cover of Susan Park's \\"Tumbling After\\"calls it a memoir and, of course, it is. But much more, it's a love story, a unique story that couldn't have happened in any other environment, among a different kind of people, nor would it have been written by any one else. It is a story of personal growth, the erasing of prejudice, a new portrait of neighborhood, family and the meaning of love in all its forms and all its unexpected sources. As well as the many shapes of heroism that develop as disaster is taken in stride. Suzy writes with the brevity of a practiced columnist, but this is not a collection of her newspaper columns. The language, the sexuality, the emotion is candid, honest and unrestrained. It's an account of what is, and what is is there to be embraced.Suzy's athletic husband Ralph becomes a quadriplegic in a bike accident. His every need requires help, day and night. There is no hope for recovery, but his life is not hopeless. The reader gets the sense that something good is going to happen even though it's clear that Ralph's physical condition wont change. There is no lecture, no attempt to show bravery, no lesson consciously taught. Yet the reader feels as though he or she is a better person for having read Tumbling After.Once into this book, you may promise yourself to read just one more \\"column,\\" before putting it down. Then just one more and just one more, page, until you get to the end. Each brief \\"story\\" leads to the next until the last. I couldn't wait to get to the end, and then I was sorry this rare reading experience was over.Heartily recommended to anyone who thinks that life is tough.- - - -"},{"Title":"Tumbling After: Pedaling Like Crazy After Life Goes Downhill","review":"I was totally captivated by this book, which will stay with me. Susan's Parker life was turned upside down when her husband had a bad accident which paralyzed him from the shoulders down. This book is vignettes of her life since. Her writing reminds me of funny adventure travel writers like Tim Cahill, Pico Iyer, Bill Bryson and Doug Lansky. Her journey is not to a foreign land, but might as well be. Her description of how she built and found a new life is captivating, funny and moving."},{"Title":"Tumbling After: Pedaling Like Crazy After Life Goes Downhill","review":"I am sorry it took me so long to discover this book. I have been a fan of Ms. Parker since I first began reading her columns in the SF Chronicle. This book is one of those you want to read slowly so that it lasts longer but find you can't put it down. Susan has a wonderful knack for untainted honesty as she reports on the universal joys and sorrows of human life. She guides the reader into her world without trying to assign blame or seek justification, a truly refreshing approach in this day and age. Can't wait for the sequel! -Cindy"},{"Title":"Tumbling After: Pedaling Like Crazy After Life Goes Downhill","review":"i loved this book and read it cover to cover in one sitting. susan parker is fearless. fearless in the way she faces her life and fearless in how she writes about it. this is a love story and a story of survival. it's poignant and at times it is laugh out loud funny."},{"Title":"Tumbling After: Pedaling Like Crazy After Life Goes Downhill","review":"Although I would have been interested in hearing more about her relationship with Ralph after the accident (their conversations, their ways of creating intimacy of a non-sexual way), I did appreciate Susan's honesty in telling HER story. There are obviously many paths to handling this kind of loss. I found her way to be beautiful and inspired. I wish her well now that Ralph has passed."},{"Title":"Tumbling After: Pedaling Like Crazy After Life Goes Downhill","review":"As the wife of a quadriplegic I was very interested to see what Susan Parker had to say about her life. The description of the devastation, hopelessness and helplessness women feel when they come into this situation was excellent. The potrayal of the feeling of being totally overwhelmed and burned out by the intensity of it all was very real to me.This is where the excellence of the book ended. It was extremely redundant, telling almost the same story over and over with a slightly different twist. I was quickly bored. It was obvious that it was a collection of short antecdotes written for her newspaper column and not a cohesive book. I was determined to finish it and was only able to tough it out to the end because of the perseverence I've learned from being a Quad Wife.It was appalling to read that her husband is kept a virtual prisoner in the living room of the house they live in. No adaptations have been made since 1994 to make the rest of the home accessible to him? He has a life of watching TV? What is that all about?I am also wondering why a woman who says she is intelligent did not seek out the available programs which provide excellent, in home assistance to people with disabilities. Had she taken advantage of such programs, both she and her husband would have much improved lives."},{"Title":"Tumbling After: Pedaling Like Crazy After Life Goes Downhill","review":"I disagree with many of the reviews. I found the tone of the book to be somewhat self-pitying and monotonous. Strangely, the only review here I seem to agree with was written below by the wife of another quadiplegic.The most interesting aspect about this topic, the devastating accident and its immediate aftermath, are glossed over quickly in the first few pages. The remainder of the book is the author going, \\"Woe is me, look how my life has deteriorated.\\" Don't get me wrong, I don't think I could have handled what she went through, but the book makes the wife more of a victim than the husband.There is nothing in the book about the husband's initial reaction to waking up and learning he was paralyzed after such an active life; virtually nothing about how he coped with the injury psychologically.One problem with this book is that the author tells the whole story from the standpoint of me, me, me. I understand how hard her life must have become in the wake of her husband's devastating accident, but I had a real problem with the fact that, according to the book, for the most part, the author parked her formerly active husband in the living room in front of the television like a potted plant and pretty much left him there.There is very little interaction described between the author and her disabled husband. The author goes on and on about how wonderful her husband's caretakers are, but treats the quadriplegic husband as a two dimensional burden. For example, Ms. Parker will describe in great detail some conversation or interaction she had with one of her husband's attendants, and then she throws in something like, \\"and we gave Ralph a sleeping pill, emptied his urine bag, put him to bed, and then [the attendant] took me upstairs and made love to me tenderly.\\" I am no prude, and I understand the woman has needs, but I found the whole thing horrifying and insensitive.She parks the husband in a hospital bed in the living room, and then spends the next few years sharing a bed and sex life upstairs with his 60-year old care attendant. When the husband says he does not want to know how she satisfies herself sexually, she tells him anyway, saying telling him would make HER feel better. Who knows how the poor husband felt. He could hardly complain, since he is helpless without both the wife and the attendant.She says her old friends and life \\"dropped away,\\" after the accident, leaving as her only social life, an odd assortment of lovable misfits that took care of her husband. The book gives the impression that, if one is rendered disabled, their only social life is going to be with their ex-con, ex-drug addict hired attendant [who also services the author sexually for years] and assorted neighbors.I did not find the book uplifing. I found it completely depressing. Usually when I love a book, I am sad when I finish it. This one I was glad to put down. If you want an inspiring book by or about dealing with quadriplegia and its aftermath, I highly recommend \\"Eleven Seconds\\" by Travis Roy [the former hockey player]; \\"Still Me,\\" by Christopher Reeve; or \\"Miracles Happen\\" by Brooke and Jean Ellison."},{"Title":"Tumbling After: Pedaling Like Crazy After Life Goes Downhill","review":"I really love the genre memoir when it catches me and absorbs me.

There were times that I felt that I wished I was right there with her, jail and all. The romance department made me want more. She told of lovers but in a suspenseful way. No Porn.

Korb (Senior Adviser to the Center for Defense Information) and Winslow T. Wheeler (worked on national security issues for 31 years for members of the U.S. Senate) combine their expertise in Military Reform: A Reference Handbook, a straightforward guide to understanding fundamental strengths and weaknesses in America's military forces, and therefore understanding what genuine military reform is, what it is not, and what needs to be done. Denouncing so-called \\"cosmetic dabbling\\", which essentially improves nothing, Military Reform examines the history of various efforts to improve the American armed forces, from the actions of the Continental Congress during the American Revolution to the modern day. Each advocated reform is examined, and its relative degree of success analyzed; Operations Desert Storm and Iraqi Freedom, as well as the subsequent insurgency in Iraq, are scrutinized to reveal what has successfully been reformed in the U.S. armed forces and what has not. A serious-minded, number-crunching, cost-conscious analysis heavily grounded in scientific-minded observation and practical experience, highly recommended for military history and studies shelves, and a \\"must-read\\" for anyone involved in overseeing military operations or structure."},{"Title":"Understanding and Evaluating Educational Research (3rd Edition)","review":"Thank you, this item was exactly what I wanted it to be.

It is a little hard to read. The panels don't seem flipped right in a few instances. Manji, though, fights his toughest opponent yet. There are quite a few badguys in the itto-ryu that have a reputation besides Anotsu. Higa is one of those guys who has his own personality. I noticed one faded drawing in BOTI a while back. It was suppose to be kinda hard to see, but you can make out some of the people. I think it was DREAMSONG. The itto-ryu were all standing and you saw Anotsu in the center. To the right are Magatsu, and others who are too hard to define. To his left are what I think to be Higa, and, again, others who are too hard to define. Higa definietly earns a spot next to Anotsu seeing as how Manji can NOT keep up with him.Hyakurin and Shinriji have some parts. I never read the first volume, but there is a guy who knows Manji. I am not quite familiar with him. Anywho, this novel is pretty cool. there are a lot of fights, a really cool badguy, and a neat segment on weapons at the end. Great book! Get volume one first. Next is SECRETS if my memory serves me correct."},{"Title":"Blade of the Immortal: The Gathering part 2, Volume 9","review":"Readers please note that this review is specific to Part Two of the 'The Gathering.' [online store] has decided to treat the two volumes as if they were the same, which is unfortunate. While nothing written here really reveals and significant plot details that would hurt your enjoyment of the first volume, I do suggest you read my previous review first.Having managed to get over my confusion at finding myself directly in the middle of the action in the previous volume, I somehow expected that its sequel would be easier to manage. After all, I had done my homework and discovered what Hiroaki Samura's real story arcs were, and I had even stolen a few peeks at the first few manage. I allowed this to give me a sense of false confidence as I picked up this volume.What I was unprepared for was that fully on half of this volume is a detailed study of a fight between Manji and three opponents. This battle started in the previous volume and reaches genuinely heroic proportions as Manji is slowly chopped to bits. Apparently, this is standard operating procedure for the immortal samurai, who manages to survive injuries that would have made short work of a vampire. Since we know Manji will survive - the manga is his story - we are pushed right up to the point where all the hacking and slashing seems a bit funny.The story of Rin's own efforts to get to Kaga and seek vengeance for her father's death is far less violent. The swordswoman seeks the aid of an innkeeper and his wife, hoping that she may masquerade as a relative in order to pass through the control point between Edo and Kaga. She discovers that this will take more than simple subterfuge and must use all her resources of courage to make her way.While I cannot help but pick on a series of extraordinarily violent episodes, but the truth is that Samura's art remains at a consistently high level, regardless of subject matter. In addition, he displays a great depth of knowledge of 18th century Japan. I find the subtext of the competition between sword schools and the stratification of Japanese society eye opening, much more vivid than what the history books provide. While the story is uniquely Japanese in its telling it appeals to values of indomitable will and courage which are admirable anywhere. This continues to be a masterful series."},{"Title":"Blade of the Immortal: The Gathering part 2, Volume 9","review":"This is a collection of the blade of the immortal...get the books to find out what happened.

Being the country with the greatest number of higher-learning institutions in the world, the United States possesses a variety of schools that have been able to stand apart from one another due to their locations and/or school traditions.This book, which was published by Peterson's Guides, the same company that publishes the thick college guides many high school students use during their search for the right school, is interesting because it discusses the little-known facts that you definitely won't find in an admissions brochure. From most preppiest schools, to the origin of many schools' names, this book will fascinate alums all over the country and world. I discovered that my alma mater was voted one of the five most preppiest in the United States (I wasn't shocked). I also read where many famous celebrities attended school, what they studied and who were Rhodes scholars (actor/singer Kris Kristofferson was a Rhodes scholar while studying at Pomona College during the 1950's).If you are a person who loves interesting facts, then this book if the right choice for you.

Ironically, during that crucial time when Hitler's Germany, by breaking the existing Soviet-German Friendship Pact, overnight became Stalin's external enemy, the Soviet population, with the exception of Party members, openly became Stalin's internal enemy, an even greater threat. Markovna makes us understand why.It is a narrative that could be told only by one who lived it. Those who write history as a profession make an interesting distinction on this point: Markovna is seen as a \\"primary\\" historian - she lived it. Those who write of events at a later time, on a broader canvas, are considered \\"secondary\\" historians, often subconsciously perhaps influenced to a degree by the prevailing political correctness of their time. Not so the author of \\"Nina's Journey\\".I have read this fiercely courageous account of Markovna\\"s journey through her youth - a Slavic Christian girl, on the run from both her native despotic rulers and later from Stalin's Western Allies - and I was prompted to read it again after seeing Mr. Visser's review on this web site in which he states that \\"...Markovna's account is honest from her personal point of view... but she totally neglects the terrible, murderous and downright criminal behavior of the German occupiers elswhere in the Soviet Union during 1941-45\\". I strongly object to Mr. Visser's use of the word \\"totally\\", reminding him of Nina Markovna's heartrending pages which recount the tragic fate of her young Jewish friend, Maya.As for the rest of his critique, it actually works in Markovna's favor, making her account historically valid precisely because she does not presume to describe the fortunes and misfortunes of those in other parts of the Soviet Union, letting the recording historians who came later to do it, instead. She also, Visser admits, subconsciously perhaps recognizing the innate bravery of the author, chose to take \\"the loser's side\\". Nina Markovna openly acknowledges that while in theory the Germans were her bitter enemies, be it the high-ranking officer who helped her family to escape the concentration in Ohrdruf, or the ballet master who provided her with the necessary papers that helped her to avoid forced repatriation, or the farmer's wife, stuffing a bag with food for her starving family, their humane spirit lifted them above the constraints such theories put upon them.To read such a remarkably balanced account of the recent past, that is often presented slanted and one-sided, is as if a puzzle in disarray was reassembled into one coherent whole. The reader understands clearly why Nina doesn't run away from the German invaders; why the Cold War followed WWII, when our children were instructed to hide under their school desks during \\"drills\\". It was all because the leaders of the Free World had accepted Josef Stalin as their ally - this tyrant without conscience, whose diabolical nature Nina Markovna had experienced from her early youth. A reader of \\"Nina's Journey\\" cannot help but experience it as well."},{"Title":"Nina's Journey: A Memoir of Stalin's Russia & the Second World War","review":"Having never truly suffered, most Americans born in the post war years as I was can not really grasp the supreme tenacity of the human spirit. Nina's Journey opened my eyes to just how much suffering brings out the absolute best in some people, the demonic worst in others. Nina Markovna lived in the Soviet Union under Stalin, when &quot;comrade-citizens&quot; living in constant fear of nighttime purges commonly kept bundles of winter clothes ready year round in the event of imprisonment at short notice. Rampaging gangs of gulag orphans terrorize the towns, their status as children of enemies of the state condemning them to short brutal lives of homelessness and starvation. Nina records the arrival of the German Wehrmacht to Crimea in the early 1940's--instead of fighting them, the beleaguered citizens welcome them as liberators from their own cruel regime. When the Red Army gains the upper hand, Nina's family escapes to Germany as &quot;guest workers&quot; where at war's end, they must avoid repatriation to the Soviet Union at all costs. This book is filled with heart rending scenes of life lived at the ugly edges of endurance, where often the only thing between life and death is the intervention of a single good soul, whose refusal to give in to the hate of war is testimony to the power of love. This book gives witness to the fact that though one person might not be able to do everything, he can do something. And those small somethings saved not only lives, but souls."},{"Title":"Nina's Journey: A Memoir of Stalin's Russia & the Second World War","review":"This book is without a doubt the most breathtaking, exciting, epic, harrowing, (fill in the blank!) autobiography (or biography) I have ever read. I have loaned this out to at least five other people who have had the same reaction. Nina and her family had perhaps 30 adventures (within one great adventure) any of which would top the most memorable event in the average life today. Nina evades starvation, instant death, rape, murder, treachery, and more in the course of her late teenage years just before and during World War II. Her style of writing and convictions make you know that whatever she is writing about, no matter how unbelievable today, is completely true. Gone With The Wind is a trifle compared to her adventures.Epic Scenes: Wandering through the river of Russian prisoners captured by the Germans and actually finding her father. Her successful plan to avoid rape by the Russian Army. Her mother's desperate trek to get to work on time in the ice storm or risk imprisonment. Her family's voulunteering for slave labor in Germany to raise their standard of living. The happy ending at the American air base. Scores more.If this story were made into a movie, it would be the epic to end all epics. Since it tells what actually happened to her, it relates the good relations between the Russian people and the German Army relatively free of the SS influence in southern Russia. Compared to their life under Stalin, the German occupation of Odessa was a golden moment for the average Russian living there at that time--something that the populace paid for with their lives when the Red Army swept in again. By the time Nina loses her Jewish friends to the second, SS-led German invasion, genocide merges with the on-going sorrow of daily life of the Russian people as just something else to endure and survive.Nina's Journey is filled with details little understood by Americans today, but what remains is an epic struggle by on Russian girl to survive the upheaval and strife of the late 30's and early 40's. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Nina's Journey: A Memoir of Stalin's Russia & the Second World War","review":"I have never felt such emotion and drama while reading an autobiography .

The author fully captures the turmoil, upheaval, and often appalling atrocities of those years, but despite all that, one of the things that stood out most for me in this book was the way that, again and again, she and her family kept coming across kindnesses in the most unexpected places--showing that simple human decency can survive even under terrible conditions."},{"Title":"Nina's Journey: A Memoir of Stalin's Russia & the Second World War","review":"interesting book about growing up under Stalins regime.

This book gives you a real feel for what the times were like and the obstacles that people faced. This book is hard to put down."},{"Title":"Nina's Journey: A Memoir of Stalin's Russia & the Second World War","review":"This book shows the inhumanity of the Soviet system under Stalin, and also the complicity of the Truman administration and the Brittish in turning over to Stalin those long-suffering refugees from Communism to be murdered or imprisoned in the gulags. It is to our everlasting shame that our troops rounded up those who had escaped to freedom from the U.S.S.R. and sent them back to their doom. The story rings true, and Nina Markovna was a woman who suffered greatly during the war, but who, by the grace of God, was lucky enough to run into some decent people who helped her escape the clutches of Stalin."},{"Title":"Nina's Journey: A Memoir of Stalin's Russia & the Second World War","review":"This is an absolutely riveting and powerful story of survival during the savage period of StalinistRussia before and during World War II. In spite of the endless litany of human tragedy in thisstory, ultimately, the story is uplifting and triumphant as it describes the fierce devotion of onefamily to each other as they struggle to survive the depradations of both the German andRussian sides during the war. It is amazing how a cumulative string of small acts of kindnessfrom strangers at critical junctures combine to save Nina's family. Also, one has only to knowthe term besprizhorniks (the abandoned children of the victims of the Soviet Gulag) to discoverthe truest and simplest meaning of family values. Two minor criticisms: the author is obviouslymore favorable to the German side as opposed to the Russian side in this story- a lot of this wasno doubt because the German troops in the Crimea were relatively benign as opposed to thosein the Ukraine or Belorussia, where some truly evil and sadistic Nazi governors were put intopower. The other criticism is a wish that the ending were less abrupt, and that somehow theauthor provide some closure for the reader by going over what happened to the various people inthe story, especially her mother and brother. All in all, a great book, especially if you feel likeyou're under too much stress in this modern society. Read this book, and you will realize thatthere is almost nothing that you could possibly experience that would begin to compare with theevents described in Nina's Journey"},{"Title":"Flying with Chaucer,","review":"This little book carries James Norman Hall's thoughts about his \\"escape\\" from POW confinement in Germany at the end of WW1 and about one of his favorite books, Chaucer's \\"Tales\\".

So if you want the newer one, click on the new edition and enjoy yourself. However, if you already have the newer edition, you may still want to buy this edition. Why? Because the author replaced some of the trails in this edition when she revised the book for the newer edition.So, if you've hiked all the trails in the newer edition and are looking for other trails in Central Florida, buying this edition will tell you about the following trails: (The number is the chapter number for the trail in this edition.)5 Panasoffkee Outlet7 Perry Oldenburg Mitigation Park9 Gator Creek Reserve10 Tenoroc Fish Management Area14 Ocklawaha Prarie Restoration Area15 Emeralda Marsh Conservation Area20 Blue Spring State Park21 Rock Springs Run State Reserve23 Sabal Point Sanctuary28 Reedy Creek Swamp30 Weekiwachee Preserve31 Jay B.

Some of the trails may have changed since the book was published. (This is true of all trail books; they don't always age well.) Additionally, GPS units were far less prevalent when the book was published. This means that the maps may not be as accurate as the trail maps in newer books, and GPS coordinates for campsites and trail heads aren't provided.But if you're a Central Florida hiker and want some new (old) trails to hike, this book is recommended."},{"Title":"The Company Secretary's Desktop Guide","review":"The book has virtually been rendered helpless by the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and i believe teh author should have waited for that law to be passed before writing."},{"Title":"Innocent Betrayal (Zebra Splendor Historical Romances)","review":"Lady Emily desperately wanted to go to America to be with her brother Christopher, but her stuffy older brother Ian wouldn't hear of it, stating that she was too spoiled and coddled to make it in the wilderness of the New World. Finally, he agreed that if she could succeed as a maid in his household for three weeks, he would arrange for the trip.So it was that when his friend Noah Sandleton came to visit, he was introduced to Emily the maid. He had his reasons for suspecting that she was not what she seemed, but it came as quite a surprise that she was actually a gently-born lady and the sister of his friend!Unfortunately, by that time, he had already seduced her and was facing a very angry former friend who was insisting that he marry--then abandon--his compromised little sister.Emily knew only that her husband deserted her the night of their wedding. She had no idea that he regretted their separation just as much as she...nor that their lives were in danger from a malevolent force lurking in the background.It came as a surprise that this is the work of a brand new novelist, not only because of the marvelous writing, but also because there were hints of a previous story involving the older brother Ian and his wife, Augusta. If there is indeed a &quot;prequel&quot; or a sequel (perhaps involving the other brother), you can be sure I will be first in line!"},{"Title":"Innocent Betrayal (Zebra Splendor Historical Romances)","review":"Noah Sandleton's pockets have been picked and the youth he suspects is picking pockets will soon meet his match. When he drags the ne'er do well upstairs to confront the young man, he realizes his mistake: this is not a boy but a young woman, a beautiful woman who claims that she is not stealing but seeking a particular captain to obtain passage to America. Emily St. Simon has begged and pleaded with her brother to let her join their brother in America. She doesn't want to marry, and she is bored with the Season as well as life in England in general. Ian finally agrees to send her, on one condition--she must prove she could stand up to the rigors of the passage to America and her new life there. The proof he demands is that she must serve as a maid, in his household, for three weeks. Noah is startled to see the same beautiful girl, this time in a maid's uniform, at his best friend's house. Mary Campisi has written a story in this 41/2 star read that though enchanting and spellbinding was a bit confusing.

A woman was the victim of an imbroglio in the past and abandoned her daughter. This woman comes back and the daughter ignores her relation to her. She is brought back into societry by the daughter's husband who knows the truth but does not want his wife to know it. But there is some kind of malediction that flies over the heads of these women. The daughter nearly does the same mistake as her mother but she is saved by her mother who accepts to be tainted in her daughter's place. Bus Oscar Wilde must think there is some kind of reward for a good deed and all is well that ends well, and this play has a happy ending. In spite of all the melodramatic sentimentalese atmosphere, Oscar Wilde definitely explores in this play the great disadvantage of a woman in society. Men can do nearly all they want. Women are extremely limited and have to walk a very straight and narrow line. Oscar Wilde seems to be ahead of his time as for the fate of women: he seems to aspire for real equality for them, though he shows in all possible ways that this is impossible in his society.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan"},{"Title":"Lady Windermere's Fan","review":"My first experience reading Oscar Wilde... and certainly not my last.Wilde's sardonic wit and ineffable satire had me enchanted from page one. Wilde writes with devastatingly appealing witticisms, and with a style and cleverness matched by few other authors. It is said that he is one of the more oft-quoted authors in the English language, and I now understand why.In addition to axioms and aphorisms of pure genius, the plot both captivates and surprises the reader. Lady Windermere discovers that her husband has been cheating on her, and a folly of misunderstandings and poor advice then unfolds; all the while satirizing society."},{"Title":"Lady Windermere's Fan","review":"Women have a wonderful instinct about things. They can discover everything except the obvious. -- Oscar WildeThe plot is about Lady Winderemere who goes from being a pillar of Victorian society to a woman of wandering morals. The woman who pulls her up is the one she suspected of being her husband's mistress. It's a comedy of society manners and morals with acerbic repartees and funny quips, in the great Oscar Wilde tradition.Now, more than 100 years later, it still has a thought provoking depth which is very much applicable to today's society as well, although we view such adventures with less criticism and more understanding.A wonderful comedy with all the wryness of Wilde."},{"Title":"Lady Windermere's Fan","review":"I just wanted to say that i really love this play and that i highly suggest that everyone should read this funny and witty masterpiece.

It is a wonderful production however.I enjoy Victorian morays, and I really like that Oscar Wilde had a first-hand and satirical spin on the Victorian this play. If a reader enjoys the perspective of, lets say, Pride and Predjudice, they will enjoy the counter-point of the darker side of so much Victorian control.

The poems are among the best; the poets are each described in biographical paragraphs; each period has a short introduction; the development of most of the major genres is described in special sections. Both a title index and an author index allow cross-referencing. (The general arrangement is chronological by poet's year of birth.) *Cornerstone* magazine reviewer Curt Mortimer says, &quot;The poems in *A Sacrifice of Praise* are chosen irrespective of denominational tradition. On the other hand, they all touch on true Christianity. And how do we know that? Donne's words say it best, 'Though truth and falsehood be near twins, yet truth a little elder is; Be busy to seek her. Believe me this, He is not of none, nor worst, that seeks the best... doubt wisely; in a strange way to stand inquiring right, is not to stray; to sleep or run wrong is.'

This anthology is organized by historic period (\\"Early Victorian,\\" for ex) and then within each period the poems are grouped by poet, with a brief bio given for each.

The mystery centers around the disappearance of so many ex-wartime Liberty freighters in mid-ocean. Most of them were in ballast when they vanished, and it was assumed but never proven that shifting ballast caused the freighters to turn turtle and sink so rapidly that no message could be transmitted on the \`how' or \`why' of their plight.\`Leicester' was an ex-Liberty freighter fitted out in peace-time rig, newly under the command of Captain Hamish Lawson. He met his ship for the first time while she was taking ballast---\\"a sludge of sand and gravel dredged from the bottom of the [Thames]\\"---in preparation for a voyage to New York. Lawson had originally been scheduled to take command of another ex-Liberty freighter (called Sam-ships by the sailors, because they were built for the wartime Lend Lease program by \`Uncle Sam'), but the \`Samkey' had disappeared on route to Cuba. \\"'Leicester' was the twin sister to \`Samkey'; built in the same yards, to the identical design. The only difference was that she was younger by a year...\\"Captain Lawson's freighter was halfway between Ireland and Nova Scotia on the Great Circle route to New York when the first storm struck. \`Leicester' rolled more than her Master liked, but she weathered the gale easily enough. His main worry was the ship's malfunctioning radio, without which he couldn't receive weather reports or transmit his own position. The Atlantic was not a good place to be in the middle of the hurricane season, without a radio.Sure enough on the morning of September 14th, the crew of the \`Leicester' found themselves sailing under another threatening sky:\\"Lawson watched the ominous black arch [of the hurricane bar] for a quarter of an hour, and even during this short interval it seemed to grow, humping up from the horizon, spreading east and west. Above it, and around the hemisphere of sky, the high clouds were thickening, growing more opaque. A light, aimless breeze that seemed to come erratically from every point of the compass had begun to play about the ship. Lawson noticed that there were no gulls or other seabirds anywhere in sight.\\"The Sam-ship tried to dodge the hurricane, but it was much too late for such maneuvers. Within the hour, \`Leicester' found herself enmeshed in the roaring hell of \\"The Serpent's Coil.\\"Mowat certainly knows how to tell a suspenseful sea story! The rest of his book describes the travails of \`Leicester' as she founders but does not sink amidst the coils of the first hurricane. Her adventures afterward are entwined with those of the salvage and rescue tugs, \`Foundation Lillian' and \`Foundation Josephine,' plus another, even more savage hurricane that struck while the Sam-ship lay helplessly at what was supposed to be a safe mooring.\\"The Serpent's Coil\\" and its even more exciting companion, \\"Grey Seas Under\\" are gripping testaments to the daring and skill of Canada's master seamen.

It never gets old.It is the kind of macro/micro writing that I think Mowat does spectacularly well, now focused on the story of three ships -- two deep-sea rescue tugs and one Lend-Lease surplus freighter.A far-from-comprehensive list of things I learned from this book:* What the legs on oil-drilling platforms are called.* What kind of ballast you get from the Thames.* The effect fog used to have on radios.* What a Carley float is.* Why you can't just tie up to the ship you're towing.* How much list 60 degrees is.* How some hurricanes start.* What happens when your boiler explodes.* How big a pump you can move in a dory.* What it's like to fly a plane into a hurricane.* How much weather satellites have changes the world.* What the Great Circle Track is.* What the Beaufort scale is.And so much more. I can't get over how meticulous the research on this book is. The bit with the meterologists in Africa. The book that Sparky sets his soldering iron on. The thing is that Sparky (on the Leicester) died in the storm, so someone must have seen his cabin or inventoried his stuff? But it gives the whole book so much texture.And it's not just the battle to save one ship. I still laugh at the stories of the crewmen, the guy from Come-By-Chance who was planning to take back blackstrap rum and retire forever, or the crew getting \\"pirate fever\\" and flitting all over their salvaged boat.I think the reason this book and its companion are so repeatable for me is that I get dropped into a whole different world, and that world is as richly constructed as any of the most intricate science fiction books I read. It just happens to be history instead of make-believe.Read if: You enjoy a good story. You love books about boats. You have liked other Mowat.

The savage theft of land and resources, the wholesale murder of millions - this physical assault was accompanied by an ideological assault from which Africans are still trying to recover.In recent years, many of us have stepped up to challenge the backward, racist ideology that permeates much of what is written about African people, history and culture. Ayi Kwei Armah is one author who has taken on the task of reconstructuring out story. The body of work he has produced is just one example of how even creative outlets can be used to further our struggle for liberation.Armah's novel Two Thousand Seasons was first published in 1973 and was reprinted last year by Per Ankh, an African publishing cooperative based in Senegal. Its significance is profound for all Africans fighting to reclaim out stolen land and resources, primarily because it tells a story built upon the progressive theories of African revolutionaries such as Nkrumah, Garvey and Diop. Armah lays the foundation for this in the opening pages of the novel by asserting that \\"we are not a people of yesterday,\\" \\"that we black people are one people we know,\\" and that \\"[Africa] is ours, not through murder, nor through theft, not by violence or any other trickery. This has always been our land. Here we began.\\"Two Thousand Seasons is a fictionalized account of the attack on Africa that has taken place over the last 1,000 years. Using the collective voice of a particular group, it traces the overall development of African history as it has unfolded for countless millions of our people.Beginning in eastern Africa, the story follows a people as they encounter and are subjugated by Arabs, forcing them to migrate to the western part of the continent where they come up against the horrors of the slave trade. Ultimately, they enter into a campaign of resistance that continues even beyond the novel's end.History of Role of Women, Religion and Social EqualityA number of issues related to our current struggle to reclaim Africa are addressed in the book. Questions concerning women, religion, and social equality are dealt with, all within the context of a fierce struggle to resist foreign domination. These elements combine to form the novel's basic premise - that the liberation of a land and resources is a necessary first step in reclaiming a way of thinking and understanding the world that has been battered, corrupted and altered by foreign influence.Throughout the story, Armah propagates the legitimacy and appropriateness of a worldview that is intrinsically African. He simply calls this worldview \\"the way\\" or \\"our way.\\" \\"The way\\" is not a religion; in fact, the term religion is discarded in all descriptions of traditional African thought. The dialectic term \\"reciprocity\\" is used instead and is defined as \\"not merely taking, not merely offering. Giving, but only to those from whom we receive in equal measure. Receiving, but only from those we give in reciprocal measure. How easy, how just, the way.\\"This characterization draws a distinct line between the philosophical understanding that has existed between Africans since ancient times, and the relatively new religious doctrines that to this day contribute to our enslavement.These religious doctrines, which so easily lend themselves to oppression, are challenged early in the novel. \\"We are not stunted in spirit, we are not Christians that we should invent fables a child would laugh at and harden our eyes to preach them daylight and deep night as truth,\\" Armah says. We are not so warped in soul, we are not Arabs, we are not Muslims to fabricate a desert God chanting madness in the wilderness, and call out creature creator. That is not out way.\\"This indictment of Christian and Islamic religious musing is followed by an explanation or how Africans view the world, as well as our place in it. In delineating this worldview, Armah takes a stance that is arguable materialist. He states, \\" What we do not know, we do not claim to claim to know. WE have no need to claim to know. Many thoughts, growing with each generation, have come down to us, many wonderings. The best have left us thinking it is not necessary for the earth to have been created by any imagined being. We have thought it better to start from sure knowledge, call fable fables, and wait till clarity.The validity of a traditional African worldview is again asserted as Armah contrasts the structure of society prior to invasions with the societal transformations that is the result of foreign presence.At the start of Two Thousand Seasons, there is a general social equality, there is no ruler or king as such, and those given jurisdiction over the community (chiefs or \\"caretakers\\" as they are referred to by Armah) are accountable to the people. In addition, male/female equality is recognized, and women share in all tasks related to governing and maintaining society. This structure is overturned, however, when Africans come under Arab domination. For the first time, African women experience exploitation and oppression as they are forced to serve as sex slaves for decadent Arabs.Struggle Between those for Independence and Those Copying Imperialist WaysEven after Africans free themselves from Arab domination, effects of that experience linger and are manifest in the ways some of them want to restructure society.This creates a split among Africans. A struggle emerges between the \\"producers\\" (those who wish to return to the way) and the \\"parasites\\" (those who wish to emulate the ways of foreigners). Armah connects the urges of the latter to a misguided fascination with the power of white people. \\"They urged on us the setting up of a king from among the parasites to whom all - parasites, producers, women, children, in the condescension of the white destroyer's road - would be bound in unthinking, unquestioning allegiance. In such arrangements, the admirers saw the roots of the white predators' power.\\"Implications of the decision to abandon long-held notions of social equality are far reaching. Traditionally, gender equality was experienced in the larger context of general social equality. In other words, men weren't seen as superior to women just as no one is society was seen as superior to anyone else.However, as society is transformed and certain people are given power over others, the role of women is transformed and women are confined to roles of child bearers and homemakers. \\" In the suppression of women first, in the reduction of all females to things - things for pleasure, things for use, things in the hands of men. - these admirers of the white predator's road saw a potent source of strength for men\\"These societal changes eventually give rise to opportunism, form collaborator kings who, for their personal benefit, allow Europeans to set up an outpost of the slave trade, to \\"askaris\\" who make a living by aiding in the destruction of their own people.The point Armah makes in all this is that social inequality, the oppression and exploitation of women, allowing certain people to rule over everyone else - all of these things constitute a break from African tradition.Armah not only outlines how those breaks from tradition develop, creating a pathway for both the physical and ideological domination by foreign peoples. He also challenges the notion that African somehow welcomed enslavement by chronicling the movement for resistance.There has never been a time when Africans accepted oppression. In the book, every move made to dismantle African society is met with resistance. As the fight for freedom escalates, the movement assumes s more strategic and skillful character. Two thousand Seasons draws to a close with Africans I the midst of a fierce battle to counter the ravenous slave trade and to recruit more and more people who are wiling to make this struggle their life's work.Herein lies what is perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this novel. The story captured in the book begins way before the first page and continues far beyond the last. The book ends, yet the struggle being fought continues, as it will until all African peoples have freedom, power and self determination.First printed in The Burning Spear, Volume 22, Number 4, July - October 2001.

Armah's at his best when launching into poetical observation and instruction (e.g. the beginning of Chapter 7). His narrative flow gets a bit bogged down with the stylization, and that makes it drag from time to time.

This novel is in more ways an epic written in a unique style that borrows heavily from traditonal West African oral literature; it begins roughly around the 11th century ce when Caucasians (Arabs and half-caste Berbers) first began to make significant leeway in terms of converting Sahelian leaders to Islam. The novel follows the history of some of the Sahelian people who resisted Caucasation and went south into the forest belt in search of a new life.However, these people found themselves unable to escape Caucasian invasion by the end of the 15th century when Caucasians from Europe arrived on the coasts of Guinea.The novel is a story of the resistance of West African people to not only Caucasation in the religious and cultural sense which characterizes the Islamic cultural invasion but enslavement to Europeans and locals who responded to Caucasation by joining it and working with the foreign powers in hopes of gaining wealth and power. What makes this story so vital is the role African spirituality played in the lives of the heroes who fought against the predators, destroyers, and their local allies.It would be easy to dismiss this novel because of what may appear to be a strong negative depiction of Arabs/Berber and European interaction with West Africa. However, it is not written as much of a judgement call as it is just recording the historical reality of the impact of these foreigners and the well known interest of exploitation and enslavement that they had in West Africa. Armah does not exclude their local allies in the destruction of West Africa, in fact most of the confrontation between the resistence and Caucasation is towards the local allies of Caucasation.For those who do not appreciate didactic literature then this novel will be of no interest to you, but if one acknowledges the importance of such traditional literature then you will find Two Thousand Seasons to be a wonderfully original and indispensable treasure for future generations"},{"Title":"Two thousand seasons: A novel by Ayi Kwei Armah","review":"If you ever see a copy of this book, buy it.

I, for one, am in my third year in which he is the single author whom I read and review most frequently. He seemed to spin off a new literary genre every four or five years: the sea adventure tale, the wilderness/prairie adventure, the passenger vessel as microcosm of society, and on and on. He wrote five books about travel in Europe. Cooper also penned an early history of his beloved U.S. Navy and biographies of naval officers. He explained 19th Century Americans to Europeans and Europeans to Americans. He engaged in controversy, sometimes over such seemingly ephemeral issues as the anti-rent clashes in New York State and elsewhere. His literary output over a mere three decades was staggering. Yet he is popularly remembered for only one novel, THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS (1826). Or at most the other four stories of eccentric backwoodsman Natty Bumppo in THE LEATHERSTOCKING TALES.James Fenimore Cooper wrote sympathetically of American Indians when Andrew Jackson and others wanted nothing so much as to separate them from their ancestral lands and wealth and ship them westward across the Mississippi River along the Trail of Tears. He had his thoughts on social mores, religion, theology and, especially, the invisible hand of God in human affairs (much as did Abraham Lincoln in a famous fragment meditated on during the Civil War). Scholars have probed Cooper's emerging theories of human history: is it cyclical? Does it move forward in a straight line? Can its direction be foreseen, managed?In a 1949 literary biography, JAMES FENIMORE COOPER, James Grossman serenely and fairly succinctly surveys the six decades of Cooper's living upon this earth and tying that life tightly to the words it spun off. Most striking: Grossman shows Cooper as a man with deep thoughts who had trouble putting them into words. A representative passage:\\"Over the years, as Cooper's faith in his countrymen's virtue was dissipated, a faith in Providence took its place. He recognized the logical force of the doctrine that if human history is a department of Providence, man, while he has every right ot hope for the best, has none to predict what that unknown best will be. But it was a difficult doctrine for Cooper to adhere to strictly, for he had very positive views on the conduct of human affairs and at times uses religion chiefly as an additional sanction to enforce them\\" (Ch. IX).James Fenimore Cooper is a long, hard read. But I find him increasingly worth the effort.-OOO-"},{"Title":"Below Another Sky: A Mountain Adventure in Search of a Lost Father","review":"Because the &quot;Lost Father&quot; in the title of this book was a close friend and had, and continues to have, an enormous impact on my life, I picked up Rick's book with anticipation and some trepidation as well. Any fears were groundless.Rick has woven a marvelous fabric of adventure intertwined with a young woman's courageous journey into unknown parts of the world to search for the answers to questions she has asked her entire life. He binds the story with the thread of his own soul searching and past adventures, described in a straightforward, heartful manner.This book touched me deeply. And also entertained me. Rick is a great story-teller, using simple, matter-of-fact language to describe hair-raising, and even life-threatening situations.This is a book for lovers of adventure, for those in the middle of their lives, taking time to look back as well as forward, for those with unanswered questions in their lives, and for anyone with a father - known or unknown.I highly recommend this book"},{"Title":"Below Another Sky: A Mountain Adventure in Search of a Lost Father","review":"I had originally read the story of Rick and Asia's journey in Outside Magazine. I could not wait to pick up the book. I have to say, whether you are a fan of the outdoors or not, this is a book for everyone. It is a book about friendships, family, life and death. The playing field just happens to be in the Himalayan Range. Rick has done such a fantastic job of writing that you don't just read this book, you join them on their trek to find a father and friend."},{"Title":"Below Another Sky: A Mountain Adventure in Search of a Lost Father","review":"As a climber and lover of mountains, I have read many mountain adventure books. They provide an enjoyable vicarious pleasure, and occasionally even penetrate to a significant illumination of the mysteries of the human spirit that make the experience of hardship and danger in nature (be it mountains, desert, ocean, etc.) such a powerful lure for many. This book, while it had those elements, was something totally different.My wife lost her father when she was eight years old, also in the mountains. From there the stories diverge in many ways, but the central theme of trying to find, and restore into her life, the father who she never knew, made Asia the star of this book, and her gift in allowing such an intensely personal story to be shared by the world is simply extraordinary. From my own experience I felt I understood her quest and her reactions, and yet the literary grace of the book, along with the beautiful design of the trip itself, left me with a far better understanding of my own wife (and a whole lot of tears).This book is about the living, not the dead; and that is the real lesson at the end. Thank you Asia, and thank you Rick, for sharing it. It is a glorious gem."},{"Title":"Below Another Sky: A Mountain Adventure in Search of a Lost Father","review":"This is the recounting of a trip Rick Ridgeway made with Asia Wright through the Himalayas enroute to searching for her father's grave. Her father was Jonathon Wright, who was killed in an avalanche on Minya Konka when she was an infant. Throughout the journey he tells her of her father's life as well as of his own past as a mountaineer and adventurer. This was a difficult book for me to get through, and it was some time before I could pick it up without my hands shaking. I didn't think it would have such an emotional impact on me, and I'm bemused to think that Jonathon can still affect people when he's been dead for twenty years. We knew Jonathon, and I remember vividly the shock of returning from a trip and receiving a telegram saying he'd been killed. Certainly we were familiar with death's capaciousness, but it was a classic case of, \\"Why him, of all people? Where's the meaning in this?\\" It's a curious experience to read a book twenty years later where someone asks those questions about the same person, but we've all known someone who died too soon.They're difficult questions and Ridgeway does as credible a job of the philosophical answers as anyone can, with his acceptance of life and death, and change. However, his denouement at the end, that we should live each day as if it were our only one, felt flat. We've heard it before and it's been boiled done to a kitchen plaque clich&eacute; that I've always found irritating when it's not further explained. I don't think I'd plan on spending my only day on earth wondering if the roof should be redone this year or next and booking dental cleanings, as I'm doing today. My grudge with the clich&eacute; is that it seems to imply that we should regret whatever it is we've been doing up to now, rather than accepting that some days are simply going to be filled with the mundane details of living. It also holds an inherent suggestion that we should seek pleasure. But the kind of pleasure that makes life worth living is an elusive phantom and comes only after we've sought experience. Pain or regret may also result, regardless of our intentions. We have to embrace the experience regardless of outcome; if it's pleasurable, it's a bonus and we've earned it. Jonathon tried to focus on the experience rather than the goal or glory at the end, and I think that's what was meant in the book, but perhaps each of us sees it differently.But Jonathon's effect on people was the result of more than what he did, it was the result of his personality, and Jonathon simply being Jonathon. We all affect the people we contact each day. Whether it's for good or ill is up to us. Partly because of his own innate goodness and partly because of his efforts, Jonathon had a positive effect on the people who know him. The lesson I would take from his life is that we could all have a similar impact if we made the effort to be nice - and I apologize for the lackluster word, but there it is - nice. The circumstances in which I first met him was one where egos could become inflated, inflamed, or deflated in an instant, and the silly posturing and puffy tempers certainly were a contrast to Jonathon's calmness. It's an odd thing, given that I didn't know him that well and it's been a long time, but I am still influenced by him and try (not always successfully!) to behave in difficult situations as he would have. Our lives do indeed affect others.The book focuses on personalities, and that gives it a heart and poignancy which are often lacking in adventure stories. As for his journey with Asia Wright, it begins in Nepal, continues on to Mount Kailas, across the Chang Tang Plateau in Tibet, and ends at Asia's father's grave. The book is nicely-written and over-all the description is strong enough, although there were places where it lacked the vitality that would really bring an area to life for me. I will say (and this truly is surprising, since he recounts a fair number of disasters, not to mention numerous other assorted miseries) that Rick Ridgeway managed the impossible - he made mountain-climbing sound appealing even to me."},{"Title":"Below Another Sky: A Mountain Adventure in Search of a Lost Father","review":"I bought this book after reading Seven Summits which recounted Rick Ridgeway's involvement with Dick Bass's and Frank Well's attempt to be the first to bag the &quot;seven summits&quot;.This is a moving story of not only the loss of Rick Ridgeway's friend and climbing buddy in an avalanche in the himalayas where he also almost died but an account of his return voyage with the friend's twenty year old daughter to where the avalanche had occurred some 18 years before. It is a travel narrative, mountaineering book, great insights on Nepal and Tibet with interesting sidetrips through his memories, trips to Patagonia, being in a Panamanian jail when he was but twenty and what it taught him...etc. You have got to like this guy! A perfect read for the introspective armchair adventure traveller who loves Asia; which is the name of the twenty year old girl who finds her father's grave and her way in life on this trip."},{"Title":"Below Another Sky: A Mountain Adventure in Search of a Lost Father","review":"What a wonderful story this is! Rick Ridgeway writes and reflects with maturity and humility of his initial climb up Minya Konka in China's Sichuan province, the loss of his friend Jonathan in an avalanche during the climb and then his return to the mountain a decade and a half later with Jonathan's now-grown up daughter, China. I read this entire book in two long sittings and as with all great books hated to see it come to an end. The narrative, which weaves together earlier climbs and adventures, growing up and taking risks, along with the trek back to Nepal, Tibet and China is a spiritual as well as a geographical journey. Ridgeway has learned much from his incredible life -- about things that are of consequence and things that are not. His wisdom and common decency, his kindness and his loyalty to friends and to memories, and they way in which he imparts this to his friend's surviving daughter is inspiring and touching. I'll read this book again sometime soon and I'll think about it for a long long time because although it is a story that begins with tragedy and death and concludes with a visit to the site of that tragedy, it is at the same time a superb hymn to a life lived full and well and true."},{"Title":"Below Another Sky: A Mountain Adventure in Search of a Lost Father","review":"After reading Shadow of Kilimanjaro, I was interested in reading more by Ridgeway. The premise of Sky is for the author to accompany the daughter of a friend who died in his arms while climbing Minya Konka. It was to be a trip of discovery for the daughter, to learn about her father and understand what drove him to the mountains of the Himalayas. But I think the author spends more time trying to understand the decisions he's made over his own lifetime.Extremely well written, packed with accounts of the author's own near death adventure experiences, and full of personal introspection, I found it hard to put the book down once I started it. Not only a memoir and adventure book, but a book that makes the reader stop and think about the decisions they have made in their lives, and the consequences that result. Also makes you question what your true motivations in life are."},{"Title":"Below Another Sky: A Mountain Adventure in Search of a Lost Father","review":"Ridgeway is the best....I've been reading adventure non-fiction for a couple of years now and Rick Ridgeway has never let me down...His writing is complete...informative, emotional, and structured.

Excellent."},{"Title":"Below Another Sky: A Mountain Adventure in Search of a Lost Father","review":"this was my first time reading Rick Ridgeway's work. I found his story telling absolutely inspirational. I could not put the book down, in fact I have just ordered two more of his works. Whether you are into climbing mountains or not, this story is a wonderful adventure about a man and young woman who learn so much in their journey to find Jonathan's grave. The entire time I was reading I could feel Jonathan travelling along with both of them, gently steering them along."},{"Title":"Below Another Sky: A Mountain Adventure in Search of a Lost Father","review":"This book is a trek into memory and is one that is held together by two riveting and story-unifying scenes. It's scenes like these that keep the book still haunting my own memory two weeks after finishing it. The book, just like real life, is merely a cycle - a repetition of connected events.Both scenes involve the author's dead friend, Jonathan Wright, once a professional photographer and mountaineer who was tragically killed by an unpredicted avalanche.The author, Rick Ridgeway, is asked by Wright's daughter to take her back to the grave site of her father on the flanks of Minya Konka in &quot;wild Tibet.&quot; While hiking the well-worn trail to Tengbocke Monastery, Ridgeway describes himself identifying the white-capped river chat on the banks of the Dudh Kosi. He is perhaps a few hundred yards of Asia Wright, the dead climber's daughter. Ridgeway is suddenly reminded of doing the same identification some twenty years earlier when Jonathan came upon Ridgeway at the river's edge. Back then, they together thumbed through the bird book until they indentified it as the same one they were looking at. Now years later, in almost the exact same spot, Asia Wright comes up the trail, and seeing Ridgeway squatting next to the river, stoops and says, &quot;What are you looking at?&quot; Dizzying deja-vu.The second motif occurs at the end (don't read this if you don't want to know the surprise). Here, Ridgeway has found the grave site where twenty years before he had buried Jonathan after the fatal avalanche. He approaches the tumbled stones that still partially cover the body. He shifts a rock and sees the hair of his friend. Ridgeway reaches down and holds the strands between his fingers, rubbing them slowly and gently. Years before, Ridgeway had done the same right before Jonathan had died. Ridgeway held Jonathan in his arms. He remembers when he moved his fingers through his hair while Jonathan's lips changed color and suddenly his face paled and something &quot;went out of him,&quot; and he died.These scenes are lasting memories for Ridgeway. I connect with the author as he connects with his past. Below Another Sky is a touching account of an aging mountaineer with a rich heritage and valuable advice to those of us too timid to climb mountains and risk our lives."},{"Title":"Below Another Sky: A Mountain Adventure in Search of a Lost Father","review":"Wow! It was one of those books that I read a chapter every day and put it down just to savor it.

Later, Jonathans dauter, Asia, and Rick set out on their own trip to other mountains. I thought that this book was okay, but it wasn't all that great. I didn't like why he did not mention why he and Asia set off on their journey because that set me off track a little, although, I like hiking and climbing mountainous areas, so it was kind of interesting for me.

Like when she mentioned that his jumpsuit was black? WRONG. As every hardcore Myers fan should know, Michael's jumpsuit is navy blue. Not black(of course!) And the whole grunting, groaning, growling thing is a major flaw, because he was always silent and emotionless ever since he murdered his sister. And also, he wasn't as sneaky and silent as he was in the movies, it was almost like he was desperate to be seen. Besides that, this was a very good book with gruesome death scenes, good humor, and loads of action. I'm only 11, but trust me on this: This is the best in the three book series."},{"Title":"The Mad House (Halloween, Book 3)","review":"I really enjoyed this book better than the Scream Factory. I thought the setting was alot scarier and the death scenes were more elaborate and gory. There seemed to be too many main characters though. I have trouble sometimes keeping them straight.

JUST DON'T READ THIS WHEN YOU'RE ALL ALONE IN THE HOUSE."},{"Title":"The Mad House (Halloween, Book 3)","review":"i have to agree with some of the other reviews.i liked the book,in fact i bought all three.but micheal doesnt make noises and sounds, and he doesnt move like the way he is portrayed in the book.and wether you liked it or not,the family story line was the movies and in the book there is no real motive.i think this is a great horror book and i liked reading it,i am a halloween fan and it gave me my fix.just some minor details bugged me."},{"Title":"The Mad House (Halloween, Book 3)","review":"This is a good, well-crafted book. It is perfects for young teenagers and kids from 9 to 12. It has a good sense of scares, suspence, and all that, but there are some problems. For one, Michael growls a lot in the book (which never happens in the movies), and they talk about how he smells. This book also has the feeling of an R.L. Stine \\"Fear Street\\" novel. Other than that, it is a good read."},{"Title":"The Mad House (Halloween, Book 3)","review":"Halloween: The Mad House is the scariest book yet in Kelly O'Rourke's series based on the famed franchise. The creepiest suspense sequences, the grisliest deaths- it's plenty frightening all around. The author settles into the by-now familiar formula of teen soap opera meets horror thriller, but things pick up a lot sooner in this one and it's good enough to be adapted as a new sequel if Dimension decides to resurrect Michael Myers again."},{"Title":"The Mad House (Halloween, Book 3)","review":"I started reading the Halloween novels, three so far, which are based on the movies, I was amazed mainly because I have never read any of Kelly O'Rourke's books. The first and second were great, yet this one wasn't so great. Just like the movies! Halloween I and II were good, but the third wasn't so great. This story was a little too gruesome, especially with some guy getting killed by a shovel to the head, causing it to explode. I wasn't impressed, but I anticipate that more books are to come, maybe even better than The Scream Factory and Old Meyer's Place, which I highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Mad House (Halloween, Book 3)","review":"I really have enjoyed these novels and the Halloween comic books of the last few years. But it certainly must be noted that after Halloween 6,the continuity got quite muddled. H20 ignored parts 4-6 buit confusingly made references to part 4 and even acknowledged that Loomis had survived!?! The comics suggested that Michael was actually born on Halloween (HUH!?!, there was no birthday party going on at the beginning of part 1.) and had the events of H20 taking place in 2001. UGH!) These novels postulate that the first film happened in 1985. What a headache. Don't these people do research. At least they get the location of Haddenfield correct. (The Friday the Thirteenths cant make up their minds where Crystal Lake is. New York, New Jersey, Long Island, Connecticut, Vermont. It just moves around the map.)NO I dont remember Michael ever grunting or growling. His jumpsuit has changed colors a few times though. It was grey in Halloween 6.Nuff said the better.

It doesn't seem to have any continuity with the movies.I've noticed a lot of people complaining about the fact that Michael grunts in the Book, but not in the movies, but this is in fact not true, as any real Halloween fan would know.He grunts repeatedly in the first movie, when he is fighting with Laurie, just before she pulls his mask off. He grunts repeatedly in the second movie, when he is trying to stab Laurie, just after he gets shot in the Eyes. He grunts a few times and lets out a muffled &quot;Agh!&quot; in H20 when Laurie repeatedly stabs him (just before he falls of the balcony)........I wouldnt say he Groans much though! :o)This book is an obvious cash in, but it could be fun for &quot;Shape&quot; starved kids out there."},{"Title":"The Mad House (Halloween, Book 3)","review":"I thought the book was great. I don't agree with the growling or grunting. He dosn't do either in the movies. He is silent and he doesn't want to be seen.

This book turned out to be a tasty treat on both counts.The author promises word origins &amp; faithfully provides with every entry, along with a sketch rendering of the plant. But --though it pains me to admit it-- not EVERY plant is blessed with a thrill-packed tale of linguistic derivation, so Ms. Wells wisely digresses, peppering her descriptions with attributed stories of interesting events and rumors associated with each plant. The overall effect is a gossipy piece with enough hard information to keep most armchair &quot;researchers&quot; happy."},{"Title":"100 Flowers and How They Got Their Names","review":"This is a wonderful, charming book. Each section provides an interesting anecdotal essay about the flower it covers. However, do not expect completeness (of course, there are many more than 100 flowers out there, and more than could be said about each than is possible in a page or two).Also, don't look for consistent information about flower naming or morphology. Rather, these are very personal essays on each flower. The essays usually include some historical information that has to do with how the flower was named. At times, this format feel forced--I would have liked the author to be able to paint with a broader brush, as I sense she wanted to. And I also think that of the 100 flowers there are a few she doesn't really like that much.

Reading about flowers is better than weeding them.I found this book AFTER reading Diana Wells newer book, \\"Lives of the Trees: An Uncommon History\\". That book does to trees that 100 Flowers does to blooms. Each chapter (go ahead look at the list inside on this listing) offers information, a drawing and fun facts about the flower while not bogging the reader down with more than 2 or 3 pages. If you need more, there are other book. This book offers a FUN first look at what kinds of flowers may be growing in your backyard, and what you might want to add. The same treatment exists in Wells' book about trees and a third one, \\"100 Birds and How They Got Their Name.\\" I give them all 5-stars for FUN reading. Take them outside in nature, the perfect place to read them.These books are perfect for homeschool students and others doing basic research on trees, flowers, and birds.

If you, in your wildest dreams, have ever even once contemplated conducting, you will want to sincerely consider this book."},{"Title":"The Grammar of Conducting: A Comprehensive Guide to Baton Technique and Interpretation","review":"This is the standard conducting text for major music schools in America (for example, I use it at the music school I attend). It's a fantastic book, with many elaborate and descriptive drawings to help the student along. There are hundreds of examples and exercises to help learn all the techniques and there are several additional sections on rehearsal, conducting opera, choir, and band, score preperation suggestions, notes on styles of certain composers and conductors, and sections about bowed string parts."},{"Title":"The Grammar of Conducting: A Comprehensive Guide to Baton Technique and Interpretation","review":"This is a great book for study conducting. A lot of examples and tips. And all the diagrams for all the rythtym music patterns."},{"Title":"The Grammar of Conducting: A Comprehensive Guide to Baton Technique and Interpretation","review":"My conducting teacher said that this was the best book there is for learning how to conduct. I agree with him. The chapters are well organized and the language is simple."},{"Title":"The Grammar of Conducting: A Comprehensive Guide to Baton Technique and Interpretation","review":"When I was a conducting student in the USA I was largely taught from this book. I found it simplistic then and still feel the same. It is not in the same league as something like Gunther Schuller's The Complete Conductor, Prausnitz' Score and Podium, or the more recent Morgenstern No Vivaldi in the Garage."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"I DONT REMENBER HAVING READ A BOOK ABOUT U2 WITH SUCH INTEREST . ITS FULL OF EXCLUSIVES ANECDOTES , MEMORIES ,STORIES ABOUT THE BAND . AFTER READING THE BOOK YOU DONT THINK ABOUT U2 MEMBERS THE SAME WAY .THEY ARE JUST NORMAL GUYS , ITS ONLY WHAT SURROUNDER THEM THAT IS CRAZY ,OUTRAGEOUS , GLAMOUROUS ( ITS ONLY ROCK ROLL ) THAT BOOK REMINDS ME THE BP FALLON ONE:&quot;FARAWAY SO CLOSE &quot;"},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"This is truly a very well written description of U2, the people that surround them, and the lives they live. You truly feel like you are living with them in their lives and following them throughout their career. Bill Flanagan did an excellent job of remembering and writing all the experiences that he went through while traveling with U2. This is a funny, understanding, and heartwarming look into the lives of famous rock and roll stars. This book definetely helps you realize that rock and roll stars work hard and have lives as well. If you are a U2 fan, or not, this is truly the best book about them you could ever read. Your appreciation for the fast paced lives of U2 and other rock 'n' roll stars will definetely grow."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"Flanagan's book is an incredible journey through all three legs of U2's Zooropa world tour. He gives readers a clear view at the lives of the band members, both public and private."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"I think a this was a wonderful, how do you say it, it is a the besta one, you going to update it, because a I thinka you should, you a very good a writer sir. Lots a people should go and a read thisa book you see. Excuse mya English it isa not a very good you see."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"This amazingly insightful book is simply wonderful. It truly gives the reader an insight into the hearts and minds of U2. My only complaint is that it stops in 1993. Mr. Flannagan, it's 1999. Don't you think it is about time to write a follow-up?"},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"Bill Flanagan's At The End the world embodies everything that has to do with a rock tour. It is a true 'what you see is what you get' as you follow Bono and the boys for 4 years from the difficult production of Achtung Baby in Hansa studios in Germany, to the end of the provocative ZooTV tour. You get to meet the real band members face to face through the eyes of an actual U2 insider instead of some journalist hack."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"This book is truly great. It shows what an extremely diverse and dynamic band U2 is. I bought the book because I am a big U2 fan but after reading it I truly think anyone could enjoy it even if you've never heard one song by U2 because the book is about so much more than music. If you are a U2 fan this is something you definately have to read!!!"},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"This book gives a great overview of not only the music but also the band. It is engaging and fun to read. You learn interesting facts and get a back stage approach to the band. It is excellent and makes you want to keep reading it. The book is written from the perspective of a person who is in with band, not a third party who only knows second hand acounts and interviews. This book comes from first hand acounts from a man who expeirenced it all with the band. This is essential for any true U2 fan."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"This is far and away the very best book written on U2. Bill Flanagan is an immensely talented writer. At the End of the World will keep you up well into the night with it's vivid descriptions of life on the Zoo TV tour. If only all rock n roll books could be this orgasmic. Pure Heaven."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"Bill Flanagan was allowed to enter a world that few have ventured. This historical account of U2's Zoo Tour, as well as past events, makes the reader feel as if they were the only one ever to know the deep dark secrets of our favorite four Irish lads. The only thing U2 doesn't let Bill do is actually play on stage with them. Whether you like the group or not, the world events that take place during this period help grab the reader. It's hard to put it down."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"I bought this book in 1995, saw you can write reviews, and I thought so much of this book couldn't resist. It is one of 'the books' to read on this band. I have read it twice from cover to cover as I not only enjoyed getting to know the guys on a personal level (especially Bono who I totally respect) but it is really funny, why the media portrays U2 as a band that takes themselves so seriously I would not know, they are guys with such a balanced view of the world knowing when to laugh and when to cry. Bill's writing is infectious and like other good reviews I agree 'could not put it down' read it three days."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"Few books are cool enough to make me want to change careers. This book made me want to drop out of graduate school and become a U2 roadie. Seriously.Fresh from the &quot;Elevation&quot; Tour, I dove into this book to find out more about the fab four from Dublin. What a treat! This book was absolutely wonderful! Flanagan had un-restricted access to the band during the recording of &quot;Achtung, Baby!&quot; and the entire Zoo TV tour and his closeness with the band shows. While other U2 books focus primarily on the childhoods of the members or early years of the band (see Unforgettable Fire) or are barely more than a collection of sound-bytes from other interviews(see The Road to Pop) this book captures U2 in the middle of their Zoo-glory!After reading this book, I found myself listening to my old U2 CD's (and going out and buying CD's that I didn't already have!) with a whole new appreciation for the music. Now I listen for the bass contribution, the unique guitar parts, etc.. Knowing the stories behind the songs brings the music to a whole new level. (For those readers/listeners who don't already love &quot;Achtung, Baby!&quot;, this book will have you listening to it on a daily basis!)Flanagan has a remarkable,candid, easy-going writing style that makes this book impossible to put down. While it is a long book, I didn't want it to end! If the author is reading this, PLEASE, for the sake of U2 fans everywhere, write a follow-up! Other U2 books pale by comparison."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"I have read this book twice, and I am having to convince myself to study something else for a while! Flanagan starts with a revealing introduction - one I think some people skip in a flight of attention-deficit - outlining his belief in maintaining his view of the band as an outsider, (although it seems that the band and crew only highlight his journalistic status in times of stress -- otherwise he appears to be accepted in the circle of operatives). He often attributes philosophy and cynicsm to his &quot;characters,&quot; and uses a voice that allows you to feel like a fly on the wall. A real treat is the fact that you get to understand some of the cognitive workings behind the band's actions, you relate to the crew as well as the band members, and come out of it with historical knowledge of their two albums - Zooropa and Actung Baby. Not aggrandizing. Just eye-opening."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"Flanagan pulls the reader into the book immediately with an anecdote that involves Bono in his underwear, German reunification, &amp; angry homeowners. It only gets better from there. Rock n roll biographies are a dime a dozen, but this book belongs in a category all by itself, primarily because it's actually well-written--EXTREMELY well written! Whether you're a U2 fan or not, you'll have to appreciate Flanagan's ability to turn a phrase, vividly describe a scene, or just seemingly be in the right place at the right time to see something really incredible. You'll experience firsthand U2 in the studio, on the road, &amp; after hours. Flanagan had seemingly unlimited access to the band, resulting in a book so revealing, it's amazing U2 let it get out! If you're a U2 fan, this read will be a revelatory experience. If you're not, you'll probably find yourself down at the local record store buying U2 CDs before you've even finished reading"},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"This is a must have for any U2 fan. This book is not only very informative but funny too. Bill Flanagan gives a unique insiders view into the band from personal conversations and participation in backstage antics. The close relationships the band share with each other are very evident in this book. I was given the feeling of being a \\"fly on the wall\\" while reading - some of the situations the band find themselves in are at once both amazing and horrifying. Bill Flanagan was along for the ride for most of three years while the band toured and recorded in the studio. U2 At the End of the World is an accounting of his time spent with the band and is an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"If you are a true U2 fan this is the book for you! It is impossible to put it down, so much detail into their daily lives and ideas is so amazing. I have always respected U2's privacy and control over their lives, but like all fans, I have yearned to know them better, this book takes you in up close better than all the rest. Read this book first and see if you want to bother buying any others, I wish I had bought it first!"},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"A great and insightful book, well written...BUT! There are two things that annoy me slightly.1 There may be a few fabrications on his part. You see, the author does seem to brag a little; I make the funniest comments, Bono comes to me for advice - when would a top international rock star turn to the author of a book for advice? I think this is what the reviewer a couple below me was trying to get at.2 I also detected, intentional or not, a slight Anti-British undertone. I'm not talking about the sections about what little he knows about the Irish/English situation, I'm talking about the tone of the book as a whole. There are a few remarks that he should out for.That aside, a great and fascinating read. I'll still give it five stars, although it's a 4 1/2 really..."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"I bought this book when I was thirteen and knew little about U2. Although it is not a book full of things like Bono's middle name, it is a book full of interesting and intriguing stories. I have everything I find funny dog-eared--that's a lot of dog-ears! I highly recommend it to anyone-it gives good insight into the band's minds. I love the story of when U2 met Bill Clinton--definitely one of my favorite stories. If you like U2 and want to read about them--get this book!"},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"As advertised, U2 AT THE END OF THE WORLD begins with the recording of U2's Achtung Baby album in 1991 and covers every major event up until the preliminary recording for what would become The Passengers project in late 1994 (it's never actually named in the text, but there are descriptions of U2 collaborating with Brian Eno to produce soundtracks to movies that don't exist). However, given the author's long association with the band, stories pop up randomly of events dating back to the band's first tour of America through to the then-present day and includes some thoughts of the future. All in all, it's a very engrossing read.The story is told by Bill Flanagan, a music journalist who has been friends with the band since the early 1980s. U2 are famously protective of their image, and one gets the impression that the band was open to Flanagan's questions precisely because they hoped their friendship would put events in the best possible light. Indeed, Flanagan's relationship with the individual band members shines through. And while these gives the book a very intimate feeling, it doesn't prevent the journalist from looking askance as some of the more colorful activities of those years (Adam Clayton's brushes with the law and his problems with alcohol being the most obvious examples). The friendly feeling also allows the band to \\"answer the critics\\" in a way by addressing some of the more controversial/criticized of their activities (their support of Greenpeace and human rights groups, the overt Christianity present in the early albums, their position or lack thereof concerning the Northern Ireland situation, to name a few).The book also gets us inside some of the most ambitions projects that U2 engaged in. Namely, the ACHTUNG BABY and ZOOROPA albums and the massive spectacle that was the Zoo TV world tour. Bono was quite glib in television interviews at the time (\\"I don't know what Zoo TV is about, so it must be art.\\"), but to Flanagan the band members open up, explaining the influences and the philosophies behind the multimedia circus. Yes, some of it does indeed come off as pretentious, but I found it fascinating to see what was going on behind the scenes. The passages recounting the transmission of live images from war-torn Sarajevo to an audience expecting to see a rock'n'roll show are excellent at conveying what must have been a shocking and emotional event.And in addition to all that, U2 AT THE END OF THE WORLD is an excellent tour diary, recounting random anecdotes about life on the road and the various band members, roadies, management types and other characters. Given the band's high profile, it's not surprising that there are a lot of celebrity cameos. Frank Sinatra shows up (he and Bono recorded a duet of \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" during this time), as do Naomi Campbell, Lou Reed, Bill Clinton (both as Arkansas Governor and then again after his successful Presidential campaign), and, of course, long time pal of the band (and former Virgin Prune) Gavin Friday. Some of the stories are really really funny.This is a fun, yet insightful read. The fun anecdotes prevent the book from getting too heavy, and the deeper portions prevent the book from being too fluffy. It's a great combination of philosophical ruminations and pure entertainment (perhaps an inadvertent metaphor for the Zoo TV tour itself). It's written in an easy, conversational style which makes it easy to pick up and put down. In fact, I must have read a good quarter of the book just through random skimming before I settled in and started back at the beginning. Much recommended for the U2 fan, and I imagine even non-fans would get something out of it."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"1992 was an interesting year for re-examination of the media. Both U2's ZOO TV tour and the documentary \\"Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media\\" emerged during this time. I was lucky enough to see both in the same year, though as a high school sophomore in '92, I would have hardly thought to compare the two projects. I was engrossed in all things U2 from 1992 through '97, and afterwards thought them square, pompous and boring. On the other hand, \\"Manufacturing Consent\\" grew to effect my life more with each passing year. While Chomsky took a decidedly intellectual path in studying how media propaganda is effective in manipulating, I've come to see U2's ZOO TV as being an artistically challenging model for exposing the modern media mechanism, as well. What Bill Flanagan's book does is show just how earnest they were in making people think, making the whole industry seem fickle, and discovering new ways to get their own humanitarian issues across.This book is a fascinating ride through U2's personal journey, as they encounter people, places and political events that draw their attention at the dawn of the digital age. By the end of this book, I'd wished Flanagan had continued to write about U2 up through their \\"POP\\" album. It made a lot of sense that U2 would find the need to go anonymous with the Passengers project in '95. Even more interesting is the carnal/plastic reveling of \\"POP.\\" After having read this book, I recently went back and re-read all the lyrics to that album. While teetering on the edge of their faith throughout the ZOO TV era, on \\"POP,\\" U2 get as close to nihilism as one can before begging for meaning at the end of the album.This is essential reading for anyone interested in how the music of the 1990s developed. The general public burned out on U2 by the late '90s, and the youth moved on, making them more a band for the aging generations. But here is a reminder of a band at the top of their game, confounding their onlookers, not through gimmick, but through earnest soul-searching."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"This book was simply amazing! It is one of those books that you can't put down, some nights I would be up to 3:00am just reading it. It was the best book I have ever read. This book turned me from a U2 liker to a hardcore fan. Flanagan added his own brand of humor to add to the sheer madness of this book. I am never gonna look at another U2 book the same, it is the only book to bring you so close to the band. No other U2 book will deliver like this one has. A must read!"},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"This book helped make me a U2 fan by showing the human and entertaining side of a band that I previously thought was pious and took itself too seriously. There are plenty of laugh-out-loud anecdotes as well as interesting facts about this piece of U2's history. The only down side is that Flannagan is sometimes condescending to his target readers, the U2 fans. Otherwise, this book is almost a pure pleasure to read"},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"It is hard to go wrong when you are on the subject of Rocks biggest best and most facinating band. This book is great foe anyone who wonders what a rock and roll supergroup like U2 is all about.U2 is not your average band, with Bono's talented lyrics and the music ofThe Edge, Larry Mullen Jr, and Adam Clayton you can not go wrong."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"This book provides many unique insights into the lives of the members of U2. Current fans will enjoy an insider's view of the band as it was in the mid 90s. Those who miss the way U2 was in the early to mid 80s may find some comfort in learning that Bono's father appears to feel the same way. In the book's last chapter, Mr. Hewson shares a letter Bono wrote when he was young and idealistic. It's hard to imagine today's Bono writing of the music business that &quot;never before have so many lost and sorrowful people gathered in one place pretending they're having a good time.&quot; This letter alone will be worth the price of the book for many former fans, who will find it heartbreaking."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"Brought as a present for the wife she hasn't complained must be alright as she is a big U2 fan"},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"I am still, 14 years later, in awe of the Zoo TV Tours. I went to 3 shows, all in the US. 1 Zoo TV, and 2 Zoo TV Outside Broadcasts. WOW!!! I have great memeories of the shows, but then I found this book.This book takes you through 3 years of the bands life, making albums, touring, personal issues, struggles, high points, sinatra, losing sunglasses, the Zoo Plane, the only date one of the original band members didn't play at, attention The Edge got for singing \\"Numb\\". It has it all. WOWIf you enjoyed Zoo TV, love U2, or just want to see what life is like on the road for a megagroup, get this book."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"This is an excellent book - Bill Flanagan really did a great job. I literally felt like I was on tour with the band! Some of the stories are hysterical. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"An incredibly insightful journey around the world with the best rock band of my generation (I'm in my 30's now) and beyond. A definite must read for any U2 fan, or any fan of good literary prose in general."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"This book really a treat for the U2 fan.It gives an inside look to the band everything from Bono's antics in Tokyo to Naomi Campell it's all there."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"Simply put, this is the best book on U2 I have ever read! Excellent and a must have for all U2 fans!!! I have read quite a few books on U2, this one is simply the very best! At the end I wished Mr. Flanagan would publish a sequel for each U2 tour!!!"},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"I can't say enough good things about this book. It is a great read, and very humorous. The author provides great insight into the band, and even though this was written in the nineties, it is really not as dated as you would think. In fact, it is even more interesting now to read about all the things that happened 10 years ago or more and see how much of it is still relevant. Bill Flanagan wrote a great book and I think everyone should read it, you will not be sorry!!!! A must for any U2 fan!"},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"Not just a great book about music, not just a great book about the tour, not just a great book about the band! My only complaint is how the beginning of the book seems to bash Rattle And Hum, but otherwise, amazing. Reading this was like being in the Cameron Crowe film Almost Famous. I really do mean it when I say you don't even have to know who Bono is! But in all likelyhood if you're reading this, you probably are a fan of the greatest band in the world, so all I can say is, buy this book!"},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"I think this must be the best book about U2 that is out there. So much insight, so much humour... you just can't go wrong with it. Instead of reading a list on vital statistics and physical attributes of the band members, i.e. 'he was born on this day' and 'he is this tall'and 'he is dating/not dating this chick' (something I can find on EXTRA) I finally get to see the real people behind the Best Band in the World. I finally get to see what makes them tick. What a RIDE!!!! I wish I was there through it all along with Bill. Boy, was he ever a lucky guy.Even if you aren't a certifiable U2 fan, I think you would still enjoy this book; for its humour if nothing else.A wonderful read."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"If you are interested in knowing more about the personal lives of U2, this is NOT the book for you. However, if you are interested in understanding the thought process of the band members, get this book. Flanagan, who toured with the band for about four years for this book, has a fascinating way of diving into the world of U2 during the early 90's. His discussions with each band member on various occassions help to get the reader's mind going, continuing the discussion further. I could not put this book down. Flanagan's writing style invites the reader to share his journey around the world with the band. He is more than just a fan, he has been connected to the band nearly since their beginning. You will instantly be transported on a wild ride through various cultures and ideas."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"I agree with some sentiments about Flanagan using this book as a vehicle to almost display his intellect and his synergy with the band, I think he is quite in awe of the band and Bono in particular, having said that this is the only U2 book that provides this level of insight and personal connection with the band and the supporting people behind the group and through personal comment and annecdotal inferrence you get a good intimate insight into the band, and it follows a timline through Achtung Baby and through the Zoo TV tour that makes the book a very enjoyable read. I drop one star for the autobiographical nature of the book."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"As much as I wanted to savor this book, I just couldn't put it down! Bill's words flow so well together and he makes me laugh so much.......well the Lads are the funny ones! This was really a wonderful insight to the Zoo days!(yes, you may criticize that the whole truth of what really went on may not have been included, but remember that Everyone has a private side!) The book taught me a lot! It's been years since I've read it, but I'm ready to pick it up and read through it all over again!Like I said, it's a timeless classic.....well, for me anyway and I'm sure other u2 fans."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"Far more than a book for U2 fans, &quot;At the End of the World&quot; captures a moment in time through the prism of these popular artists. The Soviet Union is dismantled, the Berlin Wall has fallen, Europe is headed toward financial union, and the world has come together through CNN and global media: The very nature of &quot;popular&quot; is changing, and any engaged artist -- which U2 was -- will notice that fact and what it means to their work. Flanagan's prose fits U2's story well -- personal, but populist; idiosyncratic, yet broadly thoughtful. A heck of a good story of the &quot;Zooropa&quot; tour, and entertaining aesthetic journalism besides."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"I just finished reading this book for the third time since I bought it back in '96. It's been riveting every time. Flanagan (the man behind Musician magazine, the best music rag ever, and \\"Behind the Music,\\" the show that gave VH1 reason to exist) had unprecedented access to the band during one of the most important eras of its career. He is literally with one or more members of the band during every moment from the recording ofAchtung Babythrough the entirety of the Zoo TV tour, talking intimately and getting into trouble right along side of them. Right place, right time, right band, right writer.Not only does the book provide incredible insight into the inner workings of U2 and its support organization, Flanagan's observations are incredibly prescient, especially as I read this now, in 2010. The impact of new media, the power of technology to dismantle the aging record industry, the nature of the mega-tour, the possibilities and pitfalls of the EU... it's incredible how insightful and ahead of their time both U2 *and* Flanagan were. The book is not only a great document of a momentous moment in U2's history, it's a fascinating document of the '90s: Clinton's rise, the Bosnian war, the emergence of the Web, the fall of the Soviet Union, grunge, etc.This is not only the best book written about U2 by a very wide margin, it is honestly one of the best pieces of rock journalism I have ever read. Any dedicated U2 fan should have this andU2 by U2sitting on their shelf; ignore the rest of the chaff that's be published in order to make a buck off U2. I have a feeling I will be periodically re-reading this book until the day I die."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"An outstanding work of rock journalism. This is far from a starry-eyed fanboy tribute -- Flanagan is one of the most intellectually gifted rock critics out there, and here he turns his intellect on travel, music, pop culture, his own foibles, and, of course, U2 and their art.Flanagan, one of the first American journalists to champion U2, is a confidant of the band, but it doesn't stop him from critically appraising their work. The book starts with U2 taking the last flight into East Germany before reunification, and follows the band all the way through the writing of Achtung Baby, Zooropa, and the tour that surrounded the two albums. It's probably U2's most creatively active period, and it's our good fortune that a writer of Flanagan's calibre tagged along for the ride. A must-read if you're at all interested in U2."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"This is simply one of the best rock n' roll biographies I've ever read. It reads like a novel, not the usual dry biographical documentary. If you like U2, or if you just want to read a really good book with interesting characters, this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"This book is one of the few really great rock biographies. It does a great job of chronicling the band's past by giving a distilled view of their present, in both personal lives, internal processes, and musical career. All of that is the essence of the music of U2, and the legacy their music has created. Flanagan does them a great service in this bio, but also himself, for presenting them so well and staying out of the way. Well, mostly. His humor about touring with them is fairly expressive..."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"After reading this book, I felt like I really understood what was going on in their heads while writting Achtung Baby! and the music was better for it. I've read some of the more recent books about U2 and also about Bono and this tops them all. It's a day in the life, before 9/11 and before all that came after for them. If you love U2 like I love U2, read this book."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"I am enjoying reading this book about the best band of all time. It's a great insight to what goes on behind the scences, I will definitley be getting the new book out this September, U2 by U2, they ROCK! Awesome book!"},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"Even though this book is mainly about the Zooropa tour, this book also has strange and weird facts about life on the road and what it takes to be one of the biggest bands around in the 1990s. I enjoyed this book not only as a rare glimpse into the touring life of one of my favorite Rock Bands, but also as an interesting piece of non-fiction literature. Mr. Flanagan not only gives his readers an interesting view into U2's weird and strange trip around the world, he also gives readers a taste of each band members personality and how they all fit together as a group. And because Mr. Flanagan is someone that U2 trusts, we are given a more accurate view of their life while touring than what would have been shown to us if the author was not someone that U2 felt comfortable around. Not to mention the terrific pictures that are included in this book."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"U2 At The End Of The World is a fantastic book. The journalist Bill Flanagan followed U2 during the entire ZooTV Tour and provides a detailed and fascinating description of the creation and evolution of the biggest show on Earth."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"I had a great time reading this book -- it was an interesting look at life on the road, the music business, European politics! The point of view here is interesting and the writing smart. I just wish the book were more equally about all four band members (though I know Bono is his very own case study!) Even if you're not into biographies or rock music or both, this is a worthwhile read. I felt like I was on tour, too!"},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"In a previous review, I remarked on the heartbreaking contrast this book reveals between the young U2 and the U2 of the 90s. After absorbing &quot;All That You Can't Leave Behind&quot;, my heart was no longer broken. After I watched U2's live broadcast during halftime of Game 1 of the NBA Championship, my heart was brimming with joy. I agree with _Christianity Today_: &quot;[A] once-great band suddenly is great all over again&quot;."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"... about a great band. This book is well worth the money, and with over 500 pages, there's no shortage of stories. It appears Flanagan was well-liked and able to connect with the band frequently. If you read only one U2 book, read this one!"},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"This book really a treat for the U2 fan.It gives an inside look to the band everything from Bono's antics in Tokyo to Naomi Campell, it's all there."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"the best book i have read on the band absolutly amazing"},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"Although this is a book about U2, it's such a strange and fascinating tale that it should stand as a classic of rock-n-roll writing as well as the single essential volume for any U2 fan.The first thing that sets this book apart from the usual rock bio is that it doesn't focus on serving up facts about the band members. There's no &quot;born here, went to school here&quot; at the beginning; instead, we open with Bono, startled into crouching with a hand over his nakedness when a German family comes to reclaim the East Berlin house he's staying in just after the Wall falls. The rest of this tome continues in the same vein, conveying what the band members are like and how they live their rockstar lives by vividly recounting moment-to-moment experiences that the author lived through along with them.Bill Flanagan was granted unprecedented access to the band member's lives, and throughout the two years he spends touring with him, they treat him as a friend. He makes no pretense of impartiality but rather tells everything from his own point of view, which is much more genuine than any false distance would be and allows you to feel you're there with the band. The length of time and volume of material that result are made more manageable by the fact that Flanagan gives each chapter its own brief coherency, so they can easily be read separately as well as together (and indeed a couple of them were originally published as magazine articles in Musician).The real reward comes from following the band through to the end of their Zoo TV/Zooropa tour. There's a detachment from reality that Flanagan, the band members, and all the tour crew come to experience as they dedicate themselves to a roaming life, and it's gradually revealed as the band's experiences become more and more strange. Eventually, when you reach the near-insanity of Bono walking and talking and refusing to go to sleep in Japan, it makes a kind of strange sense. Along the way, Adam bottoms out, Edge does 'shrooms and falls in love, and Larry injects himself with bull's blood. It's all good stuff.If you're really into U2, it would be a crying shame for you to miss out on this book because you'll never understand the band so well any other way. If you've somehow stumbled upon this out of a general interest in rock-n-roll life, it's worth your time to use this book for an insider's view. And if you're looking for some fun nonfiction, it doesn't get any crazier than this."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"Bill Flanagan's &quot;U2 at the End of the World,&quot; is far more appropriately titled, &quot;U2 at the End of the Music Industry As We Know It.&quot; The book, which exhaustively charts the world-crossing tours Zoo TV and Zooropa, also functions as a historical document of the music industry on the cutting edge of a major technology surge. It forecasts the eventual rise of MP3s and deals with the copyright issues involved, and the pursuit of art, commerce, and technology, and explores where the worlds converge, and where they are still discordant. It is also a documentary of the craziness involved in tour life -- as Flanagan points out, most rock writers travel for a band with a week, then leave. It is a far far greater thing to spend two years jumping around the world with a band, to the point where tour life feel normal, and everything else is child's play. A book that deals not with the mundane day to day existence of U2's members (&quot;and then Larry came in and said wackily, 'It was the pizzaman after all!' Bono, Edge and Adam laughed at the silly drummer,&quot; etc.), but with the deeper issues of what the band is about, what music is, what the business is like, and what it means to attempt to be relevant and reinvent ones'self in the ever-changing face of music. A must-read."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"This is not a biography of facts about the band so if you're looking to find out how old Larry is, or how many kids Edge has, don't be buying this book. Bill Flanagan takes you into the minds of U2 but makes sure he passes their funny bones along the way.He has the amazing ability of adding his own witty and keen input while at the same time making it seem as if U2 are talking with you personally.By the end of the book, I was as exhausted and wrung out as if I had really just got back from the three year tour with the band. Though I read the book as a U2 fan, I would now gladly pick up anything else by Flanagan. His deceptively casual style will hook you from the first paragraph with a laugh and keep you up at four in the morning as you seek to discover &quot;the secret of the universe&quot; with Edge."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"I had always prided myself as being a u2 fan - I could sing their entire back catalog by heart, but I was aways a bit wary of reading any actual \\"books\\" on my fav band as they are often out of date by the time they (the books) hit the self and often show my beloved boys in an unkind light.I ordered this book on word of mouth and the fact that I am starved for any band info as it has almost been four years since their last masterpiece - I was not disapointed. Flanagan writes this journal of life during the Zoo TV tour as a journalist but also as a fan - the personalities of the members of u2 and their organization are brought to focus in a way that helps the reader identify with Bono, Edge, Larry, Adam, and Paul (if by chance you are wondering who Paul is - please read the book and become a true U2 fan of God's Sake!)True the events that are described in this book are over ten years old but it is an essential period of u2 and it sets the stage for the cohesive unit that the band has become - last seen during the band's most recent elevation tour.I read the entire book over two days and Flanagan has done something that I didn't think was possible for a die-hard u2 fan - I fell a bit more in love the members of the band for the separate men they are and for the band they form. Remember - \\"We're one, but we're not the same, we got to carry each other\\"Flanagan shows that u2 stand behind the sentiment in One. A true gift of a book - a must read"},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"I stalled reading the last few pages before today because I did not want the adventure and emotion-filled experience of this fascinating book to come to an end. But after reading the last page and closing the book, I had a grateful smile on my face; because then, I could start from the beginning, whenever I want the journey with U2 and the author, Bill Flanagan, to begin all over again.I REALLY enjoyed this book and I HIGHLY recommend it! A fellow U2 fan mentioned it to me -- being a wide-eyed and newly infatuated enthusiast. Now, I have been progressively addicted in finding out more about them.This book is a very good and comprehensive start for me. Flanagan's writing style is accessible, funny, entertaining, eloquent, moving, sincere and heartfelt, as he takes the reader up close and personal with the members of U2 (Bono, Edge, Larry, Adam), their affiliates, and the band's many many interesting encounters. Flanagan daringly took me in a journey with them at the end of the world, and I feel myself emerging with an amazing sense of wonder, awe, energy, humility, and profound appreciation.The book has given me a broad context of understanding U2; artistically, professionally, philosophically, and most of all, as human beings.The book was published 10 years ago, peppered with reflections of U2's prior first decade. Ten years after the book's publication, as U2 perform in the midst of their 2005 \\"Vertigo\\" tour, they both embody and outlive the legacy of the book's spirit.Find out and enjoy the ride!"},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"Rarely put-downable, Flanagan writes with a careful balance of of humor and seriousness that puts U2 in unparallelled company as rock's most thoughtful and interesting band. Flanagan benefits from covering them from the depths of the at times extremely tenuous Achtung Baby sessions in Berlin to standing once again at the top of Rock superstardom, reinvented, embracing of irony and cultivating a wholly new following. If you're like me and became a U2 die hard during this period but were a little too young to go out to concerts or see band members while in town on tour, this book will show you just what a remarkable period it was for them. Paul McGuiness's insights and vision for what was to come with respect to digital, downloadable music is almost prophetic, reading the book now in 2004. But U2 are at the center of a changing world in the early 90s with the fall of the Wall and the newness of the \\"New World Order\\" which they try to recognize and understand and the election of the first Democratic president in a dozen years in America. All the while, U2 remain 4 secondary school mates who take themselves MUCH less seriously than is commonly believed. ZOO TV still remains as one of the most dazzling, ambitious and provocative tours ever put on, all at at time where a band was desperately trying to find a new direction. But the cultural, political, musical discussions, events and meanderings are what make this work so rich, beyone typical band biographies. If you love U2 or merely just love Achtung Baby and Zoo TV, you will love this book."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"I'll keep it simple. I have over 25 U2 books in my collection. This is the best, and by far. This is not a book where you will find pictures. It's the inside story of the zoo tv tour. The difference with other books is that this one is not written by someone who only thinks he knows what he's talking about. When you read it, you can feel that you do get the real story, with many spicy details that an outsider would not know about... Very well written, with no pretentions or judgments. Just the real story, like a real fan loves it. Trust me on this one."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"Bill Flanagan is a GENIUS..... His writing style and flair for comedy and saying the right thing at the right time had me laughing out loud at numerous points in this book! This book is NOT for anyone who wants a Biography of the band or wants Trivia answers... it's an IN-depth Trip through 2 tours and the making of Zooropa and Achtung Baby by showing the human side to a band most people only see the Rock face of. The band and everyone that makes up U2 come alive in their journies and follies... This is a definite must read for any avid U2 fan...."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"i'm not a huge u2 fan, but i do listen to them some, have seen them on video, know their names & personalities etc..i think this book is great even for a casual listener like me. why? because this book is as ENTERTAINING as anything you can find. where else are you gonna hear about the Edge discovering the secret to the world while on magic mushrooms, or Bono leaving his body? my guess is this is as about a close a look at the band as you're gonna get. there's very outspoken accounts of what the band thinks of other celebrities, bono and the edge's marital problems, near-death encounters, etc. etc. but it also veers off into history (political and musical), what gives the band inspiration, just what it takes to pull off a u2 concert (a LOT!) very cool."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"I've never much been a fan of rock biography... until this book by Bill Flanagan. The book contains amazing insight on the characters of U2 and their organization that keeps them in the studio and on the road. The book shares a very human perspective on what it is like to be a powerful superstar, while reminding us that U2 are still people that can get cuts and bruises. Filled with band members' philosophy on life and music and engaging stories that take you from a Greenpeace voyage to protest nuclear waste to Hitlers Olympic Stadium to the confines of their semi-hidden studio in Dublin where the music is made, the world of U2 is explored on a very personal level. Bill is a fantastically fun writer who has a heck of a lot of wit himself, even when among some of the most ambitious of all musicians ever. &quot;At the End of the World&quot; is a trip, and its well worth taking."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"Quite simply this is the definitive book of the history of U2 in the 90s"},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"Rabid U2 bias aside, Mr. Flanagan has written a book of ambitious scope, from God, to Bono as Devil/Macphisto; and carried it off. Why is U2 no longer the Biggest Band In The World? Flanagan will explain. The sheer effort of a 2-year world tour, whether you are Plant, Page or Pink Floyd, is explained. Along the way, you will meet supermodels and supergroups, and each has an interesting anecdote. Mr. Flanagan covers musical influences as diverse as Raymond Carver and Daniel J. Boorstin. (Atheneum: 1961; The Image) A finer insight into hard-working artistry, and the snoop-and-poop on the music industry could not be written."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"thisbook is perfect if you want to know everyting about U2I really love it !"},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"This is one of the most well-written biographies that I have read. Mr. Flanagan covers every aspect of U2, mixing the present with the past and the anticipated future of the band. As an avid reader of various non-fiction subjects, I have to say that this kind of a biography was a first for me. You wouldn't think that a book about a band would have any transferrable application for non-musicians, however I found that these guys are fairly down-to-earth. Reading U2: At the end of the world helped me to dispell some of the superstar myths that I had. That being said, I feel compelled to put a disclaimer about some of the language. While, it didn't seem to bother me, I would have to give this an \\"R\\" rating, as far as language is concerned. It's not as if the f-bomb appears on every other page...maybe once or twice a chapter.

It's about Bill Flanagan and how he fits into U2's world during Zoo TV/Outside Broadcast/Zooropa. Yawn....zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"I would like to read a book about U2 written by an author who doesn't think they're God's gift to this earth. I like the music of U2, but it has always puzzled me why they have the reputation of possessing more strength, character, and integrity than than any other rock band. I know they started out as devout Christians and do charity work; maybe that's why. At any rate, although Larry Mullen and the Edge come across as rather stable human beings, Bono and Adam Clayton seem as silly and irresponsible as any other rock star. Schmoozing with supermodels, doing duets with Frank Sinatra...bleah! At one point Bono bizarrely sends a 357 magnum to Wynona Ryder (described as a &quot;friend&quot; of the band) for her birthday with a note saying &quot;You made my day&quot;. He also complains about the media making his &quot;flirting&quot; with Christy Turlington out to be an affair. Is he that naive to think that he can hang out with models and not look like he's cheating on his wife? The author refers to U2 as &quot;our heroes&quot;. U2 aren't heroes; they are a talented rock band. I would like to read a book that portrays them objectively, and not from a fan's point of view."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"I bought this book in 1995, saw you can write reviews, and I thought so much of this book couldn't resist. It is one of 'the books' to read on this band. I have read it twice from cover to cover as I not only enjoyed getting to know the guys on a personal level (especially Bono who I totally respect) but it is really funny, why the media portrays U2 as a band that takes themselves so seriously I would not know, they are guys with such a balanced view of the world knowing when to laugh and when to cry. Bill's writing is infectious and like other good reviews I agree 'could not put it down' read it in three days."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"I LOVE THIS BOOK!Everyone who knows me knows what a U2 nut I am. With that knowledge, my friend Erica lent me this book. She didn't get it back for over a year!(note: I have since purchased my own copy.)If you are a U2 nut, or even if you're not and you just wonder what it's like to be a huge rock star, &quot;U2 at the End of the World&quot; is a book that is on your required reading list. Bill Flanagan spent 2 years with U2 on the Zoo TV and Zooropa tours, and through his writing, he makes you feel like you were there every step of the way.Nothing is held back. You see light moments during the great concerts, at the Grammy's, on the airplane when Adam and Naomi Campbell hook up, when Bono steals a boat. You also are there for the dark times in Sydney and the live broadcasts from Sarajevo. But always, you see the humanity of Adam, Bono, Larry and The Edge, and whether you like U2 or not, you can relate to the guys on a human level.The bottom line? Required reading for U2 fans; strongly, strongly recommended for everyone else."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"i bought this book in 1997 and i have read it many times. the book gives an insight into U2 that no one else has managed to do. filled with entertaing stories about their exploits on the zoo tv tour and the lives of the band members, it shows you that our heroes are just normal people who work hard and have their own lives. my only real annoyance is when is the next one coming out, Bill ? i think i have to buy another copy now, because the book has been worn out by me reading it !"},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"Bill Flanagan has written a book which differs from many other &quot;rockumentary&quot; books. The reader is introduced to U2 at their very personal selfs. The book evolves around various problems with drinking, girls and ordinary tour problems. Flanagan is brought along pretty much to anything the guys in the band are doing and he has put it down on print. The reader gets the feeling that they are not four gods on a stage, but four normal persons with extraordinary lives. It is by far the best book about U2 I've read so far. Buy it, you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"LIKE NO OTHER BOOKS ABOUT U2, AT THE END OF THE WORLD CARRIES YOU ON A WORLD WIDE TRIP THROUGH CITIES, LIVES AND STATE OF MINDS YOU'VE NEVER DREAMED OF.

FLANAGAN CARRIES YOU THROUGH A WHIRLWIND OF CONCERTS, GOINGS ON BACKSTAGE AND BAR PHILOSOPHIES. THROUGH THIS BOOK YOU REALIZE THAT U2 ARE MUSICIANS AND NOT THE PRETENTIOUS DEMI-GODS THE PUBLIC BELIEVE THEM TO BE.

Now I own all of them except one I believe. I got interested in U2 because of all the humanitarian work that Bono and the others have done throughout their career especially the work with D.A.T.A.I bought this book to learn more about the band and Bono because I have to give an oral report in class on some one or some band in the history of Rock and Roll. We have to talk about their lyrics, staging, political and religious outlook, who influenced them musically, and more and I thought what better way than to read books and listen to everything I can get my hands on and also watch a DVD of some of their concerts.This book is wonderful. I have barelly put it down since I got it Saturday. I find myself finding out a lot of information not only on the band and its members but also on other musicians that have influenced them like The Beatles and Bob Dylan and others.There have been so many times I have laughed out loud reading it as well. Bill Flanagan paints a wonderful and life like image of the stories he is sharing that makes it easy for the reader to visualize.I recommened it to anyone especially in a Rock-n-Roll class or anyone wanting to now more about the history of the band."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"Bill did an excellent job with this book. However, it is NOT the source of answers for a person who wants a systematic explanation of the world's greatest rock band. It is written more like a prose documentary than a biography, which makes it very enthralling.If you are just a casual fan with ADD who wants some questions answered...this is not an easy read. However, if you really want an intimate look at the band...this is your source. This will be THE book that scholars and fans in the future will be reading years and years from now, especially in regard to the Zoo TV and Zooropa tours.Flanagan is obviously extrememly well-learned and versed in many areas of academia and entertainment. The man knows his stuff. Enjoy his witty, lengthy, and definitive work on the world's greatest Rock band!"},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"Following the rise of the band, which seems from inception to have been intentionally interwoven with international politics, Flanagan shows us the motivation and vision of the group. It is strikingly different from your typical Behind the Music rockumentary. Contrary to the cover's description, quoted from the Boston Globe, \\"A wild ride,\\" it doesn't reek of sex, drugs, and rock and roll. It's interesting and curious, but the extravagancies are more along the lines of the band's brushes with greatness (meeting with Bill Clinton), rather than the band's parties. There is enough there to offend the pious Christian groupie (band members bet on the color of a woman's underwear), but the expletives are few and far between. There is drinking, but it's not glorified. This is not a book for teenagers. Opening at the fall of the Berlin wall, this is a book for those interested in U2's opinions.I suspect it's selling better this year than it did when it was released, given Bono's nomination for the Nobel Prize and award of Time's man of the year.Also notably subtle is the band's religiosity. It's definitely there. There are even allusions which would go over the head of the average Rolling Stone reader, as when it asserts that U2 has gone from Psalms to Ecclesiastes, dressing as the devil to chastise political leaders. But it's not overt. Bono at one point says that there are times when they have to draw their fish in the sand, and if people don't respond to it, they don't push it.Flanagan is after a universal spirituality that is concerned with a cause more than a crusade. Perhaps the book will serve as an example for Christians whose primary goal was to spread the Christian faith without necessarily inviting anyone to church.The sad downside of the book is ironically captured in the band's stage show. TV's spread across the stage remind the audience that they, we, are a culture that sees ourselves on the screen. U2 is no more immune to it than the rest of us. Although, obviously, it is their biography, there seems to be a twin glorification going on here. Flanagan may not admire the band as much as they seem to admire themselves. They seem caught in their own glow, and you wonder at times if they are as equally interested in their causes as their image of being someone with a cause. Perhaps it is all sincere, but then, Christians taking bets on women's [...] are hard to take seriously.In the end, a definite must read for the fans, but little real literary merit to the book."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"Fairly acurit Including the snippets of interviews and insights into the going ons of a tour and what goes into the prep of such an endevour.Easy and informative reading for a fan and follower of these mates and others involved."},{"Title":"U2: At the End of the World","review":"This book is phenomenal.

However, an unsigned note shakes Diana up as the letter claims Roxby has a mistress and &quot;loves you not.&quot; As Diana's doubts mount, she meets an enigmatic stranger. To her shock she finds herself attracted to the man in spite of her efforts to keep even her thoughts faithful.War hero James Durham is recovering from some nasty injuries he obtained while saving the lives of a naval crew. He enjoys the outspoken competency and competitiveness of Diana. Those same qualities that James finds so endearing simply drive Roxby to ire as he expects his future spouse to meekly obey his every word. As a matchmaking cat keeps pushing Diana towards James, they fall in love. However, there remains the matter of Roxby and their engagement.STARBRIGHT, the sequel to STARLIGHT, is an entertaining Georgian romance. The story line is fast-paced, filled with twisting intrigue, and loaded with engaging charcaters. Although Diana's reaction to the memo seems a stretch at first, readers will soon understand that the note allows her marital doubts to gel, ultimately adding depth to the cast. Miranda Jarrett continues to provide some of the best historical romances on the market.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Fortunes of Falstaff","review":"For my money this is one of the best books of Shakesperean study that I have read.

In Lynne Cravath's colorful illustration, swirling images pour from Crowboy as he lies awake, scared and worried. What can one young boy do to face the imagined onslaught? Like so many kids, he takes on a new persona, a protective, \\"tough\\" image:\\"So when Crowboy woke up, he decided to become a snake. Not just any old snake-a mean old rattle snake with very sharp teeth. He crawled downstairs to eat breakfast in one smooth slither.\\"Cravath draws him as a snake--a fearsome snake with big eyes and a long red tongue. On the bus, the snake scares the kids by wrapping himself around their legs (in a nice touch, the words wrap around the page too). It turns out that this isn't an entirely successful coping style, for some of the kids scream and try to kick him. But the boy rationalizes this away: \\"Crowboy didn't mind. Snakes are used to kicks and screams.\\"This is one scared boy heading for trouble, even if he thinks his snakedom makes him a safe outcast. He won't sing, and he pretends to bite some potential friends. However, when one disarming girl with big eyes and a kind heart befriends him, shows that she's not afraid, and even accepts his snake status (in a great picture that combines weird, \\"ugly,\\" yet friendly images, Cravath shows the bagful of oddly shaped worms and insects that the girl brought for Crowboy's lunch!). Though Crowboy rejects the rattlesnake lunch, he accepts her offer of friendship-and he sheds his snakeskin. They agree that they'll be snakes together, although the last page shows them as boy and girl happily climbing a play structure.Although the girl is too idealized, and the resolution too quick, this books shows (rather than lectures) how kids adopt different fronts to hide their real feelings. I liked the example of a girl and boy befriending each other, and the girl's implicit understanding and acceptance. While the story is thin, and fairly one-dimensional, Cravath's imaginative pictures and convincing use of local color highlight the book. The book jacket explains some of this apparent authenticity: Lynn Cravath lived five years on the White Mountain Apache Indian reservation, and she now resides in Phoenix."},{"Title":"Soulcollage: An Intuitive Collage Process for Individuals and Groups","review":"This entire book has a single great idea--the use of collage as a potent personal growth tool.The author describes a college process leading up to the creation of a personal deck of cards consisting of four categories:--Committee (aspects of the self, such as Inner Critic, Good Little Girl, Drama Queen, you name it--Community (persons of significance in the life of the persons making the card, whether personal friends or persons of inspiration from history)--Companion (totemic figures representing chakra forces); and--Council (archetypical figures such as Death, the Warrior, and other larger forces in one's life).The process of collecting images to assemble the cards, and working with the cards after making with them in a divinatory or reflective way, provides a way to access one's own inner wisdom while bypassing the verbal part of one's mind. Because the cards are assembled from images that have personal resonance, the deck can have an impact that no purchased tarot cards ever could.A very interesting way of making powerful personal art of especial interest to those who have no technical training in art."},{"Title":"Soulcollage: An Intuitive Collage Process for Individuals and Groups","review":"I had to have this book. I have checked it out from the library, until I can check it out no more! Making soulcards is something that I would use with myself, my children, as well as my spiritual direction clients. It offers a way to reveal one's self that no other divination tool, spiritual tool, or self discovery tool can match. It is a lifelong process that is sure to be of benefit to anyone that tries it. Using the artistic/visual technique of soul cards, it bypasses the rational left brain to get at what we are really thinking, feeling, intuiting, etc.. We can't choke the flow with this tool! It is a meditative, creative process that can be done in groups or alone. I could see myself using this with a women's empowerment group, spiritual group, or for children.

This book, this SoulCollage process, is one of them.I spontaneously discovered SoulCollage in early 2004, when I stumbled upon an introductory workshop (a great way to start, if you can access a group). Within months, SoulCollage became invaluable in helping me process life events that were unexpected and challenging, for which no other form of support proved adequate. The beauty of expressing myself through the images of others, then the writing evoked by my collage of images, started the process of \\"retrieving\\" all the parts of myself that I had buried, given away, repressed, or allowed to be suppressed throughout my life.Seena Frost is a tender, lovely woman, both as an individual and the creator of this powerful, popular SoulCollage process.

Each page seemed like an adventure into a familiar yet undiscovered land of the Soul. Seena presents a captivating, easy to read and understand process for finding the lost voices of our deepest wisdom.I have used a therapeutic process with my psychotherapy clients to find their inner wisdom, but this fool proof method gives a physical reality - the SoulCollage card - to the often-muffled voices that live within everyone.When I introduce the SoulCollage process to clients, and they consult the card, their answers seem to come more quickly. Resolution to what seemed unsolvable dilemmas come forward. Aliveness returns. I have used my own cards with similar results. I am looking forward to trying it with my group-therapy clients.Her book inspires, awakens and thrills me. I recommend it to any one who wants to get to know themselves more deeply, and at the same time connect with others. Because ultimately, while her method helps us reach inside, it also helps us reach out to our loved ones, and the wider community of Souls and archetypes to which we are intimately linked.I highly recommend this book to therapists, artists, spiritual seekers and anyone who wants to enjoy the thrill of insight and awakening. It is on my top 10 lifetime favorite books, along with \\"Loving What Is\\" by Byron Katie. Simple tools anyone can use.

I'd sensed my collages had hidden meanings, so I knew immediately the book was meant for me! I've now owned the book for several years and have created a wonderful card deck with personal meaning. I often use it to help answer life's questions. Through SoulCollage I've met new friends and also assisted old friends in making their own cards.

There is nothing like trying on a new technique, a new tool, a new way to get even deeper with my spiritual and personal growth. Seena Frost is really onto something here with her SoulCollage process.I also really appreciate her tone and approach: she is not heavy handed as she guides, she is open and flexible and at the same time, speaks with an air of authority that asks the reader to listen and respect her wisdom.I was also pleased at the respect given across belief systems: a very pragmatic, creative, soulful approach.I have several ideas percolating as far as application of the process....

You will be, too, after you read it and try it out."},{"Title":"Soulcollage: An Intuitive Collage Process for Individuals and Groups","review":"From the first moment I saw Seena Frost's book, SoulCollage, I knew I had to have it. First I looked at all the pictures. I was fascinated by the intimate, honest, personal collaged cards shown there. It took me a long time to actually read about the SoulCollage technique described. I think this is the kind of book you get ready for in stages.I wanted to try making cards-the book has a chapter on technique which clearly describes the process of making cards-but first I needed to understand the purpose and structure. Seena has included that in language that is non-technical even though she is a Jungian therapist. Knowing how she developed this process added to my readiness to try it myself.A SoulCollage \\"deck\\" is divided into suits which correspond to parts of one's personality (Committee), members of one's \\"tribe\\" (Community), transpersonal guides (Council) and different energy centers in the body (Companion). There are clear descriptions and lots of examples of each suit in the book. Seena also includes situations in which SoulCollage cards can provide guidance, again with clear examples.One can easily make great cards using this book as a guide. I eventually joined a group and found that way of working very satisfying. There are more and more classes offered by SoulCollage facilitators, and these can add to your enjoyment of SoulCollage. However you can get everything you need to work on your own from the book.I highly recommend SoulCollage for anyone interested in self-development. If you are already an artist, you will find a fun, new way of using your talent for self-understanding and expression. If you have not done much art work before, SoulCollage offers an incredibly easy way to create a beautiful, meaningful piece of personal art."},{"Title":"Soulcollage: An Intuitive Collage Process for Individuals and Groups","review":"If you want a way to get in touch with your inner wisdom and to access that level on which we're all connected, get this book and if you can, find a workshop/group in your area.

I had, however, seen some of the colorful images online and wanted to learn more about the process of creating SoulCollage cards. As a counselor/artist, I was expecting bright, vibrant examples throughout, as in most art technique books, but this one seems washed out. Of the 154 pages, there are 6 pages in the middle (8 sides) that are photographed in color, and even they seem muted and detail a bit off. The rest are black & white. It just isn't visually appealing, and though I'm going to keep it for now, I don't think it will ever be a favorite or one I'll reach for often.The chapters are laid out logically, with in-depth explanations of the significance of the Chakras in creating the SoulCollage deck, so if the info is more important to you than examples, then you may love this book.

He begins with the establishment of the British Army in the mid-17th Century to counter and check the French Army in Canada. He explores the British Army strategy about the French and Indian War and also tells about the everyday life of the enlisted men and officers stationed throughout the American Colonies and British strongholds in the Caribbean. He explains the British Army point of view leading up to the Revolutionary War and how it effected the average British Soldier. I am interested in the viewpoints of the \\"enemy\\" fighting the American Army in the Revolution and Hargreaves did not disappoint.

How do we deal with the reality of what human beings are? Anyone who has ever put these and similar questions will read the book by Robert Ardrey with great interest.People are both biological and social beings, and these two natures are ineradicable in them. While human social life has become the subject of studies in the social sciences, human biology has become, to great degree, exclusively the subject of medicine. R.Ardrey's aim was to draw a bridge over the &quot;no man's land&quot; between the natural and social sciences, since in his own words, &quot;no man or other animal lives as other as a whole thing.&quot;Attachment to a certain territory, which Ardrey has defined as the &quot;territorial imperative&quot;, is a most deeply rooted feature of all living beings, from a worm to a human. R.Ardrey begins his book with the definition of this central notion: &quot;A territory is an area of space, whether of water or earth or air, which an animal or group of animals defends as an exclusive preserve. The word is also used to describe the inward compulsion in animate beings to possess and defend such a space.&quot; Of course, the most inventive of animals - the human species - have extended their &quot;territories&quot; far beyond their appartments or garden plots to spheres of influence in business and politics, empoyment, etc. In the book by R.Ardrey a reader will find answers and clues to the question: &quot;Why do things happen in human everyday life and history as they happen and not according to the precepts of the most enlightened minds?&quot; His answers are more informative than many volumes of writings about &quot;man and society&quot;.A human being is not good or bad, all of its features are products of nature and these features have strong and rooted biological foundations regardless of the value judgements, lamentations and appraisals of moralists. It is not possible either to understand the driving forces of an individual or a society, nor to put them into a more friendly shape unless first, these obvious things are taken into account. Thirty years have passed from the first publication of Ardrey's book, and these years have provided more evidence to support his basic assertions.Those readers who fear that this may be yet another unintelligible scientific book, laden with indecipherable jargon, may put their fears aside. Ardrey's book serves to show that it is possible to speak clearly and convincingly of human nature, that most profound and intricate thing."},{"Title":"The territorial imperative: A personal inquiry into the animal origins of property and nations (A Laurel edition)","review":"My book is the 1966 edition by Atheneum. The theme is devoted to the right of an animal to its territory, and expresses the interesting fact that the possessor is usually the victor if and when confronted with an intruder. After reading Ardrey's work, I have watched with interest my 17 pound bundle of fluff, chase a much larger dog from our property. It was no contest. Just as the one knows his rights and the bounds within which they can be excercised, so too, does the other realize that, as an intruder, he has no right to contest that right. One needs to keep in mind that man is no less an animal than those studied by Ardrey who, although his writing is good, tends to be a bit tedious until he gets to the point of his discussion; namely, that man is no less territorial than lesser beasts. Within certain social groups this truth is more revelent than in others. Immigrants to the U.S. stake out their &quot;turf,&quot; as they say, and woe be to the trespasser, not a few of whom have been killed. Readers who take seriously what Ardrey reveals should be able to point to areas on earth where his thesis is in full bloom, and is the cause of considerable consternation and death. I would rate the book five-star were it not that it takes awhile for the casual reader to appreicate what is being written. It is a work which every Secretary of State should read and discuss with the President and membes of his cabinet before allowing the United States to become actively involved in national affairs, which is not to suggest that the U.S. should remain aloof from affairs that deal with decency and terrirotial righteousness."},{"Title":"The territorial imperative: A personal inquiry into the animal origins of property and nations (A Laurel edition)","review":"I spent many a long hour reading philosophy on the nature of property, possession and place.

I learned more and gained more insight into the nature of Nature's territorial inhabitants than all my previous reading. Through carefully observed case studies of animals, conservative conclusions are drawn.

The overall argument of the book lends profound insight into the study of animal behavior (ethology i believe) and answered so many questions I had about my personal daily observations. This book also attempts to make a link between animal behavior and human behavior. Those who believe that humans are not animals, but higher than animals may want to skip this title if you don't have the courage. Keep in mind however that it was Carl Sagan who called for an alliance between religion and science and Pope John Paul II who said \\"Science can purify religion from error and superstition; religion can purify science from idolatry and false absolutes. Each can draw the other into a wider world, a world in which both can flourish...Such bridging ministries must be nurtured and encouraged.\\"Lastly, it's worth would be justified merely by the bibliography of books it provides throughout its pages. No doubt, this is a dying field of science (mostly thanks to religion's inability to adapt to the facts) in a country that is mentally decaying itself. That should not, however, diminish the importance of ardrey's work and his wonderful writing style. 5 stars, no doubt.\\"If we can't think for ourselves, if we're unwilling to question authority, then we're just putty in the hands of those in power.

If we ignore or are unaware of our behavioral links to the animal kingdom we miss one of the more profound understandings of what it means to be human.Through his observation of animals the author demonstrates the three absolute needs required, not only by animals and their communities, but required as well by us as individuals and as community members. The three are identity, stimulation and secuity. For me,Ardrey's case is persuasive and I shall always consider this work a classic.

There are scattered interesting observations, but,after fifty years are the observations still valid? Buried in chapter eight are personal observations on the politics of the Middle East.

Santa Claus has (maybe...) come in to clean floors. The 3rd grade teacher is a vampire. Ghosts eat potato chips and NOW, it seems an alien has come to take over the art class!Mrs. Zork is the new art teacher, and she is by far one of the strangest Bailey School characters yet. When she first comes to class, her hair is dead white, as is her skin-she looks like chalk. And what's with this business of her wearing braces?? And why did the power go out in the school right before she arrived? Come to think of it, what was that strange sound and light in the sky right before she came to school...?? My gosh, is she an alien from outer space?!\\"Aliens Don't...\\" is the 7th book in the Bailey School Kids series, and marks a return to strange and creepy characters. Some other books, like \\"Santa Claus Doesn't Mop Floors\\", were more funny and enjoyable than weird and creepy. Something about Mrs. Zork, with her pale skin, white hair and odd ways (she doesn't even know what painting is!) is just plain strange. What's far MORE strange is how things seem to be loosing their colors when she's around... Pictures near the art room seem to be fading, flowers are dull-looking when she's around them, and what's more, isn't Mrs. Zork's pale skin starting to show some color??The Bailey School Kids series is a fast paced, often funny set of books that will appeal to a lot of young readers who are looking to branch out into short, illustrated chapter books. The subject matter-- strange and supernatural creatures with an oddly human twist (like wearing braces)-- is likely to appeal to most young readers. There's plenty of evidence pointing to Mrs. Zork being an alien from outer space. However, like the other books in the series, there is also room for doubt, usually expressed through the opinions of the unbelieving class clown, Eddie. The fact that only about 4 or 5 of the 3rd graders at Bailey ever even NOTICE these weird goings-on and that they share a secret is one of the appeals to this series.\\"Aliens Don't...\\" is a more engaging read than some of the other books in this series, perhaps because Mrs. Zork is just so strange and creepy (really, wouldn't a woman with dead-white hair and skin and shiny, glowing braces creep YOU out??). Yes, the illustrations are a bit cartoon-like and may detract from the story for some readers, but it's also a fun, swift read for beginning and intermediate readers. It comes recommended."},{"Title":"Aliens Don't Wear Braces (Bailey School Kids #7)","review":"Aliens Don't Wear Braces by Debbie DadeyHave you ever heard of an alien that wears braces?

Unlike the double meaning of Cornel West's title \\"Race Matters,\\" there is nothing inventive in this. I'm surprised that academics would want to scream anything for a book like this.The contributors mention that the idea of \\"women in development\\" (or WID) has changed to \\"gender and development\\" (or GAD), yet has not looked specifically at how masculinity issues affect men in developing countries. Further, it is honorably noted how women's issues won't be advanced without male participation. If men don't agree to use condoms, AIDS will still spread in southern Africa. If men don't learn to respect children, they will sire boys that will commit the same injustices they have, etc. This book definitely had impressive goals.The book's contributors are equally male and female; also, it seems ethnically diverse. While the book has chapters involving Asia and Latin America, half the book focuses on sub-Saharan Africa. This is left unexamined. Is that where most development scholars work? Is that where funds tend to be directed? Is that where masculinity issues are the most glaring? It's surprising that the cover of the book shows a Latin American male worker and his sons when the majority of the subjects in the book are African males.This book must be applauded for two reasons. First, I appreciated its mention of boys and the violence that grown men perpetrate against them. One chapter mentions that development agencies must do more to re-program child soldiers who have been abused by rebels and goverments in power. International child advocates may want to read this book for that reason.Second, along with the aforementioned example of how dominant men do not just oppress women, but also other males, this book highlights the diversity of males in developing countries. Examples include older men vs. younger men in South Africa, classic bugarrones vs. modern pingueros in Cuba, or tribal differences in Namibia. Obviously, the scholars here borrow from feminists of color that say women are not a monolithic category and that race and class must be taken into account. These authors apply that claim to men. This book was gay-inclusive or at least tried not to be rigidly heterocentric.Still, the chapters wondered on and on, with very little structure. The points that authors want to make to other development scholars usually had nothing to do with the actual groups or phenomena they later described. This book was totally disorganized and not much fun to read.I applaud the contributors for trying to bring men's studies and development studies together. Still, this was quite a flawed production."},{"Title":"Should You Really Seek Custody Of Your Child?","review":"This is really a terrific book that asks (and answers) a rather surprising but fundamental question in the child custody wars: Should you REALLY seek custody? Most people, I would venture to guess, when thinking about a potential custody dispute would automatically answer yes. But Dr. Kerman, whose considerable and obvious experience and knowledge in both the legal and psychological aspects of the question (she is both a lawyer and a psychologist), goes a little further in this very valuable book and guides the reader to think twice and then to think twice again before answering this extremely important question.Although the subtitle of the book refers to the best interests of the parent in considering who should have custody, in truth as one reads the book it becomes clear that what is best for the children really is the primary consideration, and by extension what is best for the children is really best for parents who love their children.Clearly if one parent is not capable of taking care of the child for whatever reason (and Kerman gives a list of reasons, including alcoholism, drug dependancy, a significant other who would not like having the children around, lack of a stable home environment, lack of maturity, or just plan don't want the responsibility, etc.) that parent should not seek custody. But parents who seek custody simply because they want control or because they want revenge or want to avoid paying child support should rethink their position. If there are not substantial reasons that relate to the welfare of the children over and above the purely psychological and selfish reasons, then the parent who really cares about not only the children but about his or her own welfare may want to allow the other parent custody.Kerman's book is set in large type that is easily read by the farsighted and there is a lot of white space for notes. She presents her methodology in seven thorough, almost exhaustive steps which, if followed, will lead almost certainly to a correct assessment of the situation and to a correct decision regarding who should have custody. It's clear that Kerman did not want to leave anything to chance or allow a wrong decision through ignorance. She considers the practical, the psychological, the legal and the human aspects of the question. You will learn what to expect from the courts and what others in similar situations experienced. Kerman sprinkles the text with case histories that illuminate the legalities and psychology involved.When you are through reading this book you will be in a position to determine not only who should have custody, but how you should go about realizing that and what difficulties you might encounter. This is an entire course in child custody dynamics in a book. I would say not only should you buy this book yourself and read it if a custody question is on the horizon, but you should send a copy to your spouse and your lawyers! If your kids are ten or eleven years old or older, have them read it too! Everybody will benefit from the knowledge and understanding that Kerman brings to bare.I will tell you one thing for sure: you will be at a significant disadvantage if you don't read this book. Dr. Kerman really knows her stuff and I don't think she left out anything of importance."},{"Title":"Should You Really Seek Custody Of Your Child?","review":"A terrific guide with a wealth of information, both practical and legal, for any parent contemplating one of the most important decisions that will be made in their lifetime.Dr. Kerman's book is a must read for any parent that is considering custody either as a result of divorce or post divorce modification. It will answer the reader's questions to aid them in the decision making process as to whether custody for them would be in the best interest of the child and parent. If, after reading the book, the parent feels that custody litigation would be in the best interest of the child, the parent will have gleaned from Dr Kerman a vast reservoir of information from her knowledge of family law and custody that will prepare the reader in the matter of formulating stradegy in filing any custody litigation or custody modification.Hats off to Dr Kerman for this invaluable resource that has helped me in my custody modification suit."},{"Title":"Should You Really Seek Custody Of Your Child?","review":"This is a must read book for all prospective litigants, their attorneys and judges involved in child custody matters in Georgia or elsewhere.

Dr. Kerman wrote this book for the non-lawyer by focusing on the reader and condensing the essential elements of custody law and procedures to guide the reader to the most rational and practical decision making.

Dr. Kerman clearly explores all the issues surrounding seeking custody of your child through her extensive knowledge and experience, and presents them in a non-conventiontial method of exploring what is in &quot;your best interest&quot; as a parent.

Anybody wishing to gain some understanding of this very important, very misunderstood, and very troubled civilization, should read this book. Lewis, once again, provides the reader with a magnificent work that is not pedantic but instructive, that does not belittle its subject nor its audience, and that demonstrates how necessary true scholarship is, particularly in times such as these.The book is divided into eight parts: Western Approaches, Muslim History and Historians, Muslims and Jews, Turks and Tatars, In Black and White, History and Revolution, New Ideas, and New Events. Since this new edition dates from 1993, the recent developments in the world should not be expected. However, I really meant it when I wrote that true scholarship is necessary in our world: in the last essay of this volume, Lewis writes that there have been basically two atitudes from Muslims to confront the problems of the Islamic/Arab world (he does not deal with the East-Asian Mulims, like Indonesians and Malaysians, because he admits that he does not know much about them), divided into two questions. The first one is &quot;What did we do wrong?&quot; The second is &quot;Who did this to us?&quot; The first question leads to the search for solutions. The second question, and this deserves to be quoted at length, &quot;leads to delusions and fantasies and conspiracy theories--indeed, the most dangerous enemies of the Muslim peoples at this time are those who assure them that in all their troubles the fault is not in themselves but in open or occult hostile forces. Such beliefs can only lead to resentment and frustration, to an endless, useless succession of bigots and tyrants and to a role in world history aptly symbolized by the suicide bomber. In the first of these questions [&quot;What did we do wrong?], for those who have the courage to ask it, and the vision to answer, lies hope for the future and for a new dawn of Muslim creativity.&quot;Professor Lewis wrote those lines in 1993, but they are as relevant today as if he had written them on September 12, 2001. In fact, the last number of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; has an article by Professor Lewis where he presents this basic premise once more, since it was true a decade ago and it is true today.I cannot recommend Bernard Lewis's books strongly enough. This one, as all his other books that I have read, is erudite, informative, interesting, serious, entertaining and, above all, important. If you have never read anything by him, but are interested in this book, read his recent article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; (&quot;The Revolt of Islam&quot;), and the already mentioned article in &quot;The Atlantic.&quot; Those articles will serve as an Introduction to &quot;Islam in History.&quot; Bernard Lewis is an extraordinary scholar, and we are lucky to have him with us."},{"Title":"Islam in History: Ideas, People, and Events in the Middle East","review":"Lewis, as always, impresses; breadth of knowledge and research is typically outstanding. Flashes of good judgement, but pretentious and assertive (though mine's apparently an earlier edition: \\"Ideas, Men and Events...East\\" and he may've softened tone a touch for 2nd ed.)- and, regardless, it'd certainly be difficult to blame him for this-- the man's a thoroughbred. His philology isn't always accurate, and the spirit is truly 'orientalist' in Said's sense; nonetheless, a terribly enjoyable read and a classic source for a foundation in the subject.ps- His Babel to Dragomans is even more impressive and should be compulsory."},{"Title":"Islam in History: Ideas, People, and Events in the Middle East","review":"I understand that Prof Lewis is alleged to be an expert in middle eastern studies, and is the \\"go to guy\\" when leaders want to know details so they can make decisions regarding the region. I am not a leader. I am an educated 59 y/o physician who wanted to improve my understanding of the religion and people of the middle east. I gave this book my utmost attention and actually read it twice. I researched Dr Lewis, his life and myriad of accolades and awards.I gave him every benefit of the doubt that he was indeed an expert in the field? However, after every effort on my behalf and giving my best attention I now know nothing more of the \\"people\\" of the Islamic faith, how and why they feel as they do toward the west than I did before I started. After enduring many lectures over my years of study Dr Lewis impresses me as a professor who enjoys hearing himself talk though knows little of the indepth material of which he speaks. When was the last time and for that matter how much time did Dr Lewis actually spend with the very people of the region for which he is so knowledgeable.My only conclusion is that the audiance for which this particular book was written is a far more enlightened and educated group than which I am included. My personal advice to those are considering the purchase of this book is to save your money unless you too are a member of his exclusive club of intellectual middle east experts."},{"Title":"Islam in History: Ideas, People, and Events in the Middle East","review":"Written from a Western point of view, this book attempts a balanced look at Islam. It takes a linguistic view at the processes and presents Arabic terms that describes those processes."},{"Title":"Islam in History: Ideas, People, and Events in the Middle East","review":"Bernard Lewis is considered the foremost authority on the Middle East and has written many highly acclaimed works.This book has 32 essays that focus on very specific topics. Each essay is presented objectively and his technical expertise and depth of knowledge is masterly.My personal favorites in this collection are the essays on Muslim History and Historians, History and Revolution, New Idea's and lastly, the section on New Events.Essays are designed to stand alone, however, when read consecutively as part of a section, also add further clarity as part of the larger topic."},{"Title":"Islam in History: Ideas, People, and Events in the Middle East","review":"We can only wish that people in responsible positions in the West had read and absorbed the points Bernard Lewis makes in \\"Islam in History.\\" He certainly tried.Lewis is no ivory tower historian who writes recondite monographs for other ivory tower historians. Many of the essays collected here -- as well as his other, more recent collection \\"From Babel to Dragomans: Interpreting the Middle East\\" -- were published in various easily accessible, if high brow, venues, such as the New York Review of Books.And they have been out for a while. The first edition of \\"Islam in History\\" was published in 1973. It received the attention due to a leading -- some would say, the leading -- Western scholar of Islam, but not the understanding. In the preface to this newer, revised and expanded but still rather elderly collection (1993), Lewis thanks those who helped him but, in his reserved but mordant style, adds, \\"I do not however feel obliged to defer to the judgments of those reviewers who in 1973 thought that I had underestimated 'the gains made by secularism in the Muslim world' and that I had exaggerated the significance of Muslim movements in Iran.\\"Touche. But with the experience of an additional 15 years, we can see that even Lewis was not pessimistic enough. And that the executors of history have learned nothing at all from Lewis' half century of brilliant insights.Not that I think they are all brilliant, a point I will expand later. But in a 1992 essay, Lewis probed deeply into the question: Why do they hate us? That Muslims do hate the West and its values should hardly be debatable in 2008, although it still is debated. In 1992, Lewis was bemused by the rally to Saddam by Muslims and Western leftists. His core paragraph deserves to be quoted in full:\\"But beyond all these (enthusiasms of Arabs for antidemocratic forces in Europe) there was and unfortunately still is a profound, pervasive, and passionate hatred of the West and all it represents, as a world power, as an ideology, as a way of life, and that hatred is extended to embrace a wide range of local Westernizers and modernizers. It is a hatred so deep that it has led those who feel it to rally to any plausible enemy of the West -- even a racist like Hitler who despised Arabs, an atheist like Stalin who suppressed Islam, a gangster like Saddam Hussein who violated every rule of Arab decency and Islamic morality.\\"Well, I don't think much of \\"Arab decency,\\" but if George Bush had understood the arguments that underlie that paragraph, he would not still be making fatuous statements about Iraqi democracy. He might still have been justified in knocking off Saddam. Being the only man in history to depose a genocidal murderer from his throne, hale him into a court of law and see him convicted and hanged is no small achievement, and Muslims should thank him for it, but they don't; but to also expect the rescued Muslims to embrace political liberty was expecting much too much.After long experience, we are entitled to ask, is Islam compatible with democracy or, as I prefer to phrase it because, as Lewis says, democracy is a slippery word, especially as used by Arabs, popular self-government? The answer appears to be no, and this is where I part ways with Professor Lewis.His massive erudition does not always save him from making some odd mistakes. For example, he excludes Buddhism from the universalizing religions. Buddhism is, like Islam and Christianity, both salvationist and universalizing. It is not, however, monotheistic, which saves it from being obnoxious to freedom.Closer to the topic, he accepts Turkey as a democracy. It is, obviously, a disguised military dictatorship, although now in the crisis of Islam's indifference -- or worse -- toward even pretend democracy. It is unlikely Turkey will still present itself as a democracy much longer.In several essays, Lewis writes about the Islamic view that innovation is a sin. This helps explain the deep conservatism of Islamic societies, and the Young Turks are the exception that proves the rule.In \\"The Guns of August,\\" Barbara Tuchman has a long passage on the curious indifference, even antagonism, of the Young Turks toward Anatolia's long and, at times, brilliant history. \\"We like new things,\\" she quotes one of them as saying.Yes, and the Young Turks abandoned Islam. The mass of the Turkish population has not, however, even after eight decades of experiencing the supposed benefits of new things. It would be difficult to find any Islamic political movement that likes new things, although Lewis astringently observes that some of the most reactionary -- like Khomeini -- blandly adopt Western forms when it suits them, like parliaments. When challenged, they are usually able to manufacture an Islamic justification, but there is, Lewis points out, no warrant in Islam for such a thing.Lewis's particular merit -- among many -- is his willingness to notice the obvious. This is especially appealing in the last, most currently impressive essay (the one I quoted from), \\"The Middle East Crisis in Historical Perspective.\\" But it is a characteristic virtue. In \\"Behind the Rushdie Affair,\\" for example, Lewis manages to skewer not only Khomeini but a passel of Islamic jurisconsults for ignoring the very obvious violations of Islamic law in the fatwa.This habit probably helps explain why Muslims and their apologists hate Lewis so much. This is strange, because Lewis, though not ignorant of Islam's flaws, is overall an admirer of this ancient system that once reveled \\"in the glorious days when Muslims led mankind in the arts and sciences of civilization.\\"The historical record, as I read it, does not show any such days, and at this point we are entitled to wonder whether the \\"ignorance, poverty and arbitrary rule\\" that Lewis identifies as Islam's modern flaws are not actually its necessary outcomes. Suicidal martyrs are known in Christianity and in other societies, but they are a wasting asset in every society but Islam.We have to wonder why."},{"Title":"Not God After All","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked up this compact hard back book.

Michel gives detailed, step by step instructions for creating altered imagery using 35mm photos, polaroids, scanned & printed (laser/inkjet) images, and magazine pix. She also shows you how to use found objects, how to transfer photographic images, and how to make other prints: acetate negative, linoleum & rubber blocks (with very helpful info about how to take a photo image and make it into a graphic image all by yourself!), monoprints, and so forth. Finally, she showcases some work at the end to further inspire readers (but doesn't use the showcases to pad the book--there really is a lot of info packed in here). Michel uses her own images as examples of the work you can create, and they are bright, beautiful, and inspiring. Everything here is do-able, and you don't need any bulky printing equipment (other than a computer and printer) to work with images as she suggests. [ADDENDUM: having tried a number of the techniques michel suggests, i have a few comments. doing graphite transfers of images that you've traced on tracing vellum (esp. ones you've scanned and photoshopped to the correct size) works really well, particularly if you use a spoon for burnishing. however, i haven't had much luck so far with the photographic transfers onto heavy paper (p. 41) or with transferring toner copies to rubber carving blocks with acetone (p. 76), even though i followed the directions in the book and tried the techniques several times each. i note these things not because i think these problems diminish the value and fantastic ideas in the book, but because there is room for improvement should there be a future revised edition of this book. i agree with another review that in-process pictures and/or slightly more detailed description of procedures with troubleshooting tips could further enhance this highly imaginative and useful book.]"},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Altered Imagery : Mixed-Media Techniques for Collage, Altered Books, Artist Journals, and More","review":"This book has several techniques I have not seen in other books.

This is the mechanism that propels creativity. Along side the ability to absorb and value artwork for it's its existence alone, the art watcher's analytical process is a reflex, an autonomic firing of synapses that creates a compare/contrast session: what is it - why is it - how did it come about - is there a message or messages here - am I comfortable with the execution of the idea - do I need to be comfortable - what would I have done differently - on what level do I interact with this piece - what will it mean tomorrow or next year - do I want to use this idea as a piece of foundation for my own work - do I want to run screaming - is it o.k. to hate this - how can I have this kind of experience, and so on. Because the human mind so naturally filters, interprets, alters and uses the information it gathers with a unique series of parameters, it seems quite natural that someone (or many someones) would recognize this fact and write it all down in a user friendly format for the rest of us to admire. Conventionally, these authors have something to do with the psychology and sociology world. Mixed-media artist, teacher and entrepreneur Karen Michel has thrown her two cents into the fray by writing the relevant, interesting and non-intimidating reference The Complete Guide to Altered Imagery.Books like Michel's allow people to do what few artists race to admit - namely, to \\"cheat.\\". It is for this very reason that I bought her book. Like millions of other folks, I hate to be caught tracing, copying, recycling or borrowing material. When I pick up a ruler to draw a straight line I can sense the immense and crushing disapproval of real artists, alive or otherwise, as they curl a collective purist lip in my direction. Paranoia perhaps, but we all know that one person who will insist on collecting wild wode and nettles from a rainy mountainside because using azure and turquoise ink from a bottle is lowering one's standards. In particular I found the author's chapters on the versatility of transparencies helpful. Her suggestions for making negatives from acetate and processing them with photo developers is one I will incorporate into my own work."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Altered Imagery : Mixed-Media Techniques for Collage, Altered Books, Artist Journals, and More","review":"This book instructs on marvelous techniques in many forms of mixed media. There's something here for anyone involved in most facets of mixed media - photography, computer alteration, book art, etc. A fabulous idea and technique source. A \\"must have\\" for mixed media artists. \\"Paper\\" arts overlap a lot, so the content of this book is applicable to almost any type of mixed media - from card making to paper collage.

I loved the section on how to alter real photos!"},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Altered Imagery : Mixed-Media Techniques for Collage, Altered Books, Artist Journals, and More","review":"I was disappointed enough in this book to take the trouble and expense of returning it. I read an article mentioned by others which gave a few techniques for altering photos. This book stretched out the article to book length without adding much besides bulk. The images shown were pretty bleak--take a bad photo, scratch it up, and what do you have? A bad, scratched up photo. NOT inspiring to even keep for eye candy."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Altered Imagery : Mixed-Media Techniques for Collage, Altered Books, Artist Journals, and More","review":"If you want some inspiration for art work you can do in a reasonable period of time, I doubt this is for you. Collage, journals, art books and altered imagery can be some of the most time consuming projects in the art world and the ones in this book are no exception. Frankly, I want to produce my art images and projects faster than this. Also, the imagery in this book has a tendency to all look the same. Look at the cover. You are looking at the stylistic range. All this said, I do not think this is a bad book at all. It is a very good book for the right person. If you have your heart set on making your own art book or art journal using altered images, including photo transfers, and you have the time to make a very detail oriented, full project, then this book will probably guide you the whole way. Also, if your personal style is more in the folk art way, all to the good."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Altered Imagery : Mixed-Media Techniques for Collage, Altered Books, Artist Journals, and More","review":"This book is fabulous!

Many mixed media techniques are explained and illustrated. Some examples: foto manipulation, image transfer, collage and printmaking. The techniques presented are interesting and, fortunately, not overdosed with filler explanation as so often found in books dealing with creativity.The author is part of an internet based workshop movement that appeals mainly to women interested in the idea of self-awareness via self-expression. Examples of other artists' work is offered indicating that art monopolized by just one techniques is d&eacute; mod&eacute; and that mixed media has become a stationary trend."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Altered Imagery : Mixed-Media Techniques for Collage, Altered Books, Artist Journals, and More","review":"This book has many wonderful pictures and lists the items need to use for the effects but the instructions are not specific enough for a beginner to dive right in if they are not familiar with certain products. I find myself looking through for techniques that I have not used and really wish that several of the projects were a bit more specific.

When I saw it at the library I was quite excitied, and now I have read it, I will need to grab it at some stage for my own bookshelf. The book is split into 4 chapters covering altering actual photos, printer/scanner images, other found imagery and prints. There is also an artist gallery with selected featured artists.I really liked this book, and there were lots of ideas that really excited me, with good images and clear explantions of techniques. She also includes useful tips for further extension of ideas.I had never seen many of the techniques and it was interesting to see how to get similar effects as some photo apps with photos. Increasingly I am putting more photos on to some of my art journal pages and using more images so it was interesting to see the techniques here, that I will also be able to experiment with.I particularly loved many of the techniques she shared on altering and integrating found images into your work. Karen's journal pages are stunning with her layers of paint and gesso and juicy yumminess, and full of meaning.Spreads of her journals are given with clear guidance, however the spreads are not shown so you can recreate her pages but rather so that you can create your own pages and go off in other directions. I was particularly inspired by her bird images and the use of found imagery.The print making section also greatly inspired me. I particularly want to try her gum dichromate printing process, which coincides with an exhibition I saw recently that really intrigued me. She also went over lino printing, mono prints (many of the ideas would work with gelatin printing that is currently exciting a lot of people). The ways she pushed monoprinting was exciting and filled me with ideas for how to take it further. I also really love the monoprinting effect.The artist gallery was filled with images, artist's profiles and artist's tips. Some of the artists that really inspired me were:Monica RiffeMichelle WardLynne PerrellaJuliana ColesCarlo ThertusAnne GrgichThis are no \\"project-based\\" works with step by step directions, so if that is what you are looking for than this book is not for you. The images are also altered a lot, and I have read a comment alluding to the destruction and vandalism of images, so if you are looking for new scrapbooking formats, then this book is probably also not for you.It is about utilising images, some of which you won't ever put into an album, to give the images new meanings, or to emphasise the meaning you want to convey with the image. It is not about preserving images for family histories, so if that is what you primarily want to do, this is not the book for you either.The book also uses a lot of paint (which I personally love), and is not primarily about collage, which is another complaint I have seen. So if you are looking for a straight collage book, then this is possibly not the book for you. :)I would really recommend this book, I really liked it. There are a lot of techniques in this book, and the work inspires you to push your use of imagery to new directions."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Altered Imagery : Mixed-Media Techniques for Collage, Altered Books, Artist Journals, and More","review":"I've owned this book for a couple years now and ever time I refer back to itor browse through it I am always inspired to create or try a new technique.There is an abundance of interesting ideas for manipulating photos, artworkand incorporating mixed media.

There's plenty of eye candy and inspiration and the author shares the techniques she uses to alter different types of images for her art. It's a lovely and varied showcase but though Michel describes the process of creating the artworks, it's not quite a step-by-step guide and may not be for people who aren't familiar with altering images or mixed media, or who prefer a more projects-type book with more detailed and visual instructions.I would use this book as a source for mixed media art ideas but if you need clearer instructions on techniques, I'd use a book likeSurface Treatment Workshop: Explore 45 Mixed-Media Techniques."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Altered Imagery : Mixed-Media Techniques for Collage, Altered Books, Artist Journals, and More","review":"Love this book.

So I was thrilled to discover she has written an entire book of her ideas, and picked up my own copy as soon as I could find one.I am not disappointed.Filled with examples of complete works, including the works of other artists such as Lynne Perella, Nina Bagley and Carlo Thertus, the book shows a multitude of ideas for altering not only real photographs, but images from other sources, such as magazines and postage stamps. Techniques are numerous, ranging from those that are easily done with tools around the house, such as scratching designs in the photos, to more complex techniques, such as the gum dichromate process.My only wish might have been to have some step-out photos to demonstrate the some of the image transfer processes, but the text gives detailed directions.Of special interest is a section on using your computer and photoediting software to alter your images. Anyone who has ventured into this area will have tried some of the ideas she suggests, but there's lots more to explore.I've already played with scraping and sanding, using watercolor markers and messing around with some of the artistic filters in my Photoshop program. I look forward to trying many more approaches, especially ways to make use of substandard photos in some of my scrapbook designs.

I also expected the techniques to be described more thoroughly, which they were not. It does not contain all the techniques possible in this world. It contains lots of great art but is very sketchy on actual how-tos. And if you already have several altered image-type books or collage books on your shelf, and have done some of this art yourself, the contents of this book will not say anything new. The book's best value is in the gallery section and pictures of projects. These are interesting to look at. This would also be a book for fans of the author or of the gallery artists, who consist of the same group of divas you see in most collage books for sale lately: Nina Bagley, Sarah Fishburn, Claudine Hellmuth, Lynne Perella, Judi Riesch, Michelle Ward and others. I for one would like to see some new artists featured, but since the market is being driven by these ladies and by several art zines that shall remain unnamed, I think it will be awhile!"},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Altered Imagery : Mixed-Media Techniques for Collage, Altered Books, Artist Journals, and More","review":"Karen Michel is one of my favorite artists, and this book not only showcases her incredible work, but reveals her secrets for altering photographs in myriad ways.

Mr. Skinner grew up in Harlem, as a leader of a street gang, but when he heard the gospel of Jesus Christ, he went on to become an urban evangelist. His wisdom shown in this little excerpt convicted me. He knew who he was. He did not need all of society to accept him.

With his Flashman series he puts his man Harry Flashman into actual historical events of the last century. These books are richly documented and have extensive footnotes... But that is not all.... The Flashman papers (as all of these books are supposed to have been written by Harry Flashman, retired in his mid 80s and early 90s) tell the story of a decorated war hero, a knighted soldier, and a beloved national figure, who is really a world class cad and scoundrel who won all of his awards and honors in spite of the fact that he is at best a womanizing coward!These are funny and entertaining while showing you actual historical events in great detail. All that is left is to wonder A) how Flashy got into the situations, and B) how he will get outof them. I highly recommend the entire series!"},{"Title":"Flashman's first omnibus","review":"I have enjoyed all of the books by George MacDonald Fraser over the years. His &quot;Flashman&quot; series is wonderful! They are, without a doubt, the finest historical fiction I have ever read. I have taken the time to research many of the incidents where Fraser has inserted &quot;Flashy&quot; and have found that his dedication to the historic context is quite accurate. Often I feel that I have to research the outrageous events related in the story as they seem outlandish and impossible- but I always find that history is stranger than any fiction. Many times while listening I am struck by the sheer genius in stringing together so many seemingly unrelated events into a fantastic tale! My highest reccomendation."},{"Title":"Flashman's first omnibus","review":"The novels involving the Flashman character are some of the most entertaining, enlightening and engrossing stories of the Voctorian era worldwide.

When is going to happen, George?"},{"Title":"Flashman's first omnibus","review":"Very funny, entertaining, and historically pretty accurate. George McDonald Fraser is a former Gordon Highlander who served in Burma among other places and has also written a few hollywood scripts. Flashman is the character from &quot;Tom Browns Schooldays&quot;, is expelled from Rugby for drunkenness , joins the army and is sent to India... Royal Flash is what &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; should have been, hilarious and adventurous. Flash for Freedom and Flashman and the Redskins are the pick of the bunch. McDonald Frasers book &quot;The Pyrates&quot; is great for anyone who has ever watched an Errol Flynn movie...."},{"Title":"Kristeva: Desire in Language (Cloth) (European perspectives)","review":"In this book Kristeva takes on the issues of language and psychoanalysis, expanding upon Lacan's views on desire and language. (Lacan said: All speech is demand, the demand for love). Kristeva is considered a genius in her field, and highly respected in France (where all this work goes on nowadays). Here she is presented in translation so that the English-reading world can enjoy her work.The interest in such theories of language, semiotics, post-structuralism and psychoanalysis is slim in the English speaking world, and this is unfortunate. Not enough scholars of language look to Lacan and Kristeva, but they should. The text is difficult, and even more so in translation, but it is worth struggling through. However, for the reader with little background in the subject matter, penetrating Kristeva's work may be almost impossible without guidance.This book is subtitled 'a semiotic approach to literature and art'. What Kristeva does is apply her theories to the area of aesthetics, especially her specialty area of the novel. Unfortunately, her studies are naturally based on the French novel (19th century), so readers unfamiliar with novellists such as Mallarme might have a problem following this aspect of her work."},{"Title":"Star Trek 5","review":"First published in 1972, these short stories are Blish's adaptations of the screenplays of various episodes from the original series. The episodes aren't sorted into books according to either chronological order or identity of screenwriter.\\"Whom Gods Destroy\\" (episode 71, season 3, screenplay Lee Erwin and Jerry Sohl) (The remainder of the title quote is 'they first drive mad'; the setting is Elba II, a planet with a poisonous atmosphere used to isolate the criminally insane in an escape-proof setting.) I tend to bracket this with \\"Dagger of the Mind\\" from season 1. ENTERPRISE has come to Elba II because the newest inmate, Garth of Izar, was a respected starship captain until he was driven mad by injuries sustained in the line of duty. The problem is, the inmates have taken over the asylum, and Garth is a formidable opponent, insane or no.\\"The Tholian Web\\" (episode 64, season 3, screenplay Judy Burns and Chet Richards) Sent by Starfleet to locate the lost DEFIANT, the ENTERPRISE finds it drifting near a 'fracture' in space that affects the minds of any near it, apparently the cause of the death of DEFIANT's crew. Kirk, separated from the rest of the away team, appears to have been lost - and when a Tholian vessel appears and demands that ENTERPRISE leave the area, Spock and McCoy must open Kirk's final sealed orders and presume his death.\\"Let That Be Your Last Battlefield\\" (episode 70, season 3, screenplay Oliver Crawford from a story by Gene L. Coon (as Lee Cronin)) Two aliens from the hitherto unknown planet Cheron board the ENTERPRISE - Lokai, a member of an oppressed minority on that planet, and Bele, the law enforcement officer who has been pursuing him for 50000 years on charges of terrorism. (Interesting if unsubtle point: the two races look exactly the same, half black/half white, except that one is white/black and the other black/white; only the placement of the colours distinguishes them.) As Lokai demands asylum and Bele extradition, Kirk defers the issue to Starfleet Command - and in frustration, Bele uses his ESP to seize control of the ship and force a return to Cheron.\\"This Side of Paradise\\" (episode 25, season 1, screenplay Nathan Butler and Dorothy C. Fontana). The first of several episodes over the years to explore the notion of a 'paradise' planet: in this case, Omicron Ceti III, where the colonists have survived lethal doses of radiation only through accidental exposure to plant spores that act as natural tranquilizers. The colonists are happy - but insist on exposing the ENTERPRISE crew to the effect. (This story works best if you've previously read/seen \\"The Enemy Within\\" - certain aspects of Kirk's character showcased in that episode are critical to coping with the lotus-eater syndrome herein.)\\"Turnabout Intruder\\" (last episode of season 3, screenplay Gene Roddenberry and Arthur H. Singer) Janice Lester, an old acquaintance of Kirk's embittered since he attained command when she did not, uses an alien device to force an exchange of bodies with him. Blish's adaptation, like the original episode, concentrates more on Lister in Kirk's body than the real Kirk, confined to the brig for trying to incite mutiny. Lester, however, isn't good at passing herself off as the real Kirk, and overlooked some crucial details about the intended purpose of the device.\\"Requiem for Methuselah\\" (episode 76, season 3, screenplay Jerome Bixby) Flint, a very wealthy recluse living alone with an unusually beautiful and self-possessed young woman in palatial surroundings, permits the ENTERPRISE to collect some vital minerals needed to treat an outbreak of Rigellian fever among the crew. But as delays interfere with McCoy's treatment, Spock and Kirk have time to notice just how unusual Flint's palace - and his ward Rayna - really are. [This episode was later used by another author, along with \\"Miri\\", to create CRY OF THE ONLIES, which tied up some loose ends.]\\"The Way to Eden\\" (episode 75, season 3, screenplay Arthur Heinemann and Michael Richards) A back-to-nature cult (resembling contemporary hippies) has stolen a starship (bad) and are headed for the Romulan Neutral Zone (worse) in the belief that Eden is a planet to be found in that area. ENTERPRISE must prevent them from causing an international incident. On the other hand, their leader has a reputation as a brilliant scientist, and one of the youngsters is the son of an ambassador figuring prominently in very delicate negotiations..."},{"Title":"Star Trek 5","review":"I am curious why James Blish dealt with this particular set of episodes as soon as he did. Maybe it was to make sure he had good episodes available for later episodes. True, he got the cream of the crop in books 2-4. But this collection is the most depressing since the first book.Why did he feel the need to hit Season 3 heavy that soon? By this point, he covered 17 first season episodes (18 if you count \\"The Menagerie\\" as two), 8 from season two, and 3 from three. In this book he does six from the third season (with \\"This Side of Paradise\\" from the first season being the exception) and four more third seasons in the next book. I actually like the episodes in the next book better than this one.Some of these worked better on TV than in print. It was hard to catch the great acting of Leonard Nimoy in \\"This Side of Paradise\\" or the more challenging role William Shatner handled in \\"Turnabout Intruder\\". But if I made a top 20 list of favorite episodes (let alone top 10), the only ones that would make it may be \\"Turnabout Intruder\\" and possibly \\"Let This Be Your Last Battlefield\\" -- namely because I'm a Frank Gorshin fan.My criticism here is not Blish's writing, but more his episode selection. If you want to read through all the Star Trek episodes, then this needs to be in your collection. But if you want to catch the greatness of Star Trek, most of the other books would be better (especially 2, 3, 4, and 9).One note -- this is the last book that had seven episodes covered, and I think in the next one he expanded his coverage of the episodes."},{"Title":"Star Trek 5","review":"James Blish was a very talented science fiction writer, his adaptations of the original Star Trek episodes not only made some of the weak ones sound interesting, but he also nurtured the phenomenon.

The series of books containing Blish's abbreviated adaptations of the episodes of the original series appeared shortly after the series was cancelled and helped keep the movement alive. The copy that I read for this review was originally published in April of 1969 and was already in the eighth printing by March of 1972. That clearly demonstrates that it was a significant part of the Star Trek legacy.In this book, Blish wrote adaptations of the following seven episodes:*) The Trouble With Tribbles*) The Last Gunfight*) The Doomsday Machine*) Assignment: Earth*) Mirror, Mirror*) Friday's Child*) Amok TimeWhile Blish generally keeps to the storyline of the episode, there are some significant deviations. When I read this book shortly after it first appeared, that fact disappointed me and it still does. However, I understand the sense of that approach, for these books were designed to expose Star Trek to people who didn't follow the original series with the passion that I did. Kathy, my beloved fianc&eacute;, is always amused when we watch episodes of the original series and I start spouting the dialog word-for-word a few seconds before it actually occurs.As an original Trekkie, the lack of precisely following the original storyline still bothers me. However, the logical part of me understands the reasons for it, so I still give the book five stars."},{"Title":"Star Trek 5","review":"Blish is to be commended as being one of the people that kept the Star Trek fires burning after the original series was cancelled. He wrote a series of adaptations of the episodes of the original series that were collected into several books. He also did not exactly follow either the dialog or plot lines of the series, something which may offend purists of the genre. However, since one intended consequence of the books was to introduce Star Trek to new people, that criticism is not necessarily well founded.This book contains adaptations of the following episodes:*) All our yesterdays*) The devil in the dark*) Journey to Babel*) The menagerie*) The Enterprise incident*) A piece of the actionIn just a few pages, Blish manages to capture the spirit of Star Trek and the message of the episode. That can be a difficult thing to do in print, as so much of the magic of Star Trek was visual. In my recent rereading of this book, I was once again pleased with the stories, even though I am an original Trekkie and can repeat the dialog of nearly every episode word for word."},{"Title":"The fighting Cheyennes (The Civilization of the American Indian series)","review":"People familiar with studies of the Plains Indians and their culture already know that this is the defininitive book on the Cheyennes.

His older brother served as the Shah's Prime Minister for 13 years.And yet the book is a vitriolic attack against the Shah.The reason?In the last months of his reign the Shah decided to imprison the author's brother, Amir-Abbas Hoveyda,in a forlorn bid to silence the regime's violent critics.Amir Abbas Hoveyda was made a scapegoat.When the Shah left Iran with his wife and family he abandoned Amir-Abbas to the bloodthirsty mullahs who soon seized power. That was a cowardly act on the part of the Shah. The mulahs murdered Amir-Abbas Hoveyda along with tens of thousands of other Iranians who fell into their hands.Fereydoun Hoveyda cannot forget, or forgive, the betrayal of his borther. And that is understandable.The problem is that Fereydoun Hoveyda's emotions prevented him from writing a balanced book. His vilification of the Shah can only absolve, albeit only partly, the mullahs who actually murdered Amir-Abbas.Had the title of the book been &quot; Settling Scores with the Shah&quot;, I would have had no obejction.The Shah was certainly no angel. But nor was he the demon that Fereydoun Hoveyda pretends.For a more balanced biography of the Shah, and a less emotional account of Amir-Abbas Hoveyda's tragic fate, you could read William Shawcross's &quot; The Shah's Last Ride&quot; which remains a good example of the Western art of biography.For a more initimate, and Iranian, view you could read Amir Taheri's &quot; The Unknown Life of the Shah&quot;. Taheri knew the Shah well and was also regarded as a personal friend of Amir-Abbas Hoveyda.He has thus been able to remain fair to both men, although his bias, not to say hatred, of the Islamists colours his broader political judgment. A READER IN RICHMOND, SURREY, UK"},{"Title":"The Fall of the Shah","review":"In response to the anonymous persian Pahlavi worshipper and self-proclaimed reader below I would suggest not to settle scores with your own wasted and insignificant life by offering a biased and unuseful review of the point of view of one man on the fall of the second and last Pahlavi. At least this is an eyewitness account of a man who along with his brother was at the helm of power for nearly two decades. Hoveida was imprisoned by his boss and later executed. The Pahlavis fled Iran. These are facts. And although distress and resentment may characterize some of the style of the author, his account is valuable and valued."},{"Title":"The Fall of the Shah","review":"Here in Brazil, I read this regular book. This book was writen by Fereydoon Hoveyda (1924 - 2006). And Hoveyda wrote this regular book because his brother, Amir Abbas Hoveyda(1919-1979), a former prime minister of Iran under the Shah. Amir Abbas Hoveyda was arrested following the Shah's orders and soon he was was executed, by the Iranian Revolution, in 1979.This book has these main good things:1- This book is short and concise.2- The author was from inside of Shah regime.3- About the newspaper's diatribe against Khomeini, that sparked the Islamic revolution, this book shows clearly that came from a Shah's relative and secretary of information, Dariush Homayoun, the order to publish that terrible article. See pages 22 and 23. This remembered an old Brazilian proverb. In English, this proverb means: Rulers have parents, not problems.4- About American paper in Islamic Revolution, this book is clear as it having just secundary. President Carter is in this book few times. Any other American is remembered more than three times.5- About the Shah's regime, this book, many times describes the terrible corruption, beggining at the Shah's family.6- This book shows that the \\"victim\\" and \\"heroic\\" last commander of Shah's Air Force, General Rabii, betrayed other generals looking to beggin a military coup. The betrayed generals were soon executed, following Khomeini's orders. Even so, \\"general\\" Rabii was arrested and executed by Khomeini's orders.7- Today, this book remains usefull, because it shows how Santayana was right. History repeats itself. Hosni Mubarak (Egypt) and Zine El Abidine Ben Ali (Tunisia) both fell using the same mistakes, as the Shah. And American participation was even worse than under the Shah's regime. United States companies recieved many billions of US dollars, from the Shah and Iranian coffers, while Egypt recieved billions of US dollars from American taxpayers.There's some problems with this book:1- This book isn't unbiased. Beyond doubt, this book has a bias against the Shah.2- About Khomeini, this book even thinking that he was founding a terrible regime, has few sins remembered in this book. As an example, on page 41, this book claims that on 19 August 1978 in the Cinema Rex fire, in Abadan, Iran, was set ablaze, killing over 400 Iranians. This book claims, on page 41, that it was from Shah's persons orders. In fact, it was soon disclosed that Islamic militants set the Cinema Rex fire, following Khomeini's orders. See the book \\"The life and times of the Shah\\" on, pages 465 & 459.****************************************************At the epilogue and about the Shah, this book writes on pages 215 and 216, these sentences: \\" No matter one believes about the theories of foreign intervention in Iran's affairs, there's no denying that the Shah did all he possibly could to bring about the collapse of his dinasty. His armament policy, the corruption of his entourage, his ruthless repression and stifling dictatorship gnawed like a cancer at his whole system, especially during his last two years in power. Blinded by his own dreams of grandeur and walled off from the realities of the country, the Shah ignored popular aspiration, despised the clergy, and antagonized both the world and his own people simultaneosly. As I have attemped to demonstrate in the course of this book, with the help of his family he was the true and certain author of his own downfall.\\"Today, in the sentences above replacing the word \\"Shah\\" for Mubarak, Muammar Gaddafi, Ben Ali and the word \\"Iran\\" for Egypt, Libya and Tunisia and finnaly the word \\"dinasty\\" for regime, you don't need to change anything else in these sentences above.ANd Syrian cleptocrat Bashar Hafez al-Assad learned nothing from Shah's mistakes. In some months, Bashar Hafez al-Assad will follow the Shah and will die in exile or he will follow Muammar Gaddafi and will be murdered."},{"Title":"Bear Hunting With the Politburo","review":"- about the former USSR, Communism and Russia can one Westerner fit into one book? Nay, on a single page? Don't know, but A. Craig Copetas must have set some record. I came across the original 1991 edition of this curio, written in the wake of the August coup. Its main contribution is a revealing look at the mainstream Western mindset of the late 80s, head stuffed with cold war congestion, fervently rooting for \\"the reformers\\" to overthrow the corrupt, failed, brutal, evil, etc., system and bring Western virtue to Moscow - impossible, of course, because the people are so helplessly sunk into their \\"Soviet mentality\\" that poor Mr. Copetas is like Charleston Heston trapped on the Planet of the Apes. For all of his post-modernism, I expected 19th century eugenics to crop out of the pages any moment.The plot of this work revolves around the cooperative movement of perestroika, that allowed three persons at minimum to obtain a state license to start a \\"bizness.\\" His Hunter S. Thompson-like hero is Volodya Yakovlev, the prototypical \\"New Russian\\" and founder of the periodical \\"Commersant.\\" Copetas outlines the history of \\"democratic free market reform\\" (this was the time, remember, when this cliche was still taken in all earnest seriousness) through his experiences with \\"Yak\\" in the wilds of glasnost, dodging the Russian \\"shatooni\\" - rogue bears - of the apparat. Gorby's idea was to legalize the black market and make it a source of taxable revenue. The result, as we know 20 years later, was more like legalizing drugs: empowering crime and the submerging of any budding civil society in even more explicit brutality and corruption.We are offered the usual obstacles to Russians getting with the Westen program: the corrupt apparatchiki (bureaucrats,) with their hands out for the take; and the befuddled Russian masses, who prefer poverty in security to the enterprising spirit that made America great for rich white boys like Mr. Copetas. Between this rock and hard place our heros reach the conclusion that the whole Soviet system must be overthrown before they can stand strong and free. Fortunately Boris Yeltsin is on hand to lead the charge. That it was a run over a cliff meant nothing, of course, to the well-capitalized with their hard currency squirreled in Western banks and Western visas in their pockets.While the Communist Party and Soviet state are the arch-villains here, Mr. Copetas' account begs accuracy (as does much of his Russian history.) It was the Party and state that authorized the co-ops in the first place. Revealing also is the distinction between the co-ops and joint stock companies, as passed by the \\"free-market democrats\\" in the Russian legislature of 1990: the latter form authorized Russian citizens to buy property and legitimately enter private partnerships with foreigners. This distinction was more than semantic, but the very essence of the Yeltsin/Gorbachev tug of war and the August '91 coup.There is little sense of the other side of the story: that these \\"co-operators\\" ruined everything they touched. This was also the case in those golden days of the New Economic Program, in the 1920s, giving rise to Ilya Ilf's spoof \\"The 12 Chairs.\\" No wonder Stalin and the 5-Year-Plans looked like such a good idea at the time! Ilf's descendants got their startup money by sucking at the Soviet state teat, like any Reaganite contractor, squirreling away the profits in money-laundering fronts false flagged as \\"banks.\\" After they gutted the state and their patron Boris Yeltsin enshrined the worst as oligarchs, they capped their new freedom with placing strongman Putin in power to protect their ill-gotten gains from the floundering rabble below.If you want to understand the rage of the modern Occupy Moscow movement, here's its genesis in the fatuous twaddle dripping in every sentence of Mr. Copetas' nostalgic tour-de-farce. The reviewer below enthused that one didn't need to know anything at all about Russia to enjoy the book. Indeed, that is a requirement."},{"Title":"Bear Hunting With the Politburo","review":"Bear Hunting is a real page turner. You don't need to know anything about Russia to like this book.

And although it served in that capacity for a relatively short period of time (1774-1776), it hosted some noteworthy characters, including a few visits from Benjamin Franklin. Franklin was there to see his son, William, who was the governor of NJ (a post Ben helped in attaining for him a decade earlier). William remained in that position until he was arrested by the \\"rebels\\" and sent off to prison in Connecticut in 1776.The book follows the history of the house after the Revolution, including its uses as a hotel and a boarding house, among others. But it mostly focuses on the colonial era of its story, and rightly so, as it is the most interesting and the most important. It's a short book at just over 40 pages and can easliy be read in one sitting.Four stars. Highly recommended as an accompaniment to a tour of the still-standing old house, if you can make it to NJ!"},{"Title":"How Democratic Is the American Constitution? (Castle Lectures in Ethics, Politics, and Economics)","review":"How Democratic is the American Constitution? The question and title of this book creates a straw man argument by Robert A. Dahl, albeit at an attempt of objectivity, that the purer the democracy the more ideal the central government, thus the Framers intention upon creation. In doing so, he completely ignores, and implicitly rejects, the republicanism ideal, which in fact was the true intention of the Framers.All things considered, they key point of contention that Professor Dahl makes is that a purely democratically run central government would have been constructed had the Framers not feared the \\"tyranny of the majority\\". As such, the entire motivation for scheming the U.S. government was in subduing this presumably harmful potency. This error, implicates Dahl, partly explains why no other well-developed democracy in the world has imitated our Constitution for their own service. What the majority wants, these countries learned, is not all that dangerous.Invariably, Dahl sets up an easy straw man to attack, that being the conception that the Framers sought the most democratic central government while balancing the limitations on majority rule. Because, \\"after all\\" (said facetiously), pure democracy is the ideal tool for running central government. And while attacking this proposition, the reader is persuaded that our Constitution is anachronistic.Professor Dahl's attack on the unequal representation of the Senate is perhaps most luminous in the miscomprehension of the intent of devising the federal government. To strengthen his argument, Dahl asserts Senate elections are not only \\"unjust\\" to those in more populous states, even going so far as to corroborate it with the fact that legislative anti-slavery measures all died in the Senate from Southern Senators who derived their powers from an equal source as their more populous Northern counterparts, but that this introduction into the Constitution was merely a compromise with no real positive value!This is at the heart of Dahl's flaw. He sees no utility in a union of autonomous states being governed centrally. Hence his quizzicality as to the purpose of having a bicameral legislation, with one half deriving its source from population, and the other from state equality. Hence his subtle yet pervasive argumentation for a more purely democratic centrally governed union.The Framers, as do I, disagree with this sentiment. Strongly independent states means citizens who are freer to influence their government. In essence, the larger the collective, the more difficult to agree upon policy. Fragmentation, therefore, leads to more citizen independence, and easier policy making, yet necessitates a superior authoritarian influence should the citizenry deviate from reason.Thus the formation of a staunchly republican nation-state. Pure democracy can certainly be applied within any state in the union, yet to be done through the central government leads to struggle for ultimate dominance by entirely distinct and unrelated factions. Certainly if you were a farmer you would not appreciate the majority of the country, who are city dwellers, employing eminent domain to increase housing on your farmland. Like-wise if you were a small state with a majority of farmers you would like equal influence on policy that supersedes those that you have in place (perhaps now the Senate is now being seen as a wise \\"compromise\\"?). Thus, a central government designed for equal representation by the states that make up the union. Indeed a democracy, but for the states.I surely did not do republicanism justice with my brief recount, and suggest further reading on the subject. The point is, the United States of America was founded on this principle, which completely obviates the entire message of this book. It would be disheartening to conclude that a Professor of Political Science is unaware of this driving philosophy; instead he must not find any meaning in it. But since he mentioned the occurrence of voter dilution through unequal representation in the Senate, I must ask a more pertinent question than the title of the book: is a central government in place with the ultimate form of voter dilution (pure democracy) superior to the democratic republic we have now?"},{"Title":"How Democratic Is the American Constitution?

Prof. Dahl has proposed some very interesting changes to our existing constitution. The electoral college, senate, judicial review ( supreme court )are some of the areas he covers. But I found his arguments one-sided and shallow. He talks about flaws but brings no real solutions to the table. At the end of the book he laments the fact that _any_ change will be almost impossible. I disagree with this outlook.He tries to compare different existing democracies, but uses different sets of countries for different comparisons without explaining why certain countries were included or excluded. I also believe the comparisons are pretty superficial. How do you say that Switzerland ( which has 4 national languages )is more diverse then the U.S.A.

The constitution and the constitutional system which it creates is compared by Dahl against other constitutional systems of world democracies. Is our Constitution really the best viable?"},{"Title":"How Democratic Is the American Constitution? (Castle Lectures in Ethics, Politics, and Economics)","review":"The issue of how best to govern a nation is of great importance and should be explored through intellectual, logical debate. Dahl's book does not carry the weight this topic deserves because he entirely avoids exposure of the logical constructs from which his conclusions stem.Dahl's unstated presupposition is that democracy is a superior form of government compared with representative democracy. This presupposition is never discussed and simply assumed true by Dahl. This is strong evidence that Dahl hopes to persuade, not promote his ideas in this op-ed piece. Since he offers no logical constructs regarding his specific ideas and avoids direct questioning of potential hazards of his ideas, he does not offer the non-critically thinking reader pause for review. Instead he promotes safe, non-threatening ideas that will be easily agreed to by the reader. Once the reader is agreeing with what is said it is nearly effortless to get the reader to agree to the next idea, even if the two ideas are completely unrelated. In fact, the very fashion in which Dahl presented his justification for changing the constitution was one such trick.Dahl states that during the time of the constitutional convention we were far less technologically advanced. He tells the reader that DaVinci could have done absolutely marvelous things had modern technology been at his dispose. This is certainly debatable if one were to stop and question what circumstances allowed DaVinci to do what he had done. However, for most, this is an idea that will be readily agreed to and will strike imagination and hope, exactly the combination needed to persuade people of such things as Dahl desires. Dahl never strikes his assumption that technological advances also bring about social and political advances, for which he could have at least made a case. He never brings the topic for discussion and simply behaves as if the point had been struck. However, societal advances are not directly conjured through technological advances and in many cases societal norms become less democratic (what Dahl would call more advanced) with technological advances. And thus, we can see why Dahl avoided intellectual debate and instead opted for a trick.This is an old, extremely effective sales trick which has personally been used to do things like sell movies to people that did not own a television and found movies morally wrong. This anecdote is not just presented to expose Dahl's method, but is also presented here to strike a point: People are gullible and will easily agree to do things to which they are morally opposed, much less unsure of or apathetic to. This is the very reason to avoid a direct democracy and there are historical examples of such things happening, which of course, Dahl fails to acknowledge. Furthermore, it is precisely self-serving tricksters that the founding fathers had in mind when writing the constitution--no wonder Dahl detests it so.Dahl uses others tricks that an unsuspecting reader will miss. For example, Dahl goes through some effort to legitimize his term \\"founding framers,\\" in preference to \\"founding fathers.\\" This has absolutely no relevance to the discussion of representative government versus pure democracy. However, what it does do is remove a name that places the creators of the constitution on a pedestal and replaces it with something less reverent. This is not to suggest that changing the name to \\"founding framers,\\" and removing some of the reverence is a bad thing. But combined with the other tricks in this book, it is highly suspicious and comes across as name calling.Furthermore, it is a rather surprising move on Dahl's part after he showed such deftness with persuasion (discussed in the previous paragraph) in other parts of the book. The reason it is surprising is that the very people he would hope to convince would likely be the people that would put his book away after reading this passage. Dahl is certainly not a dumb individual; so for whom is this book written, the like minded or the variant of Dahl? It is most likely the latter of the two.He claims that Tocqueville predicted a \\"collapse of society,\\" due to the nature of a pure democracy and gives examples of trials which modern societies have faced without collapsing. Yet, again, he fails to address the heart of his argument and instead opts for something safe and at best tangent to his point, i.e. wars and depression which have nothing to do with the nature of democracy causing a legislative overload and collapse. And yet, Tocqueville is highly accurate when he discusses the stifling laws and regulations that will govern a purely democratic state. On needs to look no further than license requirements for bicycles in modern democratic countries.Dahl claims he believes in \\"intrinsic equality,\\" which he defines as inalienable political equality among all citizens. He further claims that the intrinsic equality is what not only allows but actually promotes democracy because the majority population will respect the intrinsic equality of the minority population. So, live and let live, allow for consideration of differences of opinion on even the most important subjects is what Dahl claims to believe in and promote. However, talk is cheap. Dahl later states, \\"...it is difficult for me to see how a significantly different proposition could be defended, particularly if we draw on crucial historical cases...,\\" (131). He later refers to his own judgments as, \\"prudent,\\" while referring to the judgments of others as based in \\"hopeless ignorance.\\" It appears that Dahl fails to uphold the very standard he promotes as being the basis for a pure democracy.Dahl directly states that he considers his own opinions correct and prudent and perceives views in variation from his own as invalid. He claims that the founding fathers had personal motivations and designed our government to promote their own interests. He claimed that people today are superior that people in the past. And because of these things, it must seem to Dahl that the debate of a purely democratic society versus a representative democracy is moot.That said, merit exists in some of his points and objections about our current government. However, his methods of tricking and avoiding direct promotion of his ideas are distasteful and less effective than its compliment. Without allowing the reader preview to arguments, one cannot accurately gauge Dahl's position and thus cannot identify where differences of opinion stem. Since it is highly unlikely that Dahl will be charged with the tasks of creating a new constitution, it is likely that Dahl's work will only benefit his cause by creating a stir among his like-minded, which is certainly not respectful to Dahl's dissenters.If offered the opportunity, it would be of great interest to hear what Dahl would say regarding the role of pure democracy in the fall of Athens, or to have him explain what mechanism would prevent a pure democracy from passing arbitrary or spiteful laws into action. Or perhaps it would be good to see a working example of a successful pure democracy in business or politics (money and power); the two things that ultimately drive government action. These are the issues that his concepts bring forth and since he wholly failed to address them, his book lacks the weight required to address how to best govern a free body of people."},{"Title":"How Democratic Is the American Constitution? (Castle Lectures in Ethics, Politics, and Economics)","review":"This book is hopelessly flawed, as it is based on some very weak assumptions. Dahl is a worshipper of democracy; he does not realize or does not appreciate the Founders' distrust of democracy. As former New York governor Horatio Seymour pointed out many years ago, the purpose of the Constitution was to check democracy, not to promote it. Since Dahl only values the Constitution as an instrument of democracy, which it clearly is not, he can see it only as a flawed, reactionary document written by slaveholders.Defenders of the Constitution like myself do not, as Dahl and his approving reviewers seem to think, consider the Constitution as sacred. The Constitution has been changed many times and will no doubtbe altered again in the future. It is a matter of defending the form of government the Founders wisely chose, that of a republic as opposed to a democracy. The rights of minorities, which Dahl treasures, are far more secure under a republican form of government than a mobocracy. Unfortunately, he doesn't seem to realize this fact, which is regrettable. For a political science professor at Yale he lacks a basic understanding of American political principles."},{"Title":"How Democratic Is the American Constitution? (Castle Lectures in Ethics, Politics, and Economics)","review":"I admit this book has some decent points to make but overall his analysis comes across as disorganized, bitter, ill informed, and he seems like a man who would be happier living in a European democracy. He makes the point that the Declaration of Independence isn't democratic because it says &quot;all men&quot; instead of &quot;all persons.&quot; However, one trip to a dictionary that gives the history of the usage of the word &quot;man&quot; will show that up until the 20th century, &quot;man&quot; was used to mean 'mankind' and not just male humans. I'm only a college student getting a degree in political science and it's sad that I'm able to disprove a Yale professor with knowledge I receieved in high school. He is critical of our system only because other democratic countries have different systems. He also manages to slip in his bitterness over the 2000 election of George Bush several times by hiding it under the moniker of &quot;international embarrassment&quot; over the electoral college. I'll admit that he does have a few positive points to make on the Founding Fathers on such issues as slavery but his general analysis and criticism is almost an anachronism. He expects the Framers of the Constitution to be able to make judgement on issues with the knowledge and insight that a person of the 21st Century has. His book is poorly written as well; often he makes a controversial claim only to say &quot;I'll address this in a later chapter.&quot; I've not read any other books that Dahl has written but this book leaves a bad taste in my mouth for his style and belief system."},{"Title":"How Democratic Is the American Constitution? (Castle Lectures in Ethics, Politics, and Economics)","review":"Some other reviewers have citicized this book with the non-sequitur that the US is \\"a republic, not a democracy.\\" A republic is simply a representative democracy. The Founders feared a system in which a majority of the population could empower their representatives to do whatever the majority so pleases. To prevent such a nightmare they proposed limits on government power. Although they feared the unchecked will of the majority, they all agreed that the \\"will of the people\\" was a better source of power than any alternative. Anybody who recites from rote the \\"Republic, not a democracy\\" mantra to ward off any discussion of perfecting our form of government is forgetting that the preamble to the Constitution speaks of a \\"more perfect union\\", not \\"a perfect union.\\"That said, the question Dahl raises is why no other government in the world is quite like ours. He makes it clear that the Framers had good ideas, but suggests that other nations have improved on the excellent baseline model established by the Framers. That is a very reasonable proposition. Ironically, much of the innovation seen in other nations consists of solutions to problems that our Framers thought they had solved.The Framers feared \\"faction\\", because blind partisanship is clearly a bad thing. Ironically, a failure to foresee and allow for the inevitable formation of parties has only exacerbated the effects of \\"faction.\\" Dahl addresses the lack of proportional representation (PR), where each party gets seats in (at least one house of) the legislature in proportion to its share of the vote. The lack of PR leads to a two-party system. When you only have two parties, the inevitable result is rancor and polarization. Conversely, multi-party systems require coalitions, compromise, and negotiation. If the formation of parties in inevitable, I'd much prefer a system in which parties compromise and solve problems rather than demonize and obstruct.Also, Dahl points out that the Founders feared a popularly elected President because (a) they believed no national figure would emerge and (b) they feared that if one did emerge he would be a strong-man. They also rejected a Parliamentary system because they wanted checks and balances between the executive and legislative branches. However, the electoral college rapidly evolved into a crude accounting scheme for national campaigns, and Dahl explores the historical background to this evolution. He also points out that we now have Presidents with \\"mandates.\\" This suggests that maybe our Executive branch is TOO independent.Finally, Dahl addresses the (sady, unchangeable) malapportionment of the Senate. He points out that revered advocates of limited government (e.g. Madison) opposed equal Senate representation for each state. In fact, Madison accused the small-state representatives of seeking power rather than liberty. Conservatives should be wary of any system that gives a small group huge power. Dahl argues persuasively that protection of minorities should look at ideological or political minorities, not minorities based on which state a person happens to live in. Ultimately, people should be free to organize politically with whomever they agree, and not be forced to organize their interests along artificial lines drawn by governments.Overall, Dahl does an excellent job of pointing out the areas where our Constitution needs a fine-tuning, and he brilliantly demolishes the political ancestor-worship underlying opposition to his critique."},{"Title":"How Democratic Is the American Constitution? (Castle Lectures in Ethics, Politics, and Economics)","review":"Dahl's book is actually more of an extended essay on the Constitution and the conflicts it has with modern concepts of democracy. In particular, Dahl focuses on such elements of the Constitution as senate representation and the electoral college, both of which provide representation on a basis other than that of population.These &quot;flaws&quot; in the Constitution are nothing new. Dahl's more insightful work is where he compares the United States to other, similar democracies and sees how our Constitution compares with theirs.This is a fast read, but that's as much a result of the brevity of the book as its writing. There are items Dahl could have developed more: in particular, the difficulty of amendment ratification fits perfectly into his book, but he really only mentions it as a stumbling block to Constitutional reform, not as another anti-democratic element of the document.Despite its flaws, this book succeeds in its chief goal, which is to look at the Constitution in a realistic manner, without the glorification that so many people give it. It may provide more questions than answers, but these are good questions that need to be asked."},{"Title":"How Democratic Is the American Constitution? (Castle Lectures in Ethics, Politics, and Economics)","review":"I was enthralled by this book the instant I saw it, because it asked hard questions about American democracy that I've never heard from anyone else before. I would summarize this book as a short course in comparative democracies (sort of like comparative religions), discussing the similarities and differences between democracies that work.The main question that Dahl asks is, &quot;Why should we feel bound today by a document produced more than two centuries ago by a group of fifty-five mortal men, actually signed by only thirty-nine, a fair number of whom were slaveholders, and adopted in only thirteen states by the votes of fewer than two thousand men, all of whom are long since dead and mainly forgotten?&quot;Chapter 3 is the most interesting part of this book, where Dahl compares the American constitution to other democratic governments. &quot;[A]mong the countries most comparable to the United States...not one has adopted our American constitutional system. It would be fair to say that without a single exception they have all rejected it. Why?&quot; Dahl explores this question with respect to the American bicameral chambers (House and Senate), unequal representation (in the Senate), judicial review, the electoral system, two-party systems, and the presidental system. He discusses how the American system works versus other democracies, comparatively pointing out strengths and weaknesses.Overall I found this a stimulating, well-written, and deep book that looks at fundamental questions about American democracy that few people seem to be asking. Unlike other authors, however, he doesn't do this in a pessimistic manner, criticizing the American system needlessly. It was more of &quot;we've done pretty well all things considered, but we can do better, and we should strive to do better.&quot;"},{"Title":"How Democratic Is the American Constitution? (Castle Lectures in Ethics, Politics, and Economics)","review":"I think the book is a good one, as far as it goes. But, I think that the author, like virtually every author on the subject, is essentially arguing trivia that has little relevance to the real world. They intellectualize on a subject that our Government does not take seriouslyThe truth is that what the Constitution says or the form it takes simply has no consequence since the people who run our government simply ignore those provisions it does not like, enforces those provisions that enhance their power, and the Supreme Court can make its words mean anything they want by interpreting it to mean whatever they want it to mean. Let me give a few examples.Example:1 Perhaps the most glaring example is the ruling that money equals speech. This ruling gives Constitutional protection thru the Free Speech Amendment for Corporations and the super rich to bribe any government official they want. Could anything be more obscene than to use the Bill of Rights to permit what would normally be a criminal action. I don't think so. When one adds that to the recent ruling that Corporations are persons under law, there is no hope for the common man to have any reasonable chance to have a seat at the tables when laws are being enacted that are critical to there own well being. Both of those interpretations are so absurd on the face of them that one simply cannot take any intellectual arguments about the Constitution seriously. And while our government scrupulously enforces those rulings, the smply ignore others.Example:2 You may not know it but our government violates the Constitution on several subjects. The first is tha the Constitution states that our government is to give an accounting for all expenditures. So, why do they have a \\"Black Budget\\" that keeps secret tens billions of dollars that are spent on operations that the public doesn't know about. It is a clear violation.Example;2 In passing Trade Treatise like NAFTA and the WTO, the Constitution requires a two thirds vote of the Senate. That, of course, didn't happen. They were instead put thru an unconstitutional process called \\"Fast Track\\" where members of Congress were not allowed to add amendments. This sham was created by denying that these treaties were treaties, by simply calling them \\"Agreements.\\" One cannot make treaty not a treaty by simply calling it something else. You cannot turn a dog into a act by renaming it. This is an obvious violation of the Constitution.EXAMPLE:3 the Constitution requires that only the Congress can declare war. That is another provision that is simply ignored. We have been in dozens of wars since WW II and we have never declared war on anyone.Example:4 GWB created a precedent that allows the President to ignore any law he wants, simply by creating a Signing Statement. He did it dozens of times during his Administration. The way it works is that whenever Congress passes a law and it goes to the President for his signature, he doesn't veto it, he signs it and attaches a Signing Statement that notifies Congress that, even though he is signing the law, he does not intend to obey or enforce it.Example:5 Finally, the President can simply ignore the Constitution by simply declaring and \\"Emergency.\\" Most people don't know it, but we have operating in a state of emergency since WW II. That means that every President since Harry Truman, is free to ignore the Constitution whenever he wishes.The truth is that the Constitution as, interpreted by the Supreme Court, has created a rigged system that has been manipulated to give all power to the moneyed interests and to ignore what the people want. Given the present situation, it seems to me that any intellectual arguments regarding any requirements of the Constitution is simply meaningless.The book is an interesting read, but it is just an academic exercise. It has no real relevance in the real world."},{"Title":"How Democratic Is the American Constitution? (Castle Lectures in Ethics, Politics, and Economics)","review":"Dahl's fine book attacks the American Constitution and system of government for each of the following undemocratic features, most of them totally unique to the US among the world's advanced democracies, and all very rare.? The Electoral College.? A bicameral legislature.? Grotesquely unequal representation in the Senate.? Judicial review (veto) of acts of the federal legislature, duly signed into law by the President.? Judicial legislation (\\"policy making\\") under cover of enforcement of the Constitution.? Single member legislative districts with plurality voting (so-called, \\"first past the post\\"), contrasted unfavorably with proportional representation and runoff systems.? The two party system.? A President with important powers wholly independent of the legislature, contrasted unfavorably with the much more common system of ministerial government responsible to the legislature.? A strong federal system imposing significant limits on the powers of the general government.This is a short book in which, of course, RD does not say all he knows, or complain of every undemocratic characteristic of our system. For example, he does not complain of these, and so proposes no better alternative - however hopeless.? Federal judges are appointed rather than elected.? Federal judges have effective life tenure.? There is no federal recall.? There is no federal initiative.? There is no federal referendum.? Legislation is unduly influenced, and often even written, by lobbyists in service of moneyed interests (RD does allude to this).? Tens of millions of America's mentally competent, non-criminal permanent residents lack the franchise.? Tens of millions of America's people who have the franchise do not vote. (In the words of Sharona Fleming, \\"It only encourages them.\\")? There is no \\"None of the above\\" option for voters.? The means of campaigning are almost wholly within the gift of the rich (RD does allude to this disgraceful fact in one sentence).? The means of political propaganda in general, from report and comment in the mass media to the productions of \\"think tanks,\\" are almost wholly within the gift of the rich.? Holders of high federal office - including judges, legislators, and the President - are nearly all lawyers and nearly all personally members of the wealthiest strata.? The legislature has only the slightest real impact on foreign policy in general, and not much even on treaties. It has none on the extra-constitutional device of the \\"executive agreement.\\"? The requirement of a Congressional declaration of war is not observed and is without effect.? There is no popular constraint on, or control over, government - and in reality Presidential - war-making power.RD is justly pessimistic about the prospects for democratic change, but says not a word about why. But we know why, don't we? Many, if not all, of the undemocratic features of our system serve to protect the interests of the oligarchy who own and operate that machine.And some are bizarre. Did you know the inequalities of representation enshrined in the Senate (half of America's people elect 18 Senators, while the other half elect 82) are reproduced in lesser degree to the benefit of the very same states in the Electoral College, giving them a wildly disproportionate impact on the selection of the President?Over 700 proposals to reform or abolish the Electoral College have been passed in the House - and died in the Senate."},{"Title":"How Democratic Is the American Constitution? (Castle Lectures in Ethics, Politics, and Economics)","review":"This book is a little gem, A CLASSIC worthy of the broadest possible readership, and the widest possible debate. The questions it raises are profound and important; the solutions it suggests are penetrating and sane ... even if, at times, wrong!Dahl is an eminent political scientist, and his aim (mainly) is to show the extent to which the current version of the Constitution is far less democratic than we sometimes imagine. Not only is it NOT the world-wide model for democratic development that we fondly imagine it to be, but newly-democratising countries routinely reject the American model, precisely because of its anti-democratic tendencies. This is clearly not the view we get in our High Schools, where mindless Constitution worship is the order of the day; and where any suggestion that we could learn from the rest of the world is regarded as a malign, domestic strand of Anti-Americanism!Dahl's question never even arises in U.S. History courses where the standard treatment is to regard The Constitution as a Sacred Document akin to The Ten Commandments:The divinely inspired Framers simply bequeath it to a (clueless but) grateful People!That said, however, Dahl's perception of the historical development of the U.S. Constitution is somewhat skewed. For, it is clear even in his own account of the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention (given here), that the Constitution was NEVER intended to be \\"democratic\\". Its aim was, simply, to create an Aristocratic Republic; one which hedged its bets whenever possible on the troublesome question of \`popular' input. If you doubt that then simply reflect on the two most undemocratic aspects of the American system: the Presidency (the Electoral College vote trumps the popular vote every time); and the Senate (popularly elected only since the Seventeenth Amendment, 1913). Indeed, the Senate is so profoundly un-democratic that Dahl rightly castigates it as \\"the graveyard of constitutional amendments\\" aiming to end the abominable electoral college system (p. 87). And that's just the most obvious of the Senate's failings!The great beauty of Dahl's little book is that even if you disagree with it, you win! It is impossible not to be improved by reading this work! The author writes in an accessible, jargon-free style that draws you in; and the spiders-web of interlocking questions followed by clear and clever analyses will keep you reading to the end.In the midst of our current wrangles about activist judges it is sometimes assumed that the Constitution is a mere passive backdrop. Dahl's work will cure you of that mis-perception, and of the assumption that a critical appreciation of the Constitution necessarily validates judicial review! It doesn't.In a culture dominated by the most mindless kinds of Constitution-worshipping cant, this book stands apart. It is probing and critical without being mean-spirited or irreverent. The questions it raises don't subvert the Constitution, or the Framers; they strengthen our appreciation of both.A rara avis indeed: a book for the intelligent layman that does not treat us like dummies."},{"Title":"How Democratic Is the American Constitution?

While his Preface to Democratic Theory is more remarkable in its sheer audacity (a bold critique of Madisonian (i.e. American) democracy), these lectures offer a unique insight into two of the strangest aspects of our system. While other reviewers are correct to note that the American system is not, technically, a democracy, Dahl's point is not historical, but prescriptive. Based on the assumption that we should be a democracy (the form of government we promote around the world), Dahl seeks to clarify how we might alter the current Constitution to make our system more democratic. Any criticism of this book that takes issue with Dahl's discussion of how to make America more democratic misses the point. This book is about how to make a functional democracy, and uses as its example the pseudo-democratic American system."},{"Title":"How Democratic Is the American Constitution? (Castle Lectures in Ethics, Politics, and Economics)","review":"The constitution and constitutional law have always interested me. Further, it has always seemed to me that the cliche &quot;We're not a democracy. We're a democratic republic,&quot; was always a subterfuge for denying (while acknowledging) a paradoxical truism. Dahl's extended essay goes a long way in showing that to be correct.Are we more of a republic or a democracy. Dahl thinks that we have more elements of the former. Using the electoral college, &quot;first past the post&quot; as opposed to proportional senate representation, and the fact that the senate and the president (in the original constitution) were more-or-less picked by federal and state legislatures. So in this sense, as that of any good history book, the founders were not the believers in democracy that high school civics has us believe.Through all of this, Dahl makes some interesting suggestions. Why shouldn't the senate be abolished. It's raison d'etat, after all, seems to be to give unequal representation (2 members per state regardless of size), and create a more 'enlightened' (6 years, 35 yr. of age minimum) house. But why couldn't a unicameral system, used in most democratic countries, work? Also, he proposes that any house be proportionally represented. Parties send out ballots with a list of candidates, people vote for the party they'd like to see, and each party seats according to percentage of votes. Biproduct? This would get rid of our dead-horse two party system. He suggests some others, but I don't want to spoil the suprise.Still, Dahl's book is quite flawed. It is extremely one sided. Dahl doesn't even try to give arguments for the electoral college. Well, first, there's the very fact that we are the UNITED STATES of America. If we went by straight popular vote, the state lines would become a mere formality and we might-as-well federalize the whole process. While I agree that it should be set up proportionally rather than winner-take-the-state, it is important, especially during elections, to treat states as sacrosanct entities, not just inconveniences. Dahl talks a lot about the Federalist, but has he read the Anti-Federalist, where a lot of these arguments are made (and ironcially, it is chock full of the democratic sentiment Dahl so admires).Final flaw - Honestly, Dahl did not do enough explaining as to why democracy is worth striving for. To some, it may seem self evident but often they confuse the concept of civic equality, freedoms of speech and press, and material equality with democracy. In fact, Dahl gets these confused constantly. Especially in the last chapter where, when he asks &quot;is democracy desirable?&quot; he answers &quot;Yes, civic equality is desirable&quot; but fails to answer the question asked.All in all, this book is insightful, challenging, and worth reading (It won't take long). Just make sure you take Dahl's comments at face value. It may be good to counter some of the arguments with those found in the Ant-Federalist papers."},{"Title":"How Democratic Is the American Constitution?

(Castle Lectures in Ethics, Politics, and Economics)","review":"No matter what you may think of Dahl's views in this book, certainly it can be agreed upon that he provides and interesting and refreshing look at the U.S. Constitution. He brings up a few aspects of the Constitution that he believes are not so democratic in nature. These include the equal Representation amongst states in the U.S. Senate, the Electoral College system, and the broad judicial review powers that exist today that often trump the other two branches. Dahl's stated goal isn't necessarily to demand change, but rather, to provide a different perspective to make the citizenry view their Constitution as a tool of democratic principles. He doesn't believe citizens should simply view the document as something perfectly written and infallible. He reminds readers that the writers of the Constitution were only human themselves, and were subject to the same political compromises and considerations as politicians today. Overall a very good read."},{"Title":"How Democratic Is the American Constitution? (Castle Lectures in Ethics, Politics, and Economics)","review":"Mr Dahl claims he does not intend to propose changes to the Constitution, but, rather, changes in how we think about it. Since he appears ignorant of his subject, I find him unqualified to suggest either.Howbeit disrespectful of the powers of the States - and the people's rights as citizens of the States - the Framers were, they still knew of those powers and rights, and much of what they did and said - and what they did not do or say - was affected by that knowledge - a knowledge Mr Dahl either lacks or disrespects.Many of the faults found with the Constitution share a source: the fact that many powers that have been arrogated by the \\"federal\\" government belonged to the States, at the time of the Constitutional Convention. The franchise, for example, was defined and controlled at the state level and the central government had no business trifling with it. Slavery was a matter of property law - a body of law over which the central government had no power. (Indeed, the amendment eventually adopted as the fifth prohibits expropriation except as accompanied by compensation or due process; even with compensation or due process, the property must be taken for public use - an eventuality unlikely to appeal to the average slave of the time.)The time to discuss this separation of power - this check on central power - was in an early chapter of Mr Dahl's effort, and he failed even to hint at the power of the States, let alone to comment on their importance in balancing the power of the central government.While Mr Dahl's book may have a certain curiosity value, to those who need to know how not to write political history, I found it worthless to anyone with an honest interest in his stated subject."},{"Title":"How Democratic Is the American Constitution?

It is a constitution and the people who defend it that keep in line the greedy politicians and their followers. It is great that this guy is trying to use his head and come up with some ideas of his own. Sometimes, however we all just need to come to the realization that there are people whose intelligence is so profound that the creations of their minds can never be obsolete. The Constitution is certainly one of these. The document that Dahl proposes we do away with has been the cornerstone and blueprint for the greatest nation in the world. Following it's outline we have produced this monument in record time. In the short period between 1800 - 1920 the United States went from a few undeveloped states to the most industrialized and productive nation in the world. The system that it describes had been perfected over thousands of years. Unfortunately, with ideas such as the one proposed in this book, it will not be long before the wrecking ball comes out of the blnding light of BS(Globalization, &quot;freetrade&quot;, UN, NATO, GATT, WTO, World Bank, IMF and Social Democracy)and destroys the only true &quot;Wonder&quot; of modern civilization.

(Castle Lectures in Ethics, Politics, and Economics)","review":"This slim little book has a single, narrow objective, and, with commendable consistency, it refuses to stray. The focus is simple, and given in the very title: How democratic is the American Constitution? The answer, which it deliberately and relentlessly drives home, is, \\"Not very.\\"It is with this point that a lot of the reviewers seem to take issue, and let no potential buyer be mistaken: this is the only topic Dahl discusses in this book. He does not wish to argue why absolute and unimpeded democracy should be pursued. Nor does he bother discussing the virtues of whatever checks to pure mob rule America employs. Certainly, he believes that America should have less impediments to democracy--a notion most apparent toward the end--but that is more of an undercurrent to his thought than an inherent element to the argument at hand.Hence, Dahl points to the Electoral College, the Senate, the Supreme Court, and a variety of other elements of American government only with the intent of proving how they are undemocratic, and how they should be if the American Constitution strove for unfettered democracy. That the Senate, for instance, may be a legitimate tool of federalism as a nod toward state existence is irrelevant; the very notion of federalism is undemocratic, as it creates a source of legitimacy not founded in the people, and consequently it comes under fire. Anyone looking for plausible arguments of why democracy should have limits, and why there should be a Supreme Court capable of curtailing the will of the people (if indeed it can for any respectable period of time) should look elsewhere. It is unfair to this book's streamlined purpose to expect tangential discussion of why democracy is good or bad in a given case.The question that it does strive to answer, however, it does clearly and concisely, and for this point alone should enjoy one's reading."},{"Title":"How Democratic Is the American Constitution?

In other words, the US Constitution by definition is not particularly sacred if the democratic behavior and mores are not embedded in society."},{"Title":"How Democratic Is the American Constitution? (Castle Lectures in Ethics, Politics, and Economics)","review":"The author in a very low-key manner invites the reader to examine along with him the basic structure of the Constitution as it has impacted democracy in America. He is certainly aware that for some any questioning of the Constitution is nothing short of a sacrilege. Others are smugly certain that the subject is irrelevant because in their view the U.S. is actually a republic, not a democracy, which of course contradicts the fact that &quot;We the People&quot; established the United States.While the author invests little time in formally defining democracy, it would seem that the ability for all adult citizens broadly conceived to equally participate in the political process at some basic level is essential for democracy. Whether due to the lack of a model of democracy to follow, the need for compromise among various interests, or a mistrust of ordinary citizens, the framers created some significant non-democratic structures and understandings within the Constitution. Obviously, the failure to outlaw slavery looms largest; only a minority of citizens were given voting rights in 1788; and elections of the president and senators were not directly based on popular votes. The author laments the fact that historically it has been most difficult to gain passage of Constitutional amendments that address these kinds of issues, being subject to blockage by the disproportionately powerful seventeen smallest states in the Senate.It is a misfounded conceit on the part of many Americans that the Constitution shines worldwide as the one political document that should be and is copied. The author goes to great pains to dissect that view. Among the oldest twenty-two democracies in the world, few have adopted the U.S. system of federalism, bicameral legislatures, an independent presidency, and a judiciary that can supercede national legislative actions. The author takes particular note of the fact that most other democracies employ a system of proportional representation whereby legislatures are populated by political parties based on a percentage of total votes. It would seem that the potential for representation of multiple interests within party coalitions is far greater than in a winner-take-all system where it is quite conceivable that minority interests would have no actual representation.The author makes abundantly clear that regardless of constitutional structures, the prospects for democracy within a polity rests on a supportive and engaged culture. The rise of Jeffersonian democracy in the early 1800s was through the actions of the general citizenry. But the inequality of resources essential for equal political participation in today's society concerns the author. The domination of political information by vast media empires and the financing of elections by the rich does not bode well for democratic participation.The Constitution is perhaps flawed - far from ideal - but it is the distortion of the political process by the powerful that is most worrisome. Of course, that power imbalance is, in turn, based on an inconsistent representation structure disinclined to produce remedial legislation."},{"Title":"How Democratic Is the American Constitution?

Wright Mills, and by his history of politics in the city of New Haven.There has been a falling off in the quality of his work in recent years, although sometimes the old fire is still there. In this book, I suspect, he is trying too hard to be accessible.One of his points in this book is that the judicial review of legislative actions has gone too far -- federal judges regularly usurp the proper province of elected officials. This view, of course, is shared by many on both the left and the right. Each side believes, naturally enough, that the courts that strike down its favorite statutes are tyrannically usurping power.In his discussions of judicial review, Dahl essentially alludes to issues that require careful consideration. His allusions just contribute to his display of populist values and pessimism about their implementation. They aren't analytically helpful."},{"Title":"How Democratic Is the American Constitution? (Castle Lectures in Ethics, Politics, and Economics)","review":"Robert Dahl does a fairly good job of raking up the dry grass from previous commentaries on the U.S. Constitution. From this grass, Dahl constructs a strawman, that democracy is virtually synonymous with political equality, then concludes that our political culture stands in the way of any significant reform either of the written or unwritten constitution. Though he dispatches the tension between political equality and liberty with a fairly thin argument, he fails to consider the tension between political equality and individualism (dare I say, equity) and justice (particularly transformative justice where some attention might be given to the principle of subsidiarity).In short, this book is a quick read for identifying criticisms raised by earlier scholars, but Dahl's narrow defintion of democracy and failure to tell us how he proposes to increase the availability of \\"resources\\" leaves this reader wondering where hope resides for increased democratization under the existing constitution?Might increased democratization of our constitutional system of government rest more squarely on dealing with the depreciation of social capital (see Robert Putnam's Bowling Alone for further reflections on Tocqueville's portrait of America)? Then again, we might conduct a postmortem on the impact of the Democratic Party's use of proportional representation in 2008, both parties use of presidential primaries, and the role of a commentariat that occupies such privileged position in a mass media based almost exclusively on consumerism. These and other areas of inquiry, while they lay outside the focus of the written constitution, speak more to Dahl's efforts to seek opportunities for reform in the \\"unwritten constitution\\". I hope that he and others will turn their considerable talent on such alternatives in the future."},{"Title":"How Democratic Is the American Constitution?

It is, however, only useful information for those accustomed to thinking instead of ranting."},{"Title":"How Democratic Is the American Constitution? (Castle Lectures in Ethics, Politics, and Economics)","review":"Here's another book that mistakes egalitarian populism for democracy, mistakes equality for equity and allows altruism to override intelligence. It advocates populism over democracy. Dahl correctly assesses the Constitution to be based on democratic principles in a limited fashion, foregoing majority rule for preservation of property rights, adversity to factions and checks against control by either monarchists or demagogues. Unhappily, this system, so carefully set up by the founding fathers, led by James Madison, is now under attack by populists like Dahl.Dahl asks whether we have a republic or a democracy, ruling in favor of a not very democratic republic. He claims that Madison grew out of his fear of majority rule. That's not likely. He says that the Constitution would have been different if written in 1820. We could make the same claim for 1965 and add thank heaven that the Constitution is not being rewritten faster than it is. He wants to emulate other countries that he claims have more democratic governments. In many cases Social Democrats have morphed into communists.Tocqueville's observation of equality of condition is truthful. He didn't excuse it as modern populists do as a cover for pretended goal of equality of opportunity. Dahl uses Benjamin Franklin as a metaphor for James Madison. He thinks Franklin didn't know as much science as those who followed him, just as Madison was backward in democratic politics. In fact Maxwell and Faraday and others never pretended to know more science than Franklin as Dahl pretends to improve on Madison's political outlook.Dahl claims that the Constitution overestimates the danger of majority popular rule whereas by now it should be clear that danger is decidedly underestimated. He totally neglects property rights, makes little mention of federalism. states rights or separation of powers. He fails to observe that rule of law is becoming a joke as rule of lawyers. The liberal attack on constitutionality is based more on righteousness than logic or history. It sanctions robbing Peter to pay Paul in the name of egalitarianism.Dahl applauds the 17th amendment that changed legislative appointment of Senators to popular election. Senators are now no more than at large representatives. The utility of a bicameral legislature has largely disappeared. We observe a great degradation in quality of Senators since the 17th amendment was passed. Now the attack is against the electoral college, somewhat quaint, but serving us well as perhaps the last bullwark against popular election. Overemphasizing the compromise that resulted in equal representation for states, Dahl says votes in Wyoming count more than in California. Elimination of the electoral college would yield the opposite result. Imagine the power of Los Angelinos in a national election decided by popular majority.The book does a good job of describing and promoting the advantages of a parliamentarian system with coalition government over the fractious rabble government that ours has become. However, it's hard to get the the connection with democracy as the rest of the book promotes majority control, which the founding fathers strove to avoid. Parliamentary systems have a history of yielding excessive power to extremist fringe groups that can be needed to form a majority coalition.The tide of history is now with the populists. It's enough to turn me into a monarchist as a matter of self defense. Unfortunately the inevitable reaction to populism is fascism. All that power will someday be in the hands of a totalitarian government as writers like Dahl get their way and our once great country declines into socialism or worse."},{"Title":"How Democratic Is the American Constitution?

(Castle Lectures in Ethics, Politics, and Economics)","review":"The popularly held myth that the American Constitution is the beacon of global democracy blatantly disregards democratic norms in several instances. Robert Dahl, a Sterling Professor Emeritus of Yale University and former President of the American Political Science Association, examines the ways in which the Constitution does not practice equality of representation. Most notably, both the Senate and the Electoral College distort the value of votes, resulting in votes from Wyoming worth four times that of votes in California. Dahl discusses alternative systems of representation and presents viable solutions to making the United States a stronger democracy.Response:One of the primary strengths of Dahl's book, its accessibility, also produces a consistent lack of depth throughout the book. For example, Dahl summarizes the debate between parliamentary and presidential systems for new democracies in only a few pages. Any student of electoral systems will desperately want more depth. However, an academic review of the literature on systems of representation would undoubtedly bore many to tears. In other words, the book's briefness provides accessibility that may be more important than an irrefutable review of the vast work already done on these topics. His book lacks in depth and his specific arguments suffer because of it. However, his primary point that the Constitution is not as democratic as popular opinion claims is supported effectively.While Dahl does discuss the Senate and the Electoral College at length, he does not address major counterarguments in support of these institutions. For example, popular vote by majority at a national scale creates a highly inefficient voting system, resulting in a greater probability of human error. Recounts also become highly problematic at a national scale. Dahl simply does not address these issues. While he does effectively argue against the fear of majority rule and provide substantial evidence that many of the Framers recanted their positions against majority rule after the implementation of the Constitution, other counterarguments go unaddressed.Unfortunately, Dahl's third primary critique of the current American political system, the Supreme Court, receives a cursory examination. Dahl contends that the Supreme Court's ability to essentially legislate through judicial review gives it undeserved power that should be left to the legislature. Dahl does not mention that the Justices to the Supreme Court are held indirectly accountable to the electorate through nomination by the President and approval of Congress. Instead of providing an analysis on whether or not this indirect accountability to the electorate is effective, he simply ignores it.Bottom Line:This book should be required reading for every college freshman. If you cannot readily list several ways that the Constitution is not democratic and why, put this book at the top of your reading list. Keep in mind that this book is an incredibly brief overview of complex topics that do not lend themselves to easy solutions through policy and that Dahl clearly advocates for certain policy prescriptions. His prescriptions may not be ideal and should not be adopted without an extensive review of the full range of literature.For more reviews and a summary of Dahl's main points, find us at Hand of Reason."},{"Title":"How Democratic Is the American Constitution?

It focuses on bringing up certain questionable areas of democracy contained in our constitution and given possible solutions. As a book that introduces or reintroduces certain political concepts, this book is thought-provoking throughout and well worth reading. It better aquaints one with the American system of government through open questions and then tries to add fuel to age old question of the best type of constitution. Plato and Aristotle introduced us to such a question and Dahl continues the never ending game of what is the best structure by which a political system should be based. This is a great book to read."},{"Title":"How Democratic Is the American Constitution? (Castle Lectures in Ethics, Politics, and Economics)","review":"This book starts by placing the American constitution in its historical and social context. By using contemporary documents the author determines what the drafters of the constitution were trying to achieve, which was essentially a massive compromise. What they were producing was never intended to be a democratic set of rules, quite the converse. The idea that the country should be a democracy very quickly gained ground, but the damage to true democracy had already been done by the enormous compromises made in the constitution, for example slavery, states having the decision as to how to elect representatives, unequal representation in the senate, a president who is both head of state and the leader of the government and who is elected not by a popular vote but by an unrepresentative electoral college. The author eloquently explains that there was no model for a democratic republic at the time so the framers were feeling their way in the dark. There also seems to have been an inordinate amount of discord as to what a republic actually is. Certainly our modern day concept that a republic is the opposite of a monarchy doesn't seem to have been the accepted rule then. So the constitution is in many ways an anachronism, attempting to achieve goals which long ago became obsolete (in some cases within a few years of the drafting of the constitution) while damaging democracy in the modern world. To view the constitution as a masterpiece of political insight made by a group of matchless wonder kind is a gross misrepresentation of the facts, as well as historically inaccurate. So how has the constitution served? The answer can only be poorly. People who value freedom and democracy as much as Americans do deserve something better surely? Many alternatives, drawn from various constitutions, are debated here. The solution seems to be, as ever, proportional representation. However you view it PR produces good government which is also truly representative and therefore truly democratic."},{"Title":"How Democratic Is the American Constitution?

However, I'm not convinced the US should adopt proportional representation. (Although perhaps the first-past-the-post system could be modified. For example, a run off election if no candidate garners more than 50% of the vote.)

Halperin has taken up some overlooked and understudied sources and explored them in depth and at length for what they tell us about the relationship between literati and Buddhist temples during the Sung dynasty, complicating previous assumptions about that relationship in the process. Instead of falling into the common pitfall of much academic writing today (grand sweeping theoretical generalizations and endless methodological mullings), he builds his case carefully and gradually from these primary sources, commemorations for temple renovation projects written by literati at the request of Buddhist monks. Confining his study to this one genre gives the book focus, but also proves intriguing in that by considering these scattered and various commemorations, a genre one might assume to be generic and dull with little to tell us, he uncovers patterns and paradoxes while unearthing large swaths of social history and significant shifts in religious attitudes and institutional development--and by the end of it, you'll never be able to blithely characterize the dynasty simplistically as one of Confucian rise and Buddhist fall ever again.There are a lot of little things about the book too that stand out. The one chapter on T'ang dynasty commemorations serves its purpose of contrasting with the Sung dynasty commemorations so as to highlight the latter's unusual characteristics, but it's also interesting in and of itself in showing the educated layman's grasp of Buddhist doctrine and devotion to Buddhist deities. The mutual interpenetration of Buddhism and the Imperial cult, the degree to which Sung Emperors were divinized, and the role of Buddhist temples throughout the empire in establishing commoner consciousness of the political/religious center were all new and fascinating topics (for me, at least). And it was nice to get a glimpse of the lives and ideas of literati not on the \\"top ten list\\"--educated and politically active men of some distinction other than Chu Hsi, Chou Tun-i, or the Ch'eng brothers--not that these latter guys aren't interesting or important, but with this book I got a more concrete sense of how their ideas were affecting their peers and society at large.Prospective readers of this fine book should keep in mind that it is a pretty specialized study in some ways. As someone with some familiarity with East Asian history and religion, I still found that Halperin was assuming knowledge on his reader's part that I didn't have (or did have but in a fuzzy, vague state). Most of this had to do with the ups and downs of Sung history, and if you're rusty on this you might want to give yourself a quick review. Also, he keeps referring to what I would identify as \\"Neo-Confucianism\\" with the term \\"Tao-hsueh\\"--I'm not sure what is at stake in not using the standard English term, but perhaps there are good reasons (why not then be consistent and render \\"Buddhism\\" in Chinese as well?)--if so, a quick explanation of the reasoning behind this terminological choice may have been in order, at least in a footnote, for the sake of those of us not \\"in the know\\". None of this detracts from the book, of course, and the author's overall argument is still quite clear if you have a reasonable level of background knowledge.In short, this is a valuable and well-written study grounded in extensive and careful work with primary texts all substantiating an important, overarching point. Anyone curious about how Buddhism actually functions in society should find it indispensable."},{"Title":"For All the Wrong Reasons: A Novel","review":"This book started out interesting and then got bogged down by Ms. Bagshawe's repetitivenes.The novel tells the story of Diana, a spolied and beautiful English woman who marries Ernie. Ernie is not an upper-class man, but has become quite wealthy as a corporate raider type in a big publishing firm. Together they move to New York City where Diana becomes a society wife while Ernie becomes even more ruthless in business. During the course of Ernie's business dealings, he meets Michael Cicero, a small publisher of children's books. He takes a dislike to Michael and vows to destroy him.Meanwhle, Diana and Ernie's marriage falls apart and Diana is left humiliated and penniless. Somehow, she manages to fend for herself and begins working with Michael. A love affair of course ensues.It makes for a fast read but is very much spoiled by repetitiveness. Bagshawe must provide at least a hundred descriptions of Diana's beauty, Michael's attraction to Diana, and Diana's attraction to Michael. This gets very old and makes the story drag on and on.A fair try but is in desperate need of more imaginaion and good editing."},{"Title":"For All the Wrong Reasons: A Novel","review":"I picked out this book and really liked how the back cover sounded so set to reading it right away... I was disapointed.. the story although good and funny at parts lacked any warmth or empathy for the characters.

And frankly I don't need to hear how perfect her breasts are one more time, give us a little more depth next time."},{"Title":"For All the Wrong Reasons: A Novel","review":"Diana Foxton marries publisher Ernie for money, hoping that the love will come along later if she provides a great home for him. After expressing boredom, she asks one of his new managers for a position in his office. Michael is not really enthusiastic about hiring British Diana as he thinks she is too cold and unfeeling.Michael also does not realize that the plum contract he signed with Ernie will render him penniless, as Ernie is a known shark, and plans to steal Michael's business out from under him.Shocked that Ernie has a predilection S&M;, as well as a mistress at the office, Diana immediately leaves him, and confides in what she thinks is her best friend. Of course, Felicity soon takes advantage and moves in on Ernie. Just as Diana is served with divorce papers, Michael has the rug pulled out from underneath him and he is bitter. The divorce pretty much leaves her broke.Shortly thereafter, Diana seeks him out for a reference. He gives her another chance, and soon the two become partners in creating education game software. After a few sleepless nights, the two become more than partners in the office, but because both have been hurt and are not ready to fully express the depth of their feelings, they part and start to see others. Diana meets up with a real estate mogul (which further enhances Michael's feelings that she is just after money); while Michael takes up with the trampy office secretary.Ernie soon finds out about their enterprise and tries to ruin the two again - his feelings are that once he has knocked someone down, they need to stay there. Michael and Diana are ready for him this time. They soon start to question the chemistry between each other and try to come to terms with whether or not they want to be together once and for all, and whether it is for all the right reasons."},{"Title":"For All the Wrong Reasons: A Novel","review":"What a dull book, you will understand the entire story after the first chapter.

I haven't read anything by this author previously and certainly wouldn't seek out another story."},{"Title":"For All the Wrong Reasons: A Novel","review":"Okay, at first I was really enjoying this book. Diana Foxton is a British woman who got married to her husband just cause he is rich, and then it turns out he was cheating on her. Even though it was quite obvious, I mean she had to be really naive!! But after she left the guy the book went from Jackie Collins type sleazy to over the top Harrelquin type sleazy!! I mean all she and Micheal did besides build their business, is go to bed together. Other then that, what chemstry did they have??? It was also kind of fake how Ernie suddenly lost everything, I mean I know he was cutthroat and defintely had it coming, but how many cutthroat New York busiessmen really get what they deserve?? Plus, this book is just like a Jackie Collins novel, except it takes place in New York instead of Hollywood, is mainly about rich businessmen and their wives/girlfriends instead of celebrites,and there is no drug use. In other words, if you want a great steamy novel read Jackie Collins, the true author of that genre!"},{"Title":"For All the Wrong Reasons: A Novel","review":"I simply ADORED this book!

And keep the faith in these difficult times.Greetings from the Netherlands, Europe!"},{"Title":"ROUTE 66","review":"&#65533;Route 66 came closer than any other highway to becoming the National Road.&#65533;&#65533;And in the halcyon days of US 66, it became the most magical road in all the world.&#65533;I grew up about 1 mile from Route 66 in San Bernardino, California, and loved to hear the name of our town in the famous Bobby Troup song. I was even more thrilled when I found Route 66 in The Grapes of Wrath.But the ultimate for me was when the television series, Route 66, ran from 1960-64.For anyone with nostalgia or curiosity about Route 66 in its heyday, this pictorial tribute will be very rewarding. I recommend the book for personal pleasure, as a gift to those who loved Route 66, and to show to your children who missed the experience of this great road.Many more dimensions of Route 66 are captured here than in any other book I have seen, including:the speed traps; gangsters who made their getaways on the road; Burma Shave signs; water bags on car radiators; Phillips 66 gasoline signs; buses; diners; motels; and truck stops. To add to this color, you see photographs of classic automobiles and motorcycles, tourist sights, bridges, gas stations, drive-in theaters, and meet many of the famous people who operated well-known businesses along the route.Route 66 started in the east in downtown Chicago, near the headquarters of the Santa Fe Railway (the company where my father worked), and there&#65533;s a nice photograph of the building here. You then mosey through Illinois (including Mitchell, Illinois), Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California through to Santa Monica. Each state&#65533;s section shows you the names of the key towns passed through, the mileage to each one, and visual highlights from many of these areas.For my own home area, I was delighted to see a nice section on Cajon Pass, just a few miles northwest of my childhood home, a photograph of the Wigwam Motel in Rialto (about 10 miles away) where I always wanted to stay overnight on my birthday (until I found out how expensive it was to stay in a small concrete teepee), and the first McDonald&#65533;s restaurant on E Street in San Bernardino (about a mile from my home) where I began eating fast food hamburgers and those great french fries in 1948.Sadly, the Interstate Highway program was begun in 1956 and began to replace Route 66. Two of the first sections were from San Bernardino to Los Angeles and Barstow (through Cajon Pass). We loved the speed of the new roads, and our lives have been busier and faster ever since. Sometimes when I&#65533;m back in Southern California, I&#65533;ll take a slow, relaxing drive however down Foothill Boulevard, which was Route 66 in this area. I enjoy those trips enormously!Route 66 was decertified as a federal highway in 1985. You will still find signs along parts of its route letting you know you are on &#65533;historical Route 66.) The roads glories are fading now, as the many seedy motels and rundown diners will show you in this book.But, if you should be near any of these sights, take time to go see them. And say hello to the people described in the book who operate them. I particularly recommend the Genuine Giant in Elwood, Illinois.What did you enjoy doing when you were young that is disappearing today? Have you taken time lately to stir up a little reunion with those happy experiences?Stop, look, and listen . . . for America&#65533;s romance with the open road!"},{"Title":"ROUTE 66","review":"This pictorial contains hundreds of photographs of old Route 66.

This is more than a coffee-table book. It contains ample text describing the history of the road, the story of some of the people who owned businesses along the highway, how and when the road was supplanted by the Interstate Highway System, and driving tips for those who want to try to follow surviving stretches of the original road today.There are also separate brief features describing the restaurants, truck stops, cars, motorcycles, semis, gas stations, and motels that were all a part of Route 66 during its mid-century heyday.Looking at all of the pictures of the wide-open spaces of the sun-splashed Southwest is a great way to \\"get your kicks\\" on a cold, gloomy day."},{"Title":"ROUTE 66","review":"We bought this book to use as a gift to raffle off at one of our car shows. The recipient was very very happy, trust me."},{"Title":"Accident;: A novel","review":"A plot description of \\"Accident\\" might make it seem like a conventional mystery/thriller novel, and yet it is not that at all. It's not a thriller (though it is a sort of moral and metaphysical mystery) and it is certainly not conventional. Mosley's use of language is innovative without being obscure -- he uses the rhythms of his words, sentences, and sentence fragments both to create suspense and to force the reader to pay as much attention to what is not being said and thought as what is (it's no surprise that the book was made into a film with a script by Harold Pinter).\\"Accident\\" begins with a car accident. The narrator of the book, who we soon discover is a professor of philosophy at Oxford, lives near the accident site and is the first person on the scene. He discovers in the car a half-conscious woman and a dead man, both of whom are students of his. He carries the woman to his house, then calls the police. But he doesn't tell them about the woman.The book moves backwards in time from there, and we get to know who these characters are and their tangled relationships to each other. At the end, we return to the accident, now fully understanding all of the forces playing into the situation.The book is not quite 200 pages long, and yet its texture is so rich, its moral and philosophical questions so difficult, its language so perfect that it lives in the reader's (or, at least, this reader's) mind as books of twice its length do not."},{"Title":"Accident;: A novel","review":"This is a fantastically compact little novel that does not receive near enough praise these days despite its early critical acclaim. It is also a nice example of writing style reflecting its narrative content as the text becomes more frenetic and disjointed as the characters become drunk, rashly conspiratorial, or clear. Mosely's choice of moving in and out of stream-of-conscious writing is a great technical feat as it serves to emphasize plot points rather than flex literary muscles.The plot itself is very direct. The protagonist is an Oxford professor trying to reconstruct his relationship with his students and his family while considering the best way to react to a car accident which has already taken the life of one student and might imprison another. His meditation on the eagerness of the past, the resignation of the present, and the balance between what might be and what is all lead to his course of action immediately following the accident. A pervasive theme is the loss of fidelity, as the professor betrays the trust placed in him by his wife, his friends, his students, and his student's parents, the consequences of which are made clear to him the night of the crash. However, it is the potential consequence rather than the actual consequence which is of interest.I would highly recommended to anyone who enjoys Pynchon, Ballard, Faulkner or any modernistic writer. Even if those names scare you, the book is still worth reading as it is well-paced and puts a human face to a philosophical question."},{"Title":"Fodor's Kenya and Tanzania, 1st Edition: The Guide for All Budgets Where to Stay, Eat, and Explore On and Off the Beaten Path (Fodor's Gold Guides)","review":"The coverage of Tanzania in this book is quite sparse.

Sooner or later, you run out of other people's money.\\" So said Margaret Thatcher and so said Ernest Bramah, over 100 years ago, though not is quite those words.This remarkable book examines a past that never came to be. In his England of 1907, Socialists have been voted into office on promises of a life of financial ease and safety. Over time, the benefits gradually expand to cover nearly every aspect of life - even unions' strike funds were obsoleted by the government's promise of guaranteed income. As the dole state expanded, so did the need for new funds to dole out.Then, in a carefully planned and meticulously executed civil action, a shadowy organization devises and carries out a boycott: No one will use coal. This would have had seismic effect on the economy of the day, driving the coalworks and miners out of business and onto the dole, followed by the coal distribution networks, the sweeps who cleaned chimneys of coal residues, and so on. The brilliance of this plan lay in preparation. Foreign governments, their own coal industries collapsed under cheap imported English coal, impose punitive tariffs. At a stroke, the foreign demand evaporated with so much of the domestic demand. At the same time, foreign suppliers of oil lamps, oil stoves, and most especially oil itself leap into the vacuum with huge supplies of their goods prepared in anticipation of the coal boycott. By the time the government imposes its own tariffs to block foreign energy, it's too late. The resistance has already stockpiled hundreds of millions of gallons, which they distribute to their membership at pre-tariff prices.The story lays out a brilliant plot for retaking the government using only civil and legal means - at least, until the government turns its guns on its own, only to find themselves outgunned. Today's reader will easily see the seeds of Rand'sAtlas Shruggedin this story, including a truly remarkable female character. Irene Lisle's job description never came clear, but sounds to a modern ear like office manager cum admin aide. A dramatic scene near the end, however, places her as the last holdout when the resistance office comes under siege, prepared to use any means at her disposal to safeguard the League's secrets and other personnel. I find this heroine boldly anachronistic - similarly strong women wouldn't become common until half a century later or more.Despite its age and serious content, this text speaks in a modern and droll voice. Although it gets off to a slighly comical start, that's just the lure to tempt a reader into its serious content. This has my highest recommendation. I'm looking for more by this author.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"More Pez for Collectors (A Schiffer Book for Collectors)","review":"You you want pictures and prices. This is your first book to buy.

His particular focus lies in the Federation of Conservative Students (FCS) and the relationships between individuals in that organisation and the many free market think tanks which gained prominence at the time mainly due to the evidence of economic failure confronting the ideas forged by the Keynsian consensus. One of the particular strengths of the book is the placing of events within the context of a change in attitudes among the young in general in rejecting the consensual ideas of the past and seeking progress through libertarian ideas cutting across all sections of community. He rightly recognises the nature of the post-modern society in ideas which allow for individuals to choose their own path.The characters in the book are portrayed as bitter enemies even within the same party. I am constantly reminded of the anecdote of the novice Conservative MP who asks the old hand about dealings with the socialist enemy. The experienced man points out that the socialists are his opponents and it is some of those around him are his enemies. It seems however, that those involved were bitter opponents in a war of party political domination. In the end however, one wonders whether or not that really was the case and if indeed the battle was more about the means than the ends.Timothy Evans book rightly belongs with some of the other accounts of the time especially 'Thinking the Unthinkable' although the two are not directly linked. Looking ahead to a history of the Adam Smith institute, an autobiography of Chris Tame and Brian Mickelthwaite, and the stories of Arthur Seldon and Ralph Harris, which will add considerable insight to the remarkable turn of events which transformed Britain from the 1970's.My only reservation about this book actually lies in it's scope. Tim Evans only gives us half the story I am afraid. His focus on the FCS glosses over the developments which took place within the Young Conservatives at around the same time. Libertarian ideas were already around inside the Conservative Party. An account needs to be written of the Selsdon Group and the development of those ideas at every level to provide the complete picture. Perhaps Time Evans could write another book..."},{"Title":"MARIA CHAPDELAINE - Recit du Canada Francais","review":"When recalling the past we tend to idealize it, to view it with fondness and nostalgia, and to hold them up as the best of times. But the question becomes, were those times really that good? Why do we recall them with such fondness? Why do we hold them up as a paragon for how we should live our lives today? Invariably we find some fault or failing of or present age, something we wish we could change. We idealize and objectify the past, remembering the good and forgetting the bad. \\"Maria Chapdelaine\\" is hardly a nostalgic trip down memory lane. The Quebecois who populate the book are living a hardscrabble life that wouldn't seem out of place in the American South, and yet the simple life is all they know. Like Southerners the Quebecois life revolves around family, farm, and faith. In some respects \\"Maria Chapdelaine\\" reminds me of Margaret Mitchell's \\"Gone with the Wind\\"; both are reflections on a society that is passing from remembrance, which is being changed by outside influences and events. Both authors wrote their novels as their societies were beginning to change and adapt to modernity and outside influences and they both served as a means of capturing the essence of the world that was passing from memory. And much like \\"Gone with the Wind\\", \\"Maria Chapdelaine\\" is about the concept of place, how you are perceived by others, and the role of community in enforcing conformity. While there is considerable difference in the central characters, the themes remain similar. Maria has to make choices that are shaped and informed by the environment she lives in. While Scarlet is rebellious, Maria is chaste and demure, the embodiment of the ideal of womanhood for Quebecois. Like Scarlet, Maria is conflicted over potential suitors, the adventurous Francois Paradis, fellow neighbor Eutrope Gagnon, and Lorenzo Suprenant, who has rejected the country for the city. This troika of suitors represent the three directions Quebec was being pulled in. All three men are symbolic representations of Quebec: Francois representing Quebec's voyageur past, Eutrope the present, and Lorenzo the future. Maria's heart is truly with Francois (the past), but when he meets and untimely end Maria ultimately rejects Lorenzo (the future), settling instead for Eutrope (the present). The world around Maria seeks to ratify the status quo, to glorify the ideals of family, farm, and faith. While it appears Maria wants to break free of that life and transcend it, those thoughts are nothing more than passing fancies. The passing of her mother amidst the trapping of their hardscrabble existence should have been motivation for Maria to chose Lorenzo and leave her environs, yet she sees her mother as the embodiment of perfect womanhood and knows she must stay. While Scarlet is headstrong, impulsive, and pragmatic, Maria is stoic, contemplative, and something of an idealist. To leave her family and her place would be a betrayal. She is as much a part of the land as is Eutrope.In a sense \\"Maria Chapdelaine\\" is almost existential. Maria's community feels far removed from the outside world, as though forgotten and abandoned. The power's that control the characters destiny are far removed and detached, and there is little these characters can do to take matters into their own hands. They are left to their own devices and must cope with the world as best they can. You can learn as much about a society from reading the literature it produces as you can from reading its history and that is true here. Literature is not only a reflection of a society, but also its shared common heritage and values. Yet some themes are universal, which is what makes \\"Maria Chapdelaine\\" relevant and important. Maria seeks to belong to a community, to a place. She seeks the validation and ratification of those around her and seeks guidance from those institutions that are central to her life. The peer pressures of her community force conformity, meaning Maria stay in the community and marry Eutrope. We see a little of ourselves in both Maria, attempting to relate to changes in our world and grappling with challenges both great and small. We often see ourselves as living lives removed from the larger issues of the world, distant and removed. Yet with dignity and grace and humor we cope with those changes and look back on lessons learned with fondness."},{"Title":"Due Diligence Techniques and Analysis: Critical Questions for Business Decisions","review":"As someone who works in investment banking, I can say this book is applicable to much more than just due diligence. It can help an analyst through most financial analysis situations(assuming the user knows the basics of how to use and analyze financial statements). What's best about the book is that it goes beyond the theory and academic stuff and gets down to real &quot;how-to's&quot; and &quot;why's&quot;. He goes through every account that would appear on the three major financial statements and explains what to look for in them, how to find the answer if it's not readily apparent, what questions to ask and why the questions are important. He also thoroughly examines off-balance sheet, off-income statement and qualitative items that are essential to analysis. Beware, there are no numbers or examples to work through in this book. This book is quite literally one man's experience and intuition put into written form. If you understand that financial analysis is not as cut-and-dry as looking at well-prepared, fully forthcoming financial statements with all the info you need already given, then this book is just what you are looking for. It helps you get the right numbers to which you can apply meaningful financial analysis."},{"Title":"Due Diligence Techniques and Analysis: Critical Questions for Business Decisions","review":"Great Article!

Very good for inspiration before investigating."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"First, the title. The title is what originally caught my attention because it was so odd and weird. The second thing that caught my attention was the cover, which at the time was this really creepy image of a girl with long black hair hiding behind a broken wooden fence. Those two things got me in the front door of this book, and Shirley Jackson's deceptively simple lyrical prose made me stay.WHALITC is not a mystery suspense novel. Nor is it a gothic ghost story or a horror novel. And yet it contains all of these elements (as well as a dash of Robinson Crusoe, as well), told in an sly, secretive voice. WHALITC is, in fact, a State of Mind. Specifically, the state of mind of one Miss Mary Katherine Blackwood, also known as Merricat; the diabolically imaginative, shy, perversely funny, clever eighteen year old Woman Child, who tells the story of the tragic Blackwood family and their house just outside of a tiny village.Six years prior, most of the family was murdered by arsenic poisoning during their tea time. The eldest daughter, Constance, was tried and acquitted of the murder, during which time Mericat was placed in an orphanage, and their Uncle Julian, the only survivor of the poisonous meal because he didn't eat a lot, was crippled and confined to a wheelchair. Now the three Blackwoods live alone at the great house, but are completely cut off from the society of other people, who still regard them with suspicion and hate, believing that Constance has gotten away with murder.The Blackwoods are not only trapped inside of their great big house, but they are also trapped inside of their tiny, quietly desperate lives. Constance is trying to forget about the family's tragic past, while Uncle Julian is obsessed with trying to remember and record its every detail. Merricat, on the other hand, simply does not want to grow up, and prefers to spend her day talking to her cat, Jonas, and playing in her weird little fantasy world in which she has strange magical powers over her home and family.Merricat routinely has to venture out into town to buy groceries and check out books from the library, each time, though, she is met with ugly stares, hateful comments, and a general feeling that everybody is out to get her. The villagers are both appalled with the Blackwoods as well as secretively jealous of their beautiful house and wealth. And yet there is an unspoken truce between the Blackwoods and the villagers, one that seems to be growing more tenuous by the day.One day, their lives are altered forever by the arrival of Charles, a distant cousin who's family at first shunned the tragic Blackwoods. But for some reason, Charles wants to reconnect with his wealthier cousins and he brings to them a feeling of reconciliation and hope to their troubled lives. Charles not only looks like their dead father, but also seems to want to take his place and assume the role of father-figure, taking Constance for the role of wife and mother to the others. Constance sees Charles as a way for her to truly put the past behind her, while Uncle Julian sees him as an obstruction to his erratic and desperate recovery of his past.Merricat, on the other hand, regards Charles as a stranger, an enemy, a hostile demonic presence in her carefully constructed fairytale world. And she intends to stop him.This is a very strange and wonderful book. It goes places you would not expect. Merricat's perceptions of things are morbidly cute. One has to wonder if Wednesday Addams was not in large part based upon the goth cherub character of Merricat.The language of the book is deceptively simple, but incredibly evocative, bordering on the lyrical. The structure of the book, though, seems almost \\"stage like\\"...and as I was reading it I could almost imagine it as a stage play. I wonder if Jackson conceived of it as such, because it would work remarkably well on stage. The dialogue and structure really lends itself to what could be a very beautiful stage play if one were inclined towards such an adaptation.All in all, it's a weird, wonderful book and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I listened to this classic Shirley Jackson story in its unabridged audiobook format and the narrator did a terrific job bringing the story of Merricat and the remaining members of her family to life, her voice drips with atmosphere of the gothic drama. If you're an audiobook fan and appreciate a dread-filled slightly creepy family drama I highly recommend checking this one out.I don't want to give too much away because this is one of those character driven, slow burning, suspenseful stories that slowly reveals itself and is one you should really experience for yourself without knowing too much about its plot. When the story opens a young lady named Mary Katherine (Merricat) Blackwood is making her way through the village and you instantly know things are off-kilter. She is buying necessities for a sister who will not leave the house and is subjected to taunts, insults and/or fear from nearly all she encounters.She lives a lonely existence with her agoraphobic sister Constance and their ailing Uncle Julian. Merricat spends her time burying things, following her own strict rules to keep safe and helping Constance keep their home spotless. The rest of their family is dead. I'm not telling you how or why it happened (actually I'm still unclear about the why but I think I have it figured out). They are perfectly content and set in their routines despite their seclusion but it all gets screwed up when a greedy male cousin arrives and stirs up no end of trouble for the little family teetering on the edge of sanity.As little details are revealed through Merricat I really felt for her and understood her bouts of angry thoughts aimed at her neighbors, despite the fact that she seems to be quite happy to be the town outcast. She loves her kitty and her sister and they are all she seems to need in her world. The two however are keepers of dark secrets but I still felt for them to the very end.Filled with darkness and dread this isn't a horror novel but the writing haunted me. It was written way back in 1962 but feels timeless and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I am not sure how I came about choosing to read this classic of a book but I am so happy that I did.The first page immediately captivated me. Shirley Jackson wove this inviting yet creepy tale with such a haunting narrative. The main character is so delightfully strange, and being in her head hearing her strange thoughts about how she perceives the world she lives in is so entertaining.One impressive aspect of the writing of this book is how the author manages to create this atmosphere, making you want to delve in further, while keeping it so simple. The complexity is really in the technique she uses to construct the story.I have started to read this story now for a second time -I definitely recommend reading it twice, there are things to be noticed by a second read that you could not have noticed the first time around.Happy reading!"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"What a great read. Scary-weird-good.When I first started this one I was waiting for that 'hook me so I can't put this book down', thing, but that only lasted until 18-year-old Mary Katherine \\"Merricat\\" Blackwood, who is telling the story of the Blackwood family, made it home from town and I got to meet the rest of the family. I think that was about ten pages in.This is one I will read again.Jackson created a slowly rising fear, as I read, that all is not well with this family. And the ending did not disappoint.Susan Stec, author, The Grateful Undead: They're so Vein"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"My library book group discussed Shirley Jackson's psychological thriller 'We Have Always Lived in the Castle:' almost everyone liked the book and a lively discussion ensued - which if you are familiar with book group dynamics, you may know is a rare occurrence. The story: six years before the opening of the book, the entire Blackwood family save three, was murdered by arsenic at dinner. The surviving family members, Constance, the older sister who stood trial for the murder and was acquitted; Merricat, the younger sister who narrates the book; and Uncle Julian, who was poisoned but survives as an invalid, live in isolation in their big house on the edge of a village. The villagers shun and taunt the Blackwood family.Most of the book group participants had read Jackson's well-known short story, 'The Lottery', in which a village annually chooses a victim to be ritually stoned to death, a story which has disturbed generations of high school students and caused widespread outrage when it first appeared in the 'New Yorker' magazine in 1948. From this common American reading experience, we all knew that Jackson's writing has a dark tone and that she writes about the potential for evil in people. 'We Have Always Lived in the Castle' also explores that idea. The Blackwood household and the villagers mutually despise each other and are both capable of violence and cruelty towards each other in thought and actions.The book falls into the horror genre, with the elements of the outsider personality which becomes violent and while there is the spooky mansion looming over a poor village, this is not really a haunted house mystery. There are also elements of witchcraft in Merricat's strange rituals and burying of talismans to ward of intruders and protect her house.We wondered exactly what was the motive for the arsenic poisonings and although the book eventually reveals the poisoner, the author never explains why. We also wondered exactly what was the nature of the psychopathy of the narrator and hauled out the DSM but then decided a diagnosis didn't really matter to the overall understanding of the book.I would recommend this book to reading groups looking for something other than recent bestsellers and \\"psychological fiction\\" that is so popular with today's reading groups. It is available in paperback and there is a considerable body of literary criticism about the works of Shirley Jackson. Jackson inspired Stephen King and many other horror authors, so I would recommend it to King fans and fans of the horror genre.Note, added 2/13/2012 I changed the title of this review from \\"You Saw the Movie, Now Read the Book\\" because, as you can read in the comments below, this Shirley Jackson book was never made into a movie, although it would make a good one and it seems to be the prototype for so many horror movies about the weird family in the strange house in town. I was probably thinking of 'the Haunting of Hill House' when I wrote the review."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Merricat, the disturbed and disturbing teenage narrator of _We Have Always Lived in the Castle_, is a great invention. By turns shocking, ironic, and funny, she will have you thinking about her during work. Read the book."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"This is a really strange, unsettling book by a great American writer. It is a bit tough to figure our where the story is headed, but the plot and characterization make for an enjoyable ride."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"\\"We Have Always Lived in the Castle\\" came highly recommended by several people and for good reason. Jackson's short novel is tense and romantic with a Southern Gothic feel (I kept being reminded of Faulkner's \\"A Rose for Emily\\"). Anyone who has felt like an outsider can readily identify with the day-dream obsessed protagonist, Merricat (Mary Katherine), a \\"wandering\\" girl who cast spells, buries sacred objects and breaks things to protect her house and family, but more specifically to prevent any changes from entering her self-contained universe. When change enters her utopia in mud-covered boots her darker side blossoms and daydreams turn from flying to the moon on a winged horse to imagining everyone is dead except her sister. Death is a constant companion of this strange family. An unaccountable \\"accident\\" with arsenic killed the rest of their clan six years prior to the story, leaving the surviving sisters and their feebled Uncle Julian as social pariahs and suspected murderers in a small town which never forgives or forgets. Their large house becomes their own prison, an unchanging tomb that remains static from the day of the tragedy. This has been rewritten as a musical and a play, but I can easily see it as a film... anyone interested in working on the script?"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"As a fan of suspense and horror novels, I went through a Stephen King phase in my teens and twenties. As thrilled and chilled as I was by King's earlier work such as 'Salem's Lot and The Stand, I found his later entries more gory and less gripping. Wanting to move on, I didn't know whom to read next. Enter Shirley Jackson! Having read \\"The Lottery\\" in grade school, I was delighted to find \\"We Have Always Lived in the Castle\\" at my local library--a deservedly well-worn copy!I can't remember which writer coined the phrase \\"the banality of evil\\", but after meeting Mary Katherine Blackwood, I understand where it came from. \\"Merricat\\", as she is called, is the sister of an acquitted murderess--or so everyone thinks. The people of the village in the book demonize and scorn the Blackwoods, but do all three of the Blackwood kindred deserve their hatred? I warn you: only one might...What makes this book different and far more engaging than other horror novels is the way Shirley Jackson presents its story. Village life is presented in a sweetly ordinary and almost naive way by Merricat, despite the fact that the Blackwood family history is so terrifying. You won't forget the \\"Castle\\" easily after a visit!"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Creepy and compelling. This is a story about two sisters, their uncle, the mysterious deaths of the rest of their family, and a cousin who suddenly comes to visit.The younger sister \`Merricat' is the narrator. Her voice is unusual and at times disturbing, which adds to the creepy, dramatic tone of the story. The reader gradually learns the story of their past.If you like gothic, mysterious, old fashioned books, I highly recommend this."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Have you ever wondered what is inside old seemingly abandoned mansions, or ruins? Perhaps many of us grew up in the vicinity of a derelict building, and felt the creeping uneasiness when we approached the site. There it was, covered with moss and vine, pregnant with silence, with no birds singing anywhere near, with that special gloom hanging over the site; sun or no sun. A daredevil or two might have ventured inside, to be scared out of their wits. It's a similar atavism to the one displayed by any member of the Western civilization who enters the boneyard. We know that there is nothing there that means us any harm, and yet... I like to suppose that this was the source of inspiration, or at least one of such, for Shirley Jackson and her \\"We Have Always Lived in the Castle\\".Set somewhere in the XX century, judging from the technology, \\"We Have Always Lived in the Castle\\" might just as well be placed anywhere in time, for as usual with the stories of Mrs. Jackson, the setup is hardly relevant; it's the story that matters, not the packaging, which only helps explain why the stories outlived the author. A small village, and their small-minded villagers, or so it seems at the very beginning, and a mysterious site, with its equally mysterious inhabitants. When we start to read the novel, it's very hard to ascertain who is who and what is the heart of the matter, to speak in grahamgreenese. Only as we near the end of the book we start to understand what has happened and why, but Shirley Jackson holds us in suspense till the very end, with which I am most pleased. In many stories of Shirley Jackson, this one in particular, as much as in 'The Lottery', evil is the most normal occurrence, something not to be questioned, or fought upon; we accept it, somehow. I couldn't help moving back in time to the period when America was in its infant stage, and my imagination served images so well known from Washington Irving's \\"The Story of the Sleepy Hollow\\". Gothic as they were, both stories share a similar feeling.\\"We Have Always Lived in the Castle\\" has other, lighter, shades to it. In particular, we have an opportunity to enter the mind of a young girl, figuratively speaking. Girls have secrets, they have always had. Merricat, for instance, buries things. She has a hideout at the creek, behind the branches and bushes. She has her chants and mantras. She has her talismans, her precious treasures. She is polite and delicate, but also wild with combed hair but very uncombed thoughts and behavior. A very willful girl. It would never come to my male mind to react the way she does, but then, aren't we from different planets? That's all the charm - all these differences.As a side note, whoever designed the cover for this book should be feathered and tarred!"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"A fabulous book - crafted and memorable. Gothic but intelligent. Has stood the test of my time anyway - I have read and reread with much pleasure. Recommended."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"This is a much better book than The Haunting of.... The story just works better. I wasn't a big fan of Haunting. It wasn't \\"horror\\" and the movie versions weren't any better. A few things bumping in the night do not a horror story make, nor are they particularly engaging. However, these characters definitely are. Don't expect anything supernatural but the story is creepy. Also, having grown up in a town similar to that in the book, it's frustratingly realistic. I only gave it a 4 because of the end, which was something of a disappointment. It isn't an ending. It just ends. But, I could not really think of a more appropriate one."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"One of my book resolutions this year was to read and review more classics. I thought I would start off the year with a book that's had a big resurgence lately. Jackson's We Have Always Lived in the Castle is a twisted, quirky little book that raises more questions than it answers. What is normal? Who is the villain? How do we, as a society, create the very monsters we fear?The story is told from the perspective of 18 year old Mary Katherine Blackwood (Merricat), a mentally unstable but interesting girl who lives with her older sister and their aging uncle in a huge house outside of a small village. Merricat's sister, Constance, was accused of poisoning the rest of the family several years before but acquitted. Still, the town reviles the Blackwoods and abuses them to the point that Constance refuses to leave home. This leaves Merricat in charge of anything that involves going out in public and fuels her deep-seeded hatred of the villagers. Even with all of the turmoil the Blackwoods love each other and are happy with their lives and their home until their cousin Charles shows up and starts to take over.This book is really special because it takes the classic idea of a village plagued by a villainous family and reverses the roles. With this being said, the Blackwoods are not at all canonized in the book. Rather, they are shown for what they are: an unstable, dysfunctional and most-likely homicidal group of social outcasts. Still, the \\"normal\\" townspeople are far more dangerous and cruel.This book was full of quirk and dark humor, which I loved. I really appreciated the care the author took with the main characters. They felt like very realistic people and that made the events of the book even crazier. In a way this book was charming. While it was very strange, it had comfortable and familiar feel, much (I would imagine) like the Blackwood's home. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a fun way to start getting into more classics."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Just finished this book and I am still not quite sure how I feel about it. It wasn't amazing in the way of plot or story line, but at the same time it is one I can't stop thinking about. This book to me seemed to raise more questions than were answered.In this book Merricat and Constance are the two remaining members of a family who fell to suspect circumstances. The towns people are in tolerably mean to Merricat when she leaves to run errands, and they have become the subject of home spun nursery rhymes. The premise and description really grabbed me and I was expecting so much more from it. Still, it was enjoyable and at times creepy, just not as much as I had expected.Like so many others who have reviewed this book I have my own theories and solutions to the book and was either mistaken, or confused to draw my own conclusions. I have poured through several reviews, some with spoilers, since I finished and I agree with all of the theories that have been ventured. I tend to stray from spoilers so if you are interested in my thoughts read it and then ask. I think what is most intriguing about this book is the fact that it is confusing and unanswered. The story does resolve at the end but through out the novel there are things said or done that make you think, \\"Did it really happen?\\" I had to go back several times to reread passages and sections to try to answer some of the questions I had. Not always was I successful, but I did seem to have a better understanding of where the story might be heading.Not one of my favorites, but I feel that maybe a few years from now I will want to give this a reread and see if there is anything I might have missed. I think that fact alone makes this book interesting; there is the possibility of learning more each time you read it. So I guess I will give it 3.5 stars, and maybe in a future reread I will change my mind."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"An interesting, but entertaining story.

I was on a blog that helped people who couldn't remember titles of books (a sort of online community for books that you vaguely remember and want to revisit) that a friend had passed on to me, and one of the first links I checked was where someone was vaguely describing We Have Always Lived in the Castle. Next thing I do is get a hold of the book and read it in almost one go.18 year old Merricat lives with her sister Constance and Uncle in their mansion, secluded from the villagers. None of the mansion inhabiters leave the house except for Merricat who goes to the village twice a week to buy supplies. On her excursions she is usually met with nasty stares and snide remarks, with little kids throwing stones and calling her names. A few years ago, Merricat's entire family was poisoned, and the villagers have distanced themselves from this strange family.Merricat sounds much younger than her proclaimed 18 years. She sounds like a 12 or 13 year old. She has concocted spells that will help protect her and her sister and buries things around their house as part of these spells. Her uncle Jullian, relives the day of poisoning daily, and recounts his perspective and what had happened almost every day.The sisters and uncle live in their sheltered life, with Constance having what seems to be agoraphobia and fears leaving the house. No one visits the family save for an old family friend who comes once a week.A cousin, Charles, appears out of nowhere and comes to live with them. He shows interest in Constance, and Merricat fears he is changing things. She openly dislikes him and plays pranks on him. One of them ending in a not so pleasant occasion.**SPOILERS**The reader can decipher that not everything is all right with Merricat, and I guessed that she was behind the whole crime, although she was quite young at the time. The book was creepy and disturbing, the way the narrative took place: deathly quiet but scary in an echoing way. You have two sisters, raised in almost the same way, while one seems normal enough and the other is a sociopath. I found myself wondering why Merricat wanted to kill her parents and family. She was punished and not allowed dinner, could the withholding of food make her want punish them? Since she also went and burned the house when Charles ordered her to clean up before eating. But it all seems so mediated. She wanted to kill her family and was not at the scene. She wanted Constance to live. I wish the author had explored the reasons, but I can't imaging the book having this much of an impact had she done that.**END OF SPOILERS**"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"One of my all time favorites that deserved another 5-star rating. Amazing story and wonderfully written with characters types you probably won't find anywhere else.What Annika said, because her review was perfect."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Desperate for a satisfying fiction read, I went to my public library to revisit some of my favorite authors of old. The Library of America's selected collection of Jackson's writings included \\"We Have Always Lived in the Castle,\\" with which I was not acquainted. Once started, I could not put it down. There is a mysterious and dark secret at the heart of the story. Readers of Jackson's works know that often, what appears to be an accepted truth or appearance proves to be something altogether different. In this case, two young sisters alone know the real truth about the murders that ostracized them from their small-minded neighbors in a very small town. Don't mess with these girls."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"'We Have Always Lived in the Castle' has the classic hallmarks of a Shirley Jackson novel - gothic weirdness, and exposure of unflattering underbelly of human/societal behavior. And the book is delightfully compact. Excellent prose and characterizations make for a very enjoyable read of less than two hundred pages.The story? We have a rather imaginative (..to a disturbed extent) teenaged girl living with her older sister and invalid uncle in her \\"castle\\", a large estate home. Several years earlier the rest of their family were poisoned at the dinner table, with the older sister being the accused. Most of the neighbors view this family with extreme distain, encouraging a reclusive existence of the two young women. However this fragile ecosystem becomes unbalanced when a cousin arrives at the door. ... and that's about all I should say. The ending is very unexpected, and we learn a bit more about human behavior when the neighbors become restless.Bottom line: a highly recommended story. Not scary, but a very well-observed look at a twisted family and the 'kindness' of neighbors."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"If someone could be described as deliciously evil, I guess it would be Constance Blackwood -- never eat her food if you reviled her good nature.The central characters are Constance -- a late 20's spinster matriarch -- who tends to a few surviving relatives. Before the times outlined in this book, a meal Constance had prepared poisoned her mother, her father, her aunt and her uncle. Her uncle lived, but extremely infirmed. Her teenage sister Merricat (Katherine) lived without infirmity -- for reasons we learn later in the book.The people are polite in a Victorian way. Merricat is tomboyish like Scout of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\" With the vast land holdings, Merricat's world is her \\"Secret Garden.\\" Their world is brilliantly innocent in the land and home provided by their dearly deceased parents. Yet, their poisonous meal is complicatingly ferocious and conniving.Constance's inner feelings about her place with the family are slowly revealed to us. But, not entirely. Much like the painting movements of the middle 20th century, this 1960's novel's minimalist disclosure of the girls' characters and reasons for Constance's murderous actions are the mastery of the art to which we view.Many of the items herein may be symbolism at its sublest. Written post-McCarthyism era, the rioting judgmental crowd may symbolize more than small people with small minds. Constance may be more than a young spinster who is tired of parental pressures.This is a page-turning book. Short in length, and fast in style, Jackson delivers a ghoulish, eerie, and creepy experience to us. Oh, what a great black and white movie this would make."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Murder, poison and madness run amuck in Shirley Jackson's early novel, \\"We Have Always Lived In the Castle.\\" While Shirley's talent for Gothic horror and suspense is in fine form here, the characters have some deep-running flaws, and the plot feels somehow unfinished.Until recently, the Blackwood family inhabited Blackwood Estate -- then arsenic mysteriously killed all but three of them: sisters Constance and Merricat, and their deteriorated uncle. Now they live alone, taunted by claims of witchcraft and murder by the nearby villagers. Merricat stews angrily, fantasizing about murder, while Constance seems to drift off in her own world.But their cousin Charles soon comes for a visit, and the jealous Merricat fears that Constance will be lured away by him. Her anger grows even darker and more overwhelming, and the danger of the suspicious villagers grows as well. And soon the truth about the arsenic in the sugar bowl comes to light...\\"We Have Always Lived In the Castle\\" explores what Shirley Jackson did best: the evils of the human mind. Not ghoulies, ghosties, vampires and things that go bump in the night. In this case, it's a creepy look at what happens when someone is unable to live in the world we inhabit.And it is quite creepy, with psychotic woman-child Merricat, and the trapped domestic Constance trying to cover for her little sister. The problem is that the whole arsenic murder doesn't seem to make sense -- with a bit more explanation, Jackson's subplot might have been plausible, but the characters never fully explain their motives.That lack of understanding undermines the two sisters. Oddly enough, the mentally unbalanced Merricat is the more understandable of the two sisters, mostly because she's the narrator. Constance remains an enigma, but you get the feeling that she simply craves a \\"normal life,\\" while trying to maintain the warped reality that Merricat has.Creepy Gothic horror and psychological thrills lie at the heart of \\"We Have Always Lived In The Castle,\\" but some plot flaws leave the novel feeling rough and unfinished."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle by Shirley Jackson is the odd, but enthralling, story of two sisters living with their uncle after the rest of their family is poisoned at dinner. The story is narrated by Mary Katherine Blackwood, the younger of the sisters. She is the only one of the family to venture into the village where she must endure the taunts of the townspeople. Things change drastically for Mary Katherine when cousin Charles comes for a visit and exerts his influence over Constance, the older sister.I don't always read the introductions to books but in this case I'm very glad that I did. Knowing that Shirley Jackson is the author of the short story \\"The Lottery\\" gave me a little better idea of what to expect from this story. I really knew nothing about it when it was chosen as the December selection by the Reading with Tequila Book Club on Goodreads. While the author's name clearly didn't stick with me, I do remember reading \\"The Lottery\\" in high school and the impact the story had on me. If you haven't read this short story, I highly recommend it!I'm honestly not quite sure what to say about We Have Always Lived in the Castle. The story, as Mary Katherine tells it, drew me in completely even though it seems that very little actually happens. I do not think the story would have been nearly as interesting if another of the characters had told it. Being in Mary Katherine's head and seeing how she thinks about her situation is exactly what makes the story so compelling. The other characters seem a bit flat but I think that is because we only see them as Mary Katherine sees them and she is quite wrapped up in her own vision of the world.As far as what actually happens in the book, it isn't much. While there are a few key events, the girls' situation at the end of the story is very similar to the beginning. Their dependence on each other has only increased along with their self-imposed isolation. The strength of We Have Always Lived in the Castle is in the characters and the writing rather than the plot. Had it been written in another style or by another author, I do not think it would be nearly as successful in capturing the reader."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I hope no one ever makes this into a movie.

The revelation of the true murder's identity is as stunning as ever. However, the real beauty of the story is the way Jackson takes you inside of the heads of the lead characters and gives a breath-taking ending that makes you ask, &quot;In the final analysis, who was really crazy here?&quot; I don't know why a screenplay has yet to be made of this thrilling, chilling classic. Done properly, a filmed version could be right &quot;up there&quot; with &quot;Psycho.&quot;"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Definitely a page turner, finished within a few hours after purchasing! Well written and moves quickly-loved the main character and descriptions.

After rereading The Animal Farm and 1984, I have decided to read it again, after 43 years. I wonder what kind of impression it will make now. Will keep you posted!"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"This book was wonderful. The suspense was great, I just couldn't put it down. We Have Always Lived in the Castle keeps you guessing the entire time, taking forever to answer any questions you might have.It's about a girl, named Merricat, who doesn't get along very well with anyone outside her house, the Blackwood mansion. Everyone in the town constantly picks on her and makes fun of her for living there. Because of this, the outside world from her point of view is a terrible place. The only other people she lives with are her sister, Constance and Uncle Julian, the rest of her family died; this is the biggest question, how? But it's not like Merricat cares, she even seems to be happy about it."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I like Shirley Jackson. The Lottery is a classic. House on the Hill very creepy. This book? Boring. Very boring. Doesn't work. Don't waste your time; there are a lot of better books out there to read."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I don't understand the high reviews. Shouldn't there be a climax in storytelling???If you like a little girl sitting at the table talking about tea with her sister and giving subtle remarks every 20 pages about the fact that her family was killed by her sister's poison and having this be the spoiler and I'm not spoiling the book since this is purposefully revealed by pg.20 and continuously referenced.Oh, I guess I forgot to tell you about the little girl narrator's constant reference to \\"living on the moon.\\" There is no plot to the story, there is nothing to hold the reader to make me want to say i'm waiting to see if this happens. The only thing that would have saved the story was if the girls were ghosts, but no they're not. I'm still wondering why I finished reading the book, so I have to give Shirley credit for that; she made me read a book when I wasn't even interested in the plot. That's a good writer, bad story though."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"i don't like shirley jackson's writing style. itis very long and drawn out and there is no climax.she doesn't properly end her stories either. shesuggests and ending but never fully explains it.there is no rising action, intorduction, etc. toher stories as most would have. most authors usethis format for a reason -- it works. hersdoesn't, that's why no one else uses it.thank you for your time,Angela Bishop"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I was all excited about reading this famous &quot;horror&quot; book, with its weird sisters and witchcraft. Boy, was I disappointed! The plot of the family being poisoned, and the surviving family living alone in the big house had great potential, but too much time was spent inside Merricat's crazy head, instead of explaining all the other characters and the story. What we have in this book is a tale of a young woman with obsessive-compulsive disorder (and who knows what other mental illnesses) and her sister-who seems to have co-dependency problems. The only thing scary about this book is that so many people &quot;identify&quot; with the characters."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"This is an AWFUL book. Two sad sisters with a disturbed Uncle hiding in one home with only the one poor sister going out to town to the store and having townfolk who hate and tease her each time she does so.The secret comes out at the end - about the murder - but the whole book is a real downer.

I thought the characters were completely insane and the book just didn't seem to have a plot. I would not recommend this book at all!

I know of no other book like this. I've re-read it several times, and given it as a gift to many people. All I tell them is &quot;just read it&quot;. I guess it's a horror story, but there are no victims, no blood, no screams. There's talk about a spider. Shirley Jackson could tell a story about shopping for tomatos at a vegetable stand that could scare you to death."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I have read this book 6 times in 6 years and I will read it many more times in the years to come.

This story is great, and is now one of my favorite books. Please read it!"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Absoluetly engrossing novel, filled with suspense, mystery, and madness. Had Jackson been alive in the 1690's, she would most likely have been tried as a witch for her ability to cast such elaborate spells on her readers."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"&quot;We Have Always Lived in the Castle&quot; is a typical finely crafted effort by the late Shirley Jackson. As always, Jackson carefully builds her atmosphere and the world of characters and, through indirection, suggestion, and the careful compilation of detail, she sucks us in. Her story here concerns a never solved murder and an outcast family living amoung secrets and mysteries on an isolated estate. One day, an unknown cousin arrives, asking questions, and the past comes back to disturb the present. Subtly told, and a good yarn to while away some time on, this novel doesn't carry the punch of the author's &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot;, but it is a worthwhile, diverting read"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Once again Shirley Jackson has shown how to hold the reader spellbound, with a narative about what could be anytown U.S.A. She has drawn the readerthrough an intricate interpersonal family web of what is normal and what is fantasy. I have alwaysed enjoyed Ms. Jacksons work and only regret that there will be no more. However her collections of fiction are readable again and again."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"This book was definitely creepy at times but a horror story, no. I don't want to spoil the book for those that haven't read it but I knew right away who the culprit was. It was pretty obvious to me. A quick read. It had my attention throughout the entire time. Some parts I had to shake my head, the villagers-WTF???? I loved Jonas!!! So cute. Reminds me of my little kitty.The book cover is really nice. Stands out."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Jackson's dark tale centers upon 18-year-old Mary Katherine \\"Merricat\\" Blackwood and her older sister Constance - two survivors of a family mysteriously poisoned six years earlier. The two keep to themselves, preferring to stay away from the villagers who taunt and accuse Constance of the murders.As the story progresses, some of the circumstances surrounding that awful day begin to emerge - though it's clear that Merricat is an unreliable narrator, at best. Thus, the more details are revealed, the more questions the reader has.Despite the bleakness, the Blackwood sisters are fairly content in their isolated life. They have one another, as well as their elderly uncle Julian, who managed to survive the poisoning, though now with physical and mental issues.One day, a long-lost cousin suddenly appears at the Blackwood home. It's quickly apparent that it's rumors of the sisters' fortune Charles is after - making Merricat desperate to stop him, no matter what it takes.Despite the creepiness of the Blackwoods and their \\"castle,\\" it's also easy for readers to sympathize with some of their feelings about the outside world -- and wonder just what IS really \\"normal.\\""},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"...in my heart. I don't know what it is about Shirley Jackson's mastery of horror, but I wish I had it. Beautifully written and absorbing. No supernatural powers in this... Merricat's mind and the events occurring are quite terrifying enough. Constance is the perfect mother character, good-natured and willing to humor her sister and keep Merricat out of harm's way at all cost. Charles was an incredibly believable antagonist, behaving as just about anyone would, had they a motive and were they put into what was apparently a madhouse. Incredible."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"This is one of those books I will never forget, one that I will re-read soon. I don't like to recommend books, but I have to say this is one of the most chilling things I've read in many years."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"This was the first work of Shirley Jackson's I have ever read. Years ago, soon after I came to US, my English teacher (jr. high) read The Lottery out loud to the class. Because my English was not quite good then, I was not able to fully understand the story. However, I did understand enough to know that it was a &quot;dark&quot; story.Finally, I got to read this book to satisfy my curiosity about Ms. Jackson's writing. I was somewhat disappointed because I could anticipate the story. Without a doubt, Ms. Jackson's writing is good, but her character development in this book is the weakest point of this book. I found only Uncle Julian and Cousin Charles to be believable; whereas Constance and her weird sister, Merricat, are too &quot;out of this world.&quot; Ms. Jackson did not give enough background on their family and their life before the &quot;poisoning,&quot; although she did indicate that Merricat was a child sent often to bed without her dinner. But what about Constance? Why did she choose to take the rap for her sisterf? I just didn't &quot;get it&quot; with the 2 sisters; hence, the 3-star rating.My question after I finished the book is: What is it in Ms. Jackson's life that has given her such talent to tell very &quot;dark&quot; stories? This will be the last book I'll read by her; &quot;eerie, haunting&quot; are not exactly to my taste although I do enjoy well-written psychological thrillers (such as those written by Ruth Rendell)."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"The description of this book was better than the actual book by far. The only reason I finished it was because I kept hoping that it would get better. It never did."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I love Ms. Jackson's comedy, she has a wonderful eye for it but I really found this book dull, primarily because I saw through it very quickly. Dull characters make for dull books, and strange or not these characters plodded along on a well worn path, both lifeless and unimaginative(and I mean that). Strange or diseased is not always that imaginative because it's too easy. Jackson is always a good writer but she needed something with a bit more meat on the bone to flourish."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Although it explores some creepy psychological depths, \\"We Have Always Lived In the Castle\\" never really rises to great storytelling - or great story, for that matter. It's a very inward, and at times repetitive, tale about a family that has, for better or for worse, become isolated from its own community. One problem is that after a short while, it generates little interest in the reader for people living in this doomed, backwards household - nor of the people living outside it."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"This book, at many times, seemed to be leading to some big climax. Unfortunately, it never happened. There were some great moments in the story but they were few and far between. I felt as though this were just a first draft of this book, and after a few drafts, it could be great. It has wonderful potential, but even with its short length, it was hard to get through. Pick another book."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"i found this book only moderately dull until i came upon its conclusion, which left many things unsaid (to say the least). I felt that the whole story lacked purpose without a motive for Merricat's unexplained decision to murder all of her family and why does she show remorse and Constance immediately cover for her?. This book was disjointed and left many unresolved and unexplained incidents."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Yet again with Ms. Jackson, she has moments of incredibly interesting prose, but then too much filler. Too much silly dialogue that could be cut quite a bit. It seems as though just to make it novel length she fattens it up. The engaging parts however, are wroth the read"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"In my usual perusal of the thrift shops for 25 cent novels, i came across this interesting find summer of 2005.from the very first page, the book had me hooked. merricat blackwood is a girl i could relate to on first degree. in her family, she's a bit of a misfit, and as a consequence, finds herself and her older sister constance locked away in their large old house as the town freaks after the *mysterious* death of their entire family at dinner on night.everyone hates them and wants them gone. merricat braves walking to town to buy groceries for her sister with cash from the vast amount of wealth they keep hidden in the house. the towns people sneer at merricat and ask her to leave and she, head lifted, tries bravely to remain unafraid.it is an all together marvelous book for anyone who enjoys the cryptic events that go on behind the scenes of creepy old houses."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I am scratching my head at the many stars given this book by so many people. I found it bizarre. I am sorry I spent any time reading it."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Here is a book that is hard to review. I know that most of the other reviews are glowing, as Ms. Jackson has a fervent fan base and a brilliant writing style. However this story was not really to my taste. First of all, I did not find this to be a horror story, more of a darker drama, perhaps something you would see on the Lifetime network. The tale is of Constance and Merricat Blackwood two girls of 28 and 18 respectively. Merricat is the voice of the book and all is told from her perspective. Merricat is not entirely sane so her perspective and the voice of the book is not always truthful or even realistic. Mentally she is very young for her age, and after a tragedy that befell the house (the poisoning of all of her family save herself, her sister, and a dying uncle) it is clear that the two sisters have locked themselves away from society and in doing so, reality. Constance stood accused of the murders however was acquitted by the legal system, but not the minds or memories of the townspeople. Taunted and harassed by all but their Uncle they shut themselves in and live a strange, ritualistic life. Throughout the story the truth of what happened that evening makes itself apparent, however the oddness of the women makes the truth obvious from the beginning.When their money grubbing cousin appears and tries to take the girls estate, the truth about all involved comes to light, but it is expected from the beginning. I guess after reading Jackson's other works, I was disappointed at how simple and unexciting this book turned out to be. Rather than being a story, this is a character study of three deeply disturbed individuals whose grasp on reality has been shaky for years. The book itself is beautifully written, and I can see it being a made for TV movie, or perhaps an old black and white film. Unfortunately I was happy this book was so short because I don't know that I would have wanted to read much more about the characters."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I read this years ago as an older teen and LOVED it.... now am going to read it again. It was just captivating is what I remember and can't wait to see how it feels this time."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Shirley Jackson is one of my favorite authors. This book is sad and beautiful. I fell in love with the characters and have revisited this story many times. This is a book about love, acceptance, and mental illness. The author tells the story through the eyes of a girl who is &quot;not all there&quot;. Most of the ideas this girl has are very strange which makes for a wonderful read. This book is very well written. I was sad to be finished with it. I wanted to flip right back to the first page and start over again! This is a book that will haunt you long after you put it down."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I would say this is an uncoventional horror novel, as the key, it seems, is really wondering what is fantasy and what is reality. I agree that Merricat is a wonderful narrator and while I was on to the family secret early in the book, I was never quite sure until near the end of the book. So, the horror comes from inside Merricat, and therefore, the readers. It is also a wonderful look at how a &quot;neighborhood haunted house&quot; got that way--the murders, the reculse, her sister (or her sister's ghost?), and Uncle Julian. After a tragedy, they are never seen, only talked about in the village.Jackson's style is clean and clear, all the more to chill you with my dear."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"This is the best work from one of the best literary artists of all time. Shirley Jackson is a master story teller, her dark and forbidding works have given her a massive following. I reccomend all things from this under-appreciated author, she has an amazing range from the hilarious to the truly terrifying. This book is quite possibly her very best work and deserved to be read again and again."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Short book, short review: This is a terrific read. Jackson is a master in creating well-drawn characters and a haunting and still beautiful atmosphere. I have to mention the beginning of this book, which I consider one of the best I have ever read. Just try this: Open the book and read the first paragraph. I don't think you will be able to stop reading. I dare you. There is magic at work here. It's a shame that Jackson's body of work is so small."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I agree with all the glowing reviews of this book. Merricat is the best of Jackson's narrators and the most alluring and colorful of all her characters. The writing is beyond superb. The dialogue is lyrical and haunting. The only point on which I disagree is the &quot;shocking revelation&quot; of the true murderer. Anyone who didn't know after the first chapter the identity of the true killer is just engaging in wistful self-deception. Yet in spite of its unshocking plot, it is still a beautiful tale."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"A friend recommended Shirley Jackson to me, and this is the first book of hers I have read, and certainly not the last. I thought the plot of the book was almost uneventful, but when Jackson revealed the true murderess, I was shocked. I think what shocked me the most, however, was the nonchalant way in which Jackson surprises the reader with the true identity. She just drops it on the reader in a casual conversation between Constance and Merricat. Chilling."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I loved this book (though not as much as The Haunting of Hill House). It had everything any discerning reader could ask for: realistic yet quirky characters, suspense and that indescribable magical way w/ words that is so Shirley Jackson and so unlike any other author I've ever read. Wish she could've written more novels!"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I've read this book four times in the past ten years, and each time I read it it only gets better, each new layer filtering down to add to and compact the older layers in the deeper part of my memory; and this is a good thing, this building up of literary sediment, because CASTLE, with its air of involuted familial weirdness, with its charmingly twisted narrator (the 17-year-old Merricat Blackwood), with a warped insider's view of what it means to feel like one is always on the Outside, with the deliciously macabre grrl perspective. . .We Have Always Lived In The Castle is a goth kitten's wildest dreams and nightmares come true. (And BTW, if you like this book, you MUST see Peter Jackson's movie HEAVENLY CREATURES!) And drop ME a line, too. . . :)"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"As an English major (aaggghh) who rates Middlemarch perhaps the greatest novel in English (so far), and as a bad girl, this is one of my top five favorites of all time. What is the quality that is unique that I am not seeing in other reviews? Is it the deliciously claustrophic, even Free-Masonic nature of the relationship between Merricat and her beloved, Olivia-De-Haviland-esque sister, Constance? The dark, sweet underside of human nature is comfortably exposed here. Closet types (of any kind) ar definitely invited. Merricat is every toddler you ever loved, grown up to be exactly what you feared. Better than chocolate."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"The characters were strong, and their arrested development after the incident six years prior tot he book's opening was quite fascinating. Though not terribly unpredictable, it was thoroughly intriguing and well-written. The rather Gothic atmosphere was well-maintained from the very first to the very last page. Though brief (under 220 pages), this was powerful and riveting. I had read Jackson's short story, \\"The Lottery,\\" in high school, and after finishing this, I am even more curious about her other works."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Sisters Merricat and Constance live isolated in their family home, ostracized by the town, their entire family dead--until a cousin comes to visit, endangering their way of life and shoving their secrets into the open. It's impossible to completely convey my passion for this book: I loved every moment of reading it, from the first paragraph down to the final page, and I cannot recommend it enough. Unexpectedly atmospheric, rich with dark humor, and rendering larger-than-life figures with empathy and subtlety, Castle turns many gothic tropes on their head while remaining a rich contribution to the genre. At once a delightfully dark investigation of a family's skeletons in the closet and a perceptive study of normalcy and alienation, this is a vibrant, engaging, truly unique novel. It's become a personal favorite, and I recommend it with all enthusiasm."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"This is definitely one of the most disturbing books I've ever read. It's not scary. Instead, it takes you into the lives of a mentally disturbed girl and her protective sister. Throughout the story you watch the sane sister slowly descend into madness right alongside her already insane sister. Very creepy and an interesting look at agoraphobia. I can see why this is considered a classic. It's very well written and psychological horror at its finest."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"This is a book that will keep you hooked until the last page, and stay with you long after. I found it in the store at about five on Halloween afternoon, and when I next looked up it was seven and I was finished. This is brilliant, vintage Shirley Jackson, and probably crazier than 'The Haunting of Hill House' and 'The Lottery' combined.Teenaged Merricat Blackwood lives with her sister Constance on their family estate, in near total isolation from the hostile small-town community outside. Since the mysterious poisoning that resulted in the death of the rest of their family six years earlier, the sisters take care of their crippled Uncle Julian, the sole survivor, and enjoy their solitude. When a long-lost cousin Charles comes to them one day, Merricat senses that there is something sinister about him, and begins to desperately try to get him to leave.First off, don't think that Merricat is your typical starry-eyed, whimsical teenage narrator. Unlike other young heroines, she's got a very dark streak. She's an introvert who has a penchant for burying things in the woods and imagines the villagers dying twisted, horrible deaths. Granted, they deserve her hostility, but like Eleanor in 'Haunting', you realize it's possible that the problems in the book exist solely in Merricat's mind. She's fantastically complex, one moment dreaming about living on the moon with flying horses, the next wishing that everyone would just die. This is a teenage narrator for 'Daria' fans.Given that Jackson was living in isolation from her own hostile villagers when she wrote this book, it's easy to see Merricat as an extension of the author. Also, considering that Jackson was probably crazy at this point, the book feels very refreshing. The author didn't want to write a good, balanced story that would keep everyone happy. She gave us a one-way ticket into her mind, where some things were just twisted and warped, sorry to say. The sense of gothic claustrophobia works wonderfully well, and Merricat and Constance are absolutely fascinating. Jackson won't tell you what to think. You have to make up your own mind about these two. A perfect book for Halloween night."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"This book is frightening. I mean, seriously, seriously frightening. It makes you want to crawl under the covers and hide for a while, in case Merricat Blackwood is waiting in the shadows of your bedroom. Shirley Jackson, as well as her main character, have seriously disturbed minds. However, there's something else about this book that makes you want to read it over and over again, in case you missed something. I just can't put my finger on it. It's creepy."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"This bone-chilling story revolves around a teenage girl, Mary-Kat, and her family; the town outcasts. They are outcasts for good reason, though. Mary-Kat is demonic, evil, and maybe a little bit crazy, as are her living family members. Murder, poison, spiteful cat-calling all add to the character of this book. But also, much goes unsaid, which is why many people fail to understand its true meaning. Enjoy, because it doesn't get any better than this."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Shirley Jackson's We Have Always Lived in the Castle has become a talisman for me. It was the first book I read without stright tthrough with no break as a child and I return to it each year and my love for it only grows deeper. Merricat Blackwood is a hero for anyone who has felt different (and let's face it, that's everyone) who narrates the story of her sister and herself, the wonderful Cosntance, with humour, heart, and a little bit of magic. The opening paragraph seduced me as a child and its power still holds: &quot;My name is Mary Katherine Blackwood. I am eighteen years old, and I live with my sister Constance. I have often thought that with any luck at all I could have been born a werewolf, because the two middle fingers on both my hands are the same length, but I have had to be content with what I had. I dislike washing myself, and dogs, and noise. I like my sister Constance, and Richard Plantagenet, and Amanita phalloides, the death-cup mushroom. Everyone else in my family is dead.&quot; The story is haunting and, ultimatley, sad but the connection the reader will have with these isolated sisters is very strong and makes for a potent reading experience. Shirly Jackson has created a minor masterpiece that will speak to anyone who likes to read and imagine and does not quite understand a world where those are not the most valued things."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"This is the story about Mary Katherine (Merricat) who lives with her siser Constance and her uncle Julian after the rest of their family died because someone had put arsene into the sugar bowl. Merricat tries her best to protect Constance from the world behind the fence, a world where the villagers still belive that Constance murdered her family, even if noone could proof her guilt. So the three live quite happy in their isolation with their own weekly routine till that day when cousin Charles appears. He doesn't only change things and the routine in the house but also tries to talk Constance into taking uncle Julian to a hospital and to start educating Merricat, including punishments. But Merricat is aware of his plans and she has to react if she wants everything to stay the same.I really liked this book. The story is told from Merricat's point of view so I always knew what she was thinking, even if her dreams, like taking Constance to the moon, seemed strange for an 18 year old girl. I red this book very quick. It is written so fluent and also it has only about 200 pages. So if you are looking for something to read quickly or something to read on the train etc. or maybe you just want to read something without getting bored, then this book is ideal. Still, I give this book only four stars because it's not a book that kept me thinking about it everytime I put it away and because I didn't miss the characters after I closed it."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle is a haunting and oddly unique novel. What makes it so special is the fact that it's so---strange. Almost like you actually see what's going on in the main characters heads! Both funny and frightening, this one is a must-read!"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Shirley Jackson does it again. This novel is chilling and engaging at the same time. The characters are full-blooded representations of society. The lack of resolution just hammers this point home. If you're a fan of Hill House, definitely pick up this book. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"He pressured me into reading this book. &quot;No, no,&quot; I objected, &quot;I know about this Shirley Jackson; she's the one writes those scary books. I'd like to sleep tonight, thank you.&quot; Finally I gave in and picked it up. I didn't put it down until I had read the last word, and then only for long enough to get a glass of apple juice and demand to know why there wasn't more of it. Two weeks later, as I was reading it for about the ninetieth time, he suggested perhaps I ought to get some sleep, or some fresh air, or at least, if it wasn't too much to ask, a different book. &quot;Fine,&quot; I snarled, &quot;I'll try this HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE.&quot; But that's another review, and I still haven't gotten around to why I loved this book so much. It's been said, I believe, that Shirley Jackson was incapable of writing a bad, or poor, sentence. More accurate, I think, would be to say that she cannot (could not) write an imperfect one. Every word of every sentence on every page of WE HAVE ALWAYS LIVED IN THE CASTLE drew me in, captivated me, and made it impossible for me to not believe everything I was reading. It was as if, while reading the words of Merricat Blackwood, I was her; her &quot;madness&quot;, if that is the word for the way she thought, felt, and acted, consumed me and I thought as she did. I cannot imagine a more magical book, a more fascinating story. I urge you to read this book if you care one shred for literature. It is, truly, a masterpiece."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I am a big fan of Shirley Jackson. I first became interested in her after stumbling across a collection of her short stories, and since then, I have been hooked. We Have Always Lived in the Castle is my favorite Shirley Jackson novel. The Haunting of Hill House has generated much more speculation and interest world-wide than did We Have Always Lived in the Castle, but in my opinion, there is much more to be said for this book. There is much more to this novel than it seems when you first start reading it. Many things throughout the book will appeal to you, and simultaneously tear your heart in two, like the villager's hatred of Merricat (the narrator and main character) and their horrible, shameful treatment of her.This is a complex novel. It is not for everyone. It is a difficult read, because if you aren't into the book, then you won't understand what's going on. It reminds me of J.D. Salinger's. His books, especially if you've read his short stories, are to be puzzled over, yet never completely understood.The story is about Merricat and Constance, two sisters who live isolated on the edge of town at Blackwood Manor. They seldom venture out of their home, and when they do are subjected to abuse at the hands of the villagers, who particularly enjoy throwing rocks at Merricat and calling her names. Readers come onto the scene of the story years after a poisoning during supper at Blackwood Manor, which killed most of the family. For years Merricat, their uncle, and Merricat's older sister Constance have lived in solitude until Charles, a distant cousin, comes calling. He plays upon Constance's desire for a normal life, telling her how unnatural her life is at Blackwood Manor, while at the same time displaying to the reader a strong interest in the family fortune. Merricat sees him as a threat to her lifestyle of comfort and solitude, away from those who revile her and her family. Merricat is also disturbed by the way Charles seems to be tantalizing Constance with visions of how her life could be if they left Blackwood Manor. Suddenly everything important to her is threatened.I felt particular sympathy for the character of Constance. She was locked in a world she couldn't get out of. She loved her sister Merricat, (even though Merricat was strange and a bit crazy) and didn't want to desert her, but at the same time, as demonstrated by her quickness to come around to Charles's way of thinking, she wished to have a normal life. She didn't want Merricat to be so wild, and she strove for normalcy at every turn. She was constantly doing motherly activities like baking and cleaning, and generally taking care of everyone around her.What I liked most about the book was that it left me with the same feeling I got from reading Jackson's famed story \\"The Lottery\\". It leaves you with that kind of horror at humanity \\"The Lottery\\" did with such deftness.All this book needs is someone who is willing when he or she sits down with it to take the time to figure out what's REALLY going on here, and to understand the characters and their plights. If you read this book, go into it with an open mind. You will be rewarded for it.This novel is not for everyone. But it may be for you."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"This novel is a wonderful, delicous tale that only the late Ms. Jackson could possibly bestow on her fans. This novel is a deep journey into the psychological powers of us all. Merricat is a very real character, one that will and should be treasured by future generations as a wonderful priceless work of art. This is so much more than words on paper, this novel is a eerie lingering taste of true horror. Not the horror that authors such Stephen King or Anne Rice would write, not Shirley Jackson. This is another superb master-piece of psychological horror that can only be described as cryptic and beautiful. I HIGHLY recommended that you read this novel, it will teach you how to view circumstances and events in a different perscpitive...the Shirley Jackson perscpitive. I would love to rate this book with at least eight stars. ******** Wonderful, you won't be sorry if you read this. Constance is such a caring person, and Uncle Julian is so real that you actually begin to feel sorry for him. And Charles you will not like Charles. But Merricat, she is a divine work, a sweet little niave girl who wishes to live on the moon with Constance and Jonas, her cat. Breath-taking saga that only Shirley Jackson can create."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I think I am just about the only person out there who had not read Shirley Jackson's, We Have Always Lived in a Castle. Well, now I have, and this 146 page book left me feeling a bit unsettled. Creepy, atmospheric and beyond clever, this is one book that will leave some of you scratching your head when you get to the end.In brief, Merrikat, as she prefers to be called, begins narrating this story in this way:\\"My name is Mary Katherine Blackwood. I am eighteen years old, and I live with my sister Constance. I have often thought that with any luck at all I could have been born a werewolf, because the two middle fingers on both my hands are the same length, and I have had to be content with what I had. I dislike washing myself, and dogs, and noise. I like my sister Constance, and Richard Plantagenet, and Amanita phallaides, the death-cup mushroom. Everyone else in my family is dead.\\"From the opening paragraph, I thought something is very strange about Merricat. She is eighteen and acts like a child. She is extremely superstitious, believing in signs and burying items in the ground to secure the property. She is also very protective of her sister. She lives with her sister and Uncle Julius, who on the surface appears to have some sort of dementia. The three of them live in a secluded mansion, and never leave the house, except for Merricat who ventures into town for necessities about twice a week. It is clear that the townspeople fear and dislike the remaining family members. The Blackwoods avoid the neighbors, preferring the security of seclusion. They even avoid the few who are friendly.Cousin Charles arrives on the scene, interested in money that may have been left behind, and although he is an unlikable character, he is the only one who seems to be somewhat normal. How the other family members died is revealed as you read on.So where is this story going? Well, before long it is very clear that Merricat is emotionally disturbed and not a reliable narrator, and that everything is not as it may have appeared early on. For a 142 page book, this one took me several days to complete as it was creepy, really kept my brain engaged searching for clues, and in the end left me wondering about Shirley Jackson, and what her life was like. I know that I will be interested in reading more by this fascinating author. Don't Miss This One!"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"A young woman, her older sister, and their uncle live as pariahs on a crumbling estate next to a small town. We first meet the girl on one of her tortuous and torturous bi-weekly excursions into town to get supplies. Something happened at the house on the estate seven years ago which devastated this once prosperous, leading family. The full story is not revealed until near the end of the book and Jackson deals out pieces of information through the main character's bizarre thoughts, the cruel actions of the town's people, and the interactions and rituals of the surviving members of the family in their spooky museum-like house. I doubt that a more insightful, compassionate exploration of madness has ever been written -compassionate without being maudlin or judgmental. The love between the two sisters is of a quality not suited to the world they live in. As in many other Jackson stories, the morals and sanity of small town America take a beating. Wonderfully paced, this is a psychological novel in the best sense of the word."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"This is so out of character for me to be sitting here submitting a \\"review\\" of this book. It won't be your typical review. This is simply a manifestation of my need to relate how literally swept away I was. I have never read a book in one sitting. I have always been annoyed by people who claim to. Well, I started this beautiful story after work yesterday and did not look away from my Kindle until I had read the last word. I'm not going to go into detail about what I loved about it - that is done so eloquently by other reviewers. I simply wanted to add my five star rating and tell anyone who is remotely interested in this book for any reason - it's title or the cover art or familiarity with the author - you are in for a treat.I also want to caution potential readers. The book comes complete with an \\"introduction\\". DO NOT READ IT UNTIL AFTER YOU HAVE READ THE BOOK!! A more appropriate title for this section would have been \\"Completely Inappropriately Placed Spoiler - Do Not Read!!\\" In this \\"introduction\\", Jonathan Lethem describes the entire book, start to finish along with his thoughts on the various aspects of the author's writing. Mr. Letham - the next time you are asked to write an introduction, please politely decline the invitation."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I read this book in one sitting, silently turning page after page, totally caught up in the story.The story is written in very simple format, unravelling like a favorite and somewhat familiar mystery, and though largely predictable, the slim tome sticks to your hands by some supernatural force, and doesn't release you until the last page is turned and the last word read.Mary Katherine Blackwood, known as Merricat, the main character, lives with her reclusive sister Constance and their Uncle Julian, the surviving members of a large family that came to a sad end through the consumption of arsenic laced sugar.The intriguing Merricat tells the story, regaling the reader with her rituals, talismans and magic, but these alone are not enough to counteract the interloper, who threatens her familiar lifestyle, and tries to destroy the strong family unit.The conclusion was not quite was I was expecting, being of macabre humor and vivid imagination, but was fitting and satisfying.A haunting but not chilling read."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I strongly believe that this is the greatest, most powerful horror novel ever written, and I would go so far as to rank it among the top five pieces of literature the world has ever known. It truly is the most disturbing, original, heartbreaking story I have ever read. It is almost impossible to describe, as are the emotions I feel having read it--it taps virtually every emotion I know of. Merricat is the most unusual, utterly tragic heroine in the universe of fiction. She lives happily with her older sister Constance, her uncle Julian, and her cat Jonas. The rest of the family died several years earlier, murdered with arsenic during the family's evening meal. Although Constance was suspected of the deed, she was acquitted. Nevertheless, the three Blackwoods live in total isolation, and Merricat's twice-weekly trips into the village for groceries are horribly taxing on her because the villagers all laugh at her and tease her mercilessly about the family's tragic history. Merricat likes to bury things and play with her cat and hide near the brook; Constance is perfectly content cooking for her family and keeping the house immaculately clean, and Uncle Julian devotes himself to writing a book about the murder of most of his family. The strange trio is happy and safe in their self-isolation until a cousin shows up at the door and brings ruin, despite Merricat's magical safeguards. The interrelationships of the sisters and uncle is often nonsensical yet very real and adorable. Cousin Charles is a greedy beast, yet only Merricat seems cognizant of this fact initially. The really despicable people are the villagers, however. Never tiring of their constant teasing and harassment of Merricat on her few public appearances, the utterly black heart of the mob is vividly shown toward the end of the book. The end of the novel is incredibly emotional and touching and brought tears to my eyes. I wish I could truly describe this novel, but the only words that can accomplish that are those of this mesmerizing book itself.On the back of my older copy of this novel, the book is described as an item of black magic that will cast a spell upon the reader; never were truer words written. The psychology underlying all of Jackson's fiction is deeply complex, unique in literature, and maddeningly compelling. But there is also much tenderness to be found here alongside the pain and horror of the Blackwood family story. This is tragedy surpassing even the best work of Sophocles. Anyone who reads this novel and is not deeply affected emotionally is simply not human. If I could have reached into this fictional world and pulled Merricat, Constance, Julian, and Jonas out, I would have done so. The powerlessness I felt as a reader, quite unable to protect and comfort the characters, was truly agonizing, and it was sometimes all I could do to keep myself from getting up and running around the room in exasperation. Anyone feeling at all depressed really should not read this book; it is a form of magic or a drug that can potentially threaten your very sanity. I know how silly this sounds, but I am quite serious. There is so much emotion stored in these pages that it really should come with a warning label."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I had to read &quot;The Lottery&quot; in high school; I'll always recall the impression that story had one me, with its ending of pure surprise. I had never read anything else by Shirley Jackson, and this novel's premise sounded interesting, and so I picked it up.And I couldn't put it down. The narrator, Mary Katherine Blackwood is an eighteen year-old girl who behaves like a much younger child. She lives with her sister Contance, who years before was tried and acquitted of murdering almost the whole family by putting arsenic in the sugar bowl.This novel is at once a mystery of what happened that one night when the family died, and a suspense thriller of what happens when cousin Charles comes to visit and seems as if he doesn't plan to leave, unless with the family fortune.But, the most driving and irresistable part of the book is the quirky and creepy voice of Mary Katherine; she's child-like, naive, scheming and malicious all in one twisted voice. This novel is every bit as satisfying as &quot;The Lottery.&quot;"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"While certainly not as well-known as her famous short story \\"The Lottery\\", Shirley Jackson's novel \\"We Have Always Lived in the Castle\\" is still a great work in its own right; one worth reading and savoring. A word of warning however; this is not a who-dunit or a psychological thriller, as some readers might think. Don't expect shocking plot twists, morally-grounded characters, or a neatly resolved ending. This is, instead, a powerful and hauntingly beautiful exploration of madness, culpibility and family dysfunction closer to Patricia Highsmith and Lovecraft (see \\"The Outsider\\" and \\"The Tomb\\") than Agatha Christie. At the center of it all is the wildly disturbed, and strangely likable, Mary Katherine (\\"Merricat\\") Blackwood, whose psyche is gradually revealed to the reader throughout the novel. At times loving, cruel, innocent, hateful, tender and controlling, Merricat is above all facinating. Jackson definitely shows true literary genius, balancing reality and fantasy to create an unforgettable story. If you prefer interesting characters, real psychological tension and a rich gothic atmosphere over the conventions of the suspense/thriller genre, read this book.If you enjoy this novel, be sure to check out \\"The Haunting of Hill House\\" as well."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I find that the best way to make reviews helpful is by adding a list of books I love and books I hated.

When I found that one novel remained, I was all over it, and We Have Always Lived in the Castle did not disappoint. The narrator, Mary Katherine, or Merricat, has a quite unusual world view, and yet one cannot help liking her and applauding her approach. That is, until it starts to dawn on the reader . . . well, that would be a spoiler. Though a few questions remained unanswered if we are to think of this as reasonably realistic fiction, I enjoyed every moment of a too-short book."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"This is my favourite Shirley Jackson novel.

In 214 pages, this book makes the reader realize how lucky they are that they have a loving and caring family. Nobody, not even Merricats family loved her, well that is when they were alive. One night while the Blackwood was having their usual tea after dinner, they were all mysteriously poisoned with the sugar they put in their tea. The person who did it must have known the Blackwoods pretty well, because they all loved sugar and always put it in their tea. Constance 28, Mary Katherine (Merricat) 18, and their great uncle Julian were the only survivor. They now struggle to keep their small family together. Merricat is off in her own world. She hates people and everything else in the world. Constance has never step beyond the gates of their property and Julian is very ill and handicapped. When their long lost cousin or so he says, Charles steps into their lives, everything turns ugly. Merricat does not trust him and is very suspicious of him. Put your feet in her shoes: As it is your life is tough, everyone in the world hates you, and you are locked up in an old castle for your whole life. Then this stranger, who says he is your long lost cousin and wants to be part of your family now. Then starts putting awkward thoughts into your sisters head, like \\"normal life\\" and \\"boyfriends\\". Your sister is your only hope for your life to continue and this Charles guy is trying to change everything. I would be a little nervous and suspicious around him.That's all I am going to tell you about the book. Now you need to go out and get the book, and read it. I think you will really enjoy it. I know I did.I would recommend this book to girls and boys of the ages 13 to 19, because those are usually your teenage years. Teenagers could definitely relate to this book because the main character is 18 years old. Some teens have family and friend problems and insecurities with themselves just like Mary Katherine, the main character in the book. I would rate this book four stars out of five stars, because this book was a wonderful mystery for teens, although the beginning was a little confusing and weird at times."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"To read this tale you must forget all you were expecting from The Lottery (though it's a great story if you haven't done it...just click the link to read!). This does not have a surprise ending. No horrific shock to be found. Instead this is a tale of death - of living in a haunted house - with two sociopaths. One will be your guide. One will turn out to be her family's murderer.Merricat (Mary Katherine) will lead you down this journey. She and her sister Constance are at a cross-roads. A few years away from the horrific death of the bulk of their family. Constance has been tried and found innocent of the crime involving arsenic in the sugar bowl. You see, Constance never takes sugar, though she does cook all of her family's meals. Her innocence looks fishy to say the least. The only other survivors of the evening meal were the girls' Uncle Julian, who didn't consume as much sugar and thus not as much arsenic and Merricat, who had been sent to her room without dinner that evening. Constance has lived through the spectacle of the trial and is, as the years pass, becoming mentally stronger - considering rejoining the society outside the family home. For that is where Constance has lived all these years, in the home where her family died, never moving one tea-cup or hair brush out-of-place, never moving beyond the garden gate. If Constance decides to move out into the world of the living normalcy may return.Merricat on the other hand moves beyond her home and into town. She bravely grocery shops amongst the townspeople enduring their insults and cruel stares. Merricat worries for Constance. She knows what it's like to wander outside the garden gate she worries for Constance's mental state to do so as well. However, we're never quite sure if Merricat is more worried that Constance will find life outside the home difficult, or if Constance will begin to enjoy it.To say much more about the sisters and their intimate relationship with death would ruin the tale for anyone wishing to enter into their decidedly macabre world. But in the end I think that the true horror of the tale isn't these two girls. It's not \`who done it' or even \`why'. As a reader once you're used to living life through their eyes...Once you're used to the death, and the creepiness...you too will become scared of the \`normal' population. Watching those who are a stranger to the occult, strangers to murder and the assumed violence that goes along with it you realize that this unknown makes them terrified of the unknown. The mob mentality of people who are both scared and jealous is horrific. What a group can accomplish - disgustingly amazing. You'll end up realizing that to accept the macabre and to not just dole out death but live with it produces a kind of sociopathic happiness. And causes the mentally competent become unhinged.This is a tale of that house you held your breath in front of as a child. The place in your town you walked faster past - knowing that there were watching eyes. It's the home the you're never quite sure someone occupies. The place where friends dared you to tread. It's the story of that house before it became that house.Rating: 3.5/5 It's a well written and creepy tale...marred because I was expecting something different..."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"It might not be her very best work, but that doesn't preclude getting five stars from me.

Fairly short, though, like most of Shirley Jacksons books, more suited for weekend reading"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Once I read this wonderful book I had to read it umpteen times. I just loved it. Every reading you find something new you missed before. I recommend you engross yourself in this good read."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Shirley Jackson's story has a subtle creeping horror underlying a slow, marginally interesting story of two women living as outcasts in their historic, gothic family home, the products of scandal and fear.This one takes a good amount of perserverence to make it all the way through to the end, and the end, while not entirely what the foreshadowing leads you to expect, is still pretty predictable. The benefit is that it's a quick read, and makes for fine rainy day reading when you're in the mood for something a bit creepy and otherworldly."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"This is a delightfully creepy story, in which Jackson reminds us that the most frightening tales need not rely on graphic violence, spilling blood, or similar. This is the story of Merricat Blackwood, who lives in the family home with her sister and uncle. The rest of the family is dead, having been poisoned at dinner years ago. The Blackwoods have become pariahs in town; Merricat is the only one who ventures out beyond the old, Gothic manse they call home. How the family came to be poisoned, and how the sisters have come to exist on the fringes of society are revealed as the book develops.This book is pure weird, psychological suspense. I loved it for that very reason, and stayed up half the night so that I could read this in one sitting. I was shocked to discover that Merricat is supposed to be eighteen. She behaves more like a stunted child than an adult. As unique as the characters are, it's the house that remains seared in my memory. When I think of this book, I think of the house, the castle, such as it is. The castle is a character in this book. It has a life, presence, and personality of its own. I would definitely recommend this book, especially as a classic for those who generally don't care for classics."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I first read \\"We Have Always Lived in the Castle\\" in moody puberty and have returned to it time and again as I approach the half-century mark. This is far and away my favorite of Shirley Jackson's books and stories and one of my favorite books ever. The writing from beginning to end is quietly brilliant and creates a vivid if strange world. Every detail tells, from the jewel-like jars of preserves in the cellar, put up by generations of Blackwood women, to the narrator's refusal to accept cream or sugar in her coffee in the village cafe, but no detail dates the book. The pace never flags. The characters are compelling. Reading this book is like taking a journey to a hidden fort in the woods with only your wildest imagination for company. A stunning example of the writer's craft and art."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I read this book in about two or three sittings as the pages flew by.

The most frightening thing is, Jackson makes us identify with her and see parts of ourselves in her. Merricat is sort of a female version of one of Jim Thompson's monsters. This is a wonderful book to read when you've had a very bad day."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Interesting, well written as all of Jacksons work is, but primarily this was interesting to me not for horror, scare, purposes but for the psychological mastery of Jackson dealing with the psychotic mind,and her alertness and willingness to tell of the common day nastiness and cruelty of the average person, i.e the townspeople in Merricats village. How cool Jackson was at revealing the horrors of the disturbed mind, and the little fanstasy worlds inhabited by the unstable, (for their own protection) and the clear eyed callousness and cruelty of the &quot;normal&quot;. What a dreadful world we live in at times, and how far ahead of her time Jackson was, in pointing out the flaws of human nature, and its sickness. Interesting for that reason, story itself is plotline predicatable except for Jacksons marvelous character analysis of human kind"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Anyone who reads this book will either love it or hate it completely. The story in itself is not new: characters living in an old house with old secrets. It's the building of the characters and way of the telling that makes the difference - the castle stands and the characters live in two separate but mingled worlds ... one in which they have committed a crime that must remain secret, and one in which they are innocent children, looking through the windows of their souls to the physical windows of the castle, both fearful yet curious about what goes on outside where they cannot play because they do not quite belong. It's a story that's so real to me. You see, I, too, have a sister; we live in a house away from the congestion of the city; and yes, we have our own secrets, some too strangely painful to tell ... even in crowds, we are apart and alone ..."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"The other major novel from Shirley Jackson. It doesn't have the devastating impact of _The Haunting of Hill House_, but that is like saying getting hit by a speeding van is less devastating than being run over by a eighteen-wheeler.This is an aching, tragic novel of psychotic decline and clinging human dependence. Narrator Merricat is an amazing character, both repulsive and sympathetic as she tries to protect her sister and their life together from the villagers and the encroachments of cousin Charles. As in _Hill House_, the protagonist is obsessed with location and a need to belong, and it drives her ultimately to insane actions. Like Eleanor Lance, the main character in _The Haunting of Hill House_, Merricat continually removes herself from the rest of humanity.Although the novel contains nothing overtly supernatural, it is filled with \\"living ghost\\" and haunts the reader the same way real ghosts would. Shirley Jackson was a stunning talent, and she dares you to forget he dark, stirring, psychological worlds she builds.

I strongly disagree with a previous reviewer that Merricat and Constance are not believable characters. Merricat's thought process and magical view or the world (and homicidal fantasies) correspond almost exactly to my inner life as a child--however Merricat never grows out of that thought process. And I assure you I am not a fictional character.In short, it's a book of incredible beauty and mystery and I especially recommend it to anyone who was ever an outcast."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Shirley Jackson is, of course, best remembered for The Lottery , one of the great short stories of all time, and for The Haunting of Hill House, which has twice been made into a movie. But this terrific novel is every bit as good as those others and may in fact be the best thing she ever wrote.From what I've read, it seems that Ms Jackson's work may well have been an expression of her own psychological problems. If that's true, this story is even more frightening. It is about two sisters, the older one meek and shy, the other assertive and nearly demonic, who barricade themselves inside a gutted mansion to escape the local townsfolk who torment them because they suspect that the girls were involved in the mass killing of four family members.The psychological overtones are plentiful and troubling. There is, first of all, the sense in which it appears that it is only when together that the two sisters form one complete personality. Second, the crime involved is not merely murder, but murder of the family, that ancient taboo. Third, the two are completely alienated from the society around them, even ignoring the few friendly neighbors who come by to try and help. Jackson apparently had a horrendous relationship with her mother and with the people of Bennington, where she lived. Local legend even had it that The Lottery was based on an incident where local boys threw stones at her. Finally there is a strong indication that not only are the girls happier in their isolation, they may truly be better off by themselves and they may be more &quot;normal&quot; than the people in town.At any rate, the story is creepy and sly and a great deal of fun. This is one of the truly great gothic horror novels of all time.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Two young sisters and their ailing uncle live in a grand old house after the rest of the family has been murdered by arsenic.

When Merricat makes her journey into town, it becomes clear that she is the only family member willing to show her face outside of the house. The three relatives live in a well-developed rhythm that limits their interactions with others and therefore limits their need to talk about the tragic event from years past. When a long lost cousin appears at their house, it throws the whole family for a loop as they must confront their demons before it is too late.Jackson has never been light on the action or intrigue and this book is no exception. The family relationship is incredibly interesting and well developed. Though it took me two tries to get into the novel, I think it is only because Merricat's character is so brilliantly created that I did not figure out she was an unreliable narrator until my second attempt. If you're looking for mystery...here it is! If you're looking for drama...here it is! If you're looking for a quick and enthralling read...here it is! Here is the complete package. Go read it!"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"The Lottery is one of my all-time favorite short stories, but I'd never read any of Jackson's other works. We Have Always Lived in the Castle has a similar tone, balancing its unsettling atmosphere with an unreliable narrator to great effect, for a story that's delightfully open to interpretation while defying easy categorization.I'm planning to read all of Jackson's novels and collections now!NOTE: Lethem's introduction is better read as an afterword, lest his own interpretation spoil and color your own reading."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"The more I read of Shirley Jackson, the more she has proven herself again and again to be a master of creepy, emotionally unsettling situations. With that said, do not read this book if you don't want to be unsettled.The novel follows two sisters, 18-year-old Mary Katherine (Merricat) Blackwood, and her agoraphobic older sister, Constance. Though the story centers around the poisoning of Merricat and Constance's family, the true horror is psychological, as we spend more time in Merricat's head and little bits of information about her world are revealed to us in small fragments. Though Merricat is 18, her voice reads like a young child, swinging back and forth from dreamy fantasies about living on the moon to dark, murderous thoughts toward the people of her village. Constance's portrayal is equally terrifying, a woman indulgent to Merricat's destructive behavior and freakishly obsessed with domestic duties. What is horrifying, to me, is the way these characters are depicted as being so resistant to change and self-reflection that they inevitably seal themselves up in their house like a tomb, sitting at the heart of a village that hates them. And yet still, somehow, you feel emotionally attached to the sisters and are totally caught up in the way the manipulative Merricat tells her story.The Jonathan Lethem introduction is insightful in this edition, but I would suggest reading it after you read the novel so that you can garner your own interpretation, and then read Lethem's take on the two sisters afterward. \\"Castle\\" is a quick read (I wolfed it down in a day or so), but it is not a novel soon forgotten. Prepare yourself to let these characters stick in your mind."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle is the story of the reclusive remnants of a wealthy family that died mysteriously before the narrative begins. Mary Katherine, Constance, and their Uncle Julian are all that survive, and Merricat does everything she can to protect her older sister from the world. Shirley Jackson's short novel is haunting and thrilling, and she masterfully creates tension and horror without resorting to trite themes of slash and gore. We Have Always Lived in the Castle is terrifying for its simplicity and honesty, and although the primary mystery is evident from very early the story itself is thoroughly engaging.I highly highly recommend We Have Always Lived in the Castle, even for those who do not normally enjoy horror novels. Jackson is an exception worth making."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"The book appears under the \\"horror\\" title but it is not really horror. I would say that it is more bizarre then horror - it may be horrible in the sense that the thoughts that go through people's minds do not stay in the form of \\"thoughts\\" but get carried out. The book is presented from the eyes of Merricat and the reader is left to guess if she is retarded, slow, or someone with witchcraft powers as she would like to think - but however \\"weird\\" Merricat is, the reader can identify and even sympethize with her feelings, with the whole spectrum of her feelings: her love and loyalty to Constance and her hatred and anger towards other people. The reader recognizes that what goes on in Merricat's head is not totally unfamiliar.... Also, however \\"weird\\" the castle may be it is still a home and a very secure loved home and this feeling comes out of the story - so there is also something very surprisingly cozy about this castle and this comes from the portrayal of constance's cooking, the stored food, daily routine. I think I love this book because it shows you CAN live in a bubble you create and that you make your own reality... Also a very good portrayal of human flaws."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I am a voracious reader, and was never able to choose a single 'favorite' book until I read 'We Have Always Lived in the Castle.' I was immediately captivated by the ethereal narrative of the haunted and haunting Mary Katherine Blackwood, and the eccentricities of Constance and Uncle Julian add depth, humour, and sorrow to the book. Mary Katherine's perspective makes Cousin Charles a thoroughly despicable and intrusive presence, and it is enjoyable to speculate on how she might have dealt with him had circumstances not thankfully driven him away. 'We Have Always Lived in the Castle' is a bewitching novel."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"WE HAVE ALWAYS LIVED IN THE CASTLE is a book that walks through the walls of genre to a place that defies definition. 18-year old Merricat Blackwood lives with her sister Constance in an isolated house.

Under constant cruel ridicule of the local villagers, the sisters manage to create an odd, eerie contentment, tending their gardens and caring for the surviving uncle Julian. But when their cousin Charles reappears, threatening to steal Constance from Merricat and break apart the happiness she has fought to built, Merricat decides that Charles must be a demon, and is determined to drive him away."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"There is Stephen King, and then there is Shirley Jackson! Forget King! You don't know what unspeakable horror is until you have read We Have Always Lived In The Castle! During the reading of this story, I entered the mind of a madwoman, and I was emotionally exhausted by the time this incredible tale was over. Shirley Jackson knows how to weave a web of terror. She is THE master of horror stories, and in my opinion, this is her masterpiece; her crowning achievement! The ending is so pathetic, it truly broke my heart. Open this book on a stormy night, and prepare for your blood to turn to ice!"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"WHAT is this book about?The Blackwood family (what is left of them) live in a large estate outside a village. The gates leading to their home are always shut, secured by padlocks. The villagers don't like the Blackwood family very much. In fact, it would be safe to say they despise them. Perhaps even hate them. The only member of the Blackwood family who ventures into the village is 18-year-old Mary Katherine (known as Merricat). Her trips to the village are done only out of necessity. After all, Merricat and her family need groceries and the occasional library book. But one day, Charles (a long-lost relative) comes for a visit, and his presence starts to change things around the Blackwood house with disastrous and unexpected results.WHO do we meet?* Merricat is our narrator and is quite unique. From the moment you meet her, you know she is a bit different. Consider the opening paragraph:My name is Mary Katherine Blackwood. I am eighteen years old, and I live with my sister Constance. I have often thought that with any luck at all, I could have been born a werewolf, because the two middle fingers on both my hands are the same length, but I have had to be content with what I had. I dislike washing myself, and dogs, and noise. I like my sister Constance, and Richard Plantagenet, and Amanita phalloides, the death-cup mushroom. Everyone else in my family is dead.* Constance is Merricat's older sister. She never leaves the estate and is quite the object of curiosity around the village for reasons you'll discover when you read the book. Constance loves to cook and dotes on Merricat like her own child.* Uncle Julian is the only other member of the Blackwood family living in the house. He's in poor health and occasionally confused about where and when he is living. He is obsessed with his project, which involves writing about a fateful night in the Blackwood family history.WHEN and WHERE does the book take place?The story takes place in and around the Blackwood estate in an unnamed village, probably in the early 1960s.WHY should you read this book?Merricat is an unforgettable narrator, and I doubt you'll soon forget her. I found her simultaneously amusing and creepy. Jackson does a brilliant job of presenting Merricat's world view (and her own special brand of magic). I suspect you'll be drawn into Merricat's world, which is a different place indeed. At just 214 pages, We Have Always Lived In The Castle is a short read, but Jackson manages to create a memorable story filled with atmosphere and an unforgettable narrator. This was my last book for the RIP Challenge, and it was the perfect way to end."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Today Shirley Jackson (1916-1965) is best recalled for the story \\"The Lottery,\\" originally published in 1948, and the novel THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE, published in 1959. But although these two works are indeed among the finest of her work, they are not her only work; during her short lifetime Jackson produced a seemingly endless stream of stories and essays, two memoirs, four books for children, and six novels--of which WE HAVE ALWAYS LIVED IN THE CASTLE, published in 1962, was her last. It is an astonishing work, perceptive, deceptively simple, remarkably artful, and both disturbing and terrifying in a way that defies easy description.The novel is narrated in the first person by Mary Katherine Blackwood, an eighteen year old, and begins with what would seem a commonplace event: Merricat, as she known, has gone to town on a series of errands. But the trip soon acquires an ugly tone. She is afraid; she is angry; the town is ugly; the people in it are openly hostile to her. She returns as quickly as possible to the Blackwood property, a large, heavily wooded tract of land accessible only through padlocked gates--and to the Victorian mansion in which she lives with her sister Constance and their invalided uncle Julian.As the novel progresses it becomes apparent that Uncle Julian cannot leave the house and Constance will not leave the house--and although the reasons are different for each the actual cause is the same. Six years earlier the Blackwood family sat down to a meal that included blackberries served with arsenic. Uncle Julian survived, his health destroyed and his mind clouded; Mary Katherine, having been sent to bed with supper for a childhood misdeed, escaped the poison; and Constance, who prepared the meal and who never took sugar, was accused of the crime. Although acquitted in court, she was deemed guilty by the town--and the trial was so traumatic she has since been unable to bring herself to leave the house.Although they occasionally receive visits from old friends who knew the family before the tragedy, the three live in isolation, and the sense of paranonia that pervades their lives warps and twists each in unexpected ways. Mary Katherine in particular has fancies and imaginings, often engaging in childhood acts of magic that would seem more appropriate to a child than a young woman. But the lure of the family's wealth is very strong, and it draws a relative to their door--cousin Charles.Constance finds Charles appealing and takes seriously his urging that she throw off her isolation, but Mary Katherine recognizes his motives as purely mercenary. The battlelines are quickly drawn, Mary Catherine on one side and Charles on the other, with delicate Constance caught between the world in which she feels safe and the life she might have outside it. Charles will find that a family in which an infamous and unsolved murder has occurred does not necessarily enjoy intrusion from the outside, and the nightmare is soon upon them all.Mary Katherine is hardly an unbiased narrator, and her perception of the town and its people, cousin Charles, Uncle Julian, and her adored sister Constance is colored by her clearly abnormal thinking--but Jackson plays a truly unexpected card, drawing a sharp comparison between the more attractive qualities of Mary Katherine's abnormality and the singularly disasterful normality of Charles and the outside world he represents. The result is moody, disquieting, and quietly terrifying, and Jackson is careful to leave many key questions unanswered, thereby driving a sense of ambiguity ever deeper into the reader's mind.If your taste runs to the like of Stephen King and Dean Koontz, you may find Shirley Jackson a shade too delicate for your liking: there will be no ghosts, no vampires, no overtly evil people doing overtly evil deeds. But to my mind Jackson is all the more effective precisely for that, a brilliant writer who has no need of the obvious in order to chill you to the bone. WE HAVE ALWAYS LIVED IN THE CASTLE is a masterpiece, and I strongly recommend it.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I chose to read this book for my outside reading novel in my advanced English class.I had the book lying around my house, and I decided that I would give it a try. I loved it. Great, well-developed characters, and an amazing plot. I enjoyed the atrophic behavior of the town.

It was an enlightening journey, don't miss it!Shirley Jackson...when she's good.....she's GRAND. Check out her other works as well."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"When I was in Junior High--what they refer to as \\"Middle School\\" these days--we occasionally had book sales to raise funds for various projects like the Prom or the Class Trip. One of the books I selected in those long past days was Shirley Jackson's \\"We Have Always Lived in the Castle.\\" I was very impressed by her style. I still am!In the intervening years since high school, I took narrative writing classes to complete one of my degrees, and I can honestly say from that experience that Ms Jackson writes exactly and very successfully as they tell you how to write in such classes. There is a novel introduction; I mean, who can fail to be captured by a paragraph that tells you the narrator should have been a \\"werewolf\\" and ends succinctly with the statement that \\"Everyone else in my family is dead (p. 1).\\" The author builds mood and character by the use of carefully chosen words that project atmosphere, as when speaking of the village, she says, \\"The houses and the stores seemed to have been set up in contemptuous haste to provide shelter for the drab and the unpleasant (p. 9).\\" Already we sense there's something not quite right. Like Shakespeare's much touted Falstaff, however, the character of Uncle Julian adds a touch of levity that gives the tragedy of the story more impact. There is a good deal of detail, but despite this the story isn't just wordy or inflated to fill the requisit 200 pages. The detail makes the town and its residents and the two women in the \\"castle\\" much more real, and pull the reader into their story more fully than a more economical treatment would have done.A thorough delight. Miss Jackson's work still hangs together despite the years.For THOSE WRITING PAPERS: in narrative writing or English composition. Examine the book for key words that give each character their personality. What does the author tell you without actually telling it to you outright. Were you surprised by the revelations in the book? Were you surprised by the outcome? Compare writers like Edgar Allen Poe, Steven King or Peter Staub with Ms Jackson. How are they similar? How are they different? How is Ms Jackson's work \\"dated?\\" How is it timeless?"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Fifty years on and this novel is as fresh and creepy as ever. The narrator (18 year-old Mary Katherine Blackwood) runs wild outside the confines of middle-class sensibility in an amoral world peopled only by her sister Constance, her Uncle Julian and her cat, Jonas. In the first paragraph we learn that 'Merricat' believes she could have been born a werewolf, dislikes dogs and washing herself and is particularly fond of the deathcup mushroom. Everyone else in her family is dead.Read MoreAnd it is those deaths that lie at the heart of this story -- their impact and continuing influence on the sisters who live outside of town in the fabulous old house they lovingly care for.Shirley Jackson's fiction (The Lottery being her most famous) tends to snowball from mundane beginnings into catastrophic disasters. She specialises in outrageous acts committed by ordinary people. She also gives us a glimpse of worlds ordered differently from our own, which I find refreshing."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Shirley Jackson was one of America's great, great writers of fiction, and \\"We Have Always Lived in the Castle\\" is her bona fide masterpiece -- simply the finest thing she ever put on paper.I say this, by the way, as a great fan of \\"The Haunting of Hill House,\\" Jackson's beautifully written ghost story. I also hold in high regard \\"The Lottery,\\" which collects that short story and two dozen others, including the masterful \\"Charles\\" and \\"After You, My Dear Alphonse.\\"But \\"We Have Always Lived in the Castle\\" is her masterwork because it works on every single level it attempts: It is, at once, a deep character study, a social commentary, a (quiet) thriller, and a novel that is seductively macabre without being supernatural.\\"Castle\\" is a tale of two sisters and their elderly, infirm uncle. Merricat, the younger of the two sisters, is the only one who leaves the house, or, rather, the mansion -- the Blackwood mansion. Uncle Julian is too ill and Constance, the older sister, seems to be suffering from a combination of what we moderns would reductively label agoraphobia and social anxiety disorder. So the regular task of shopping for groceries and household needs falls to Merricat, who despises the errand.She despises it because the townspeople despise her and her family. Part of their hatred seems rooted in the Blackwood's wealth, but the other part of it has to do with the murders of several other members of the family, including the sisters' parents. Constance was charged with but acquitted of the killings. Despite that verdict, it is the townspeople's collective view that she got away with murder.In the end, though, it is not the plot of the novel that compells so deeply. It is the voice of Merricat, who serves as our narrator. She is, at 18, both diabolically intelligent and peevishly childish -- a girl-woman who seems to have little interest in growing up fully. Jackson's sure writing makes Merricat nothing less than indelible; after reading this book, you will feel this is someone you have met personally.The author herself died at age 48, which I always have thought was a terrible shame. Though she had been dealing with health problems, she was still writing, and I can't help wondering what other gems she would have completed had she lived a longer life."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I think most people read Shirley Jackson's The Lottery in high school; I know we did. After that though, I didn't come across her again for years, until one day I was on Amazon and saw that We Have Always Lived in the Castle was on sale. I loved The Lottery, so I figured I would give another one of her work's a try. I cannot believe I waited so many years to read her again!!Simply put, We Have Always Lived in the Castle is a classic for a reason! Merricat is possibly one of the most fascinating characters I have ever read. Wandering around the old house with her sister Constance and the cat, she seems to occupy a space that is her's alone. There is something faintly sinister about her polite facade, and you can just picture sharp teeth behind her sweet words and smile. Every word that comes out of her mouth is fascinating. I particularly enjoyed the tension during her interactions with her sister; there is a fine line between love and hate, which is never more present than in familial relationships!I don't want to give away the secrets or ending, in case someone has waited to read it like I did. I will just say that the ending was shocking, and well worth the build-up. I cannot recommend this book more highly!"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"In this novel Jackson has created a textbook-perfect example of an unreliable narrator.At first, it's easy to trust Merricat's view of the world, she seems like a sympathetic victim of cruelty from the village. But it doesn't take long before we another Merricat, and it is this obsessive, amoral, stunted and narcissistic young woman that forms the backbone and brilliance of Jackson's creepy novel. Yes, there are a few problems with the plot and some believability issues, but at the end of the day, this book is a brilliant character study and a wonderful read."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"What a strange, subtly unnerving book this is. Trying to describe the plot of We Have Always Lived in the Castle is challenging, partially because not much truly \\"happens\\" in the book, but mostly because so much of what makes the book effective and powerful comes from the method of the storytelling. As narrated by a young girl affectionately known as Merricat - whose 18 years don't often come through in her voice - Castle is the tale of the Blackwoods, a rich family who suffered a massive tragedy many years ago. Now, all that remain of the family are Merricat, her older sister Constance, and their Uncle Julian, who has never been the same since...well, that's to be discovered. What matters is that the surviving Blackwoods are figures of unease, hatred, scorn, and even terror in the village near their manor, and although Merricat is outwardly charming and girlish, her dark, even murderous thoughts make you realize that there are some truly unsettling undercurrents to be found in the Blackwood house, even as the family itself is one ruled by love and kindness toward each other. We Have Always Lived in the Castle is a novel about isolation, in some ways (imagine any small town novel with the creepy outcast, only imagine that the book is told from the outcast's perspective), but it's also a strangely unsettling tale, made all the more so because it's difficult to put your finger on what, exactly, makes the book so unnerving. Much as in The Haunting of Hill House, Jackson tells her tale through implications and oblique characters, but the impact here is incredible; for such a seemingly simple tale, Castle has left me thinking and analyzing it in some great depth as I think on it. If all you know of Jackson is The Lottery and Hill House, you have to check this one out; on the other hand, if you just want an unsettling character study and a fascinating immersion into a deeply damaged family, this one should be near the top of your list."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"This novel is even better than Jackson's more famous _The Haunting of Hill House_. This is a novel about madness, but until the middle of the book, you're not sure just which one of the Blackwood sisters is off her rocker. Which one of the sisters killed the rest of the Blackwood family, and why? The sisters seem content to live in Blackwood Manor, even though the entire town views them as freaks and murderesses, until cousin Charles shows up. Then the fun really begins!What makes this novel turly creepy is the psychological disfunction of these two women. There are no supernatural influences here, as there were in _The Haunting of Hill House_; the antagonist is a person who simply cannot live in the real world, and has to create her own reality.This novel is an especially good read for a stormy night. But be sure to finish it at one sitting, as it will be sure to haunt you afterwards."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"When it comes to books with which I am unfamiliar, the opening paragraph is usually my means of deciding whether or not to read it.

Like her well-known and highly regarded \\"The Lottery\\" and \\"THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE,\\" this novella is unique and gripping. It deals not with the supernatural (as in THE HAUNTING OF...) but with human relationships and their peculiar psychological twists and turns.It's hard to discuss the book without giving away aspects of the plot that may spoil your enjoyment. Just know that if you are a fan of psychological horror, this is one of the sleepers. Not as well known as the classic Jackson works but nonetheless surprising and gripping.I hope the opening paragraph is also enough to get you started on this wonderful, perplexing tale."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I'm no stranger to the genius of Jackson's mind after reading The Haunting and she certainly didn't disappoint in this novel, there is strength but also perfect restraint that keeps it from being gauche. The writing is simply exquisite as it skillfully wraps the reader like a cozy blanket, sometimes when I read it I felt as if I was struck by a moment so beautiful that it made time stop, I would re-read it again and picture it in my head almost smelling the heady swaying grass and the sun shimmering in the morning breeze as Mary Katherine Blackwood and her feline companion wandered through the beautiful nature surrounding their decaying house. This book was written in the sixties but it's still felt refreshing in its own refined way, it's a literary treasure that should be read about and discussed because it's simply wonderful and it reads a bit like a period piece but it only adds to its charm ( and it's definitely easy to read). I love gory horror books but this was just as good as the most intense and popular thrilling read from the past few months, so trust me, this is a good book!The Blackwood house is no longer the social gathering of great minds but a leftover with living ghosts, people who were once a part of a family until a fatal dinner laced with arsenic put the end to the festivities leaving behind only a handful of surviving family members. Sick and ailing uncle Julian, his niece Constance along with her younger eighteen year old sister Mary Kate (playfully called Merricat) and her black cat. They are left to their own way of life taking it one day at a time which means going into town only when they find it absolutely necessary and they are not bothered by what is happening in the world. The Blackwoods are busy eating delectable things in the privacy of their own garden as they seem to have dropped out of the society and time itself by living a suspended life on their own terms with their own secrets and ceremonies, especially those upheld by Merricat. Normal in general form doesn't hold place in the Blackwood mansion, people who live in it do whatever they want anytime they please, perhaps that is why the arrival of handsome cousin Charles stirs the household so hard of its axis, his family connections enable him to get in but when the wants to take over the fortune his future isn't too bright when it comes to accomplishing it, Merricat is a smart kid and she won't let anyone even if they are admired by older Constance to take over her world no matter what! People form the near by town want to know what is going on in the mysterious house at the same time as old demons come to the surface and that final arsenic laced dinner rears it's ugly head again revealing the mystery behind the strange deaths. The struggle between different worlds is apparent and the conclusion is incredible, anyone reading this will have their favorites and their villains and will probably be surprised to see who they end up rooting for.

Constance spends her days tending the garden and cooking. Merricat plays with the Cat, Jonas, and wanders around the grounds burying things as she tries to keep bad things from happening while looking for omens. Uncle Julian takes notes and feebly writes a book he's been working on for years regarding an incident that occurred long ago which altered their lives inbetween meals and naps.The villagers have bad opinions of the tiny family and children tend to taunt them, while a few of the villagers do try to be friendly the family stays hidden and guards themselves against the cruel outside world.A cousin decides to visit them after the patriarch of his divided family dies. Cousin Charles is a fortune hunter looking for the family fortune when he heads up to the old house and tries to weasel into the family and change things, but sometime's change isn't good and routines are the way they are for a reason.Shirley Jackson's writing is spellbinding and polished in this novel. Discovering the secrets of the dark house and it's inhabitants are well worth an afternoon's read. It's interesting to note that according to the biography, Private Demons, writing, We Have Always Lived in the Castle, was one of the reasons that Shirley became agoraphobic in the last years of her life. Also, in regards to this story, in it Shirley described that she was both character's in the novel, Merricat and Constance, and the two characters represented her daughters as well."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"In the aftermath of the murder of family, Mary Katherine \\"Merricat\\" Blackwood attempts to carry on her life on the family estate with her sister, Constance, acquitted of putting the arsenic in the sugar bowl that killed the family, and her uncle Julian, the only member to survive the poisoning, although with great physical and mental damage. With Merricat as her narrator, Shirley Jackson tells the tale of a family conscientiously living apart from the world, as Merricat uses various magicks to protect her surviving relatives from the outside world, particularly from the villagers who hate the Blackwood family. Constance cooks and cleans and Uncle Julian flits in and out of reality, to the satisfaction of all. That is, until their estranged cousin Charles appears to assert his will over Constance and what he sees as his rights in the Blackwood estate, all the while meeting resistance from Merricat.Shirley Jackson, best known for \\"The Haunting of Hill House,\\" weaves a macabre tale in \\"We Have Always Lived in the Castle.\\" Although, this book isn't exactly a \\"tale.\\" Jackson sets up many enticing plot threads: who did poison the family? ; why do the villagers hate the Blackwoods so much? ; and why has Charles come and why does he exert such influence over Constance. The most important issue Jackson raises is the character of Merricat: how trustworthy is this girl who buries things in the grounds around the house in the belief that doing so will keep out harm? However, when these issues are resolved (and, truthfully, not all of them are), they are anticlimactic. Indeed, it more likely than not that, upon reaching the last page, the reader will probably be disappointed with the overall plot of the novel, and perhaps feel that the novel is a little pointless.I suspect that this initial response was part of Jackson's intent. For upon further reflection, the reader may realize that this is not really a novel interested in plot but rather in character and mood. And even then, the novel is concerned with WHAT people do, but cares not a whit for WHY they do these things. Merricat is an excellent vehicle for Jackson's exploration. When we first meet Merricat, she is shopping for the household in a town full of people who hate her for the family she belongs to. Nonetheless, she is strong, defiant, and sympathetic as she takes abuse but is not cowed. As the novel progresses, the reader's sympathy and trust in Merricat as a narrator erode simultaneously. Merricat is childish, narcissistic, and paranoid. She reports events, but her interpretations of these events are suspect. The more Merricat reveals of herself, the reader cannot help but wonder if so much of the misery hanging over the Blackwoods stems from Merricat's efforts to keep the world out, and that her indulgent sister is doing her no favors.Mood is the other critical element in this book. The inevitability of tragedy hangs over every word and deed. It draws the reader along, keeping us firmly entrenched in Merricat's unhealthy mind until the very end. It should come as no surprise that Jackson provides no satisfactory answers. As long as the Blackwoods refuse to come to terms with the cancer within, they cannot be happy.\\"We Have Always Lived in the Castle\\" is a peculiar book. It is simultaneously substantial and elusive. While the plot may not be completely gratifying, the unhappy character Merricat Blackwood is a powerful draw, and plays on the reader's mind long after the book is done. Thus, Jackson has created a creepy tale of family despair."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Time has stopped at Blackwood house, refusing to progress since the dark day arsenic found its way into the communal sugar bowl, killing four of seven family members.

She is intensely protective of her sister, innocently contributing to Constance's agoraphobia and other anxiety problems, but is not without a gleefully dark sense of humor. When the local gossip drags someone along for an unwelcome visit, visibly upsetting her sister, Merricat pertly offers the frightened woman some sugar for her tea. She is not slow or retarded, as has been previously suggested, her mental development is simply in stasis from years of living in an unchanging vacuum. She is treated as a child and so she remains.Julian, still suffering from the effects of the poisoning, relives the same few days over and over, oblivious to his declining health and mental lapses. Constance, on the other hand, seems completely aware as to how unhealthy all this is but is simply too frightened to take a first step until her cousin Charlie arrives with ulterior motives that will eventually shatter what little sanity is left.The horror label is misleading, as this is neither the orgy of sex and gore nor the mindless splatterfest typical of the genre. 'Castle' is more of a pschological dissection containing elements of the Gothic. Within, Jackson has crafted a truly unique narrator and a spectacular tale of human cruelty and the fragility of the human psyche. It is a tale of quiet ordinarity and the damage that can be wrought on the human mind through small actions, both well-intentioned and spiteful. In short, it is one of the few books in a very long time that had me salivating for more and blissfully satisfied at the end."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"What made me want to read this book initially was the title. This was my first time reading or hearing of the author Shirley Jackson. I really enjoyed this \\"quirky\\" book.The story is about the two sisters, Constance and Mary Katherine Blackwood, who live together with there somewhat senile uncle, Julian Blackwood. You learn early on that the rest of the family died due to arsenic poisoning. The arsenic was in the sugar that was sprinkled over the blackberries that was for desert. Uncle Julian survived the poisoning, Constance did not eat blackberries, and Mary Katherine was sent to bed without desert that night. Constance was accused of the murder but was later freed. We get the details of that night in bits and pieces from Uncle Julian because he is writing a book about the subject. The books has never been produced because he is always reviewing his \\"papers.\\"The story's narrator is Mary Katherine known throughout the story as, Merricat. The sisters along with their uncle live a very reclusive life. Merricat hates the very idea of having to interact with the townspeople. The townspeople are not very fond of the Blackwood family either because of their wealth. I really feel in love with Merricat's character. She suffered from anxiety and a mild form of OCD but she had a \\"snob\\" side that I loved. Constance was so motherly and protective of Merricat. Uncle Julian was hilarious.Towards the end we meet their estranged cousin Charles Blackwood who Merricat immediately deems a ghost and a demon. Charles's greed disrupted the family and his presence brought on an awful tragedy. My favorite part of the novel was how when Charles said something to Merricat she would respond with the latin name of a poisonous mushroom! Every great novel has a cat and this one was no exception he was Merricat's constant companion, Jonas.

I haven't read Hill House and not even \\"The Lottery\\" but I can promise you after diving into this brilliant, poetic, stunning novel by her I will be going after her complete library next.I'm not going to repeat the plot from the back of the book or from other reviewers, but I will simply tell you that this is one of the best books I have ever read. The characters are expertly developed, the setting is crisp and haunting, every word is brilliant and artistic. Jackson writes so beautifully and timelessly that you really can't place her. Her style is as carefully crafted as the hundred year old \\"school\\" novels, but as page-turning and juicy as modern bestsellers.I hear there is a movie adaptation planned for this in the works, and I'm excited to see it - but DON'T miss out on this book. Even if the movie gets great reviews and is claimed to be the best literary adaptation ever made, Jackson's prose is so perfect, and the dialogue so real and haunting that you will truly be missing out if you do not read it."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"Shirley jackson, famous for \\"The Haunting of Hill House\\" delivers another winner, albeit a more restrained one. This time, no haunted house, no paranormal activities. Just small town pettiness and a creeping sense of paranoia. Well written, eloquent, this would make a fascinating on-secreen psychological drama. The book is not dated at all, but on the contrary acts as a still relevant and poignant indicment of intolerance and meanness. What emerges in the end is the utter alienation of the main protagonists. There is a pervading sense of loneliness in Miss Jackson's writing that is absolutely compelling. I won't reveal the ending, but rest assured: this book is a wonderful addition to any booklover library. This Penguin edition cover is also nicely designed and features a very enlightening foreword penned by Jonathan Lethem, author of \\"The Fortress of Solitude\\". A true gem!"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle takes place at the Blackwood House which was the scene of a multiple murder, when a family save for three died of ingesting poison. The residents of the home that survived include the eldest daughter, Constance, who made dinner that night, Uncle Julian, the elderly and morbidly ill survivor of the fatal meal, and Merricat, the younger sister, who was sent to her room and not allowed dinner that eve. They live in the mansion that there family once shared closed off from the town people who bully them, ransack their house, and treat them cruelly. Since there was never anyone charged with the arsenic tainted dinner, the townspeople pinpoint Constance, who is terrified of leaving the mansion.They settle into a routine of hiding away from the villagers, except for Merrikat who does errands. They try and live quietly day to day until a greedy cousin Charles visits, and begins disrupting their lives. In the course of his visit the family secret of what really happened is revealed and shatters the already fragile lives of the young girls.Jackson is an amazing character writer and we have some eccentric ones in this novel- Merricat, a macabre character who uses charms and hexes to tune out the hatred of others, Uncle Julian whose mind is so warped as he tells aloud to anyone who is listening, the events of that night trying to come to a whodunit conclusion, and cousin Charles who wants the house out of greed.This book examines what happens when a family is shattered and the truth is held back too long. The fear and anxiety of the sisters combined with the hostility, blunt rage, and inhumanity of the villagers makes this a compelling novel. Add in murder, magic, and suspense you have a perfect Shirley Jackson thriller."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"This novel, written by the Stephen King of her day is a psychological horror story. About two young women who are forced to live alone by cruel townspeople. Then one day the older is seduced by a cousin appearing as a \\"friend.\\" Although not as good as two of the author's most famous works \\"Lottery, Haunting of Hill House.\\" The characters are very well drawn and the writing disturbing. In fact there is one scene in the book that was very similar to one I had and was so affected by it that I almost \\"lost\\" the novel."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I heard about this book through a book club. I have never heard of Shirley Jackson before but I did see a movie \\"haunting of hill house\\", which i had no idea that Shirley wrote.I started by reading the text. I got through about 1 chapter when I was finally able to take out the audiobook from my library. I then started the audiobook from the beginning and finished it in about one week. The audiobook is from Blackstone Audio, narrated by Bernadette Dunne (unabridged) (5 disks).Not very much happened in this story so I don't want to give too much away. It's about 2 sisters, one older, who live together, in a really big old house, with their ailed and dying uncle Julian. We don't know what's wrong with the uncle. Suffice it to say, he is in a wheelchair, forgets things a lot and relies on the girls for meals and his schedule.The girls come from a really rich family. But at point, not too long before the story began, there was a murder in the house and the older sister, Constance, was accused. They put her on trail but acquitted her of all charges. The reputation, in this small town, persists.The younger sister, Mary Catherine aka \\"Merricat\\", spends all day either in the house, or on their big property. Every once in a while she'll go into town to by groceries or to the library, but she hates going into town and the people are mean to her. Merricat is very focused on routine, rules, and has compulsive rituals. To ward off evil, she believes that if she avoids saying certain words, then no evil will come.Neither of them like interacting with the outside world, or want to make friends, or to go out. They just want to stay at home, in private.And then something comes along that changes everything, as they say \\"the change in coming.\\"At this point, we're about half-way into the book.There is a strong per-occupation in this book about death, dying, poisons, the ground, as well as a need for privacy, silence, solitude, and to be far from strangers. In a way, even though the girls are alive, they lock themselves in the house like it's their own tomb. Silent, and far from the outside world. Even after \\"THE CHANGE\\" they still refuse to go out, and in fact, it just causes them to shut in even more. To me, this behavior is totally illogical. I don't think any normal person would do that, and would probably want to do the opposite.But then not very much of their behavior makes sense. They don't go to school, they don't work, they don't talk about paying bills, or needing things, or ever having friends. They're a world apart from everyone else. Even for the 50's when Shirley probably wrote this story, their behavior would be very unusual. No wonder all the town people are talking; you can't really blame them.It is a very strange story. It is not particularly scary or dramatic, just odd. Reading the text was a bit difficult because there was a lot of repetition, for example \\"And then he stepped outside and closed the door, and needed his shawl. And after the door was closed, he placed the shawl and his lap and was happy to be outside.\\" This is not a direct quote, but an example of the type of circular repetitive, looped thinking and wording that is constant throughout the entire book. It makes readying difficult because you feel like you're read and reread the same sentence over and over. You think YOU are the one going slightly mad.However, on the audiobook, it was much clearer and easier to understand, and to follow along, and you KNEW you were NOT rereading the same sentence by accident. Bernadette did a really good job of reading all the characters well. She was easy to understand and tell apart. The pace and volume were both good as well. I really enjoyed the audiobook more.Did I like the story? Not really. It was odd, but nothing that I loved. Did I like the writing? Not particularly, nothing except the repetition really stood out and I don't like repetition in general. Did it cause me to stop and think? Yes, all along I was wondering why these women are cooped up in the house like crazy people. And the entire time I really thought something was mentally wrong there. Perhaps it really was, but not specifically stated in the story.Is it different? Yes, it certainly is odd, unusual, etc. The general feel of the story was annoyance intermingled with creepiness. At times, I really wanted the girls to DO something and of course, they didn't.I can't say I would really recommend it to others. It's a curious story, different. But is it worthwhile of classical or dramatics standing? I don't think so.I'm sure there are tons of literary critics who would think otherwise. But I just don't see any major reasons for this, other then, it's a very different type of story about really strange, ritualistic, lonely, and slightly mad sisters."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle / 978-1-4417-3428-0My husband and I purchased this audio book to listen to during a long car drive. The audio book quality is good - the solo narrator has a solid voice and decent changes and inflections when she voices the multiple characters. For some reason, her voice reminds me a little ofMaria Bamberg, whose voice talents I deeply enjoy. For the overall story, however, we were nonplussed - this isn't really a creepy story, or a character-propelled story, or indeed a story where much of anything happens at all.For one thing, despite the tease on the box that there will be a \\"revelation of a terrible secret\\", this is not a suspense story. The \\"terrible secret\\" of the murderer's identity is completely obvious from the first few chapters - both my husband and I came to the same correct conclusion about 45 minutes into the reading. So if you're coming to this for any sense of suspense, you'll leave disappointed, because there is never any suspenseful buildup and never any kind of meaningful resolution of the events behind the murder. Annoyingly, the identity of the murderer is pretty much the ONLY thing the reader will learn about the murder mentioned on the blurb - outside of the initial who/what/where/when exposition dump in the early chapters, the backstory is never fully developed or explored. A few tantalizing hints are dropped of potentially interesting side elements - the family feuds, the suspicious age differences, and the abusive politics at play that have left all the surviving members of the family so broken and shattered - but none of these elements are developed and they all feel tragically wasted. Despite several situations seeming ripe for one, there's no real \\"twist\\" here to reward the reader - with the murderer known to everyone (including the reader) from the get-go, and with no ghosts (real or metaphorical) to appear and/or vanquish, all the reader is left with is the slow slog to the finish line. The only real character \\"development\\" to be had here is limited to an extremely tame and vanilla spiral into further agoraphobia - and it's just not enough to carry the reader to the finish line.Listening to this novel, I realized that this is one of those stories that English majors often encounter - a story where the critical commentary (particularly the ones with Epileptic Tree theories) is far more interesting than the actual story itself, because the critical commentary can delve into those tantalizing potentialities that the actual story refused to develop. I can see how, if I'd been assigned this in my English major days, I'd appreciate this book more - it's short, sweet, and to the point - but as a read-for-pleasure novel, I feel that it failed us. I understand that a lot of people truly love this novel, and to each their own, so take this dissenting viewpoint with however many grains of salt.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"When I was a kid I had Merricat's habit of burying things and drinking words from a glass so they'd go away. My favorite book. I love it."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"The best lines in the novel may be the first. \\"My name is Mary Katherine Blackwood. I am eighteen years old, and I live with my sister Constance. I have often thought that with any luck at all I could have been born a werewolf, because the two middle fingers on both my hands are the same length...\\" There's a hooker for you.It's not a horror story. There's nothing supernatural about it, but it's terribly spooky nonetheless because it involves a trip into the mind of what psychiatrists would call a schizotypal personality. Mary is given to magical thinking and odd behavior. She buries things. She sees people as demons. She believes that if she wishes intently enough she can make things come true. She dreams about living on the moon.Mary poisoned a couple of people in her family some time ago and now lives in a locked up house off the beaten path with Constance and Uncle Julian, who is old and a little dotty because he happened to consume some of Mary's arsenic sugar. They're all a little screwy. Mary goes shopping once a week to supplement the vegetables and beef that generations of Blackwoods have stored up. She carefully crosses the street at only certain points, avoids looking directly at people, and speaks to almost no one, though many of the villagers try to tease her about the arsenic incident.The novel is rather a long, slow slog after those first few sentences. For 114 pages (about half the book) we learn all about the regimented and private lives of the three family members, and about the structure of the house, and about the routine of its maintenance, and about the vegetable garden and about the tree house and about the marbles buried by the creek and -- excuse me while I pendiculate.Then Cousin Charlie comes to visit. What a bummer. He pokes around in secret places looking for hidden stashes of money. He appropriates Father's watch and chain. He casts goo-goo eyes at Constance who begins to respond. He mutters barely masked threats against Mary Katherine. He muses about putting Uncle Julian away and he stinks up the joint with his pipe.Inadvertently Mary burns off the top floor of the old house with that smoldering pipe. The villagers come to enjoy the fire and they smash everything they get their hands on before finally leaving. Uncle Julian expires of a heart attack off screen.In the end, Mary and Constance have sealed off the top floor, boarded up the windows, and never leave the house again. The penitent villagers develop a habit of leaving baskets of food at the front door, making it unnecessary to shop. Cousin Charlie is long gone. Only the two women and the cat Jonas remain, sitting silently in the dark, locked, decapitated mansion. Last line of the novel: \\"...Oh, Constance,' I said, 'we are so happy.'\\"Shirley Jackson isn't a fancy writer. There are no high-brow allusions and she works with ordinary, somewhat stripped-down prose, but that makes it all the more effective because the stuff she's writing about -- so casually, so negligently -- involves some antics that would look pretty bizarre to most outside observers.I found it worth reading, despite that 100-page longueur towards the beginning. It may not be up to her best work. I think some of her short stories are better because there, at least, we may find the occasional comedic touch."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"My low rating for this book may not be entirely fair. This book does have some merit in that it contains a depiction of extreme mental illness and family dysfunction. For that reason, it's not entirely without worth. However, it was a frustrating read and not enjoyable, IMO, precisely because of the mental illness and dysfunction portrayed within. I don't want to spoil anything by complaining in too much detail, but it was frustrating for me to see such extreme mental illness handwaved away by the other characters. It's not funny or \\"silly,\\" this character is sick and it's being entirely ignored! I was left unsatisfied. None of the characters were relatable and their actions were beyond strange. I'm unsure what the point was."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"This book exemplifies how outcast she felt in their suburban life in the fifties.

I recommend the book, but not this edition."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"This story revolves around a family that has sustained a major tragedy. Apparently, most of the family was murdered at supper one day via the introduction of arsenic into their food. Only three family members survive, sisters Constance and Mary Catherine Blackwood, and their elderly Uncle Julian. Constance, who always cooked for her family, was charged with their murder but aquitted at trial. The surviving three Blackwoods now live in splendid isolation in their mansion, as they are reviled by the villagers.Mary Catherine, the younger sister known affectionately as Merricat, is a strange girl. Bright, imaginative, and compulsive, she has an assortment of rituals that she carries out in her daily activities, which are somewhat limited. She rarely ventures beyond the curtilage of her stately home, except for trepidaciously entering the village to get necessary supplies. Her sister Constance, however, never ventures beyond the immediate perimeter of her home, though this is clearly something that she wishes to do. Uncle Julian is an invalid, living out his remaining days trying to figure out the mystery behind what had happened to his family that caused them all to be poisoned.They are truly alone, except for the rare visitors who knew their family prior to the tragedy that took place. Even these few visits are almost too much for them. Still, Constance does her best to entertain them, although Merricat clearly wishes they would not come. Their highly structured world, however, is slowly torn apart, when Charles, a cousin, comes to visit them. He inveigles and tantalizes Constance with visions of having a normal life. Needless to say, Merricat and Charles do not get along, as she perceives him to be the enemy, seeking to disrupt her orderly, though dysfunctional, world.The writing style is spare, taut, and, at times, quite compelling, as well as darkly humourous. Still, what happens to Constance and Merricat is no real surprise. What is problematic is one never really understands what makes Constance tick nor what makes Merricat do what she does. There is no resolution in the book, leaving the reader to fill in the blanks.While I admit that I am in the minority, as I found this book to be a little disappointing, I do I find it hard to believe that Time magazine, at one time, had named it one of the ten best novels of the year. While this a moderately enjoyable work, readers would do better to seek out Ms. Jackson's dazzling story, \\"The Lottery\\", a much better, and more satisfying, book."},{"Title":"We Have Always Lived in the Castle","review":"I purchased a collection of Shirey Jackson's short stories a few years ago because it contained my favorite \\"The Lottery\\". \\"We Have Always Live in the Castle\\" was one of the stories included.

I did on a damp and dreary Sunday afternoon which was the wrong time because I had trouble getting asleep last night!I like most everything else this author has written, but not this story."},{"Title":"Inspector Maigret and the Strangled Stripper","review":"Matched with Prichard's dreary reading, this recorded book grows rather threadbare.It could be interesting to have included the villain (although most seem villain here), or rather the assassin appear earlier in the tale in order to give us all a chance at figuring it out, but that is not to be (NO SPOILER HERE!). Making up an unknown at the end of the tale is not the preferred structuring of a detective story.This tale reflects a world post war in Paris, after the occupation, and the occupation, and still with a seedy night life.Rather deeply sad, and weary, and the reading by Prichard does not lift things much at all.An early Maigret, quirky, and perhaps leaning on filme noire and on Hemingway and such too much. Perhaps hoping to be used as a screen play somewhere, with Bogart, and Bacall.Still its listening fills a dark evening, if you're into that sort of thing.Far more interesting would be to hear it in the original French, or read it in same. For one thing the title indicates the infidelity of the translation from Maigret chez Picratte (sp.?), as the English title adopts a seedier Erle Stanley Gardner tone.Also available here by the same reader isMaigret Sets a Trap (Simenon)which aspires limply to psychology, and alsoNone of Maigret's Business (Simenon)which may be the more pleasant of the batch, as Maigret finds himself on vacation.Simenon was a former Parisian police reporter turned novelette writer, who eventually traveled to Hollywood and back and spent a long lifetime milking this Maigret series. Maigret is a police detective in Paris, and can be quite good, but please get us a better reader! Mr. Prichard did quite a few readings for the Audiobooks series, but I find his attempts to take on voices, particularly of women, gratingly unconvincing and shallow.Simenon makes little to no attempt here to enter the psychology of the women who work in this bar, and rather mocks them repeatedly, including the reference to describing one abused as shaking herself like a barnyard fowl.Not the best place to start with Maigret, nor the best way. Perhaps you may findNoel de Maigretinteresting. If you grow really fascinated, of course, you might choose the seriesTout Simenon Vol 15: Le Riche Homme / La Folle de Maigret / La Disparition d'Odile / Maigret et l'Homme Tout Seul / La Cage de Verre / Maigret et l'Indicateur / Les Innocents / Maigret et Monsieur Charlesalthough it is absurdly priced (yes, that is a faux pas in a review, but look at the cost of acquiring all of the volumes here!).I would love to see the great Jean Gabin (he ofGrand Illusion - Criterion Collection, etc.) asInspector Maigret [Region 2] but must wait . . .One wonders in horror whether it was the Maigret series which gave birth to the ridiculous Peter Sellers travesties.Also of possible interest are the series of DVD's includingMaigret - Volume 4 - 10-DVD Box Set ( Maigret et le fantme / Maigret et le marchand de vin / Maigret en Finlande / Maigret et la demoiselle de compagnie / Maigret et la croqueuse de diamants / Maigret et l'affaire Saint-Fiacre / Maigret et l'&eacute;cluse no.1and the dreary Michael Gambon seriesMaigret - Complete Series 1-2 [Non-U.S. Format Region 2 U.K. DVD Set] (Starring Michael Gambon)"},{"Title":"Chris Christophersen: A Play in Three Act (Six Scenes). Foreword by Leslie Eric Comens.","review":"Written in 1919 and performed in Atlantic City in 1920, this play (an early version of \\"Anna Christie,\\" which was staged on Broadway in 1921) remained unpublished until Leslie Comens recovered the typescript from the Library of Congress and edited it in 1982. Since \\"Anna Christie\\" is one of O'Neill's better known plays (and was awarded a Pulitzer Prize), this early version has not received much critical or theatrical attention, but fans of Eugene O'Neill will certainly appreciate it.The basic plot of \\"Chris Christophersen\\" is the same as \\"Anna Christie\\": Anna, the daughter of the title character, finds her estranged father in New York City. Formerly a sailor on transcontinental voyages, Christophersen now captains a small barge that hugs the Atlantic coast, always in sight of land. He has sworn off \\"dat ole devil\\" the sea, blaming his career for robbing him of a fulfilling life, killing the male members of his family, and causing him to neglect his own wife and children. When his daughter arrives, the former sailor is determined to keep her from falling in love with either the sea or anyone associated with it.The main difference between this version and \\"Anna Christie\\" is that, in the later play, Anna is a down-and-out prostitute who hides her former life from her father. In this version, the roles are reversed: Anna has been raised by a proper British family, and it is her father who tries to clean up his act. Although some scenes and bits of dialogue are shared between the two versions, the divergence is enough to make this earlier draft feel like an entirely different play.But which one is better? Most would agree that \\"Anna Christie\\" is a vast improvement largely because Anna's character is more fully realized. Yet the earlier version (in spite of its rather rushed, lame ending) does a better job, I think, portraying the relationship between two strangers who happen to be father and daughter. There is much to recommend both versions, but what will probably most fascinate fans of O'Neill is the process through which a great playwright resuscitates a play that has merit but isn't quite polished and turns it only one year later into a theatrical success."},{"Title":"The United States navy from the revolution to date,","review":"Of course, to date is 1918 (publishing date) and there is something interesting in just that.

I'm big into characterization and dialogue and this tackles both in a big way...the story is terrific as well. More people need to read this book. Like ''the berkut' and 'dark debts...karen hall' this in my opinion is an extremely unknown and therefore underrated novel!"},{"Title":"Last Reveille: A Novel","review":"David Morrell is one of my favorite authors. The only problem with being a Morrell fan is that he's not a big name author like King, Koontz or Grisham. You have to explain who he is to author book people and they usually get turned off when you mention one of the most famous characters in fiction: Rambo. Too bad because Morrell writes multiple genres - supense, historical fiction, horror - and he does them well and he is definitely should be known more as the creator of the cartoonish image most people have of Rambo. Anyway, I'm slowly working my way through his older books and enjoying myself.\\"Last Reveille\\" is Morrell's foray into historical fiction. First published in 1977, the 1994 edition has an eight page introduction to the book that sets the book up quite well. He notes that it is similar to the John Wayne movieThe Shootistin that there is an aging character that becomes a composite, a symbol of America's past (note that the book was nearly done when the movie came out).The aging character is Miles Calender, a name designed to evoke his age and the distance he has travelled. The young soldier that is learning his ways is Prentice, a named taken from apprentice. They are involved in Blackjack Pershing's expedition into Mexico to try to capture Pancho Villa.Is it good historical fiction?Yeah. It seems solid to me (a history teacher but I do not claim to be an expert on Pancho Villa, Pershing or the military hardware of the time).Is it a good book?While not Morrell's best, it is a good book, worthy of your time. Kind of like a western with some real nuggets of literature thrown in. There are themes, exploration of the male psyche (father figures, friendship, etc.) and gunfire. What's not to like?"},{"Title":"Last Reveille: A Novel","review":"Very true that this is nothing like Morrell's other mystery/adventure writting, and more's the pity. It's historically accurate, well written, and written from the point of view of the folks who live at the bloody end of the national spear. It's set in Mexico during the Pershing Punative Expedition, and it's a shame that it wasn't made into a movie. With William Holden or Lee Marvin as the old scout, Sam or Timothy Bottoms as the recruit who becomes the old scout's understudy, and with Tom Selleck as the Major who looks after the old scout, this could have been as good or better than The Wild Bunch. If you liked The Wild Bunch or The Professionals, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Last Reveille: A Novel","review":"Very nice read, one of his earliest book written in a different style than his fans are used to, a touching story."},{"Title":"Sandstorm","review":"The 18 essays in this superb 392-page volume were all printed as articles in the US foreign policy quarterly, Orbis: A Journal of World Affairs between 1986 and 1991. A few pieces are clearly dated. But for the most part, age has not lessened their value. Overall, they provide understanding of a conflict-filled region that violently surged into view with the Islamic terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.The book is divided into 4 sections. Although scholarly, the articles are easily accessible to lay readers wanting a broad overview of the troubles currently afflicting the entire region.The first four articles provide a frightening window onto the political realities in Egypt, Algeria, Lebanon and the fundamentalist Sunni states. Emmanuel Sivan considers the shape an Egyptian Islamic republic might take. His sobering sketch is hardly far-fetched: Moderates and secularists like Hussein Ahmad Amin and Faraj Fuda despair that even former moderates like H. Hanafi and A. Abdel Malek now sympathize with fundamentalists. Similarly, Khalid Duran portrays the political dysfunction that overtook Algeria during its 2nd revolution in 1988, when Algerian soldiers killed nearly 500 rioting children and where militant Islam remains a force to reckon with. Hilal Khashan found Shi'i students in Lebanon to espouse surprising political moderation. However, he predicted a Pan-Arab revival north of Arabia, fueled by Sunnis who are apt to support Saddam Hussein and radical anti-Western views. This seems already to have occurred.Of six articles on the Arab-Israeli conflict, the first four are most interesting. Michael Mandelbaum considers Israel's security dilemma. Mitchell Bard predicts that, near-term, the &quot;emotional, religious and historical sources of conflict&quot; will not disappear. Aaron David Miller posits that Arab &quot;cost/benefit&quot; analysis has recently moderated their policies, though he considers a return to old animosities possible so long as Arab states maintain a war stance toward Israel. And Robert Satloff warns darkly that Washington risked disaster in attempting to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict without considering the influence of fundamentalists in the West Bank and Gaza.The book also includes five superb articles on the Persian Gulf. Efriam Karsh's 1989 article warned that the Iran-Iraq war badly eroded international red lines during war, including the use of poison gas, increasing the potential for violent Middle Eastern wars. This was born out with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait a year later, and judging from recent events, we have not seen the last of this. Martin Kramer exposes the clash of Muslims against Muslims in Mecca in 1987. Two articles on Iranian-US relations are somewhat more dated, but still relevant. Eliyahu Kanovsky, whom I once interviewed for Forbes, predicted that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait would precede a decline in oil prices. Kanovsky's ideas were so counter-intuitive that Forbes wouldn't print them. Nevertheless, he was right. We should listen.The final section features only three articles--on the military benefits of US relations with Israel (Steven Spiegel); the April 1986 US raid on Libya (Frederick Zilian) and how the Iran-Contra story broke (Daniel Pipes). The last one is worth the entire price of admission, especially for journalists curious about the mechanical details of THE story of the 1980s. Alyssa A.

They are simple and non-cluttered and give an accurate enoughfeel for the lay of the land. It covers many of the more common bases - teepees, headdresses, horses, cacti, their dances and weapons, and theanimals around them (though I confess I have never connected moose and Indians together before), the papooses, and momma's cooking pot.

What makes them great is that they are not in the usual Osprey fashion. Their is no chronology of dates at the begging taking up space; Chartrand jumps right in with organization details, tactics, equipment, armament, and each regiments uniform distinction as it changed through Louis XV reign. The plates are outstanding. Usually for Osprey their only three figures per plate. Not here, 5 and more a plate. With that number it's not cluttered and doesn't detract from the detail. On a last note, I will never have to buy anything else to help me paint my Seven Year War French figures."},{"Title":"Louis XV's Army (1) : Cavalry & Dragoons (Men-At-Arms Series, 296)","review":"This is an excellently-illustrated introduction to the cavalry regiments of the army of Louis XV of France. There are many contemporary monochrome illustrations supporting the text. The colour plates are brilliantly-executed watercolours.The Author - \\"A substantial part of Louis XV's army consisted of numerous regiments of guard cavalry, heavy cavalry and dragoon regiments, all of which were considered the best and noblest part of the army.\\"The Introduction -\\"France had a population of between 22 and 25 million at that time, and maintained the largest standing army in Europe. In peacetime it might have amounted to about 200,000 men; in times of war, it could be anything up to half a million. The majority of the troops were stationed along France's borders with Flanders, Germany and Italy, with a few thousand garrisoning seaports and the colonies.\\"\\"Yet France could hardly be termed a military society. It had approximately one regular soldier per 110 inhabitants in peacetime and one per 65 in wartime, compared to one in 27 in peace and one in 14 in war in a military state such as Prussia. The ratio of officers to men in France was very high: one in 11 enlisted men in the 1740s compared to Prussia's one in 29. Thus up to half of the army's budget for pay went to officers, and, proportionally the French army cost about a third more than that of Prussia.\\"The Contents are -P03: Introduction; The Royal Guard Cavalry.Gardes du Corps; Gendarmes de la Garde; Chevaux-legers de la Garde; Grenadiers a Cheval de la Garde; Mousquetaires de la Garde; Gendarmerie de France; Gardes du Corps de Monsieur; Gardes du Corps du Comte d'Artois; Gardes du Corps du Roi de PologneP11: Heavy Cavalry.Structure; Tactics; Uniforms; regiments (x61); Carabiniers; Post-1760 reformsP33: Dragoons.Uniforms; Regiments (x17)P38: Standards and Guidons.Liveries for musiciansP41: Plate CommentariesP47: Bibliography; French & German CommentariesThe Colour Plates (between pages 25 and 32) -A: Gardes du Corps, mid-18th century - 1, Trooper, Scottish Company; 2, Trooper, First French Company; 3, Trooper, 3rd French Company; 4, Kettle-drummer, 2nd French Company.All these figures are in blue coats and red facings; #3 & #4, are mounted, #1 & #2 are on foot.B: Gendarmes and Chevaux-legers Guard Companies, mid-18th century - 1, Trooper, gendarme Company; 2, Trooper, Chevaux-legers Company; 3, Gendarmes Company Trumpeter; 4, Chevaux-legers Company trumpeter.Figures #1-3 are in red coats, #4 is in blue; 3 has lots of gold decoration, #4 has lots of silver and gold; #2-4 are mounted, #1 is on footC: Mousquetaires and Grenadiers a Cheval, mid-18th century - 1, Trooper, Mousquetaire, 1st Company;, 2, Drummer, Mousquetaire, 2nd Company; 3, Trooper, Grenadiers a Cheval.Figure #2 is mounted, #2 & #3 are on foot, but with smaller mounted versions in the background; #3 has a blue coat, #1 & #2 have red coats with blue tabards.D: Gendarmerie de France, mid-18th century - 1-3, Officer, Trumpeter, Trooper, Chevaux-legers du Dauphin; 4, Trooper, Gendarmes du Dauphin; 5, Trooper, Chevaux-legers de Bretagne.Figures #1-3 are on foot, #4 & #5 are mounted; #1, #3, #4 are in red coats, #2 is in a blue coat with lots of silver, #5 is in a buff coat.E: Cavalry of the Line, 1740s and 1750s - 1, Trooper, Cuirassiers du Roi Regiment, 1740s; 2, Trooper, Wurtemberg Regiment, c.1756-1761; 3, Cavalry trooper, 4, Kettle-drummer, Conde Cavalry regiment.Figure #4 is mounted, the rest are on foot.
