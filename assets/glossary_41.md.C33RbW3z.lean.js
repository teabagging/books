Not the topic I had expected! I love trivia, so my interest was piqued.From the dust-jacket flap:\\"Here, for your entrancement and enlightenment, are exits made by 175 people famous during the past 3,000 years\\".The book covers people from John Jacob Astor IV to 'Mama' Cass Elliot and Ivan the Terrible to Virginia Woolf. Don't know who the person was? Forbes does briefly discuss how the person became famous (or infamous) and sometimes adds in some deliciously odd twists that occurred during the person's life. He then, of course, tells you about their (often) bizarre or ironic deaths.Forbes speaks in language that is colorful and he keeps you so interested that you want to read it from front to back even though you could really pick up the book and turn to any page to learn something that you didn't know before. I enjoyed it immensely."},{"Title":"They Went That-A-Way: How the Famous, the Infamous, and the Great Died","review":"They Went That A-Way is a collection of over 150 1-2 page sketches of famous personalities, mostly from the 19th and 20th centuries. Each sketch contains a short summary of the person's life and accomplishments, then a description of how they met their end. The book is well done, however I found it a little depressing, as the majority of the personalities were dysfunctional, dying from alcoholism, drugs, or suicide."},{"Title":"They Went That-A-Way: How the Famous, the Infamous, and the Great Died","review":"Malcolm Forbes was a very interesting figure indeed.Great subject he has chosen to write, and he wrote it very lively and colorful.The book has short biographies of many interesting figures in history, and describes the not-so-known-facts about how they died.I used to read this book at bedtime, because its such a good way to go to sleep happily knowing that we all die and we should take care of us, each other and the whole world - as long as we live today, and not let ourselves get carried away about things we plan to do in the distant future."},{"Title":"They Went That-A-Way: How the Famous, the Infamous, and the Great Died","review":"This is a must-have on your bookshelf. From the famous to the infamous, here are the sad, surprising, strange, or sordid ends that have befallen well-known names from the past. The breadth is impressive for a small book, and there are a few names that may not be familiar. You'll receive a brief biography for each alphabetized entry and a summary of the events that led up to their death. Minor quibbles are lack of citations or references and a general tone of innuendo. It's not a classical historical reference, but rather a maudlin set of stories that would probably be difficult to track down yourself. And so it is all democratically minded, we will all go that-a-way...one day."},{"Title":"They Went That-A-Way: How the Famous, the Infamous, and the Great Died","review":"Clearing up errors and enhancing the details of the deaths of the famous and infamous, this book is a surprisingly interesting and fun read.

It introduced me to such personalities such as Primmie Niven, Carole Lombard and Huey Long (hey, I'm 23 they were way before my time). Forbes gives great detail and he makes death look interesting, not something to be look forward to. I can tell he had fun writing and researching this book and if Malcolm were alive today I'm sure someone would write a sequel to this book. Perhaps the sequel would have Princess Di (another monarchy figure), Kurt Cobain (Jimi and Jim of the 90s), Dr. Atkins (the so-called revolutionary diet hero dies from a fall) and maybe Malcolm himself.

Taken as a grouping, these three may be the definitive report of the social history of the moment, as impacted by that War. Obviously, Tom Brokaw's book of individual reminiscences, THE GREATEST GENERATION, must be included with this list as well.In common with all of these others, David Brinkley, too, is an excellent writer who makes history lively and interesting. As with each of the other books mentioned in this group, WASHINGTON GOES TO WAR can stand alone on its own merits. Yet each of these books gains synergistically by being read in tandem with the others.This was a fascinating moment in modern history, and David Brinkley tells tales that most readers would have no other way of learning."},{"Title":"Washington Goes to War","review":"I am only 17 years old but when I was reading this book I felt like I really knew the world that Brinkley was talking about. Ashley in DC"},{"Title":"Washington Goes to War","review":"In 1940 Washington, DC was a town that hosted our national government. By the end of 1945 it was a city and the central focus of a government that managed the sixteen million men and women in uniform who fought the Second World War and the other millions who supported the effort at home.This required office space, housing, entertainment and above all people, people, people. More people than anyone imagined could be supported in our ten mile square federal district.David Brinkley saw the transformation first hand. People and buildings could literally not be deployed fast enough in our nation's capitol city to keep up with the demands of World War. The effort to accomodate this change is an interesting story told well by the author. The pace and magnitude of change is fascinating to behold. One wonders how the bureaucracy that took a 250,000 man fighting force from wooden training rifles to the millions who had 50,000 aircraft alone to deploy against our enemies were able to undertake this phenominal expansion in reasonably good order. As Brinkley tells it, it was part good old American &quot;can-do&quot; attitude coupled with a near unanimous belief in our mission and dedication to winning the war.Somehow the City, and the people responsible for running its only true industry (government) managed the task and its transformation fairly well.Brinkley is a good story teller, and his chronicle of how Washington changed during the war years is also the story of America coming of age. He brings a fresh descriptive narrative to what turns out to be a pretty interesting story."},{"Title":"Washington Goes to War","review":"I found this book very interesting. As someone who is currently living in the D.C area, I was fascinated to travel back in time while reading this book and picture how D.C. has become what it is today. There is much to learn in this book especially about Roosevelt's presidency and the turmoil around the war and it is presented in a very fun, easy to read style. I recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn about the development of our nation's capitol."},{"Title":"Washington Goes to War","review":"Living in DC, this book make you really think about what was once going on around the place where you live. This novel is about the mentality that people had during World War II, and what it meant to be living in the nations capital. The stories really let you into the minds of the characters, and how hard life could be sometimes. There was a lot going on in Washington, and it is amazing that such pure history can be so interesting to read."},{"Title":"Washington Goes to War","review":"&quot;Washington Goes to War&quot; is an extremely insightful and interesting book. It provides a unique view of history. I learned things that I could never have found in a text book. The book often dealt with individuals and how they had an impact on the whole, rather than just explaining events. I learned a great deal about what Washington was like during the time surrounding WWII and how that connects to what is like today. I also learned a lot about WWII and how Roosevelt dealt with issues he was confronted with. I definitely recommend this book to people who want to see the personal side of history rather than just the facts."},{"Title":"Washington Goes to War","review":"David Brinkley's well known dry wit here mixes with his delight in all things human to produce one of the finest books on wartime life 'back home'. Moreover, with the possible exception of Gore Vidal, few writers have given us a sharper look in any age at the doings within and around our nation's capital.Brinkley was there when Washington left behind forever its previous role as a quiet government town living at a Southern pace, and morphed suddenly into a bustling wartime metropolis. Washington suddenly was engulfed in hundreds of thousands of new workers, all desperately seeking housing that simply didn't exist. This population explosion ceated a crazy shortage, where tens of thousands of newly hired government workers slept in different shifts in the same constantly used beds, inside row upon row of uncomfortable temporary thrown-up quarters.Here is Brinkley on the fundamental changes air conditioning wrought;\\"...by the late 1930's some members (of Congress) had discovered the comforts of the air conditioning in the Fox, the Capitol, the Earle and the RKO Keith movie theaters downtown. They asked to have cool air pumped into the House and Senate chambers and into their office buildings across the street. And so, in 1938, the United States Congress made a fateful decision that a few of the more canterkerous members said foretold the collapse of the Republic. It installed air conditioning. With its chambers and offices cool and pleasant, some predicted, Congress would stay in session all year and pass the additional time making even longer and more tiresome speeches, enacting more laws, spending more money and running the national debt still higher. Longer sessions, they said, would mean more government and more taxes, more forms for the people to fill out and more bureaucrats hired to read and file them...(the Senate) was a gentleman's club with but one woman senator, Hattie Caraway of Arkansas, who sat in the chamber every day, knitting, listening and saying nothing.\\"Or this line, presaging today's, \\"A Crisis is a terrible thing to waste.\\"Quotes Brinkley of Senator Vandenberg in his diary, \\"The worst of it (The usurption of Congressional authority by FDR's endless wartime agencies) is that there is still a substantial New Deal sector in high places which will constantly think of the war in terms of new opportunites for further New Deal experiments.\\"Brinkley writes with a fine journalist's sharp eye for concrete details - names, places and dates all mix together the anecdotal and the factual in a swirling tempo of good writing and delightfully engaging story-telling. He manages the remarkable feat of making something interesting out of the drab universe of Washington's Alphabet agencies, endless bureaus, and engulfing confusion of regulations and petty political interests.Most impressive of all is Brinkley's unflinching writing on the conditions faced by Washington's largest citizen group - the thousands of poor blacks struggling to survive in ghettos all but under the shadow of the Capitol dome.One of the best American memoirs I've ever read.Highest recommendation!For a humorous take on the Washington wartime housing shortage, consider watching George Stevens film, \\"The More the Merrier\\" with Jean Arthur, Joel McCrea and an Oscar-winning supporting performance by Charles Coburn as industrialist matchmaker \\"Mr. Dingle\\".The More the MerrierThere is also a hilarious play from the period on the housing shortage, \\"The Doughgirls\\", made into an farcical film (1944) starring Ann Sheridan, Alexis Smith and featuring a wildly zanic performance by Eve Arden as a Russian woman sniper who takes midnight strolls back and forth with rifle between Washington and Baltimore!"},{"Title":"Washington Goes to War","review":"Imagine, being able to eat your lunch on the White House lawn! This was once possible. David Brinkley brings out the humor and silliness as well as seriousness of the storm clouds of approaching war. As he descirbed it, Washington was not like New York or Paris. It was a sleepy Southern town, that just happened to be the HQ of the Federal Government. Anyone interested in American history will have fun with this book. Much of it is downright funny. The diplomats who wont talk to each other is like scenes out of the movie Casablanca. The woman who was told by the Sanitation Dept. to get rid of her bricks by leaving them on the bus. I reread bits of the book when I need a laugh. Keep Washington Goes to War in a Prominent Place."},{"Title":"Washington Goes to War","review":"Life in Washington, DC, and how it changed during the years of World War II. Brinkley says in the preface that the book \\"is less a work of history than of personal reminiscence and reflection\\"; I'd go so far as to call it gossip. It's pretty much nothing but a collection of anecdotes, but without an index(!) you can't even go through it looking for anecdotes about any one specific person. Some parts were interesting to read--the stuff about the move to income tax withholding, which I didn't know about before, for instance--but once only at most, no replay value."},{"Title":"Washington Goes to War","review":"David Brinkley was born in 1920 Wilmington NC and wrote for his hometown newspaper while still in high school. After Army service he joined NBC News and became famous on television, winning many awards. This book is journalism, not history, in covering the many colorful characters that flourished in what was a sleepy provincial town. This helps to understand life in those days. The 'Acknowledgments' mentions the many who helped; Charles Curtis and Clifford Sloan began gathering this material. There is no 'Index'. 'A Note on Sources' mentions the others who contributed to this book. If \\"history books\\" tend to concentrate on names, dates, and battles this is an addition or correction. It is interesting and worth reading even if it is necessarily incomplete (\\"my own observations and experiences\\").In 1941 an ordinary citizen could walk into the White House grounds (p.84). The story on page 43 about the Enigma coding machine differs from other published accounts and seems improbable but colorful. Before the war Washington shut down for summer (p.194). Air-conditioning later allowed year-round operations. Commuting to work was difficult for many. The local Washington newspapers were mostly against Roosevelt and the New Deal. Housing was difficult given the expansion of the population (p.231). Tires were scarce, gasoline, food, and clothing were rationed. Congress had (and still has) its perquisites (p.195). The President and the military got all the money and power they asked for (p.196). What was the average Congressman like (p.206)? [Shouldn't that date be \\"February 1942\\" (p.211)?] Brinkley describes the older system of paying income taxes (pp.216-217). The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank proposed paying taxes by payroll deductions (p.217). [Today the FED still gets this cash.]The story on pages 233-235 seems like a personal experience. Chapter IX has some details of the housing shortages. [If peasants had pictures of Woodrow Wilson (p.255) it was because their countries gained independence after WW I.] The last chapter tells about FDR's final months. This memoir is a good addition to any history of the 1940s and is worth reading by itself. I suspect a lot was omitted to limit the pages."},{"Title":"Washington Goes to War","review":"This is one fun book. Brinkley is able to re-create how Washington DC went from a sleepy village to the thriving community it is now. Read how those crummy government buildings were only supposed to be temporary. How those girls came for work from the farms, bought leg makeup, and stayed. How the Japanese and German ambassadors were placed under guard in a mansion and still couldn't get along. Recommended to anyone who has an interest in the homefront during WWII."},{"Title":"Washington Goes to War","review":"David Brinkley wrote a splendid eyewitness account of the transformation of Washington, D.C. from a sleepy southern city into a major world capital in a very few years. As in his reporting, he had a keen eye and ear for colorful details. Brinkley's description of his reaction to the sickly appearance of FDR was vintage Brinkley. As most Americans, Brinkley had no idea that Roosevelt had not much longer to live.Brinkley describes the chaos and confusion of the hordes of newly hired government secretaries finding places to live, along with the Navy's attempt to commandeer the newly constructed Statler Hilton Hotel as an officers quarters. It was something like the scenes in the George Stevens movie, The More The Merrier, although Brinkley wrote that many in Washington did not see much humor in that movie. This is the best of the books Brinkley wrote in the twilight of his career."},{"Title":"Washington Goes to War","review":"Journalist David Brinkley (1920-2003) provides an informative look at the U.S. capital during World War II (1939-1945). Readers see how this not-big city expanded rapidly starting before Pearl Harbor, as the nation began preparing despite opposition from isolationists. During the war years Washington, DC, was increasingly flooded with soldiers, volunteers, government typists, and others. The city was simply overwhelmed by greater needs for more housing, transportation, office space, etc. This occurred in the face of nationwide rationing of gasoline, rubber, food, nylons and clothing. Brinkley describes the capable leadership of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, from the pre-war preparation despite opposition from Congressional isolationists, to late-night collaborations with a frequent British house guest (Winston Churchill). Readers also learn about important figures like General George Marshall, Chester Bowles, Theodore Bilbo, and a soon-promoted Senator named Harry Truman. Finally, Brinkley describes the city's considerable Negro (black) population living in segregated slums within sight of the Capitol, plus civil rights figures Marian Anderson and A. Phillip Randolph.This is a down-to-earth look at both U.S. history and the wartime growth of Washington, DC by a journalist (and ex-GI) who worked in that now-bustling city during the final year of the war. First published in 1988, this book remains an nicely illustrative read."},{"Title":"Washington Goes to War","review":"Brinkley gives a fascinating picture of samll town Washington suddenly forced to grow up and serve ascaptial of the free world. He describes the society of the diplomats and the rich who livedon Embassy Row as well as the life of the very poor who lived in the back alleys. His historical narrative is spiced with ancedotes some funny and some tragic. All together it's a fascinating and entertaining book."},{"Title":"Washington Goes to War","review":"The author states that this is more of a memoir than anything else, but the end note to this book states that \\"after his army service in World War ll\\" the author \\"worked for United Press and then joined NBC News, becoming White House correspondent before the end of the war.\\" So how long was the author actually in Washington during the war? Of course, that's a question that hasn't much relevance UNLESS you state that what you are writing \\"is less a work of history than of personal reminiscence and reflection.\\" Moreover, he laments how \\"pathetically and sometimes hilariously unprepared\\" Washington was for anything concerning gearing up for the war or leading it, yet has not a word of criticism for pretty much anybody, and certainly not Franklin Roosevelt. And this despite the fact that the author relates many examples of FDR setting organizations up only to ignore them or the people running them or in putting off decisions for so long on many issues that little was getting done because FDR couldn't fire a friend or tell anyone that they were not up to the job.The book, in short, is little more than, in effect, a couple of dozen snapshots of happenings that took place in Washington during the war with but cursory captions to flesh said visuals out. One of the blurbs within this book praising it states how \\"objectively\\" David Brinkley writes, but that's only because the author says almost nothing about himself during this time, says almost nothing about why things happened they way they did nor does he offer an opinion or comment on almost anything within his 283 pages. Get a load of this paragraph: \\"At almost the same time, however, officials in the War Department were making other plans for the Pentagon---plans that would, like Roosevelt's, never be implemented, but plans that more accurately predicted the shape of the postwar city and the postwar world. In February 1945, reports were leaked to the press of the military's proposal not to vacate but to expand the world's largest building. A new (and ugly) 24 story office tower would rise out of the Pentagon's six-acre interior courtyard. It would house some (but not all) of the workers who would be needed to maintain the nation's peacetime forces. On top of the building would be an eternal flame: a symbol of the nation's great victory and of the new American imperium over which Washington would preside.\\"That's it, that is the last paragraph of this \\"memoir\\" of sorts. The author states in a postscript on sources that \\"Washington at War,\\" a 1970 work by Scott Hart \\"is a lively narrative that covers some of the same events I have discussed here.\\" I wish I would have stumbled over that book instead of this one, but unfortunately that book is out of print.

Brinkley's insight explains why some black folks still do not like white folks...not that I blame them. If I were African American, I would not like me either. America apparently did not like women much either, although they were better tolerated than racial minorities. Our local book club could not find any glaring factual errors, anyhow. Reading how each interest often worked for itself and against other interests makes me wonder how we managed to win the war after all.

Maybe if I had a great professor that actually taught and walked us through the practice problems it wouldn't be so frustrating, but he doesn't, and it makes trying to go through the book EXTREMELY difficult.There are huge gaps in information that show up in assigned problems, which I understand can help reinforce the learning process, but there are books that do it effectively and then there's this piece of crap.The authours of this steaming pile of cow waste leave out important details that can cost a student literally hours in trying to figure out a solution only to discover that the reason for the incorrect answer is because the book failed to mention ANYTHING that might be helpful.I can't relate how many times I went online and actually looked up information in OTHER books that were 1000000 times better than this POS.An example, you ask? On the section on combining independent current sources, it mentions (in about 2 sentences) that current sources should be combined when in parallel. That's fine and dandy, but what it doesn't tell you is that when you're doing ANY PROBLEM where current is in question, you've got to add any current sources BACK in to the answer, depending on where they appear in the circuit, or you'll get garbage as a result.Is this common sense? Sure, I guess, if you've already taken the class and already understand circuit analysis. If you haven't and you don't, the authors apparently decided to leave you up s@#t creek without a paddle after robbing you blind.If you're taking an EE class and see that this is the text, check out the professor before you take it, or you'll be sorry."},{"Title":"Basic Engineering Circuit Analysis, Textbook and Study Guide","review":"One of the reviews on this page is obviously written by the publisher.

Oh and one more thing, the &quot;Circuit Works&quot; program which you pay for the use of when you buy the text book either doesn't exist or is being kept hidden purposely, none of my classmates or the instructor has been able to access it.

In the first year of my engineering graduation, I used this book for the subject of Basic Circuit Analysis and found it to be extremely helpful. I think I can even say that this book made my life a lot easier, since the author - J. David Irwin - did a very good job on explaining concepts and circuit analysis basic methods and laws very clearly.The book is very well structred, objective and and the subjects are easily understandable for the reader with little or none electronic circuit knowledge: every chapter starts with an introduction and a list of helpful topics which the author named &quot;Learning Goals&quot;; then, everytime a new concept/law/method is introduced, the author tests the reader to see if he did comprehend what has been explained to him by presenting him with very basic exercices, &quot;Learning by Doing&quot;; the author also provides the reader with &quot;Learning Hints&quot; on a regular basis, which can be interpreted as algorithms to solve certain problems or simple hints for the reader to do the exercice correctly, avoiding typical mistakes; at last, when a resonable amount of concepts have been introduced, the book features many &quot;Learing Examples&quot; with resolutions (note that resolutions can be of an extreme importance when the reader cannot understand how a certain problem is solved).Basic Engineering Circuit Analysis covers everything that a book of this kind (introductory book) should cover, and even more, all in a clear way: basic concepts (quantities and electrical elements), resistive circuits (where the ohm and kirchhoff's laws are introduced), circuit analysis techniques (nodal and loop analysis), equivalent circuits (superposition, th&eacute;venin and norton's theorems), capacitance and inductance, first and second-order transcient circuits, AC steady-state analysis, magnetically coupled networks, steady-state power analysis, polyphase circuits, variable frequency network performance, the laplace and fourier tranforms (and applications to circuit analysis - e.g. bode diagrams), two-part networks and basic semiconductor circuits (diodes and transistors).In my opinion, this is an excelent book for everyone who wants to study the basics of electrical circuit analysis.

My professor's notes are better than this book."},{"Title":"Dolphins, ETs & Angels: Adventures Among Spiritual Intelligences","review":"Reading Timothy Wyllie's Dolphins, ET's, and Angels is like opening a door into a world that is only experienced by mystics and people who have gone to the edge of this life and returned. It illustrates a phenomenon known to many who have explored the path towards cetacean relations- that attempting entrance into the world of the dolphins and whales opens up a number of fascinating vistas and can take one in directions never guessed at first.From the opening chapter, when Timothy sets his heart on developing his relationship with dolphins, to the paths that twist and turn through encounters with peoples of exotic cultures, unexplainable phenomena which happen concurrently with his dolphin quest, and ultimately to contact with celestial beings, Timothy's honesty and candor draws us along with him on his journey. Timothy's descriptions of the emotional states he experiences in the presence of dolphins are shared by hundreds of thousands in these times when the cetacean community has begun to draw humankind back into their influence. Not since the time of the ancient Greeks has the influence of the dolphin been so strong in human culture, and never in human history has their influence been so badly needed. Timothy sheds any hint of machismo in telling his readers about being moved to tears by the presence of cetacean company, emotions that many of us have experienced in the oceanariums and shallow seas around the world. His desire to be physically near dolphins is so strong that he risks life and limb in stormy circumstances and tests his physical abilities to the limit, just to share a few moments of proximity. The course of Timothy's life parallels in a number of ways the paths mapped out by John Lilly, and Dr. Lilly's pioneering work with both dolphins and altered states of consciousness clearly provide a profound influence.Timothy's experiences are reported to his readers in his down-to-earth style, complete with his commentary about his perceptions of the emotional states of those sharing his adventures. Even in this reporting there seem to be parallels with dolphin life. Research into dolphin sonar has shown that the detailed pictures generated are likely to give dolphins very clear indications of the emotional states of their cohorts as they are able to see the respiration rates, heart beats, peristaltic movements and other indicators of emotional state. Timothy's years of exploration in the area of human and cetacean consciousness have developed his intuitive capabilities and contributed to a persona that radiates kindness, tolerance, and love for his fellow humans. He has truly learned to &quot;go with the flow&quot; in the course of his adventures, and this naturally opens up a myriad of possibilities which are there for everyone's taking but rarely noticed in our culture of materialism and emphasis on immediate gratification. It is clear from reading his accounts that he has long ago ceased to think and feel from a self-centered place, preferring instead to shed most of the usual ego trappings and merge himself with his accomplices, both human and non-human, residents of both material and celestial realms.Dolphins, ET's and Angels reads in an entertaining manner on several levels. Timothy's circumstances allow him to travel to rather exotic circumstances many of us seldom, if ever, reach, providing us with a travelogue of faraway people and places. His ability to penetrate beyond the surface of his day-to-day experience and extract essence from it is instructive and can help his readers to develop their own intuitive abilities and expand their empathic tendencies. Throughout the book, there are clues that suggest remarkable and esoteric traits present in the cetacean world that have not yet been detected by science. Defining what is meant by &quot;intelligence&quot; or &quot;telepathy&quot; has historically been difficult, the subject of an immense body of philosophical writings across centuries. The stories in Dolphins, ET's and Angels are intimations that dolphins and whales may possess the ability to attract people together for specific purposes, to effect &quot;sonic interventions&quot; on the physical bodies of fellow cetaceans and humans through ultra sound generation, and to accomplish subtle but effective communication through telepathic connections.It is with both pleasure and enthusiasm that I recommend Timothy Wyllie's Dolphins, ET's amd Angels. If what it does for you upon reading it even halfway resembles what it has done for me, you may have some very interesting times ahead."},{"Title":"Dolphins, ETs & Angels: Adventures Among Spiritual Intelligences","review":"Dolphins Et's and Angels are somehow all connected by Timothy Wyllie. This is a fascinating story from start to finish..., and then we want more. The wonderful surprise is TimothyWyllie's enthusiasm and sense of fun that comes across in his writing. To most of us dolphins seem so intelligent and attractive but we do no more than wonder. Timothy Wyllie went in search of them. He wanted to find out how to communicate with them. How can we communicate with extraterrestrial beings, if we cannot first communicate with Earth based beings? Timothy Wyllie exposes himself totally to the universe and us, in his search. He finds dolphins by going to their inshore habitats around world, and making himself known to them in a most extroverted, but gentle, way. It works. He is led by what seems coincidence to a spot in the middle of New York city and sees what can only be a UFO, or something unidentifiable by him and his companion. At that same moment he meets a young boy who seems to know an awful lot about this UFO. Where could he have come from, or gone to? As he becomes more enwrapped in his search, Timothy Wyllie comes across the book of Urantia, and is once more swept into an area that can seem overwhelming. He somehow manages to make a relatively simple synopsis of that very convoluted book, and we learn about beings who are managing, not only our planet Earth, but our Universe too. These are beings that on the surface are so far away from our individuality, that it can be scary to know that there are governments looking after us whose existence is totally invisible to us. Later Timothy is invited to meet Edward who was able to speak as a channel for a group of angels, and is taught by them how to make direct contact with our personal angels. This is a story with a much larger scope than is presented in the book. Timothy ties this all together. We want more. There is more..."},{"Title":"Dolphins, ETs & Angels: Adventures Among Spiritual Intelligences","review":"Dolphins, ETS and Angels is not another book to force you to think anything. Timothy's narrative is delightful, refreshing and honest. What a difference from other books in this category! Keep writing Timothy."},{"Title":"Dolphins, ETs & Angels: Adventures Among Spiritual Intelligences","review":"I'm sure that there is not coincidences, I know everything has a reason, and read this book is something like a preparation for something bigest. Certainly, everyone has his own experiences, but when someone speaks about them and another (like me) feel into his heart the same feeling, it's a miracle of God's plan in action!"},{"Title":"Dolphins, ETs & Angels: Adventures Among Spiritual Intelligences","review":"This book is amazing! The authors account of psychic communication with healing dolphins was so inspiring, I just had to try it for myself. On September 11, 2011, I boarded a high speed catamaran, and under a machine gunned escort by the U.S Coastguard, I and several hundred other souls were safely whisked out of Boston Harbor on a beautiful, but somewhat tense day.Our destination was Georges Bank, a sweet spot feeding ground for several species of cetaceans off the Massachusetts coast. From the moment we arrived, magic was in the air. Far from shore and the frantic pace of a modern city, we spotted our first Humpback! Within minutes we were surrounded by at least twenty of them. Even the marine biologists on board were surprised at the number.With each misty blowhole spray, and every signature Humpback tail flip, I could feel the heaviness of this most awful anniversary day lift away.If you ask me, the whales were performing a group healing! However, what I wanted to see most of all was a full breach. Unfortunately, that was not happening. After a full half hour of tail flips and spouts, I asked the lead marine biologist when they were going to breach? \\"Well, they don't always do that,\\" was her reply.Ok, now's my chance I thought. I'll put what I learned in Mr. Wyllie's wonderful book into practice. So with careful concentration I began putting out thoughts in an attempt to telepathically connect with the Humpbacks. \\" Could one of you please just do one breach so I know you hear me?\\" Well, within 15 seconds a massive thirty ton mammal shot up and out of the Atlantic, so close to our boat that many people got very wet as he crashed back into the sea! The marine biologist I had just previously spoken too, turned around and looked directly into my eyes. I just smiled, and she said, \\" That was awesome!\\"Skeptics may disagree and say coincidence, but as far as I'm concerned, I know what happened, and no one can ever take that away from me. So with as wide a grin as I can muster, I highly recommend, Dolphins ET's & Angels. You'll love it. And you just may find that you too can converse with cetaceans!"},{"Title":"Dolphins, ETs & Angels: Adventures Among Spiritual Intelligences","review":"I always knew that dolphins were special in some way, but in this book the author really takes you on a tour. He writes in a master style that makes you feel like you are actually walking with him because he does such a masterful job of putting you in the situation with his feelings and emotions at the time. It's absolutely incredible.This book is easily a 5/5. Just an absolute gem. I love the front cover particularly!John McAdam, author of:Were Ancient Gods From Other Planets?Am I Mad Or Coherent?"},{"Title":"Dolphins, ETs & Angels: Adventures Among Spiritual Intelligences","review":"I started with the second book in this series, but realised soon enough that it depended heavily on the material in this book. So I bought this one too and I was not at all disappointed. Reading this book has been an uplifting experience, to say the least.The author begins by telling of his background and the flow of events that led to his writing this and his later books. How he began as an architect, his rebellion against the techie nature of the established mode of life, his experiments with drugs, his attempts at forming a community with like minded people, his exhaustion from overwork, followed by a near death experience, his subsequent disillusionment with his former pursuits, and the development of his interests in communicating with the cetaceans, especially dolphins. He describes how dolphins and whales help him to commune via telepathic thought transference, while simultaneously effecting a physical healing on his body. The author takes care to explain that this form of thought transfer is nothing new, it is a forgotten art common to all beings, human or otherwise. These abilities also sensitize the author to the extraordinary faculties of a boy he meets in a New York park during a proposed UFO sighting. The boy was presumably from an alien planet.There is a chapter on the author's insightful and at times wordless communication with some rastafarians on the Bahamas. Development of such skills, also lead him to a channel for angelic entities, with whom the author and one who he refers to as \\"his companion\\" (she prefers to be unnamed) spend many evenings discussing diverse issues. One of these issues that are touched in some detail, is the \\"Lucifer\\" issue, the healing of which is imminent on the Earth, as the end date of Dec.21, 2012 approaches. One senses the author's empathy for the High Being, and his unique point of view, despite the realization that most of one's own suffering due to what is termed as \\"evil\\", has been through no fault of ours. The thoughts that came to me after reading this chapter are best described by Alfred Lord Tennyson's lines in \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade\\",\\"Someone had blundered,Their's not to reason why,Their's but to do and die\\"as applied to ourselves. We are the hapless soldiers in the poem.More channeled insights from the angelic realms appear in this book. One more that deserves special mention is about the enormous extent of the healing work for humanity that is underway at this time, due to repercussions of the \\"Lucifer split\\". This healing has signatures in the art forms and ethical values that come forth today. The angels also inform us of the groundwork that is being laid for an entirely new kind of spirituality and being, a spirituality embodied by the Christ consciousness, all-embracing, all enveloping with room for all to grow and be the entities we are destined to be according to the Divine Plan.This book contains material that is far ahead of the time when it first appeared (1984). Two afterwords have appeared in my later edition (1992). Ripples of the consciousness accessible to the discerning reader of this book are sorely needed today as the veil between the present world and the one to come is gradually lifted during these times of turmoil and change. This book doesn't explicitly mention the Mayan end date, but it is clear that the contents are geared to a consciousness not applicable to humanity as it is today.A key reference is the \\"Urantia\\" book which has been given some importance. However, Wyllie's text is anything but judgmental in its approach. One senses the existence of a \\"middle ground\\"between the theological concept of a \\"fearsome and revengeful\\" God and a \\"God self\\" whose energies are accessible to all.I recommend this book strongly to all those who wish to know more of the magnificient and sentient beings who share their living space with us."},{"Title":"Dolphins, ETs & Angels: Adventures Among Spiritual Intelligences","review":"Thank you Timothy for being a forerunner.

They were my teachers and your books were a welcome guide into my ocean of discovery. It comforted me to know that there was someone else out there in the world who understood, and could express, the joy of being embraced by this familiar spiritual intelligence.

Black Perspectives on Huckleberry Finn","review":"As a high school teacher in NYC I never attempted Huck without first having the students read from this book. The essays are (largely) insightful and cogent in their arguments pro and con.

It is an invaluable resource and a very, very important book."},{"Title":"Satire or Evasion?

Black Perspectives on Huckleberry Finn","review":"If you're a high school student or English teacher, you will find this collection of essays important in discussing the impact of Twain's long-canonized classic, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Much ink and video tape has been applied to the debate over the book's use of the \\"n-word,\\" but this book embraces a variety of viewpoints, including the less popular views in literary criticism -- specifically the idea that this satire DOES NOT deal with anti-racism and African American characterization responsibly. If you have seen PBS' Born to Trouble, you know that Twain-bashers are not given much room at the literary lunch counter, eloquent support of the book notwithstanding. While I tend to agree with this more popular and positive criticism of Huck Finn, I found these rarely published perspectives essential and productive when putting the book on trial with my students. I highly recommend Satire or Evasion?, even if only for its positive discussion results."},{"Title":"The Bridesmaid Chronicles: First Date","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It didn't take me long at all to finish it. It was pretty light and very fun! It's a story about a snap engagement that provokes the protective sister to come in and try to stop the wedding. Of course there are misunderstandings and scheming plans and personality conflicts. That only makes the book more fun entertaining to read. The main character did get on my nerves a little bit due to the fact that she is very controlling and extremely nosy and worst of all, self-loathing. Enter sexy hero.

Already angry at having to jump at her father's demands, and worried about the absence of her father's bookkeeper, Betty Lou-not to mention the money that disappeared right along with her-it's no wonder she doesn't take her younger sister's email very well. It seems that Julia, whose always seemed to be the incompetent one, regardless of her job as manager of the smallest hotel in the Marv's Motor Inns motel chain, is in an even greater bind this time-she's getting married to Roman Sonntag, a man she's dated for-gulp!-one entire month.Hightailing it to Fredericksburg, Texas, is the last thing Syd wants to do, but when Julia fails to take her sister's worry seriously via email and telephone, she knows that she's the only one who can make her sister see reason. Being irresponsible is one thing, but ruining your life by marrying a virtual stranger is, most definitely, something else entirely.There's only one problem with Syd's plans-one best man by the name of Alex Kimball.

I am not one of these people that adore every word that Beckett ever wrote; I have severe reservations about some of the later minimalist pieces such as 'Breathe', but 'Happy Days' is one of the most concise and fully realised portraits of the human condition in modern drama. 'Waiting for Godot' is just playful and clever; this is sublime and intellectually adept, combining the structural rigidity of 'Not I' with the fluidity of existential ideas that proliferated throughout all his work. While this is not my favourite play of his, that is entirely due to a personal preference for 'Endgame' - there is nothing tangible that really lets it down."},{"Title":"Happy Days","review":"So often Beckett's philosophical 'universality' seems like an excuse not to confront genuine dilemmas head on. 'Happy Days' is his most tangible work, a grim portrait of a marriage, where a wife is buried up to her waist/waste in a repetitious living death, trying to avoid confronting the reality of her situation, the brutish indifference of her husband, the incremental inevitability of life only getting worse.Winnie is Beckett's most sympathetic character because she is the one we are the most likely to meet - she is aware of the hopelessness of her situation, but what can she do? Concentrate on something else - how many of us do better? The dissatisfaction most people have with the play presumably lies with the stage directions which interrupt the monologue every couple of words, rendering a fluid, rhythmic read impossible (like Beckett was ever easy). Instead of complaining, go and see it in a theatre, where words and gesture combine to moving effect, even when the language is at its most insistently ironic and playful (and it's very funny too, but don't they always say that about Beckett?). It certainly made me ashamed of the way I treat my wife."},{"Title":"Happy Days","review":"Happiness in small things? Oh well.Anyway, this play is hilarious, and is not just about despair. At this stage of the game with Beckett, the characters can almost be read as one single character, their interactions/dialogue as mechanics of a single discursive mind. What can I say? Some people just like Beckett, and I think if you liked Endgame, you will certainly like this. I just had kind of an evil laughter about me the whole time I was reading it.That said, this is no Waiting for Godot. By that, I only mean that Beckett was at a different point in his career here, and I think an even more brilliant one. He just really cuts to the core of things. I mean, the world really is screwed up if something like this can be written. But at the same time, isn't Beckett so much fun? He's an absolute master of language. It's interesting that somebody that studied under Joyce, a writer who used such elaborate means to develop his themes, should end up being so minimalist. Beckett is just brilliant, and though this play is not as elaborate as Endgame, it is my favorite, Endgame being my second.Expensive for something that can be read so quick, but if you're reading this you're probably not looking for quantity anyway, and I imagine this will be one that I will just pick up and read now and again maybe once a year or so. It's that good. I don't know how seriously this was meant to be taken. I don't see it as trivial in any way. I think it is brilliant, but still have a light heart when I read this stuff. I guess there are some people who let this get them down. I seriously don't think this is about nihilism. If you want that, go to the French surrealists.Try it out!"},{"Title":"Happy Days","review":"When this 1961 play opens, a woman is buried waist deep in a pile of sand, a large bag on her left, and a deep tunnel behind and below her on her right. The environment is treeless and bleak, and we have no idea where the woman (Winnie) is or why and how she came to be in her present predicament. Throughout the first act, Winnie shares the minutiae of her life, pulling out her glasses, a parasol, a gun, a music box, and her hat from her bag and blathering on about brushing her teeth, while questioning if she has brushed her hair. Occasionally, she looks toward the tunnel, where she addresses an unseen \\"Willie,\\" who does not respond. When he emerges from the tunnel briefly, humming, Winnie gaily announces \\"Another happy day,\\" before he disappears again.The only changes that occur in the play are the result of time--there is no plot. In the second act, Winnie appears older, she has sunk into the sand so that only her head shows, and she is unable to move it. Though she is not sure Willie is alive and calls to him repeatedly, he ignores her, until he suddenly emerges, dressed in tuxedo and top hat and tries to crawl upward toward Winnie. End of play.In this classic example of the Theatre of the Absurd, the characters are out of sync with the world as the audience knows it, living in some universe with which we are unfamiliar. Their lives are meaningless, undirected, and irrational, yet, during the play, they somehow survive the passage of time, the lack of connection with each other, and their purposeless existence. Willie seems to be trying, futilely, to connect with Winnie at the end, but, absurdly, Winnie cannot see him and he cannot reach her.Author Samuel Beckett once said, \\"Nothing is funnier than unhappiness...it's the most comical thing in the world.\\" In that sense this is a funny play, but there were few laughs from the audience when I saw it recently. The production starred one of New England's most brilliant actresses in one of her most extraordinary performances, the lighting provided visual interest, and the direction was first-rate. Yet despite the fact that this was an audience of theatre-goers accustomed to serious drama, most of the audience was yawning by intermission, and about one-third had fallen asleep. If Beckett's intention was to show the meaninglessness of life through the monotony of this play, he succeeded brilliantly--putting the audience to sleep is the ultimate absurdity. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Happy Days","review":"It's difficult for me to give an honest review of this play, one because I've never actually seen it preformed (and plays are in no way meant to be read like this, especially Happy Days with all its stage directions interrupting the lines beyond easy readability) and two because the subject matter is a bit above my head (in the sense that it seems to focus on a long marriage, something I have no personal experience with). That said, the play is enjoyable and seems to have a firm grip on what it's doing. It took me maybe a page to get past the absurdity of the whole situation, and then I was stuck in on the characters. (Seriously, all my margin notes are solely focused on the characters, nothing about meaning or anything. It draws you in.) It's definitely worth another read, or at least a viewing of the play."},{"Title":"Happy Days","review":"What I got was the cover of Happy Days and a completely different play on the inside.

Annoyed."},{"Title":"Happy Days","review":"I have been a fan of Ruth White ever since I saw her in Lullaby and Let Them Hear You Whisper from the Broadway Archives. They never recorded her performance as Winnie in Samuel Beckett's Happy Days. First, Beckett is not for everybody. Some people are going to find him difficult, hard, and even boring. Those people who have never read Beckett or studied him thoroughly are going to have a hard time understanding his brilliance. Beckett is the king of minimalism regarding theater and the absurd. Here is a middle aged woman stuck in mound doing a daily routine. We never do learn why she is in such a predicament because it's a Beckett metaphor for our lives being stuck in a mound. It's a literary device. He was brilliant."},{"Title":"Happy Days","review":"The play is by beckett.

This poem has a large amount of symbolism that I have grown to love...the ringing bell, the revolver, the symbolic gestures of old age and all that he has put into this. Beckett put a lot into this one and it has a meaning, it is a scene in everyday life, put in a different perspective."},{"Title":"Happy Days","review":"The alarm clock rings and Winnie awakes. It is the beginning of a new day. The scene is a flat landscape with Winnie in the centre. She is embedded up over her waist in the mound. Winnie is happy about every single day. Willie, her husband, lies behind her and he seldom speaks. He is reading the newspaper. Winnie is preoccupied with oneself, putting thinks out of her bag and talking to Willie.In the second act Winnie is embedded up to the neck in the mound. Her speech is an endless flow of words. She is more melancholy as in the first act. I think Beckett wanted to show the process of getting old and cope with it. They both are two different characters, but they complete in a very special way. Remembering the past and being happy with the present is one of the pleasures of life. Happy days will end, but if not today, it will be another precious day."},{"Title":"Happy Days","review":"So we are supposed to \\"read in\\" to the deeper meaning of an elderly woman and her irrational attempts to delude herself about her terminal situation. Ok, I get that part. When the redundance of her babbling stream of consciousness became unbearable, I realized this was just an attempt to get back at his wife for badgering him to do a \\"happy\\" play, and we are all just victims of his ironic joke.What is fascinating to me, is the rationalizing that must take place among Mr. Beckett's admirers. Admiring him for his great works, they must reach deep for some rationalization of their own as to why this is also a great work. This play gives you such a shallow plot, with no real sympathetic character, you can write your own backstory and intent. Yes, it has a few cute moments, but by-and-large if you don't like a stop sign, just pretend it's an ice cream cone - happy me. Brilliant?

Happy Days is the worst play I have ever read. It is a mundane, insipid melodrama of no merit whatsoever. The idea is weak to start with; Winnie is a middle-aged woman buried up to her waist in dirt. SWith only a few possessions and Willie, a mumbling gargoyle of sorts, to keep her company, she remains entrapped in her absurdist situation, delivering a dull monologue that swings between pathetic whining and annoying screeching. I can't even imagine that watching this play would be an any more pleasant experience. No one moves at all, and all that keeps this play &quot;going&quot; is Winnie's humdrum soliloquoy. It's hard to imagine that the talent behind Waiting for Godot and Krapp's Last Tape could have been responsible for this tripe. I'm a worse person for having read Happy Days, a book which only deserves the title when it is burned publicly."},{"Title":"Happy Days","review":"Even though I consider myself fairly versed in theatre, I have to say that &quot;Happy Days&quot; fails to resonate.

Since Ralph Ellison (a friend of Murray's at Tuskeegee) died there has not a been a black author who has shown more insight, wit, and stylistic virtuosity than Murray. The Seven League boots is a fitting end to a trilogy of novels about Scooter, and again this book is a showcase for Murray's down-home mix of Joyce, Faulkner, and Duke Ellington poetics. In a book that warmly and humorously examines that ever-present rift between expectations and personal dreams, Murray never manages to drift into cliche. Much like the jazz music which forms the roots of both his style and his life, Murray confronts the demons of existance with the sound of surprise and wit. By an author who is far too overlooked, the Seven League Boots is a necessity for a lover of modern literature."},{"Title":"THE SEVEN LEAGUE BOOTS.","review":"There are two parts to this novel, and the first part is far better than the secend. In fact, the first part, which stands by itself, from page 1 to about 156 or thereabouts, is far and away the best modern writing I have encountered in a long time.It is difficult for a non-professional reviewer to do justice to the brilliance of Mr. Murray's acheivement in those few pages. Not only is the writing as near to perfection as human frailty can manage, but the themes are of such seriousness and profundity as to ennoble what is already brilliant prose.Then one comes to part two, which I found to be cliche-ridden and trite in subject although still expressed in excellent and readable prose. In addition, I must register a strong disagreement with Mr. Murray, on no less important point than that of \\"Worthy Use of Spare Time\\", which he would appear to think is mainly, if not solely, an attribute or practice of wealthy, charming, beautiful people. He should have known better. His story is set in the early part of the 20thC, after WWI, and before WWII. In those decades, American culture and Americans had not yet been corrupted by the stupidities of mass culture, and the country was crawling with rockhounds, birdwatchers, fossil collectors, amateur naturalists and astronomers, avid gardeners, amateur historians and archivists, and I could go on. So, no, Worthy Use of Spare Time, was not and is not only to be found among the beautiful people.As for the charge of racism, mentioned above, I saw no such thing. Certainly, there is none of that coy so and so who happens to be such and such, which regretably infects the work of far too many African-American women writers."},{"Title":"THE SEVEN LEAGUE BOOTS.","review":"This is a mythical, mystical journey that deserves to be read and re-read for all time.

This book is an easy read for anyone familiar with SQL based db systems, cryptography and an understanding of basic application architecture. Additionally, if one plans on working towards HIPAA compliance (term used loosely), this is a must read.The concept of translucent databases is a step in the right direction for any entity interested in storing useful data without holding the overwhelming burden of liability over their own head. Working on the \\"other end\\" of the software development chain, it is clear to me that this concept will be a hard sell to business that aren't under the (HIPAA) gun.Wayner's writing is extremely readable, with great emphasis on explanation. My lack of java experience was not a hindrance at all while reading this book.This book is best shared between developers, architects, and decision makers, as it is their understanding that is crucial in selectively choosing what data is stored, what data is not, and what data is hidden and to whom. While there are few, if any Eureka! Moments in the book, there are concepts which will prove to be valuable as time progresses."},{"Title":"Translucent Databases","review":"This book contains an innovative and viable approach to securing databases, and one that I've not encountered anywhere else. In a nutshell the author provides techniques, based on standard SQL and Java, for securing sensitive data without restricting general access of less sensitive data to authorized users. The core of this approach is based on encryption and one-way functions, including PKI and secure hashing, and accepted authentication techniques such as digital signatures.What makes this book unique is that while it's based on solid theoretical ground, the material is practical. As the techniques are discussed they are illustrated by 15 different scenarios, all of which contain problems faced by e-commerce, HIPAA and other high security environments, and code examples that show how to solve the problems. I like the way the author shows how to implement his solutions in common database environments (PostgreSQL, MySQL and Oracle - the approach should also work in the MS SQL Server environment). As I read this book I saw interesting possibilities for implementing role-based access controls and securing against SQL-based statistical attacks using the author's approach.This book is essential reading for DBAs, system architects and IT security professionals, especially those in healthcare who are struggling with meeting HIPAA requirements, and in e-commerce who are challenged by protecting credit card and account information. This book shows the DBA how to secure his or her database, and the system architects and security professionals what is possible using SQL and Java. The book also has an associated web site which is supposed to have soft copies of all of the source code contained in the book. As of 6/25/02 the link to the source code is on the site, but the code itself is not yet available. When it is the value of this book will increase even more because of the time it will save by not having to manually create the code from scratch.If you are new to the cryptographic techniques introduced in this book I recommend &quot;Cryptography Decrypted&quot; by H. X. Mel and Doris M. Baker, which is one of the best introductions to this complex subject. I also recommend reading &quot;Secrets and Lies: Digital Security in a Networked World&quot; by Bruce Schneier, which covers the technical, organizational and social aspects of security and gives a clear description of the technical underpinnings discussed in this book."},{"Title":"Translucent Databases","review":"You can skip this book if you're a super crypto geek as the other obnoxious reviews make clear. If you've got sensitive information to store, check this out. The book is filled with several dozen examples worked out in raw SQL and Java. It could use a bit more crazy examples like his other book, Disappearing Cryptography, but at least the book is crisp, helpful and to the point."},{"Title":"Translucent Databases","review":"Translucent Databases deals with the issue of building applications that store and manipulate sensitive data in a very accessible and pragmatic fashion.It provides working developers with a practical understanding of the fundaments of cryptography and stenography as applied to the specific needs of data storage, retrieval and manipulation.The author has been careful to support major concepts with examples, discussions, real-world rationales, supporting mathematics and recommendations for additional reading. In particular, developers who do not have formal computer science background will appreciate the clear explanations of the base mechanics of the various hashing and private/public key schemes.Given the profusion of applications that store sensitive data, this book is a timely guide that helps developers quickly solve problems in time-constrained development environments.Additionally, the author writes in a highly-readable style that makes the topic material less fearsome for timid readers who fear daunting subjects like cryptography.The book is not perfect - it contains more than its fair share of typos and could benefit from tighter editing. However, these are minor flaws that do not compromise the utility of the book."},{"Title":"Translucent Databases","review":"Although the book is both interesting and useful, it suffers from a worms-eye view. Explanation is given at the source-code and SQL level and not above that. There is no attempt to give the reader an overall picture of the algorithms being described; the book contains not one E-R diagram, schema diagram, or diagram of any other sort. I wound up drawing these for myself to make sense of the muddled explanation. Because I think the book contains valuable information, I hope that Mr. Wayner will correct this oversight in a second edition."},{"Title":"Translucent Databases","review":"According to the book, database \\"translucency\\" involves passing values through a one-way function before storing it in a database.That is the key concept. If you understand it, don't buy the book. All you'll get are (very simple) examples of doing this, with the label \\"translucent\\" slapped all over. Although the book is promoted as being ahead of its time, the idea has been around for decades To its credit, the book is fair enough to mention this, citing the UNIX password file as \\"One of the first and best examples of a translucent database\\".The book glosses over the fact that encrypting data fields requires more complex access control---each unique encryption, requires another password to manage if the data is ever to be recovered. This overhead is the main reason why encrypted data isn't more prevalent.I was hoping the book might contain some approaches to reducing this fundamental problem. There are none.The book attempts to fill space by describing additional methods of \\"translucency\\" that have nothing to do with encryption. Rather, they are methods of reducing the accuracy (apparently so that anyone who gains unauthorized access to the database will have less valuable information). Some of these methods are, well, kind of simplistic:\\"Instead of storing the day, hour, minute and second, store just the day.\\"\\"Adding Fake Entries...unless you add a large number of fakes, the odds of discovering the real ones remain significant.\\"In addition, the book suggests replacing a person's height with \\"tall\\", \\"average\\" or \\"short\\".All told, I am disappointed with this book, and I can't recommend it to anyone who does serious database work."},{"Title":"Translucent Databases","review":"This is a straight-forward, elegant look at a simple way to make databases more secure against attacks from both insiders and outsiders. One of the reviewers seems to feel that this simplicity is a limitation or a reason to avoid the book, but I am still amazed at what you can do with a few simple functions. The raw idea may not be new, but the applications are inventive. The examples for protecting the names and schedules of babysitters is still a real eye opener for me."},{"Title":"Translucent Databases","review":"I was very suprised by this book. After reading some of the other reviews it seemed the author may have hit on a new idea or something midly profound. Unfortunately, no.This book is 13 chapters of Hashing functions and encryption functions. By hashing/or encrypting specific columns you can protect the data... Ok. No new concepts here. I could have read that in 3 paragraphs and saved myself an afternoon of reading and a few dollars.This book is *not* essential for DBA, developers or anyone else with a basic understanding of hashing or encryption functions.Perhaps this would be more appropriate in a college environment or for a beginer."},{"Title":"Translucent Databases","review":"If you work in security and databases; skip this book.It touches on column-level encryption, mixing plaintext data and hashing to secure data (i.e. hash a password then store it and compare against the hash when people log in) without sacrificing the usefulness of data.I don't want to say the book is bad, it just doesn't have any real new concepts for experienced professionals. If you're new to securing data (that resides in databases or not) then this book might be a good resource.This sort of information isn't really covered in another book that I know of, and believe me, I have a lot of tech books (roughly 5 bookshelves worth)."},{"Title":"Translucent Databases","review":"Key concepts are simple to get in the large.

Concepts are put into practice many chapters before they are introduced. Example: the balance sheet is defined from page 425 (!) onward although, of course, sentences like \\"this shows up on the right-hand side of the balance sheet\\" appear much earlier in the book. The line of reasoning at times is so muddied that I wonder whether the authors understood things themselves. This is underlined by a large number of downright errors.To be fair, there are some positive sides to the book (hence 2 stars): individual chapters contain boxes named \\"you should remember\\" which contain helpful summaries. There are sections intended for practice (including answers) that I would like to see in many other textbooks. Also, some of the sections are actually well-written, interesting and important. It's just that consistency is totally lacking.My conclusion is that, although there are sections in the book that are excellent, a beginner in the subject will not be able to distinguish them from the less succesful material it is interspersed with.

The small format makes the pages hard to stay open. There is no use of shading or color or much of anything else to get important material to stand out. The best you get is a dark lined box which says \\"you should remember\\".In an age where we use spreadsheets and calculators very regularly, this book expects you to look up information in giant, grey-on-grey hard to read tables in their back! We're not in the 1960s, it's time to update the book to move into the modern era!On the up side, when you look at the inexpensive price of this book compared to the $150-and-up prices regularly seen on other textbooks, it's almost reverse sticker shock.

It makes it clear that a theoretical model is just that--a very simplified view of a possible reality, and not a reflection of the real world. It also gives relevant problems and provides the answers immediately. I like the fact that the author introduce key terms for each chapter in the beginning. This sets your mind in the direction of the subject, and you know what to pay attention to when reading through the chapter.In short, a beginner can use this book effectively to learn about finance, while someone more experienced can use this book as a valuable reference tool. I have invested in stocks for many years and studied international political economy at the graduate leve, but there is nothing like a direct, no-nonsense explanation of the basics and intermediate concepts. This book will give you just that."},{"Title":"Finance (Barron's Business Review Series)","review":"I loved this book!

The reason I like this Barron series is that only pertinent information is given. This is in nice contrast to textbooks that often are quite verbose and make difficult subjects even more difficult. This book continues with this philosophy but in my mind perhaps goes overboard.Here are the reasons I don't feel particularly excited about this product:1. The problems at the end of each chapter are perhaps too simplistic to really be helpful in test preparation.2. Some of the chapters are too vague. For instance the valuation chapter is quite short and gives very few examples about how to value bonds or equity.3. There is not even one word of mention about how to use spreadsheets or financial calculators. It is actually a little annoying to me how often they refer to the FV and PV tables as if they were some kind of ultra-convenient high tech tool.While this book is not terrible by any means, I feel it is outdated and not on par with other Barron's books I've used.

I know that some are going to be turned off that this book has no photographs, instead relying on very basic illustrations. However, that is precisely why I think this book is such a marvel. I like styling my hair and changing my style, but with time, I realized that there are only a certain amount of ways to do your hair. Crafty Girl - Hair, has illustrations of the classic hair styles and directions on achieving them. She also addresses face shape and hair types. I found it refreshing to see the \\"basic style\\" laid out, without the distraction of a gorgeous model whose face or makeup distracts from the actual style.For the crafty in all of us, she includes several recipes for hair masks, homemade shampoos and conditioners, and the like. She also has ideas for hair accessories, although they are often quite basic.If you are someone who needs color photos, this book is not for you. However, if you can imagine the hairstyles from the sketches, and enjoy making hair concoctions, I think you'd really get a lot from this book."},{"Title":"Crafty Girl: Hair: Things to Make and Do","review":"I should have realized that when the author used the word \\"girl\\" she meant child, rather than a term for an energetic, youthful woman.This book is for pre-teen, and young teen girls.I was VERY disappointed with the content in this book.First off, there are only 5 or so hairstyles covered in this book. Easy hairstyles that for even the hair-retarded, like myself, could figure out eventually.Second, the \\"crafts\\" for hair are things that are obvious, like gluing a rhinestone on a bobby pin. -WOW! I NEVER thought of THAT!!!---I was looking for a book that had great hair styles -- and gave step by step instructions (maps, diagrams, etc) on how to accomplish them, but that is nowhere to be found in this book.If you are over the age of 12, and are looking to do more than a \\"prom\\" look, temporary \\"dreadlocks\\", and other silly, non-work friendly hairstyles, then look elsewhere.I would give this to my nieces, and think I probably will.Utterly useless book for people living in the adult real world."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"I loved the Kushiel trilogy, and Jacqueline Carey knows how to write beautifully rounded characters. The trouble with this series is that there is no one main character, none at least, that we can care about. Tanaros comes the closest, but he's dismayingly static, obsessing for 1000 years over the wife and king who betrayed him, displaying a sad sense of duty but little growth. In the end, there was too much prophecy, too much inevitability in this story. It ends just as it had to, the tagline \\"All things are as they must be,\\" repeated over the course of the book by too many of the characters. The book ends with the hint of more to come, but if there really is a third, I'll skim through it at the bookstore, just to see how it ends. By now, I don't much care."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"There is little doubt that Ms. Carey is a talented writer -- her Kushiel novels stand on their own as novels of extraordinary breadth and originality (I'll leave out disconcerting for those who are faint of heart). But c'mon... putting aside the well-discussed \\"homage\\" to LOTR and the Silmarillon -- did anyone buy the premise of these novels? The \\"Gifts\\" of each race are overly simplistic, the motives of pretty much every character involved are curiously shallow or as one other reviewer put it, \\"static\\", and finally, mankind (and womankind) largely seems hell-bent on giving up their preeminence in the world by serving the god that wanted them gone. Perhaps Ms. Carey forgets that it was not Man who punished Prometheus.Highlighting the concept of evil perceived vs. evil-in-truth is not without interest, but I refer the curious to Steven Brust's \\"To Reign in Hell\\" which does a far better job with the topic.Having said all that, Ms. Carey's manifest ability is always \\"readable\\" and often poetic. I look forward to her future, and perhaps better thought out, novels."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"I enjoy Jacqueline Carey, and this book and Banewrecker were the first two I'd read away from the Kusheil Series. While Banewrecker is quick moving and catching, Godslayer gets bogged down in the telling of the story. There is a great deal of wandering in either the desert or forests - or long, dark tunnels, depending on the characters. The book seemed cumbersome at times, and I found myself skimming over large sections to get to the meatier parts. This book is not as slick as her Kusheil stories. The main characters are well developed and Carey does a good job of letting her readers know their thoughts and feelings. Carey is a good writer who can tell a great story, however my feeling was that Godslayer does not live up to her other works."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Carey's books -- but not the Godslayer books. Carey is a marvelous writer, very thorough in her attention to details and does the finest job of wrapping up all the loose ends. I was expecting the same with the Godslayer books, however these two books are different. The story moved back and forth between characters, ponderously slow while giving little hope for a fine resolution. The end was disappointing, and the small bit of hope that might lead to a third Godslayer book was not enough to compel me to read another on this tale."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"I love stories that explore moral ambiguity, and Carey's new trilogy is a beautiful example.And, no, it's not as great as her Kushiel trilogy, but that's setting the bar kind of high. lol And, for all the people bemoaning it as a thinly veiled rip-off of LOTR, perhaps the publishers should require people to take a basic level IQ test before buying the book...What it *is*, is a beautifully crafted retelling of the traditonal high fantasy story, in which 'good' battles 'evil'. Maybe this isn't everyone's cup of tea, but I loved it.Now to be a bit critical, I thought this one dragged a bit in the middle, but it definitely picked back up for its sad and poignant ending.I'm definitely looking forward to its sequel. (There will be one won't there?)"},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"What a letdown. I forgave Carey's obvious Tolkien spinoffs in the first novel, figuring she'd establish and elaborate a center in the sequel. It never happened.The language is gorgeous, if somewhat overwrought in spots, so that isn't the problem. The primary problem is that the trimmings can't overcome that fact that the world and characters she created don't make a lick of internal sense.Trying to avoid spoilers here, the series premise is a battle among a whole slew of gods and their assorted followers. The rebel god embodies--for lack of a better description--lust, vitality and creative chaos. The more docile cadre follows a control-freak god with painfully obvious totalitarian leanings; Order taken to extremes for his own purposes.Big problem number one: *none* of the dizzying array of gods or followers, save the rebel forces, even notice that their course will end in unbalance and stagnation. Unless Carey intended this novel as exercise about sheep driven by fear, the sheeplike characters are distinctly weird, especially contrasted to their 'heroic' descriptions.Big problem number two: Character development is too patchy to carry the novel. The ones who really do come alive are mostly among the rebels: ugly misfits who nonetheless love, have honor, hopes and bravery, no matter their unprepossesing exteriors and histories. Too bad, so sad to be them; they end up toast in the battle against their really, *really* pretty enemies.Carey's oft-repeated catch phrase about immutable doesn't remotely cover the massive \\"HUH?\\" gaps left in the wake.So...the saga 'ends' with most of halfway intelligent, gutsy, vital characters deader than doornails and a new age beginning for the really, really pretty twits who gained Order at the minor cost of sterility and frigidity.I don't need or want good guy/bad guy teams in books but sheesh, this series collapsed from the center."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"Carey's prose in the conclusion of The Sundering is as poetic and skillful as ever, however she does not seem to care at all for her characters. I got the feeling she lost interest in the story and slapped out a conclusion so she could move on to something else. Any interest the reader had in the characters after reading Banewreaker is lost as they stumble toward what she describes as an inevitable conclusion. The only interesting characters all die when the entire theme of the first book pointed toward the fact that they reach some kind of peace. Plot lines that seemed original and intriguing, such as the attraction between Tanaros and Cerelinde, peter out. The promise of the first book has been squandered. I had to finish it to see what happened, but was sorely disappointed."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"SPOILER WARNING. I was very disappointed by this book. Not because of how it does or doesn't relate to Tolkien (I don't care), but on its own merits. It's skillfully written, but the emotion foremost in my heart at the end was: so what? There is almost no evolution of the main characters, which is a capital sin of storytelling, and what evolution does happen matters little, as Carey kills almost everyone off at the end. I love (and most highly recommend) Carey's other works, but I found this book (and its predecessor) a well-wrought, colossal waste of time."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"Beautifully written, yet I have to agree with jaymac. I am moved to total disappointment in JC's finished volumes. One might accuse me of loving the Kushiel Triology so much that I am blind to works in a different vein, but that is not true. The premise was gorgeous, seven gods-one errant etc. One of JC's talents is her ability to create a world uninhabited by us, populated by fantastical characters that enthrall. The writing is awesome as she is able to manifest the poetry of her thoughts so eloquently into prose. But. This story was way too ambiguous, I never really knew what deep seated knowledge Satoris had gleaned from the dragons and if he knew what was going to happen, why did we and his Three agonize so? Someone is going to chide me for this next admission, but I couldn't even finish GS because I was so frustrated with not being able to connect with any of the characters as well as with the cryptic messages throughout that were never fully shared with the reader.

Bottom line, don't waste your money or your time. You'll find it hard to care about anyone in this story, and those chararcters who do manage to engage your vague interest, all die. I reached the final page and shook my head in disgust. Go out today and buy all 3 books of her Kushiel series. Avoid this series like the plague!"},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"This isn't, as some have described it, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" told from Sauron's viewpoint. It's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" set in a non-Christian, non-dualist world, where good and evil are secondary constructs, not fundamental conditions of the universe. The tragedy comes from the clash of perceptions, as the \\"good\\" side tries to impose its black and white (and incomplete) version of reality upon a world that is significantly more complex than that.I was rather disappointed that Carey did not appear to have followed through the implications of destroying a portion of the universal Godhead. It's not really clear from anything that comes before why Satoris'death would not in fact have catastrophic consequences, the next time that the One God decides to reconstitute Itself and discovers that one-sixth of It is missing.As another reviewer remarked, this is a philosophical meditation disguised as a fantasy novel. Plot, character and worldbuilding are sufficient, but not generous (though I rather liked the creepiness of the Gandalf-figure - mind-control through magic gems, hmm), which is why I am only giving it four stars. A certain familiarity and understanding of Tolkien and his philosophy would probably be very helpful. This is not for someone who just wants Kushiel-style hot sex, travelogues and a wallow in familiar tropes.I enjoyed reading the two books in this sequence, and it would be nice if she wrote more. I would like to know how the new world at the end turns out."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"I, like others here, found Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel series a wonderful breath of fresh air in a rather stale fantasy market. So, I, like others here, was excited beyond belief to find The Sundering books. I read both one after another about six months ago. I finished not knowing really what I thought. These books are so different, formal and epic, where Kushiel's are personal and enganging. I was sad and drained; I let a friend borrow them with a warning that they were \\"dark\\". She didn't read them and I found myself disappointed because I wanted to talk with someone about the books. As time passed I found myself thinking again about the books, the characters, trying to figure out how it could have gone differently, and wondering what will happen now in the world Ms. Carey has created. Kushiel remains in my mind as a terrific story with amazing characters, settings and it was fun, but The Sundering is what I keep thinking about and want more of."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"Again, I am also a fan of the Kushiel series, however, THIS IS NOT KUSHIEL! This is a whole different world, and it is amazing, with it's own mythology and history.Wow... some of this book was sadly predictable, not sadly as in bad writing, sad because you know that's how it had to be. Other parts were also amazingly surprising, and also sad in the same aspect, it had to be.This book was excellent, and it made me cry and laugh at the appropriate parts. And the ending, though it's horrible and made me Carey, was very well-written, and it does leave it open for a possible sequel, which I wouldn't be adverse to."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"As other reviewers have noted, the story borrows heavily from LOTR, but with a well-developed cosmology and mythology of its own that make it an interesting read. Unfortunately, it's pretty clear from relatively early on that the supposedly evil guys are really not all that bad, and the supposedly good guys are little better (and in some ways possibly worse), and while that's an interesting concept, it's not really enough. I think Jacqueline Carey sold her readers a little short with this one: the second half of this novel was boringly predictable, as if, having turned good and evil on their heads, she feared to do anything else."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"in this wonderful sequel to her magnifcent epic fantasy novel Banewreaker, the battle for Urulat comes to its epic conclusion (maybe). it is beatifully written with a very thought provoking plot and an interesting array of characters. what more can i say? well, what did the skeptics say?fortunately, most of the romantic fantasy fans and Tolkien purists didn't bother to read (or at least review) this one but still its ratings fall. here are the various complaints against the series and my responses:ITS NOT LIKE KUSHIEL!i have yet to read Kushiel, BUT THIS IS A GREAT BOOK. however, if you don't like epic fantasy, you probably won't like it.IT RIPS OFF TOLKIENfirst of all, WHO CARES! all fantasy books take some inspiration from Tolkien. besides, Tolkien took all that stuff about the beautiful immortal elves(rather than Santa's little helpers), the dwarves that live under the earth, the cursed ring, the sword that was reforged, right out of the Poetic Edda (also a great book). plus, Carey didn't JUST rip off Tolkien, the Marasoumie were right out of Robert Jordan, the whole theme of good seen as evil is very Miltonian, the inevitability of fate theme is omnipresent in Homer, Beowulf, and the Edda, although it seems odd to our modern taste, Satoris' refusal to kill Cerelinde bears striking similarity to Odin's refusal to slay Fenrir, the \\"water of life\\" that makes thing young is right of of Norse mythology, the Helm of Shadows sounds like Fafnir's Helm of Terror in the very lays that inspired Tolkien, and the \\"gifts\\" of Haomane and Satoris sound like the gifts of Hoenir and Lothur(who is probably Loki, the sort-of-evil god) in the Edda.I CAN'T SYMPATHIZE WITH ANY OF THE CHARACTERSif you can't sympathize with anyone who has faults, then you must live a very sheltered life. the only characters who aren't conflicted, and who can't see their own faults, are Haomane's allies. thats the point, they are blindly pursuing their goal towards \\"paradise\\" without thinking of the repercussions (sound like our president?). IF YOU NEED CHARACTERS DEFINED IN BLACK AND WHITE THEN DONT READ THIS BOOK!THE CHARACTERS ACT STUPIDyes, HAOMANE'S ALLIES are blind, thats the theme. Haomane is obssessed with creating his \\"perfect world\\" free of emotion, and the humans have been taught that Satoris is the root of all evil. as for the other gods, they're just scared of Haomane. Satoris' allies, on the other hand, know that Satoris is going to die eventually, but they want to keep his gift in the world as long as they can, and die with honor. in our culture that may seem a little dellusional, and perhaps it is, but the ancient epics tell us that in ancient, violent times people believed that destiny was inescapable, and strived for an honorable death rather than a peaceful one. the Were just want peace. the dwarves they probably realize that Haomane is going to win, and don't want to be on his bad side.ALL THAT STUFF ABOUT THE GIFTS AND THE DRAGONS JUST DOESN'T WORKits suppsed to be magical, not scientific. IT ISN'T TOTALLY LITERAL! the Fjel can think, but so can dogs or monkeys. they can speak, learn, hunt, and obey, but they don't have the kind of complex analytical or creative abilities of humans. furthermore, Satoris' gift is PASSION not the ability to procreate. Carey uses dragons in Beowulf-like way, as an embodiement of fate. they are omniscient, and can see into the future, but they do not try to change fate, only to carry it out.I CAN'T REMEMBER ALL THESE CHARACTERSyou see what I mean about the Gift of Thought?SPOILER WARNING: IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING THENSTOP HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!a;sldkjfhal;jdfkl;aslkfj;lakjdsf;lkahdsfjashflk;ajsfhljkdfhklajsall the characters i like die:(that junk was to keep people who don't want to knoe the ending from reading the title when they skim over this, by the way) yet again, thats the theme. from the end of Banewreaker, its pretty evident this isn't going to be a happy ending. however, Carey likes to dangle a sliver of hope before your eyes, well more than a sliver until the end, and take it away, and maybe you think Satoris will win because thats what you want to think. that proves that you DO care about the characters, and thats why Carey is a great storyteller. you cant believe how stupid everyone is, and you cant hate them for it, but you love them too (except Malthus). she WANTS you to think \\"how could you do that Lilias\\" and \\"how could you do that Cerelide\\" and why didn't you just KILL HER. if you like happy endings then this is not the book for you. still, it does leave you with a glimmer of hope."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"As others have commented before, this is indeed a very, very peculiar fantasy epic. A deliberately anti-LOTR, anti-Tolkien sort of fantasy. It is, I feel, a philosophical meditation disguised as a fantasy novel.As the author of the Kushiel novels, Ms. Carey's ability to write outstanding conventional fantasy -- with heroes and adventures and a whole lot of even more eyebrow-raising, uniquely Phedre no'Delaunay type things -- cannot be questioned. Yet this is a novel that is missing all of these: it has no sympathetic hero, and it has no final deliverance. After reading it, it leaves a dry and bitter taste in my mouth. I refuse to believe this is an accident. So many things are so diametrically opposed to her old style as well as the Tolkienist conventions that it must have been deliberate.As a philosophical treatise (if you will), it can be read from many different angles. Here I'll just concentrate on what I take to be the central point of the meditation: the role of fate/providence. In Lord of the Rings, fate/providence plays a double role: it publicly threatens the heroes, yet secretly aids them. The apparent power of the Dark Lord is overwhelming and the fate of defeat for the \\"good guys\\" seems certain. Yet this is merely deception: not only the \\"good guys\\" refuse to accept such a fate (which is of course where most of the heorism comes from), but in fact in the course of their struggle against this apparent fate, all the \\"breaks\\" go their way. At every turning point where the heroes' \\"fate\\" hangs along a knife's edge, they have one lucky \\"coincidence\\" after another, until such \\"coincidences\\" pile so high that even the heroes themselves begin to perceive that fate/providence is in fact at work to aid them to overcome insurmountable odds -- which, when one realizes the inherently uneven playing field favoring the \\"good guys,\\" in fact are not so insurmountable after all (there is even a sort of sly in-joke, I believe, to this near the end of Godslayer, where the battlefield literally tilts up in favor of the \\"good guys\\" to help them win the fight).Here, the role of providence is presented, in a very unambiguous fashion (unlike the fleeting references in LOTR), as a prophecy uttered by the High God of the \\"good guys.\\" The entire story consists of various parts of the prophecy, one by one, ruthlessly coming true \\"despite\\" all apparent odds against them. One of the truly perverse pleasures (or ironic pains?) of this story is that, since it's told from the perspective of the \\"bad guys,\\" you feel each \\"lucky break\\" for the good guys not as dramatic, exhilarating elation, but as extremely painful regret -- why why oh why does everything that can possibly go wrong in fact does go wrong when it matters the most? Why can't \\"we\\" get just ONE lucky break?But Ms. Carey's twist on fate/providence goes beyond merely a mirror trick. Time and time again, people do things to fulfill the various parts of the prophecy, even when they cannot understand why. Some of these actions, so lacking in apparent rationality (or even down right irrational), boarder on grotesque parodies of heroism. This can be clearly seen in the quest of the \\"holy water\\" -- two apparently weak people, against all apparent odds, delivering a dangerous weapon to the heart of the lands of the Dark Lord -- a storyline that most obviously parallels LOTR's Frodo and Sam. But unlike the intrepid hobbits who display a full range of emotions and initiatives, this story's heroes are merely wooden puppets in the hands of fate. Why should they help the High God Haomane in fulfilling his prophecy? It was Haomane who drove them into the desert and forgot about them. Why should they go on this quest? It was merely at the asking of Haomane's emissary -- even when he offers no reward, and if they do not go on this quest, it will bring no harm to their society. Why should they repeatedly make the choices that favor Haomane and his \\"good\\" allies? Merely because they have \\"chosen\\" to do so, for no good reason. Indeed, their whole community's constant refrain is just the command \\"Choose,\\" even when most of this community faced their potential executioners, who would almost certainly have spared them if they had offered even the slightest rational defense, or just a plea of mercy. Instead they offer the perverse \\"Choose\\" -- asking the executioners to choose to kill them or not with no attempt at defense or explanation. Far from \\"choosing\\" their own fate, they in fact abandon themselves to fate.This is certainly not unique. Time and time again we see characters in this novel abandon themselves to the prophecy/fate/providence for reasons are often to the utter bafflement of themselves. In fact the whole story itself is brought to a bitter climax when two principle characters in effect committe suicide, while giving the explicit explanation of either relieving the burden of individual, rational choice or to fulfill an even greater fate/providence. Time and time again, some of the dialogues actually read almost like a third-person observer commenting on the story, speculating the roles the various actors fill in the whole history/myth-as-a-play, and how implicitly individual choices and autonomous actions are mere illusions.Above all, the feeling I got at the end is the sheer futility of human agency in the face of the overwhelming ruthlessness of providence. There is really no joy at all in victory, or even the hunger for revenge in defeat: everything is foretold, prophesized, ordained to the nth power. The foremost feeling is utter despair at the hands of fate.To be sure, this is no exhilarating, melodramataic and happy reading material! Another Kushiel clone it certainly is not. As a straightforward fantasy/adventure novel, I cannot in good conscious recommend it. But if one is willing to take a walk on the wild side a bit, give this very peculiar and strange philosophical fantasy a try.BTW, it's also interesting to speculate -- this part is indeed resting on very thin ice -- about some theological implications of this novel vis-a-vis LOTR. Tolkien is well-known as a devout Christian, yet LOTR is ostensibly a pagan novel: no savior God, no grand judgment, and certainly plenty good ol' fashioned pagan philosophy (especially in war -- reminiscent of the Iliad, where heroes achieve immortality by dying bravely and famously on battlefelds). But fundamentally it's tentalizingly Christian in at least two respects. One is the subtle hints about how fate/providence assists the good at every turn (Gandalf, who certainly benefits from it, comments on this more than once). The other is the timeline: LOTR speaks of the passing of different ages in a linear timeline. Though it has only beginning but no visible end, it certainly does not subscribe to the notion of \\"cycles.\\" In yet another interesting twist (at least it seems to me), Godslayer turns this around too: it's Christianity-like notion of providence is hammered to home at the readers again and again (while showing the very, very dark side of such providence), but this providence nevertheless is fitted inside a fundamentally pagan notion of cyclical times, where nothing truly ever ends. Plus, the jab about how the high god Haomane is an \\"absent father\\" is more than a little suggestive..."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"I loved her Kushiel series.

I knew, going in, that this meant it probably wouldn't end well.I think she did a good job, but the problem is with my personal taste. I cannot stand reading books where the characters do nothing but repeatedly fail at every single thing they do. And that seems to be what these books were about. I know some people must like that sort of thing, otherwise no one would ever read John Steinbeck, but personally I just find that draining.Personal taste aside, I liked the ideas presented in it. People get upset and are unwilling to listen when their personal paradigm is threatened. If you look at any controversial argument you tend to see that a lot. Especially with regard to religion.I thought there were too many character points of view. I think I prefer her style in the Kushiel books that focuses on just one person. I admit that I just could not bring myself to care about certain characters, like Dani and his uncle. I wanted to keep reading about Lilias, Tanaros and Cerelinde.The other thing that bothers me, and I think this was part of her point so it's not necessarily a criticism, is that I don't feel anyone really learned anything. The bad guys' crime was essentially just wanting to live and be left alone. The good guys just refused to accept that, and refused to acknowledge that, basically, \\"They started it.\\" I wish just one character would have come around to realize that. They were like religious fanatics refusing to see reason. Which I'm sure was the point, but it left me ultimately dissatisfied and depressed. Stories that are a pure exercise in defeat are good for discussion, but I greatly prefer a difficult journey with a happy ending, please."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"I know this is a re-write from the perspective of the King of the Nazguls from Lord of the Rings, so we know how the story ends. That's not why I knocked off two stars. I did that because the characters just aren't that interesting. The only two who held my interest was the half-breed who seemed to hate everything and Lord Sartoris himself. He was interesting. The others just felt like place-holders. I will say that this world is dissimilar enough from Middle-Earth and the remaining characters and possibilities are intriguing enough that if the author returns to this world with an original series, I'd probably read it."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"I read both of the Sundering books back to back, so this is a review of the entire story, not just of the second novel. There are a few holes in the story that require you to suspend disbelief and not probe too hard at thin points in the plot. The 'Gifts' of the Shapers is one of the tricky bits to me, since the races who aren't gifted with desire still manage to have children(even though supposedly the loss of this gift will prevent the Were race from having any in the future) and the troll race are sentient, despite not being gifted with Thought. Also, there is a rather suspicious lack of venality; all the characters are noble and well-meaning, except for the Sorceress, who is admittedly shallow and vain, and who dies entirely too conveniently, but overall I really enjoyed The Sundering. The twist of Tolkien's formula was extremely satisfying, if you, like me, are one of those readers who appreciates being reminded that there are always two sides to every story, that all heroes are flawed, and that there's no reason that gods can't lie, or be wrong."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"First, I will give you a simple truth. I do not have the words to express how utterly incredible the books Banewreaker and Godslayer, written by Jacqueline Carey, are.Satoris, thirdborn of the Shapers of the reborn world, defied his oldest brother. Haomane, who denied Satoris' gift of quickening for his children, requested three times that Satoris remove his gift from Men, the only other race to receive the gift of thought from Haomane. For while Haomane thought he knew the will of the world, only Satoris had conversed with the Dragons, who truely knew.And so Haomane waged war, sundering the world and killing many of the dragons who had come to the aid of their friend, Satoris. The world was scorched, wars fought and lost, until Satoris shaped a fortress, Darkhaven. There, Satoris stayed, merely wishing to live, while his brother, Haomane, fought still, this time through Prophesy.'When the unknown is made known, when the lost weapon is found, when the marrow-fire is quenched and Godslayer is freed, when a daughter of Elterrion weds a son of Altorus, when the Spear of Light is brought forth and the Helm of Shadows is broken, the Fjeltroll shall fall, the Were shall be defeated ere they rise, and the Sunderer will be no more, the Souma shall be restored and the Sundered World made whole and Haomane's Children shall endure.'Banewreaker and Godslayer take place in the time of this Prophesy's fulfilling, following the forces of 'good' as they try and fulfill the prophesy, and the forces of 'darkness' as they try and survive the war brought upon them by the fulfilling of this prophesy.The tagline of Banewreaker is simple, but telling. 'When all that is considered good considers you evil, are you?' Those on both sides of this imagined line are honorable, devoted, and ernest in their beliefs. You feel sorrow for those manipulated by Haomane's will, and for those who will be destroyed by the same, and even moreso by those caught in the middle.If you enjoy fantasy at all, read this story. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"I just finished the second novel of this series.Yes, I understand why people are bound to characterize this story as a reversal of Tolkien's archetypical good versus evil story. But it is not! That view is an oversimplification and it saddens me to see people fall into that comfortable rut.No one is good. No one is evil. That is Carey's point, I believe. Both sides are giving every last ounce of themselves for their Truth, for what they believe to be vital and necessary, and worth their lives. Inseparable and undeniable is the truth that neither side truly understand what they are fighting for. They are loyal and honorable, and they hold on to those values as if they are enough without answering the questions: What is honorable? Loyal to what? Over and over, the offer and plea is made: \\"Choose.\\" Over and over, both sides decline to choose. They toy with the idea, but it's too grand, too vast. It is easier to slip back into the known; into loyalty; into honor. Those are comfortable and familiar. Therein, lies the most pointed of Carey's observations. It is shocking how frequently and consistently these smart, good people choose comfort and familiarity over Truth, Knowledge, Possibilities... and, frankly, their own good. They keep sacrificing, keep giving up their own happiness - and for what? If they stopped long enough, they might think it through and understand that there are no sides; that they are fight what, in some sense, is an imaginary war with good people and good intentions on both sides. If they stopped long enough to think, they might realize that they could do worse than show a little weakness, let their honor slip a little and just let themselves be happy. It's heartbreaking - and, I tell you, it makes for a great, great story.The prose is not so elegant here as in the Kushiel books, not so refined. The reality of the story, too, it not so twisted or poetic. But could a novel bound by those elements get at the raw, unpoetic and very beautiful truth of this story, and at the vivid, human, flawed and lovable characters who reside within in? I don't think so. Not quite like this."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"There is a thought provoking thread throughout this story. Who are \\"the bad guys\\" or is it simply which side of the conflict your viewpoint is from that determines that? No moments of levity in this tale but very good nonetheless."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"I hated the Kushiel books. I loved this one. It is a dark book that has a very satisfying ending but not a happy one. This is the classic story of good vs evil, told from the evil point of view. It is Tolkien-inspired only superficially. The plot and characters are unique. The events of the book are unique. The nature of the magic is unique. The Tolkien-esk elements are merely a nod towards the genre meant to further emphasize the author's point about the treatment of good and evil within the fantasy genre. It is not a retelling of LOTR. It is a story examining the nature of evil. There are many characters, few main characters, and -thankfully- no love interests. This is a long book. It is a good read and the themes are deep and well presented.The evil characters are evil. They betray, murder, steal, pillage, and destroy. The good characters do not commit these crimes but are guilty of other, more subtle, atrocities. It is hard to like the evil characters but not hard to understand them. They are appropriately layered but their motivations are practical. The good characters have more lofty goals of keeping the world from succumbing to evil. They are easy to like but difficult to understand."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"If you liked the overly-angsty ridden and stilted formality of the prose in Banewreaker, then you will continue to eat up Godslayer, a direct continuation of the Middle Earthlike tale of Lord Satoris the Sunderer of the World and his three immortal human servants against the \\"good\\" allies of Haomane in the world of Urulat.\\"Ways of the Marasoumie had been destroyed. Lord Satoris had done this in his wrath. The Dragon of Beshtanag was no more, slain by the Arrow of Fire; the lost weapon, found. Bereft of her Soumanie, the Sorceress of the East was nothing more than an ordinary woman; Lilias, mortal and powerless. The Were had struck a bitter bargain with Aracus Altorus, ceding to his terms; defeated ere they rose. Aracus was coming, his heart filled with righteous fury, knowing he had been duped.\\"Thus begins the further exploration of what evil is, and how evil can contain love and how that which is good can become evil so easily. (Reading this book has infected my writing!)We get more of Tanaros Blacksword's dueling love for Lord Satoris, his Fjeltroll army, and the hostage Lady Cerelinde. More self-sacrifice from both \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" characters, and the continuing flow of irony and ichor (how many times can one use \\"ichor\\" in a book, without going completely overboard, I wonder, Godslayer at least skims the boundary) from Lord Satoris himself.And it still isn't stale. Despite the highblown and emotional dialogue of everyone from Fjeltroll to Yarru-yami (aborigine) and the adjective-heavy prose, it's still a delicious journey through good and evil and satisfying to anyone craving Middle Earth.The ending almost made me knock down my stars to three. Many of the characters lives' are brought to a close, but a main thread is left loose, and while promising hope, we are left with some major gloom and doom from both sides' perspectives.But I could not get over the pure, self-indulgent pleasure of the prose and the angst-ridden characters that never cross the line into tedium or buffoonery.This Book's Snack Rating: More Cheetos for the cheesy, compulsive flavor of the prose and the still satisfying crunch of meaty characters."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"While most people continue to compare these books to Lord of the Rings, if you are able to look beyond the similarities you will find a very richly written story. I enjoyed both books immensely and I am glad I took the suggestion from George R. R. Martin's list. It's hard not to find a fantasy book today that you can't compare in some way to Tolkien, look at Salvatore if your screaming rip off. Both books are a good solid read with very rich characters."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"Um, yeah. Not as exciting as Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel's series. The story felt predictable to me. Yet, I couldn't stop reading; was up until three in the morning finishing the book. I think what kept me reading was HOW the ending would happen and HOW it would be justified. Meanwhile, the talent of a poet brings to life a whole world never seen except in Ms. Carey's imagination.I tried to decide WHY I cared about any of the characters. The good guys; not exactly all that, and the bad have reasons for their own behavior. So if everyone is \\"just so\\"--WHO cares? Then Jacqueline brought in a child. As my mother and I confirmed long ago: Any show (book) is good if there is a child and/or an animal, even the war or cowboy shows that Dad liked to watch.The final reason I finished reading this series? I challenged myself to read everything I could by Jacqueline Carey. I only have the Santa Olivia series to go!"},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"\\"Godslayer\\", the second book in Jacqueline Carey's \\"Sundering\\" duology, takes off almost immediately from where \\"Banewreaker\\". The armies of the \\"good\\" side are on the move towards the fortress of Lilias of Beshtanarag, and the councilor Malthus returns to the story in a way deeply reminiscent of Gandalf the wizard from The Lord of The Rings (which the story is both imitating and deconstructing, simultaneously). Tanaros continues to struggle with the captured Ellyl princess Cerelinde, himself, and his enemies, while the \\"water-bearer\\" Dani and his uncle continue their flight towards Darkhaven in the hopes of leading to the ultimate defeat of Satoris, the deconstructed and subverted \\"Dark Lord\\".The problem with this story in large part lies many in two places. The first reason is that, like the first novel, the book suffers from heavy plot-driving; in order to match up closely with the Lord of the Rings, Carey is forced to make her characters undertake certain events that don't seem to flow naturally from their own characters, and that ultimately render the story melodramatic rather than interesting. Major battle are fought more or less because they need to be fought For The Sake of The Plot, and what little remained of character-driven storytelling dissipates. This greatly diminished my patience for this book, such that by the end of the story I felt relief in many ways that it was finally finished.The other problem is that much of what made the first book good - the theme of defiance, the characterization, the tragic and painful ways in which people and groups tried to deal with their perceived \\"fate\\" - is weakened or absent. The closest it comes is with Lilias, and her defeat and capture do not equal, for example, the sorrow invoked by the peace the Were are desperate for. Without that, a story that is based around humanizing the \\"dark\\" side instead becomes a bland paean to their goodness and the injustice of the followers of Haomane (the \\"light\\" side).Perhaps squandered most of all is the possibilities for aftermath - namely, what happens to the \\"Light\\" side followers when they achieve their goals, and it turns out to be not what they expected? Instead of exploring this, Carey ends on a deeply ambiguous but optimistic note that fails to evoke any feeling or interest in the reader.While I still suggest reading this duology because of the excellent first book, I am disappointed that the second book turned out to be highly weak and unsatisfying by comparison."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"My biggest criticism of the first book in this pair was that she waited til near the end of the book to really give the background history and motivations, even personality, of most of the characters. But once I had that, I really enjoyed the end of the last book. Then, with that basis set, I really enjoyed this second book much more.There are so many ways Carey could have taken the story, and I found myself extremely satisfied with the ending. The majority of the major characters wrestle on their own level with the thesis behind the whole book - what makes one evil? Do you stick by your principles when you aren't sure your side is right or not? How each resolves this quandry is what brings the plot to its culmination, with each and every decision integral to the final outcome."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"I can't understand why people compare this to the story as told from the perspective of the Nazgul, or compare it to LotR at ALL - this is completely different! The Nazgul were intent on world domination and the complete and total subjugation of all people and races underneath them; Satoris only wants to be left alone. Haomane would be more accurately compared to the Nazgul than Satoris, and even HE isn't THAT bad - he just wants his way like a spoiled child!That's not to say I got the ending I wanted in the book! But the book ended as it should - as the dragons say - \\"All thingss mussst be asss they are.\\" And, although this story was being told from the point of view of the so-called \\"dark\\" Lord, it still clings to the conventions for this type of story. However, I don't wish to spoil the story, so I won't go any further with those thoughts.In this book we continue to follow the attempts of Haomane's Allies to fulfill Haomane's Prophecy, and Lord Satoris' Allies attempts to stop them. We spend a good bit of time with the Bearer - Dani of the Yarru Yami - in his travels to get to Darkhaven, as well as with Lilias in her captivity among the Rivenlost. Unfortunately, years of indoctrination leaves the Rivenlost and the races of Men completely unable to believe anything of what they are told of Satoris. Only the Lady Cerelinde - held in the fastness of Darkhaven, begins to question her beliefs. And, of course, by the time she does it really is too late.Again, I actually really liked this story - those who compare it to LotR or the Belgariad are not really giving the story the credit it is due, I think. I have read LotR well over a dozen times, and must have read the Belgariad close to that - and I can't see that much of a similarity. I'll grant you that the very basic premise is somewhat the same, but it is a standard convention in this sort of story - however, Ms. Carey takes it into new and unexpected directions and I was happy to see it. I can, with confidence, suggest this to anyone who is willing to read this and take the time to really think about it."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"The land of Urulat is about to see the end of a conflict thousands of years old. The machinations of Satoris the Sower have been exposed and the would-be King of the West, Aracus Altorus, advised by the Wise Counsellor Malthus, has raised a mighty host to assault Darkhaven and rescued his beloved, Cerelinde of the Ellylon. It falls to Satoris' most loyal servants, the Three, to prepare his defence. But whilst great armies ready for the clash, it falls to two of the humble desert-people to find their way into Darkhaven and strike the blow that will render Satoris truly vulnerable.Godslayer is the second and final novel in The Sundering, a duology that studies and subverts the traditional epic fantasy paradigm as established by Tolkien. Like its forebear, Banewreaker, Godslayer is an epic tragedy, closely based on events and characters from J.R.R. Tolkien's The Silmarillion, Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, but at every turn analysing deeply every character's motivation. As Satoris ponders, does it matter that you are not evil if everyone else believes that you are?This premise allows Carey to examine many themes and ideas, such as propaganda (Malthus/Gandalf as a sort-of Goebbels for the 'good guys' is an interesting take), destiny and the cyclical nature of history: just as Morgoth was cast down but his servant Sauron was overlooked, allowing him to return later, so Satoris has his own lieutenants who stand poised to inherit his mantle. These ideas are rooted in strong characterisation, particularly of Tanaros and Cerelinde, though other characters also come to the fore.Godslayer suffers from some minor issues. The story is inherently predictable, once you realise what Carey is doing. Also problematic is that The Sundering is one novel split in two for publication (itself appropriate, since The Lord of the Rings was originally published as three volumes; the fact that Carey tells as epic a story in considerably less pages may itself before a comment on the fantasy genre), meaning that the two books do not stand well alone. Since both are available now and you can read from one into the next without a problem, this is not as much of an issue as when the book was newly-released.On the plus side, this is a clever and thoughtful conclusion to the series. Through authors such as Bakker and Erikson, epic fantasy has of late been more and more interrogating itself and asking hard questions about its underlying assumptions, but Carey does the same here a lot more concisely. Carey also delivers a story that is an emotionally powerful tragedy. The opposing factions cannot agree on anything and good men on both sides die needlessly as a result of mistakes made thousands of years earlier. The reader becomes as frustrated as the characters do at the ongoing carnage that is only happening at the whim of the proud and long-absent gods.Godslayer (****) is a worthy conclusion to this duology that questions the conservative nature of much epic fantasy and finds it wanting, as well as delivering a powerful and tragic tale in its own right. The book is available now in the USA and on import in the UK."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"Godslayer is not quite the second book of The Sundering series. It is the second half of a single story, and it is impossible to read one instalment without reading the other.While Banewreaker depicted a world tethering on the verge of war, closing off with the inevitable fall into conflict, Godslayer offers us an agonising resolution to the epic struggle of thought versus passion: the tension mounts with every new development. Even when we think that the rope is so taut that it must surely break Ms. Carey keeps on weaving her tale, taking us to higher and higher places... And setting us up for an ending that should leave no one untouched.The Sundering series is a deconstruction of the Lords of the Rings so the reader knows - thinks he knows - the ending. Actually, we think we know what is going to happen from the very beginning. And... we are not wrong, entirely. We are far from right, though. The characters, who are the ones driving this particular story, add all sorts of nuances to the tale. There are twists we would not expect, gestures that leave us gaping in wonder, and an underlying hopeless hope for Satoris to be left alone and in peace shadows our every step of the way.This is perhaps the best aspect: suspension of belief, perfectly achieved. We know, but we hope. And thus the tension is born and it never lets up.Another most interesting aspect of Godslayer is the way it makes us think. Fantasy is often used to address issues such as racism, sexism, good versus evil... Most books do this using half-breds, charismatic heroines and orcs versus elves. It is nothing new. But to change the point of reference, to explore the views of those both sides, to be able to empathize with both sides of the field... That makes for an entirely new level of grey, and for some nutritious food for thought. And on top of these classic themes, Jacqueline Carey presents us with a chance to reconsider the meaning of loyalty, of heroes, of destiny, of fate, of the choices we make and of so many other things. I could not have asked anything more from a book.The characters keep the same voice and feeling they had in Banewreaker, while they react and evolve according to their circumstances and to the events. They are alive in their own world, and they are consistent with their motivations, their beliefs, their hopes. Particularly touching is the Sorceress from the East and her loneliness. Or Satoris and his honour, his humanity even in godhood. The Lady Cerelinde, whose kindness is an invisible knife in truth.And Tanaros, always Tanaros.Godslayer is not just a great book. The Sundering is not just an amazing series. I feel I'm the richer person now that I've read it.Godslayer made me cry. Not many tales can touch you so deeply, and I'd never change that experience."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"I feel this series is very well written. I understand what people who give it poor reviews are saying. But think about it... those who follow from faith, do they question it really? Or fully understand what they are doing? No. Faith can be a very blind thing and I feel that is what Carey is portraying. I also feel she is trying to portray the idea that no one is fully good or evil, and that what is thought evil is often from an origin of good. I understand her ideas and concepts in this story and I find the characters very interesting. Perhaps this story line is not for everyone, but personally I am not let down at all. Carey is magical with words and her writing style and though this is very different from her Kushiel series, I feel it is just as good in it's own right."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"One of the problems with sequels is that, everything that you held in wonder from the first book, is now old hat. There's not really much one can do about that except read the sequel and hope it stands on its own merits.If I could give this book 3.5 stars, I would. It's almost as good as Banewreaker, but not quite. In this volume, I think Carey spends too much time with the two characters that stand in for Frodo and Sam from LOTRs (named Dani and Thulu). I was never keen on their storyline from the beginning, so the attention she gives them here wears upon me.Also, like the movie version of Return of the Kings, Carey has trouble finishing this book. There's like 6 different endings. Loose ends do indeed need to be tied up, but it just goes on and on.I was, however, glad to see that my favorite character, the Dreamspinner, played a significant role, and I hope Ms. Carey will consider doing another series with him at the helm."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"I have not read the Kushiel series as yet as I wanted to give the Sundering a fair chance. I must say that it was very enjoyable, although there are some elements of Tolkien. But, it is still worth reading. I wonder if Ms. Carey will write another one. I am hoping that she will."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"One of the underwritten sub-genre's in the fantasy field is what one might call the \\"bittersweet\\" epics. Here we take a major step away from Tolkien, pushing into areas where the fantasy trappings give way to the complex shades of gray. Robbin Hobb's Liveship Trader series is one of the classic examples of this style of writing.Jacqueline Carey's The Sundering series approaches new heights. It is, ultimately, a series about the fallen god Satoris who, in his own words, spent too much time with the ageless dragons and Tanaros, his 1000 year old bereft and broken general. Their all too human failings, dreams, triumphs and disappointments will stay with you for a long time."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"After reading the first half, Banewreaker, long after it was released, I had promised myself not to wait on reading the second half. After all, they were originally meant to be published as one, and the end of Banewreaker was such that one really didn't want to wait on the conclusion for too long. Quite a feat for the author to have accomplished, I must say, given that you know from the get-go where the story is heading: the \`bad' guys, the ones you in fact end up rooting for, are fated to lose.Perhaps it is just human nature, helped along by the way Carey writes the story, but even despite knowing that it is a tragedy, you constantly keep hoping that something will happen to change the inevitable. You just can't imagine she'll really go ahead and do what she's said she will do, even when the evidence mounts higher and higher. But ... she does. And if you're anything like me, you'll read the last hundred pages with a growing lump in your throat and a tightness in your chest. Not too many weeks ago, we studied tragedies in my Literature class, and Godslayer definitely fulfills many of the requirements of a classic tragedy, not the least being able to produce katharsis in its readers."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"I find Carey's prose wonderful - also in the two books of the Sundering, which I am reviewing together - like another reviewer, I read them back to back. Again and again, for a few pages, she fully pulled me in, because her writing is beautiful.HOwever, the story fails, for me.There is no main character, who has real depth. Each person is repetitively associated with a few main traits, or memories, they do not develop, just continue.The story itself has so much promise, but there are too many people, about whom I never manage to care deeply, since they all seem pawns in a grand chessgame nobody is visibly playing. Even the Shapers do not appear to guide the destiny, or to act, they just set events in motion, long ago, and now the game is played out - and never is there a feeling of a new game being set in motion, or of a shift towards a new player taking over (except the epilogue).The moral basis is very interesting, but never fully developped or explained. I like the hints, and the half grasped truths, but nobody, at the end, is truly wiser or happier, or even really clearly different from how they set out except some of those who suffered for millenia are finally released into death. Well, yes, predetermination is also a way of looking at the world, but then the whole struggle is in vain, basically, which makes for a rather depressing ending to a long book.I may have missed some subtle stuff because I started skipping, all those repeated moments of pain, endless despair and futile striving got repetitive and I was not able to start caring deeply for anyone, maybe with the exception of a raven, who played a very minor role.If all this was condensed into a 50-100 pages legend which was the introduction to a new era and then we had a real story happening in the new era, it would have been excellent. But only the legend, in very long words, with everybody larger than life and no fun or happiness at all, and all innocents just getting ground into the grand design, that works, maybe, for those who like legends. But not for someone like me, who wants a good story where I can identify with the characters - so all those who like heroic sagas should like this one.I will definitely read Carey again, and probably even risk the price of a hardcover, since her writing is so good that I am prepared to try one more time."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"I had a difficult time getting into Banewreaker, but when I did I was interested enough in what was happening to purchase Godslayer.As it was, I read another book in between Banewreaker and Godslayer, one that was extremely well written, and when I came back to Godslayer the problems I had with Carey's prose multiplied. As is the problem with many fantasy novels, the prose was rather purple, and contained an abuse of words that made you look to a dictionary. I found myself struggling to turn pages.Then, out of nowhere, she \\"pulled a Gandalf\\". If you don't believe me, he's on the cover for all to see: a reincarnated character who comes back robed in white, with white hair and a white beard, and on a white horse!I had argued that in Banewreaker Carey was imitating Tolkien's works so much (and to a lesser extent, other works) because she was telling a story that could apply to any epic or high fantasy series. That allowed me to get past the numerous unnecessary similarities to Tolkien's world (Soumani = Silmarils, etc.), but just barely. This last one, the \\"Gandalf\\", I can't get past. It could reasonably argued that the Soumani were necessary to the story, and it couldn't have been told without them, but it cannot be argued that \\"pulling a Gandalf\\" was necessary, because it just isn't. It NEVER is."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"While Lord of the Rings is a great fantasy book, I have always thought it somewhat marred by its capitalized and underlined Good and Evil. I suspect Jacqueline Carey of an urge to re-write it and address this flaw. Godslayer has numerous parallels to LOTR. For Sauron it has Satoris, a Shaper god ruling a dark kingdom of undead men, troll-like Fjel, and the misshapen and abandoned of the world. Arrayed against him are the races of men, elves, and dwarves, under the distant rule of Satoris' siblings, the other six Shaper gods. For Gandalf it has Malthus; for Frodo and Sam it has two small desert dwellers on a journey into the heart of Satoris' kingdom; and for Gollum it has ... I wasn't sure until I read Malthus describing a sorceress: \\"She may yet have some small part to play in this.\\" Got it.But there is no clear-cut good and evil here. Satoris is a Promethean god, who gave the gift of reproduction to the race of men, and is hounded by his siblings for refusing to withdraw it. The darkness of his kingdom comes from his own wounds, despite which he tries to provide haven for his followers. While Good might seem to reside on the side of men, elves, and dwarves, their case against Satoris is shallow and unexamined. It's no secret why Satoris is hounded, but men apparently are not capable of thinking through what it would mean if Satoris gave in to his siblings -- oops, no more children, for a start. Apparently they're too caught up in their honor to notice this little problem. I appreciate the attempt at moral ambiguity in the story, but the potential tragedy of loyalty and vengeance introduced in the first book degenerates into muddled thinking in the conclusion. Perhaps Carey could have successfully drawn it all together by revealing that Haomane, the Big Brother Lord of Thought, has suffered a tragic brain injury. That would explain why no one's thinking clearly.The book is enjoyable to read if you like a moody, medieval style. It's well written, and while it has a few too many self-conscious \\"betimes\\" and \\"begats,\\" Carey largely succeeds with an archaic writing style. The book's main failure comes where LOTR excels -- in the depth of history and back story. The cosmology of the Shaper gods doesn't make much sense. (The Fjel are supposed to have no gift of thought, but are actually just a little slow; while elves, supposedly denied the gift of reproduction, have children occasionally -- does this mean that the gods only give the gift of being a little better at something?) At times a misty veil covers important aspects of the story. (What the heck DO the dragons know? \\"All thingsss musst be as they musst...\\" just doesn't work after awhile. And why are the Shaper gods in hiding?) Since this book is supposed to be the conclusion of the story, I have to think that the author herself doesn't know and tries to cover this up with soft brushstrokes and mood lighting. If you want to take on Lord of the Rings, you'd better have that Winsor Newton Triple-0 worn down to nothing. Soft brushstrokes just won't cut it."},{"Title":"Godslayer (The Sundering, Book 2)","review":"I'd previously enjoyed books by the author of Godslayer, Jacqueline Carey. Her Kushiel books were thick stories of political intrigue in a fantasy world (with more focus on the courtesans than I appreciated, but that happens), and I loved the cover of the first book in this duology when I picked it up, so high hopes ensued.Before I began reading Banewreaker, I had heard a vague rumor around the internet (because I can't remember where exactly), that the inspiration for the story was a what-if: What If Sauron wasn't the bad guy Middle Earth thought he was? This sounding like a fascinating jumping-off point- an interesting take on good, evil, and how people can be manipulated into one or the other.What I didn't count on was that it wasn't so much inspired by LotR as a near-direct mirror image copy. I tried, really hard, to give the books a chance. I slogged through the difficult-to-get-into first half of the first book, and then found myself having an easier time telling what was going on simply because of the relation to LotR.Yes, there were a few characters that weren't exact copies of Tolkien's, but those were few. I found myself annoyed by the lack of originality, and irritated by the total lack of empathy that any of the characters inspired. I've always found it difficult to tolerate stories that are blatant rip-offs, but this was one of the worst offenders I've ever dealt with.Fast-forward several years, and I found the second book at Half-Price Books, and figured it couldn't possibly be as dreadful as I remembered. So I bought it. And it took me months upon months to dreg up enough interest to actually start reading this book.Oh, it was hard to read. Again, it took my a good quarter of the book before I sank into the rhythm of just remembering characters by their LotR equivalents, and the parallels (to be as kind as possible) grated on my nerves.Add in the fact that it was difficult to read at work based merely on the title... for example:Customer: Godslayer! What a terrible title!Me: It's a fantasy novel.Customer: Well! Talking about killing gods! (flounces off)Me: (sigh...)...and you get a book that while I was able to finish it, I didn't enjoy it. At all.Seriously, they even have the White Wizard on a White Horse, convincing the people who are known for their Awesome Horses to fight back against The Bad Guy (who is soooooo emo and not at all sympathetic or A Good Guy), the King of Men taking his throne and wedding The Elf Chick, while his sidekick dies to buy time for The Bearer (of a clay vial and not a ring) and his companion to get down to the bowels of The Bad Guy's Fortress and enable the death of The Bad Guy by falling into a pit of lava.I am not kidding."},{"Title":"Power, Politics, and Crime","review":"The author was my undergraduate advisor and he literally changed the course of my life. Everyone who reads this book is affected in a similar way. While the statistics are solid and powerful, the book is accessible to everyone on every level. Someone who has no previous exposure to the American criminal justice system can easily gain a large knowledge base while criminal justice scholars will find the book to be a powerful summary of much that is wrong with the current system and its function (or, more accurately, disfunction) within society. From the motives that drive government officials and police officers to the effects that labeling individuals as criminals at a young age to the amount of tax dollars spent and manipulated every year by the government and government-funded agencies, the book clearly and effectively drives home the point that each and every individual in this country is, in one way or another, a victim of the &quot;War on Crime.&quot; The book is not preachy and does not make the reader feel as if they are being lectured but rather opens the reader's eyes as a view of the bigger picture inevitably hits home. Regardless of whether you consider yourself liberal, conservative, or just plain politically apathetic, reading this book will lead you to immediately develop an acute awareness that the American battle plan in the &quot;war on crime&quot; cannot prevail. The book thoughtfully and entertainingly compiles fact and truth in the form of statistics, research, and illustrative anecdotes in order to expose the real enemies in the war on crime. The American public is frequently made to believe that when it comes to our country's well-being, it's &quot;us&quot; against &quot;them.&quot; I think Chambliss would agree with that; however, in every war, those standing on the battlefield where weapons have been drawn must choose a side and Chambliss makes clear that many people have unknowingly been given misleading ideas about who the &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; are.Simply stated, the effect of the book is to place every reader within the plot of a classic children's story. Too many have lived for too long with the fear that the sky is falling, not realizing that all are actually being cleverly lured into Foxy Loxy's den.If everyone in this country were required to read this book, America would be a better place."},{"Title":"Pap's place: A two-act play about family and change (A Lillenas drama resource)","review":"I am the director of The Harvest Players, the drama department of Garden Valley Church in Kelowna Canada.

Where it referenced indians and chiefs you could substitute scouts and patrol leaders. Much of the information is good camping and outdoor woodskills related, with a smattering of indian lore. Many of the illustrations look like they are directly out of a boy scout manual. If you are interested in a real authentic look at native american life and activities, you will not want this book.

This is the first and only Perry Mason story I have read. I've heard that the tone of these earlier works are a little 'tougher' than the stories written in the following decades. The first half of the book certainly follows the hard-boiled tradition, as Mason acts a more like a private dick than a lawyer. But a lawyer he is, and the second half settles into a court-room drama. What does Perry Mason have up his sleeve that will rescue a young lady and her new husband from charges of murdering her uncle to ensure her inheritance?An enjoyable, light read, although Gardner's writing is a little pedestrian and the build-up to the court case is a little long, with the trial itself resolved a little perfunctorily."},{"Title":"The Case of the Sulky Girl (Pocket Book)","review":"Frances was accustomed to doing things her way. However, under the terms of her father's spendthrift trust, she was powerless to marry until age 25 unless she risked being cut out completely. She retained Perry Mason to break the will, despite it's iron-clad terms which gave her uncle absolute power over the fortune in the trust.The will did leave a loophole - if her uncle died before the terms expired, Frances would get the money absolutely. So it was completely in her favor when Frances's uncle was murdered - until she found herself as the prime suspect.This was Mason's first recorded trial, though not the first book (The Case of the Velvet Claws was the first, and had no trial scene). He handles it expertly, but it all comes down to a typical Perry Mason trick to confuse a witness. It works, but not as well as some of his later works."},{"Title":"The Case of the Sulky Girl (Pocket Book)","review":"When an actor so well defines a character, it's easy to forget the character predated him. Such is the case with Raymond Burr and Perry Mason. Before Perry Mason came to television, the character was in Erle Stanley Gardener's novels and in six movies.In their adaptations of Perry Mason for the radio, the Colonial Radio Theatre on the Air seeks to faithfully recreate the novels from the 1930s rather than the Television program. The first to be released is Perry Mason and the Case of the Sulky Girl.A 23-year old spoiled rich heiress (Kimberly McCord) whose father left everything to her and put it in a spendthrift trust managed by her tightwad Uncle and with a prohibition on marrying before turns to Perry Mason (Jerry Robbins) to get help breaking the trust. Mason suspects that she's not telling him everything and learns she's been secretly married which could give her uncle reason to cut off the trust immediately and leave her with only $5,000. Without telling the uncle about the marriage, Perry tries to reason with him but to no avail.Then, that same night, the uncle is murdered and his client lies to him and the police, giving her a false alibi. His client is charged with murder, along with her secret husband. Mason has to prove she's innocent and find what really happened.This was a very good murder mystery with a lot of twists and a focus that rested almost completely on Mason, who was in nearly every scene.The story is well-paced and a bit more hard boiled than Burr's portrayal. This Perry Mason does bend the rules, having his client fake a nervous breakdown to send her to a sanitarium, so he can have time to plan. His client also stupidly took $38,000 off of her uncle's body to pay off a blackmailing and to give Perry a retainer. Mason stuffs the $10,000 retainer in an envelope and mails it to a fictitious address.However, Mason is in a tough game against lawyers who are very seedy. The murderer makes a clumsy effort to frame a chauffeur who was passed out drunk by planting $2,000 on him. The chauffeur's lawyer offers to get his client to plead guilty to manslaughter--in exchange for a $50,000 fee. Rather than the ethical Hamilton Burger (who would not be introduced for four more novels), Mason draws the crookedest prosecutor around.Against such odds, Robbins' Mason is tough and smart, as he tries to represent the interests of his client. Robbins' is supported by a solid cast, McCord in particular does a great job as the bratty heiress. The Courtroom scenes are slightly stiff by everyone but Mason, but I think this was to create a sense of realism."},{"Title":"Revenge of the Manitou","review":"\\"Revenge of the Manitou\\" is what I wishThe Manitouhad been. I was not particularly fond of the first one, finding that it went in a ridiculous direction, especially in regard to how the characters planned on defeating the evil medicine man. I thought the battle between the medicine men in this sequel made more sense (but I don't want to give too much away). I didn't find myself rolling my eyes and thinking that the author went too far into the absurd while reading this one, which did happen when I read the first.My only complaint is that the Harry Erskine character is too much of a wiseguy at times, cracking jokes as if he's in a stupid sitcom, and his jokes are never funny."},{"Title":"Revenge of the Manitou","review":"I always have some doubts about a second tome, usually not as good as the first one.However, Manitou II made exception.

Wodehouses's best books. Although he's never turned a tale anything but excellently, this is somehow more endearing than most. It starts out normal enough, with a man who just became an earl (Reginald, third Earl of Havershot) going off to Hollywood to save his alcoholic cousin from the deadly drink. He meets an actress by the name of April June, the very embodiment of virtue, on the way there-- or so he thinks. He also runs into his ex- finacee, whose engagement to him he bungled by way of a little accident with a cigar. After some very cold ice cream, he needs to have a tooth pulled. In the dentist's waiting room he meets little Joey Cooley, the child actor, Idol of American Motherhood, who will be undergoing the same torture as him. Well, both souls get administered some laughing gas, and this gives them the ability to be masters of the art of astral projection. But the thing is, little mischevious Joey puts his soul into Reggie's body, rather then his own. Reggie then has no choice but to inhabit the body of the child star with the golden curls. Now we've got a dilemma. See, Joey wants to poke everyone in the snout, and in Reggie's body, now has the strength to do so with optimum results. Uh-oh. And now Reggie is left with the mind of a grown man, but the mean Miss Brinkmeyer (the &quot;tall, rangy, light-heavyweight, severe of aspect' woman with whom he shares a mutal hatred...animus is in the air) and all other of Cooley's keepers, who treat him like the eleven-year-old child they think he is. Double uh-oh.This book is one of the funniest things I've ever read, not only because Wodehouse is a master of the English language and shows such a conatagious affection for it, but because it's a very zany tale that never fails to make you laugh and keep a smile on your face all day. There are so many more hilarious moments in this book, and not a page goes by without a good, hearty chuckle. I would highly recommend this book and all of Wodehouse's books, for that matter."},{"Title":"Laughing Gas","review":"Wodehouse's usual skill with the turn of phrase and the unlikely situation makes this book a delight. It's atypical of his work in that it contains a fantastic element: a grown man and a bratty child, visiting a dentist at the same time, accidentally have their souls switched while under the ether."},{"Title":"Laughing Gas","review":"This review is more for people who've already read a few of Wodehouse's stories, particularly the Bertie Wooster-Jeeves stories, than people who haven't. I'm a fan of PG Wodehouse (though I'm relatively new and no question I've read less of his than other reviewers here) and I liked this one all right and can recommend it if you haven't got much else at hand, but I must say I didn't think it was that great and didn't find myself laughing much. The switched identities plot element may seem promising in theory, but it wasn't all that amusing as it developed; it was mainly good for some slapstick-style humor, really, and in fact the plot on the macro level, so to speak, is fairly predictable in many ways, as you could say of the plot in many of his stories. On the other hand, one aspect where his stories excel, and this one produces some good moments, is in nicely set-up situation comedy-type scenes, where the civilities or complications or just plain screw-ups are pretty good fun. Here for example there's a first-rate scene where Reggie meets his ex-fiancee. Also, Reggie or Lord Havershot is an endearing character in the mold of Bertie Wooster--civil, courteous, basically good-hearted, rising to aristocratic disdain at times; with a tasteful eye; but hapless, quite fallible, and often dense. This all makes for what are, for me anyway, the real highlights of the novel: the sometimes hilarious commentary that Reggie as narrator makes on things as they happen. For example when he says, of a sarcastic remark by his ex-fiancee regarding his new flame, \\"I chose to disregard the vulgar comment\\", or when he touts his own \\"generalship\\" in dealing with an awkward situation, these are such finely comical comments (at the same time prideful, correct, yet feckless and somehow, in some elusive way, disproportionate), in the same way as Bertie Wooster's commentary along the lines of \\"I gave him an icy stare--and I meant it to sting.\\" In that sense I find this novel engaging in the same way as the Bertie Wooster-Jeeves stories, where the Blandings or Psmith stories or other pieces that don't have 1st-person narration aren't quite as entertaining.So, the book is good for some delightful moments, but I don't think I'd put it near the top of my Wodehouse reading list. Among the ones I've read, I liked the following in roughly this order: 1. Code of the Woosters (the 1st one I read--maybe I'm partial to it for this reason like other people may be partial to Laughing Gas). 2~4. Joy in the Morning; Right Ho Jeeves; and Very Good Jeeves (much of it is not that great but it contains one of the funniest stories I've ever read.) 5~8. Something New; Leave it to Psmith; Blandings Castle; Heart of a Goof. 9~10. Quick Service; Mulliner Nights. This novel falls somewhere in the middle of that range, though of course I've enjoyed more or less every one of these stories."},{"Title":"Laughing Gas","review":"Laughing Gas was the first Wodehouse I ever read. I knew his work through some Jeeves tales (and their TV adaptations), but I had never ventured outside of those characters. Seeing that the storyline was somewhat like the Freaky Friday genre of films, I wanted to see what Wodehouse would do with this already familiar plot. I was not disappointed and I have gone back to him whenever I wanted something to make me laugh--as long as it's not an audiobook read by Jonathan Cecil!Reginald, Third Earl of Havershot (gotta love those Wodehouse puns) finds himself in the dentist's chair after an embarrassing incident seated next to child star Joey Cooley (&quot;Idol of American Motherhood&quot;), going through the same procedure. After the administration of some of the titular anesthetic, the two have an out-of-body experience. The mischievous Cooley, however, instead of returning to his own corporeal form, slips into Reggie's, leaving our hero left with the tot's as his only choice. Hilarity ensues, as they say, as little Joey likes to go around punching people in the nose and continues to do so under the guise of Reggie. Meanwhile Reggie is party to the stories going around about &quot;his&quot; behavior and is powerless to stop them while in his current pint-sized form.Wodehouse takes this in all of the expected directions and invents a few new ones, to boot, making Laughing Gas one of his best novels. Well, one of the best I've read, anyway."},{"Title":"Laughing Gas","review":"Several years ago, I asked the most well-read man I knew to recommend an author who was consistently funny and wrote light-hearted books. He recommended P.G. Wodehouse immediately, and I'm so glad he did.In Laughing Gas, Reginald, third Earl of Havershot, and Hollywood's reigning child idol, Joey Cooley, switch bodies while under the influence of laughing gas during simultaneous dental procedures. Hilarity ensues, and I mean that quite literally. It really is a laugh-out-loud funny book.The plot careens and swerves through lots of crazy coincidences, farcical situations, and unlikely encounters. But you don't keep reading to see what will happen next. The plot isn't the driving force with Wodehouse. Instead, what keeps the reader turning pages is the sheer joy of finding out what wonderful saying or hilarious conversation will come along next. The unexpected use of language is one of the charms of Laughing Gas. I opened the book at random just now and came across this little gem: \\"I didn't get his drift, and said so. He continued snowing.\\" The book is full of little treasures like that.Another thing I enjoyed about Laughing Gas is the lack of cynicism in the characters. A lot of comedy has a snarky side, which is fine with me for the most part, but the refreshing sincerity of Reggie Havershot and the rest of the fictional folk in Laughing Gas is a nice change of pace. Wodehouse really knows how to write a likeable everyman, even if that everyman might be a little slow on the uptake at times. Even the worst behaved characters probably won't get up to anything worse than \\"throwing soft-boiled eggs at the electric fan in the better class of restaurant.\\" It's a fun story, and I'd recommend it to anyone who needs a good laugh."},{"Title":"Laughing Gas","review":"\\"Laughing Gas\\" is a rather appropriate title for a work by P.G. Wodehouse, since most, if not all, of his novels and short stories will have readers laughing out loud. This delightful romp set in 1930s Hollywood is no different, although not quite on par with some of his other works. Perhaps it is because the plot revolves around an entirely implausible event or perhaps it winds up being far more sentimental than comic - not necessarily a bad thing.Reggie Havershot, just recently named the third Earl of Havershot, is dispatched to Hollywood to locate his lush of a cousin and to prevent him from a malignant marriage. On the train there, Reggie meets and falls in love with the beautiful actress, April June, who seems just as eager to return his attention - he is an earl after all, even if he has the face of a gorilla. Reggie cannot understand why others do not view April June with the same eyes that he does, but when a toothache stalls his romance, his real troubles begin. For while under the gas in the dentist's chair, Reggie's soul is swapped with that of Joey Cooley, the spoiled child star of the moment. Imagine Reggie's disbelief when he awakens in the young tyke's body and discovers the demands of a child actor's life. Imagine his further chagrin when Joey Cooley, now installed in his body, seems to have no desire to switch places and has taken it upon himself to carry out some wish fulfillment fantasies now that he is a grown up. How can this matter be righted without both characters ruining the life of the other? In Wodehouse there is a way.\\"Laughing Gas\\" is a delightful comic read that never stalls, but rushes headlong through various schemes and nefarious plots as Reggie comes to terms with his new life, learning just what a pill the true possessor of this young body is and just how much one can yearn for the simple things in life once they are denied him. This novel requires a great suspension of disbelief but it is freely given. Even with such a fanciful premise, readers will gladly accept a story that revolves around soul swaps. Anything is possible in Hollywood after all."},{"Title":"Laughing Gas","review":"This small book, 286 pages, is very very funny. It comes to us from one of the greatest English Comic writers. P.G. Wodehouse is best known for the worlds he created for his characters in Blandings Castle and the Wooster--Jeeves duo. In this book, Laughing Gas, he took a simple story and used his characters to take it to level of comedy that is unusual. The approach and especially the language was funny, but it also crated a farce and in some ways could be seen to be offering some interesting social satire.The two key characters were, Joey Cooley, a child actor, and Reginald Havershot and English Earl. All the characters in the book not only complimented the comedy portrayed by Joey and Reggie but seemed to add to the farce because of their own uniqueness and role in story. The idea of swapping souls has been a well tested plot over the years and at first you wonder how going back to this plot and story, told my an author born in the late 1800's, could bring anything original or interesting to this idea. Both Reggie and Joey were at the dentist and both went under laughing gas at the same time. We were told that they somehow slipped out of their bodies in the fourth dimension and swapped. At first just a dated approach to this idea soon proved that it didn't matter and indeed was different because it was dated. It was just funny page after page. The answer lies in the characters themselves. Reggie's English approach to life in Hollywood was one where he had to survive for a few days in Joey's little, and very different, body. It is from Reggie's perception from within his own body and also during the time he was in the child's body, that we mostly see this storyThe story was told with an English accent, in a time and place that does not really exist anymore. Both Joey and Reggie by them selves were funny but it was the plot that unfolded after the body switch that left you laughing out loud.I was not very familiar with P.G. Wpodehouse so for me the book was a fist close look. I was not disappointed and may be hooked."},{"Title":"Laughing Gas","review":"I'm a huge Wodehouse fan, grew up reading him, but I have to say that this particular book is more pedestrian than most of his work. The premise of two consciousness switching corporeal forms is a time-tested plot device, and here it's dressed up with the screwball antics and snappy language one expects from Wodehouse. The gist of it is that the newly minted Earl of Havershot heads off to America to rescue his alcoholic cousin Reggie from the perils of Hollywood dames and booze. Being a very traditional Wodehouse hero (average looking, kind hearted, more or less hapless, and somewhat dense), he manages to become besotted by a vapid movie starlet. Alas, soon after his arrival in Hollywood, he suffers a severe toothache and visits a dentist, resulting the application of the titular vapors.Whilst under the influence, his consciousness gets swapped with that of Joey Cooley, a bratty little child movie star who is having a tooth pulled in the office next door. Wacky antics ensue, as the Earl must succumb to the strict regime of the movie star under contract, including a wholly unpleasant diet, and a packed schedule of publicity appearances. As it happens, his former fiancee is on the scene as a press agent, as is his bon vivant cousin. From then on, wacky antics ensue, as the Earl learns the true colors of his movie star love, realizes the fine qualities of his ex, and of course everything ties up rather neatly at the end. Along the way, Wodehouse is given licence to draw upon his own experiences to poke very mild fun at life in Hollywood. The book feels somewhat rote, probably because it's such a familiar premise, and it reads as if someone took it and applied a Wodehouse-wash to it, and then set it out to dry. My favorite part is actually the very beginning, where the Earl sits in the Drones Club attempting to start telling his wild story. All in all, it's Wodehouse, so of course it's worth reading, but most of his output is much better."},{"Title":"Laughing Gas","review":"This was my introduction to Wodehouse, and I'm sure I'll come back for more. Clever and witty, the book about the soul switching between an English aristocrat, and a bratty Hollywood child star is something straight out of the movie world it pokes fun at.Wodehouse throws in plenty of funny and colorful characters while tying up plot points in neat little bows by the end.It should also be mentioned that the newly designed editions by Overlook Press are beautiful, compact, and a must have for collectors."},{"Title":"Laughing Gas","review":"What a treat Laughing Gas is to read! A great Wodehouse story and wonderful word play by the master. There is not a day that goes by that makes me wish I had met PG or Plum as he was known. I wonder if he was as masterful with language in person as he was with the written word? No matter, we have his over 100 books and Gas is one of those I like best. I love them all, but here is a few that you might also like to read:Jill The Reckless: A British Humor ClassicLeave It To Psmith: A British Humor ClassicLove Among The Chickens: A British Humor ClassicPsmith In The City: A British Humor ClassicMy Man Jeeves: A British Humor ClassicKeep reading - hope to see you at Blandings soon!"},{"Title":"Laughing Gas","review":"Having heard a lot about Wodehousian humour and wit, I was quite disappointed when I read a few of the Jeeves-Wooster series. Maybe it was the anticipation of reading 'unparalled humour and writing style' that let me down.But recently when I picked up an old copy of \\"Laughing Gas\\" and read it on a long flight, my neighbours on the plane kept on wondering what was wrong with me - I would burst into uncontrollable giggles at almost every second page. The book was actually like Laughing Gas (sorry, couldn't resist the obvious pun).The story revolves around an Earl (from England naturellement) who travels to America to rescue a 'wayword cousin' who has fallen for a starlet in Hollywood. But while on a visit to a dentist, the Earl exchanges bodies with that of a child-superstar Joey Cooley. The resultant confusion is simply humourous (though at times bordering on the slapstick).What keeps the reader engrossed is not the plot (which was probably ingenious when the book was written but not anymore) but the authors ability to churn out puns and one-liners that has the readers in splits. The ending unfortunately is quite Shakespearean with suddenly everything falling into place conveniently (the good-old \\"all's well that ends well\\").My belief in Wodehousian humour remained intact (if not stronger) after reading this book."},{"Title":"Laughing Gas","review":"Did not received product as shown in picture.The book I did receive was good some pencil marks."},{"Title":"Laughing Gas","review":"The super-hero kid, and the troubled young man, and the switch of 'souls' and identities! Only Wodehouse could have made this improbable plot seem larger than life, and as funny as the gas under whose effect the souls 'switched'. The kidnapping at the end, and the imminently satisfactory way in which all loose ends are tied are truly Wodehousian in perfection."},{"Title":"Am I Old Yet?: A True Story of a Timeless Friendship","review":"I was buying this book for a dear friend and decided to read it first before giving it to her. This book was such a quick read.I could'nt seem to put it down. It was light hearted and funny at times and deep and introspective at others. This is a great book about friendship and how it affects our lives.I really enjoyed this book. At times I was laughing out loud.I know my best friend will enjoy it too."},{"Title":"The Quotable Founding Fathers: A Treasury of 2,500 Wise and Witty Quotations from the Men and Women Who Created America","review":"Of course, it would be silly for me to write a review of the quotes themselves in this book, but the sheer volume of material warrants this book 5 stars. Moreover, the quotes are sub-indexed by category (education, greed...etc.) which allows for easier access to speech writing and quoting. A welcome addition to my collection of early American History references."},{"Title":"The Quotable Founding Fathers: A Treasury of 2,500 Wise and Witty Quotations from the Men and Women Who Created America","review":"I love quotes but can never remember them. I bought this book just for fun, edification and because I enjoyed the Mark Twain quotation book I bought a while back. The quotes actually for the most part give you food for thought. You can ponder over various quotation in this delightful book."},{"Title":"The Quotable Founding Fathers: A Treasury of 2,500 Wise and Witty Quotations from the Men and Women Who Created America","review":"As a living history actor I enjoy having as much little pieces of information to go with the larger picture of my character and the time.

This map is rich with ground-level detail and easy-on-the-eyes readability, while still offering sharp shaded relief and a real sense of the terrain, even for those who aren't practiced in reading contours.One of these days I'll invest in some snow shoes and use this map for the hut system in the area, but for now I'm doing some good summer hikes in the Holy Cross. I highly recommend this map, especially over its Trails Illustrated competitor(s). Though I'd never discourage serious navigators from supplementing this up-to-date map with a USGS quad, the UTM grid is very easy to use at this scale, so an experienced GPS user should be able to eyeball their position readily enough."},{"Title":"Summit, Vail & Holy Cross Trail Map 4th Edition","review":"This map, like all the skyterrain maps I've seen, is simply outstanding. It *so* clearly presents the big picture for roads and overall terrain, as well as the \\"important details\\" on topography, hiking trails, and water-ways. And the map is amazingly readable - even for those of us in our forties with failing near vision. Extras include various charts, overhead views and selected trail details. The waterproof material is quite handy too. No CO mountain hiker should be without one."},{"Title":"One Hundred Sex Scenes that Changed Cinema","review":"this book gives a great overview for the non-film buff for it's subject matter. It focuses primaril on meaningful or metaphoric narratives exsisting within each film and it's relationship to sexuality, not the sex scene specifically."},{"Title":"John Paul II and the Legacy of","review":"I give this book high praise simply for being more honest than most in the Catholic world today. First because the author creates a conceptual schema of \\"Three Moments\\" in the interpretation of the the document Dignitatis Humanae. Please note that this very heuristic suggests an evolution or change. This is precisely the point that is denied by many Catholic quasi-intellectuals. This is grounded in the notions he develops at the outset that the Church earlier had fought against the acceptance of religious liberty, for centuries. In other words, to put a more specific gloss on it, the Thomistic view which some Catholic scholars would like to think was a bolster to religious liberty historically, in fact was not. To believe so is an historical absurdity. To assert that is the sheerest lie. But the best part in the book is the simple notion that what Pope John Paul did to the Church was characterized broadly by a \\"Mistrust of Secular Pluralism\\". Does not that give away the store already???? Ambitious Catholics like Robert George and Rick Garnett can pretend that the Church's view, as evolved by John Paul and now continued wby Pope Benedict, is co-extensive with notions of real pluralism in a democratic secular society. And Mr. Garnett, of Notre Dame, is even threatening to publish a book on the topic, which would be a scholarly travesty prima facie. . But this book's very heuristic tells a more honest tale. Collaterally it could be used to show , at the very least by that heuristic, that attempts to define \\"secularism\\" in light of the Church's Thomistic blandishments is just a sleight-of-hand, and very dishonest one too. It is intellectually and morally inconsistent. What is actually happening instead in the Roman Church is that they don't spend their time trying to understand their own position in the world. Rather they try to shake-down society by wan threatening of lawsuits against purveyors of information to try to protect the limited respectability they have left, and not scare off potential donors. Very disappointing. It is not worthy of their tradition, to say the least. How do they sleep at night. They must be utterly unhappy people."},{"Title":"The Hunters: Two Short Novels","review":"and especially so in Claire Messud's case when &quot;The Last Life&quot; was so deliciously rendered, so unforgettably film like and full of nostalgia without ever being sentimental. In contrast, I found these novellas too tight and with too little room for the reader to daydream on them. But this is highly subjective. I read one professional review that praised the first, damned the second work--there are 2 novellas here. Another reviewer, highly respected saw it just the other way around. But for myself, I missed the last novel and felt these experimental works may lead to a greater next novel, not another novella, which I do not believe is Ms. Messud's best genre."},{"Title":"The Hunters: Two Short Novels","review":"Claire Messud's THE HUNTED is surprising work, and what most surprises is that this young writer has mastered a demanding literary form, the nouvella. In &quot;A Simple Tale&quot; she enters the mind of a World War II survivor of Hitler's labor camps and traces this woman's consciousness from youth to her older years as a Toronto cleaning woman. All of the characters in this nouvella are fully fleshed out and thoroughly interesting. &quot;The Hunters&quot; is set in contemporary London and deals with the psychology of fear and suggestibility. To say that it is a contemporary take on James'&quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; is to suggest its creepiness and fascination. not to dismiss the nouvella as trite hommage. The book is a double dose of adventurous thinking and accomplished writing from a writer who has found her voice at a very young age. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Hunters: Two Short Novels","review":"Wonderful introduction to an author who will surely make her mark in contemporary literature. Messud utilizes the pen to paper as would a painter use their brush to a canvas. In both short novels----or novellas, Messud engages the reader into the full depth of a story in the shortness of 100 pages each. Unlike other reviewers, I was not prejudiced by having read The Last Life first and so disappointed with these stories. (although it sits next to me as I write because I can't wait to see more of her work). In A Simple Plan, we learn the whole life of Maria to who and what she has become today from her plight as a child. The Hunters story immediately strikes the reader without ever revealing the gender of the first person narrative. The most engaging part of both of these stories is that the language makes them come alive, almost dance off the page. I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading more of her work."},{"Title":"The Hunters: Two Short Novels","review":"The ***** is for A Simple Life, which is not simple at all, but rich and complex and almost unbearably painful in parts. The details in this novella are beautiful in their symbolism - for example, the plastic on the furniture, whereby Maria strives to preserve the past. Although they are quite different, I think of Ozu."},{"Title":"The Hunters: Two Short Novels","review":"Like some of the other reviewers, I read the The Last Life first and loved it. I also intend to read The Emporer's Children. These two novellas were well (meaning artistically) written. Bad writing was not the problem here at all. These stories are much more about character and mood than plot action, if someone is looking for a story that moves, they won't care for this book. However, in the first story, Messud really succeeds in making her main character, Maria, realistic. I found myself thinking that we as the readers are probably the only people who really know her. Much of the story is depressing, but ends on a hopeful note. The second story works the theme of the hunters and hunted well in many ways, but I found it just too weird. There are (maybe purposely) a lot of unanswered questions. I didn't care for it, although again this was not because of poor writing. One thing I did notice was that the narrator, as well as his friend Richard Copley, are supposed to be Americans, but don't talk like any Americans I have ever heard. I'd give this book a 50-50."},{"Title":"The Hunters: Two Short Novels","review":"Not as good as &quot;The Last Life&quot;, which is so far Claire Messud's masterpiece. I love her fuid, romantic language that effortlessly transports you to her worlds, and it works well in these two novellas; however, there is an emotional hole in these stories that was not present in her other work. I did not feel a connection to any of the characters as I did in her previous full-length books and I don't know if it's because the stories did not have a middle &quot;arc&quot; or perhaps Messud is at her best when she is allowed to draw her characters out over several chapters. I enjoyed the stories for what they were but they left no lasting impression on me the way Sagesse from &quot;Last Life&quot; did, nor did they offer any new observations on the human psyche that she hasn't already explored. Still, even Messud's disappointments are never fully &quot;disappointing&quot; and I would recommend this book for a satisfying weekend read."},{"Title":"The Hunters: Two Short Novels","review":"Two novellas in one book. The first, \\"A Simple Tale,\\" was my favorite. (That's the thing with more than one story in a book, there will always be disagreement about which is best...but it does help illustrate the mercurial nature of book reviews in general!)A Simple Tale is a beautifully rendered, elegant and poignant tale of a Toronto housemaid's life, examined primarily through her relationships with an elderly woman she cleans for and her son's family, as well as flashbacks to her youth as an Eastern European refugee (\\"DP\\"). Messud portrays how Maria Poniatowski speaks, acts, and interprets others, and allows the reader to see how people -- who cannot possibly understand her history -- relate and react to her. Messud never misses in her portrayals and she spikees them; whether it's the affected wealthy woman calling Maria \\"gel\\" and tootling \\"rig a jig jig! presto! voila!\\" -- the dogs of another employer \\"whose chronic, vindictive ill temper created a great need for cleaning,\\" or Maria's daughter-in-law (who polishes off \\"an entire mixed-meats sub and three glazed crullers, along with a bottle of Carlsberg for which she did not bother with a glass..\\"), this psychologically sophisticated, semi-comic tragedy gives the reader an extremely interesting and well-resolved look into her character's reality.The Hunters is a more experimental novella, in that we do not know the gender of the narrator and the ending of the novel - the \\"whodunnit,\\" for someone is killed - is unresolved. Someone has rented an apartment in a not-very-fashionable section of London for its cheerful interior and telescopic view of the neighboring buildings. The narrator begins to interpret what s/he sees, and the reader is left to decide on the degree the narrator is \\"reliable.\\" It is a frightening story, because of the way the narrator objectifies and dislikes a particular neighbor: is she truly that objectionable? This is another story that examines insider/outsider, the misunderstandings that occur from differing realities, in Messud's well-crafted prose."},{"Title":"The Hunters: Two Short Novels","review":"Wow! This is Good Stuff. If books were dessert, this would be one where you savor each bite. Then you would be tempted to ask for seconds and guess what? The author has already generously provided! It would be hard to say which is the better plate, the first or the second; both are rich without being weighty. I loved the intimate portraits of the people in the stories--the personal connection created by the eloquent disclosure of their thoughts. This is a book worthy of kicking off your shoes, curling up in a comfy chair and allowing yourself to be absorbed by."},{"Title":"The Hunters: Two Short Novels","review":"What happened? Her previous book, \\"The Last Life,\\" was terrific. The two short novels in this [price] book (big type, too) are awful.

Hope the author's next will return to her previous level of excellence."},{"Title":"No roses for Harry!","review":"Of all the Harry Books, this one is my fave. Harry, a white dog with black spots, gets a present from Grandma--a sweater with big roses all over it. He hates it. He gets laughed at when he wears it, so he tries losing it...several times. He is finally rid of the sweater in an imaginative plot sequence that involves a mother bird. It's a sequence that also spares Grandma's feelings, thank goodness! The story ends with Harry receiving a new sweater from Grandma, one he likes very much. It's a white sweater with black spots. The ending is no doubt a reason why the book is a favorite of mine. My two-year-old likes all the Harry Books. The stories contain wonderful twists of plot but are written in simple language. Also, there are only a couple of sentences on each page and the illustrations correspond beautifully to the text (a rare treat, given that the author was not the illustrator), so even though they are recommended for young schoolchildren, toddlers will be able to enjoy these books."},{"Title":"No roses for Harry!","review":"My 4 year old daughter loves reading this book by herself; she just can not get enough.

The Tedlock translation of 1985 added new information to the work of many distinguished predecessors, and made substantial parts of the narrative clear (or at least much clearer).The fact that a fairly extensively revised edition of this book was not only possible, but necessary, in 1996, a decade after its first publication, might have discouraged the publisher from continuing to call the new version \\"Definitive\\" on the cover. The title page more precisely calls it a Revised Edition of \\"Popol Vuh: The Mayan Book of the Dawn of Life ... with commentary based on the ancient knowledge of the modern Quiche Maya.\\" However, \\"Definitive\\" seems to be the marketing buzzword. But how would a third edition be described? (Dennis Tedlock has recently -- 2003 -- returned to the writings of the post-Conquest Maya aristocrats who actually produced the existing \\"Popol Vuh,\\" in \\"Rabinal Achi: A Mayan Drama of War and Sacrifice,\\" so it is clear that his work in the area continues.)In fact, the work of Dennis and Barbara Tedlock with living Quiche Maya ritualists (priests / diviners / shamans), which, in the first edition, added so much to understanding this early post-Conquest text, was part of a larger expansion of Maya studies, including a more complete decipherment of ancient inscriptions, and greatly improved studies of Maya art. It is now possible to recognize events, and even characters, of the \\"Popol Vuh\\" in art centuries older, and their prototypes a millennium earlier. Meso-American cultures have been re-analyzed, and lost details recovered, as part of a major, and very rapid, shift in understanding.As an example: a large part of the story of \\"Popol Vuh\\" involves games played in ball-courts, in this world and the world of the dead; a major collection of papers on this theme, in Mayan and other cultures, \\"The Mesoamerican Ballgame,\\" was based on a conference held the same year the first edition of Tedlock's translation appeared (Scarborough and Wilcox, 1991).Another change was the adoption of a new official system for writing Mayan languages in the Roman alphabet, one devised, for the first time, by native speakers of the various languages. This adds considerably to etymological and grammatical precision, but enormously complicates recognizing words and names in older systems. (Anyone familiar with the juggling of Wade-Giles and Pinyin transliterations of Chinese will be only too familiar with the kind of adjustment process for ordinary readers.)Tedlock has attempted, with considerable success, to incorporate this new information, and the new transcription system, into the old structure of the book. In the process, besides adding fascinating illustrations and fine-tuning the translation, he has restructured the introduction and notes. Some interesting personal observations are gone, or greatly reduced. References to older literature, often with Tedlock's reconsiderations, have generally been replaced by citations of more recent studies. Once debatable points have been given firm answers, and new questions have been raised. Some material which, at a first glance, I assumed to be missing, turned out, on close examination (with copies of both editions open in front of me, and the help of a lot of post-it flags), to have been broken up or consolidated in different contexts. In a few places, however, the strain shows, as a once-clear line of argument is disrupted. The sheer complication of the material explicated, in which social, cosmic / astronomical, and agricultural references are constantly intertwined, probably made this inevitable.Archeological and epigraphic material has somewhat eclipsed in prominence the modern Maya contribution to this edition, although for fuller information it was always necessary to turn to Barbara Tedlock's \\"Time and the Highland Maya.\\"Among more recent publications of considerable value for understanding the mythological and astronomical material, Susan Milbrath's \\"Star Gods of the Maya: Astronomy in Art, Folklore, and Calendars\\" (1999) is exhausting, but I found it particularly illuminating. A series of books of which the late Linda Schele was co-author or co-editor (The Blood of Kings,\\" 1986; \\"The Forest of Kings,\\" 1990; \\"Maya Cosmos: Three Thousand Years on the Shaman's Path,\\" 1993; and \\"The Code of Kings,\\" 1999) are more popular in style, and very rewarding; unfortunately, like everything else in Mayan studies, they have dated very quickly, and the reader should always keep the date of publication in mind. Technical studies -- linguistic, epigraphic, archeological, art-historical -- are now abundant, but also harder for me to judge."},{"Title":"Popol Vuh: The Definitive Edition of The Mayan Book of The Dawn of Life and The Glories of Gods and Kings","review":"There's something here for the serious student of Mesoamerican culture, the historian, and those who just like mythology. Rather than relying solely on academic translations, Tedlock has employed the services of native speakers of the Quiche Mayan language to give not only the words, but the *feel* of the stories. The first section is a synopsis of the people and events in the Popol Vuh itself from the time of the &quot;creation&quot; all the way to the coming of the Conquistadores, but rather than detracting from the story itself (as such synopses all-too-often do), it adds depth and understanding. I would have appreciated seeing more of the original glyphs, as well as the original forms of many of the names (which have been translated whenever possible), but this is a very minor quibble. Overall, highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Popol Vuh: The Definitive Edition of The Mayan Book of The Dawn of Life and The Glories of Gods and Kings","review":"The Maya did not divide their everyday lives and religion. In fact, they didn't have a religion in our sense at all. Their everyday lives were bound up in visions, stories of the heavens, earth, past, and future that were not separate from the reality of their everyday experience. This book, the \\"Popol Vuh\\" means Council Book. That is, it is a book for the Lords to consult. One of its other titles is \\"The Light That Came From Beside the Sea\\". It is a document of the Quiche Maya who lived (and still live) in a portion of what is present day Guatemala.The \\"Popol Vuh\\" tells the essential myth of the ball game and the hero twins. Its story is far too involved and strange to try and explain it in this review. The story explains things about the Sun, Moon, and Venus in their play across the heavens. It prepares the living for what awaits them in Xibalba (the awful place below the earth). And there is constant gratitude for the knowledge of the creation of men from maize and the light of understanding this book brings them. The various sacred places of mountains, caves, and of ritual sacrifice are all here and powerfully expressed.Dennis Tedlock translated the text into clear and very readable English. However, that is not sufficient for the uninitiated to understand. So, Tedlock provides us with an introductory essay to help us understand the context of these stories. At the back he also provides notes on the text arranged by page number, a glossary of terms (which we desperately need to read the book), a wonderful bibliography for further reading, and an index.Now, a couple of things to keep in mind when you read this book (and you should). This text has one written source, and it is written in the Mayan language with a Western alphabet. Also, this copy is post Conquest so there is no real way to know how the story was changed or influenced by the Christian stories that were also (forcibly) taught to the Maya, if at all. If you end up believing that this story is an intact retelling of the true Myth without Christian influences, there are some pretty strange and wonderful parallels. If you are uncomfortable with some of the parallels, then you will want to explain them away by claiming corruption by the Christian conquerors. Take your pick. No one really knows.Terrific edition of an important text that you can really enjoy reading and adding to your understanding of the world and the total range of the human experience."},{"Title":"Popol Vuh: The Definitive Edition of The Mayan Book of The Dawn of Life and The Glories of Gods and Kings","review":"If you are fascinated by the stories various peoples have told (and still tell) to explain who and why they are, this is essential reading. This Mayan genesis presents a new world, a new reality, peopled by heros, monkeys, and macaws, triumph and treachery. The translation will hold your attention, and the translator's notes on how the story happened to survive contribute to our understanding of this exotic and intriguing material."},{"Title":"Popol Vuh: The Definitive Edition of The Mayan Book of The Dawn of Life and The Glories of Gods and Kings","review":"Tedlock's translation is far more than a translation. Because the meaning of the Popol Vuh, he tells us, is situationally dependent (i.e., is likely to change depending on the context in which the reader approaches the text), Tedlock had to receive formal training as Mayan &quot;daykeeper&quot; (shamanistic reader of the Popol Vuh) before he approached the text. The results are amazing -- a depth of commentary and a tapestry of images that will require a dozen readings before I can begin to comprehend it, but intriguing enough that I bought a copy for my wife for Christmas as well. No folklorist should be without this work."},{"Title":"Popol Vuh: The Definitive Edition of The Mayan Book of The Dawn of Life and The Glories of Gods and Kings","review":"It is difficult to imagine a better version of the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; than this one. It is literary, it is scholarly, and it is well written - by a man who knows his subject. It provides incredible insight into the world of the ancient Maya and their modern descendents.If you're interested in Maya studies and you haven't read this book yet, then you haven't even gotten started. As time goes on it becomes more and more apparent that this book is our guide to understanding Maya iconography, and we are incredibly lucky to have a book like this available to us at all. To have such a well-done translation is almost too much to ask. Small wonder that other writers on the Maya simply cite this book as &quot;Tedlock&quot; - it's considered a foregone conclusion that you know which book is meant.Now if only somebody could come up with a good English version of the &quot;Chilam Balam.&quot; Are there any takers out there?"},{"Title":"Popol Vuh: The Definitive Edition of The Mayan Book of The Dawn of Life and The Glories of Gods and Kings","review":"I cannot heap enough praises on this book. Bravo!This book is an English edition of a transliteration into latin letters of the Popul Vuh: the sacred religious and wisdom text of the Maya. It was studied by Mayan leaders, and recited aloud to the people. Everyone knew the stories. In the original books, there were many glosses, anecdotes and images elaborating upon the text; and in this English edition, the author has provided us with just these same sorts of things, including beautiful mysterious Mayan art on nearly every page. I absolutely love Mayan civilization's artwork, architecture, script and it's greatest story; they appeal to me profoundly on a deep aesthetic level. Mayan civilization seemingly had so much mystery and excitement. They even had stadiums where thay watched sporting contests! This book opens up this whole civilization to us and allows us to get intimate with it. And, for those of us living in the Americas, this is the greatest work of literature of our greatest ancient civilization!!! It's human value is inestimable; and it still contains lots of wisdom for us, if we are willing to learn from it. It was the book of kings, and now it is ours!"},{"Title":"Popol Vuh: The Definitive Edition of The Mayan Book of The Dawn of Life and The Glories of Gods and Kings","review":"This prize-winning translation of the Popol Vuh, the Mayan Bible, is the best one ever published. The translator not only knows the language but he is also a participant in the culture. His other books, &quot;Days from a Dream Almanac&quot; (poetry) and &quot;Breath on the Mirror&quot; (short stories)show his deeply poetic understanding of the culture. Now he has a new translation &quot;Rabinal Achi,&quot; a Pre-Columbian Mayan play still performed today. These are mystical books that are also absolutely accurate."},{"Title":"Popol Vuh: The Definitive Edition of The Mayan Book of The Dawn of Life and The Glories of Gods and Kings","review":"We are offered an excellent translation of the classic Maya text. The imagery is vivid and memorable. The book transports us into the minds of ancients who created one of the most remarkable cultures on the planet."},{"Title":"Popol Vuh: The Definitive Edition of The Mayan Book of The Dawn of Life and The Glories of Gods and Kings","review":"For most readers, this could be a first introduction to the legends of the Maya. It is an excellent place to start, in my opinion. I also began here. Not being familiar with Maya languages or writing, I have less than zero idea if the translation is accurate, but it is no doubt poetic and beautiful, if more than a mite strange. It seems to me that the legends of other peoples, only dimly comprehended through veils of space and time, are bound to seem strange to us. What comes through is common humanity. Like many books in other parts of the world, the Popol Vuh was used for divinatory purposes as much as for simple reading. If you want to know about Judaism, would you read the Old Testament and figure you'd got it down ? Not likely. And for Islam, would you just read the Qur'an Sharif and feel satisfied ? No, you would need to read a lot of interpretation, a lot of history. The same will be true for the Popol Vuh. For those who are not experts, a lot of background knowledge is required. The Popol Vuh can be seen, to some degree, as a Bible of the Maya, or at least the Quich&eacute; Maya. I would say that reading this book will probably be unsatisfactory unless you have, or are going to get, a lot of background knowledge to go along with it.Tedlock's book kicks off with an introductory section which enables the newcomer to the Maya world to understand the cultural and historical import of what he/she is about to read. The reader then launches into the text itself, and can make use of the final part--almost 100 pages of notes and comments on the text. A glossary at the back explains dozens of terms that appear in the text. There are excellent line drawings, two maps, and even black and white photographs which connect modern times to ancient. The vast number of names of individuals, tribes, gods, and places is hard to digest. Only a few readers who are not students of Maya culture or mythology will be able to read the central text without considerable difficulty. OK, reading the Popol Vuh is not easy, but it tells the Maya version of creation and provides a guide to their visions of what the world is and should be. When we remember that European missionaries burned all but a few of the Maya books, we should cherish all the more this survival, written down in Roman letters in early colonial times and skillfully translated by Tedlock."},{"Title":"Popol Vuh: The Definitive Edition of The Mayan Book of The Dawn of Life and The Glories of Gods and Kings","review":"Book came exactly when it was supposed to. It's in excellent condition and was everything I expected it to be. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Popol Vuh: The Definitive Edition of The Mayan Book of The Dawn of Life and The Glories of Gods and Kings","review":"The Popol Vuh captures the Quiche people's myth and history in written form. Much was lost because of the European invasion, but a number of original sources remain. A few codexes survived the missionaries' gleeful destruction. More importantly, native speakers have carried the traditions forward, and are still able to place baffling terms correctly within the cultural context.Parts of this record call the Old Testament to mind. The narrative begins with a creation story, that gives humankind a place in relation to other beings of this world. Later sections recall the biblical \\"begats,\\" with their lengthy lists of who succeeded whom in patrilineal genealogies that seem to drag on endlessly. Other passages call to mind Norse stories of Loki or North American \\"trickster\\" myths. Some passages call Grimm's fairy tales to mind, with magic simply assumed in the tales. All, however, carry a bloodthirsty slant usually associated with the Aztecs. I still can't quite get my mind around the word \\"suckle\\" used to describe human sacrifice by cutting the beating heart from a living chest. Not to worry, though - more often than not, the victims of some terrible death just get up and play again, one way or another.Extensive introductory material and endnotes fill out a relatively thin (~135 page) translation, slightly padded with apt illustrations from original sources. As is my habit, I focussed on the original material most closely, so I can't say I've read the translator's addenda quite as carefully. The bits I noted, however, do a fair bit towards explaining or expanding on thr translation itself. I recommend this to anyone interested in world mythology, and especially to anyone interested in the culture of Pre-Columbian mesoamerica.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"Popol Vuh: The Definitive Edition of The Mayan Book of The Dawn of Life and The Glories of Gods and Kings","review":"Vastly inferior to the 1985 edition.

This book is a translation of their greatest religious document, the Popul Vuh, by a scholar named Dennis Tedlock, who has serious chops as a Maya historian and translator.The Popul Vuh discusses the world before there was Man, when the gods got together and created everything, and how they went about doing that. If you aren't familiar with Mayan mythology, this is a treat. The language of this book follows Mayan patterns, which are really different from, say, American patterns, and you know right away you're dealing with a markedly different world view, which is fun from time to time for a sense of perspective. There are stories about heroes who were born before Men were created (they were children of the gods) and how those heroes defeated monsters and prepared the world for the coming of people. Then the book goes on to the first humans who were created by the gods and what their lives were like, and from there on to famous leaders among a sub-tribe of Maya called the Quiche, who live in the mountains of Guatemala. The book thus covers thousands of years of mythical and legendary history and introduces you to a number of memorable characters. It reads like a set of adventure stories, and if you want to know how at least one tribe of accomplished Indians made sense of their world, this is a great introduction to the subject."},{"Title":"Popol Vuh: The Definitive Edition of The Mayan Book of The Dawn of Life and The Glories of Gods and Kings","review":"Knowing the creation stories of our tribal cultures is important to know.

I studied the Mizutanis' \\"Introduction to Modern Japanese\\" while I was living in Japan, so I was immersed as well using the book. I went there with no previous Japanese experience. There's pros and cons to that. I picked this up to help me learn Japanese.Some things about the book--A) It is a system that works. It works only *IF* you take the time to study it and learn the basic sentence patterns, you will learn Japanese. The book teaches basic sentence patterns, then begins substituting different nouns/verbs into those basic sentence patterns. This is huge, as sentence structure is very different from English. You have to learn these. Knock rote memorization for its limitations, but pattern repetition--whether in your own home learning English as throughout your childhood years or working on a tighter schedule with a Japanese book in your study--is the key to learning a language. This isn't the only way to learn language (compare immersion and experience), but repetition is the one used in this book. If you don't want to spend some amount of time--30 to 45 mins a day let's say practicing, then give up now and save your money.B) Get the audio tapes. I wish they had CDs now. These are invaluable. Don't get the book without the tapes. At first blush, the example Japanese you hear at the start of each chapter is too fast and difficult. The example frames the sentence patterns being taught in each chapter and gives them context. It also uses normal speed dialogue. This is very tough to follow at first. Get used to backing up and re-playing multiple times, BUT when you get it, you get it. You can pick out words, sentences, context when you hear them in real life.C) If you want to practice, rent movies with Japanese. Not all movie types are useful. Samurai films are out b/c they use old Japanese; compare to learning English via Shakespeare. Action anime films are off the island b/c the character lips don't move like a real person as they speak; another negative, they use a bunch of whacked out words b/c the storylines are so removed from reality. Slapstick comedy is probably not a good choice either. Movies with lots of slices of real life will seem slow, but...they give decent examples of real life dialog. \\"shall we dance\\" is an example. No monsters, aliens, or samurai, but if you go to Japan, probably you won't meet a monster, aliens, or samurai, but you might want to meet someone for okanomiyaki some day...I would give this product 5 stars if they had a CD/mp3 audio to go with the book."},{"Title":"An introduction to modern Japanese","review":"I used this book for a couple of weeks until my sensei changed the texts while I was in Japan.

Mrs. Fatio was born in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, where she displayed literary talent from the earliest age. By the 1920's, when she herself was only about 20 years old, she already was a best-selling novelist.Mrs. Fatio's affluent family began wintering in Palm Beach back when that resort was new. At the turn of the 20th Century, the Town of Palm Beach had been created, virtually whole cloth, by railroad and steel magnate Henry Flagler as an escape for the very rich.Subsequently, Eleanor would marry Maurice Fatio, a Swiss citizen who became a naturalized American. According to letters Eleanor wrote, and which the author includes in this book, theirs was a great love match. Maurice was one of a handful of architects responsible for that opulent look now associated with contemporary Palm Beach, a style which has been adopted widely in affluent American communities.Unquestionably, Eleanor and Maurice were accomplished and fascinating people. One of this book's greatest flaws is the sparcity of detail it offers; too often, his account is little more than a timeline of where they were and when. The author implies that the Fatio's surviving child gave him access to her mother's papers. At the least, it would have been nice if he would have reprinted the first chapter of one of Eleanor's bestsellers.Nonetheless, this biography is a fascinating peek at the genesis of Palm Beach through the eyes of two of the people who gave form to the modern town. Thus, it is worthwhile reading, though the ending in inescapably sad."},{"Title":"Eleanor of Palm Beach","review":"This book is a brief biography of American writer Eleanor Chase (1903-1944) and her husband Palm Beach architect Maurice Fatio (1897-1943).The book is based upon the correspondence and papers of Eleanor Chase, now held by her daughter.The strengths of the book are threefold: Eleanor's early mentoring by Robert Benchley and other members of the Algonquin Round Table, her quoted writing (particularly the witty poems she wrote for her children after her evenings out) and the early deaths of both Maurice and Eleanor. Quite frankly the rest of the book is extremely sparse. Their mature years, after Eleanor's early success had faded and Fatio was busy building houses, are uneventful in this telling.This book will serve as an introduction to their characters. Clearly these were interesting people with an interesting circle of friends.

Whittell's book is purely descriptive and an account of the places he visited, how he got there and the people he met. It is sorely lacking in observation and whatever little observations he comes up with are trite and tacky. Whittell seems to have a lack of understanding of the people, or chooses to be so. One gets a feeling that this book will fit right into a larger anthology on Whittell's life rather an attempt to make readers learn more and understand a region and its people. Whittell's account is a mediocre and half-hearted attempt to delve into the deeper issues facing Central Asia -- identity in the period after Soviet occupation. Central Asia has always been an interesting region for me, from the culture, history, to the location and the people. I would love to visit there sometime. The book is good for some information on the vast region, but otherwise less than average."},{"Title":"One Shot: A Thousand Holes","review":"I recently had the opportunity to purchase and read her gripping story of survival. Ms. Hovda's compelling book speaks to something often overlooked in the violence happening all around us. Speaking throughout the year on the subject of Domestic Violence, I feel her book vividly illustrates the far reaching effects of such violent acts.One Shot A Thousand Holes, is much more than one person's struggle for survival, and the devastation caused by such a tragedy. Through Ms. Hovda's words, and those of her family, the reader is able to glimpse into her pain-filled journey, and discover profound and lasting effects of such a tragedy on family and friends, as well as the lessons learned and the gifts received on her road to recovery.Many people who have read One Shot A Thousand Holes, have shared a similar reaction to the book--once started, it is difficult to put it down.I want to applaud and thank Rebecca for having the courage to write her story and for bringing Domestic Violence awareness to the forefront.Larry Nicholas"},{"Title":"One Shot: A Thousand Holes","review":"I have a respect for those who can write an engaging story that so many can relate to.

However being a daughter of Ann's I cant help but wonder would my mother really want parts of her personal diary published?

However, you may come to very different conclusions, or none at all, if you cannot put the clues in the context that Gardner does when Mason solves the crime.Here we start out with a very complicated set of situations, as Mason is approached by a man whose wife ran off with another man. But this isn't the first story Mason gets, as the client first complains about a howling dog next door. We soon discover that the dog may have had a good \\"dog reason\\" for his howling, but if that is so, then why did it abruptly stop? Then Mason's client disappears. Things only get more complicated from there to the very end.The TV show version of this book changed a few things around, but overall was remarkably close to the plot of the novel, which I always find to be entertaining. No question, I'm a Perry Mason junkie. However, I try to indulge my habit in small doses, three or four books a year, so that I don't overdose on them and lose my enthusiasm. For anyone already a Perry Mason fan, or for those who enjoy the old style mysteries where you have a good chance to solve it as you read, this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The case of the howling dog","review":"The Case of the Howling Dog, by Erle Stanley GardnerArthur Cartwright visits Perry Mason to see about a dog and a will. Perry explains what makes a will valid in their state. Cartwright hates to hear a howling dog because it means death in the neighborhood. Perry explains how he will avoid a malicious prosecution suit: they will see a deputy district attorney to issue a warning (Chapter I). Clinton Foley, the neighbor, visits the deputy DA and charges that Cartwright is mentally deranged; Foley's dog doesn't howl. Deputy Sheriff Pemberton will personally investigate this conflict (Chapter III). The housekeeper and cook say the police dog Prince didn't make noise. But Foley finds a note - his wife has run away with Cartwright (Chapter IV)! Cartwright left home last night and never returned (Chapter V). Perry orders Paul Drake to investigate Foley and Cartwright; he suspects there is something going on (Chapter VI). Paul Drake reports on the identity of Foley and his wife - shocking news (Chapter VII)! Perry calls Foley to discuss the situation at a 9 pm meeting.When Perry arrives at Foley's home he finds the dog dead, and Foley's body. He calls the police (Chapter VIII). Sergeant Holcomb questions Perry about his appointment. Perry points out that his lack of an alibi shows he had no foreknowledge. A perfect alibi should be suspicious (Chapter IX). Paul Drake's menlocate the taxi driver who brought a visitor to Foley's home earlier (Chapter XI). When they locate Bessie Forbes, Perry visits her and gives her advice (Chapter XII). Perry retrieves a handkerchief, and call Sergeant Holcomb to turn it in as the owner visited Foley's home around the time of his death (Chapter XIII). Perry's clever misdirection points to the Breedmont Hotel.Perry confers with Bessie Forbes and hears her story. Perry tells he she can't afford to lie about her call on Foley, and can't afford to tell the truth. Bessiemust not answer any questions unless her lawyer is present. The police show up next to arrest Bessie, and warn her that anything she says can be used against her (the \\"Miranda warning\\" in 1934). Della and Perry discuss the case (Chapter XV). Perry explains that a defense lawyer presents the facts in favor of the defendant against the powers of the state. Perry must strike at just the right time to free his client. First he must build up sympathy in the newspapers. Perry's case will depend on that howling dog! The police traced the gun to Bessie Forbes, bought over a year ago.Perry gets Paul Drake to investigate the alibi of Thelma Benton, Foley's housekeeper. Her hand is still bandaged from a dog bite. Perry uses a ruse toquestion her (Chapter XVI). The trial starts in Chapter XVII. Perry cross-examines the taxi driver who brought Bessie Forbes to the Foley home; he was coached by the district attorney. Perry plays another fast trick, skating on thin ice because he has to do it (Chapter XVIII). Perry explains the fickleness of the mass mind and how he will use it (Chapter XX). The cross-examination of Thelma Barton is interrupted with startling news! Perry argues for his client, and the jury returns with 'not guilty' in Chapter XXI. In the next chapter Perry explains it all, a happy ending; we learn why that dog didn't howl. Perry would not accept a dismissal; justice was served, not the letter of the law. The language reflects the manners of that time."},{"Title":"The case of the howling dog","review":"This is the fourth Perry Mason books written in 1934 and I think it is one of the best.

Her competitor, Harry Peavis, bought up a few shares in her small corporation. Now he wants to buy up control. Mildreth calls Perry Mason's office for an appointment, then visits her invalid sister Carlotta and her husband Bob. Chapter 2 explains how this nightclub with a PRIVATE door runs a racket. The witness, Esther Dilmeyer, is poisoned by candy but is found in time. Mildreth suspects Bob has given up Carlotta's shares in the corporation. There is another roller-coaster ride of a story where events pop-up as a surprise twist. Complications arise from page to page, chapter to chapter, yet the storyline stays simple to follow.In Chapter 5 Mason visits the nightclub owner's cabin, only to find the police and newspaper reporters covering his murder. Lynk was dead quite a while (the coagulation of blood and rigor mortis). Now the question is who did it from the list of suspects, or an as yet unknown person. Chapter 6 tells how a suspect could refuse to answer questions based on constitutional rights. Lieutenant Tragg plays with Mildreth like a cat with a mouse, and gets her admission (Mason represents her sister Carlotta). Mason points out that husbands and wives are more likely to kill each other than a stranger (Chapter 9). Chapter 13 explains why a claimant in a court of equity must have clean hands; illegal means, entrapment, fraud, or oppression disqualify a suit. Mason learns of facts that lead to the questioning of a witness, and the truth comes out to free his client. Mildreth recovers the missing stock and keeps her business. This all takes place in two fast-paced days. One item dates this novel: a woman wearing \\"light woolen stockings\\" (Chapter 3)."},{"Title":"The case of the howling dog","review":"a client calls for a will and a howling dog . the next day he runs away with his neighbors wife leaving behind the CORPSE of her husband and perry mason in a very embarrising position.or did he? must read . on of the best gardners book."},{"Title":"The case of the howling dog","review":"Well plotted, and a VERY unexpected end. a must read"},{"Title":"The case of the howling dog","review":"Fans of Gardner's Perry Mason stories will quickly recognize that this was one of the first in the long and delightful series of stories featuring the dynamic attorney. There are also references to the economic depression that had enveloped the United States and the world, further serving to date the story in the minds of the knowledgeable reader.At this point the development of the Mason, Street and Drake characters is still in the early stages; Mason has a rough and hard edge and the two primary adversaries, police Lieutenant Tragg and District Attorney Hamilton Burger have yet to appear. Mason is very bold in working along and beyond the border of ethical and legal boundaries, a point that he acknowledges to both Street and Drake. The relationship between Mason and Street is one of affection, yet Street open criticizes Mason's tactics, something that is rarely repeated.The story itself is a modification of the episode of Sherlock Holmes where the key point is what the dog did not do. In this case, the dog supposedly howls but then later does not. This is a key point in the story and like so many others, when it is revealed the conclusion is obvious. Modern readers will be appalled at the racial slurs regarding the Chinese cook as well as the hints of his primitive mental capacity. The best way to deal with these things is to appreciate how far our society has progressed in this area and read on."},{"Title":"The case of the howling dog","review":"First published in 1934, The Case of the Howling Dog was the fourth entry in Erle Stanley Gardner's long-running series featuring Perry Mason.At this point, Gardner was still in the process of establishing the formula that he would adhere to once the series hit its stride. Lieutenant Tragg, the intelligent and sympathetic homicide detective, and Hamilton Burger, the D.A. who would become Mason's principal adversary had not yet been introduced. The police department is still represented by the oafish Sergeant Holcomb, who wouldn't recognize a clue if it bit him in the backside. The D.A.'s office is represented by an assistant D.A., Claude Drumm who immediately falls into every trap that Mason so cleverly baits for him.Della Street, the faithful and adoring secretary, Paul Drake, the reliable detective, and Perry Mason himself are still evolving into the characters they would ultimately become. Mason is a bit rougher around the edges than the suave attorney that most crime fiction readers would recognize, and at this stage of the game he's much more willing to severely bend, if not actually break the law in the interest of serving what he sees as the greater good.As is often the case in this series, the plot becomes almost hopelessly convoluted: A man comes to see Mason about his neighbor's howling dog and about writing a will. Complications ensue.Suffice it to say that there will be a murder. Inevitably, Mason's client will be the prime suspect, and inevitably the case against the client will appear to be open and shut. As always, the D. A.'s office will be salivating at the chance to finally beat Mason after suffering so many ignominious defeats at his hands. And of course, as always Perry will pull the rabbit out of the hat and save the day at the very end.Obviously, this story is a bit dated and is clearly a product of its times, but it's still a fun read and an opportunity to see Perry Mason and these other characters in their formative stages."},{"Title":"Murach's CICS Desk Reference","review":"This is the fourth of Murach's books to find a permanent place on my bookshelf.

He examines the implications of pluralism in education, politics, and personal reflection, coming down in the end on the side of a scholarly pluralism toward these issues, emphasizing the empathy which this approach allows. &quot;The crosscultural students of religious and other worldviews is still immeasurably better off in regard to understanding than is the monocultural navel-watcher&quot; (21), he claims, but the more interesting question which can be begged from this statement turns out to be: is pluralism itself a worldview, subject to the same criticism as the religious and nationalistic worldviews Smart presents?

Let me also say that I was extremely jealous when I first came across this book in a bookshop in Cambridge, England. For years I have shown my students clips from science-fiction films such as \\"The Matrix\\" (re: Descartes's first Meditation) and \\"The Terminator\\" (re: machines without sensation -- Descartes again) and \\"Total Recall\\" (re: Descartes's first Meditation again, and Locke's memory theory of identity) when teaching my Modern Philosophy course. But Rowlands beat the rest of us to it and wrote a book in this vein -- an introduction to philosophy by way of popular science-fiction films.This Winter Term (2005), for the second year in a row, I will be assigning this book for my Modern Philosophy course. (Last time I had to order the books from England; this time they are available in the US). In 2004 my students enjoyed the book tremendously and it proved very useful, especially the sections on Descartes (chapters 2 and 3 on skepticism about the external world and the mind-body problem -- \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"The Terminator\\"), Locke (chapter 4 on personal identity -- \\"Total Recall\\" and \\"The Sixth Day\\") and Hume (chapter 5 on free will -- \\"Minority Report\\").The author, Rowlands, is known best for his work in the philosophy of mind and applied ethics (especially the ethical status of animals). I believe that the earlier parts of the book, dealing with philosophy of mind, metaphysics and epistemology, are easily the best. The final parts of the book dealing with ethics -- chapter 6 on \\"Hollow Man\\" (why should we be ethical?), chapter 7 on \\"Independence Day\\" and \\"Aliens\\" (should the scope of ethics extend to aliens?) and chapter 8 on \\"Star Wars\\" (good vs. evil) -- are not quite up to standard. Somewhere in between, standard-wise, are the parts dealing with the meaning of life -- chapter 1 on \\"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein\\" and chapter 9 on \\"Blade Runner\\".The book is written primarily for undergraduates. It normally does a nice job of presenting philosophical ideas and problems in an appealing and direct fashion. You can tell that the author is part of the generation that grew up watching Star Wars and then Buffy, but has a D.Phil from Oxford and can write about supervenience or Doug Lenat's CYC project.This makes it all sound far too serious and educational, however. The most important thing about this book is that it is funny. It's funny about philosophy, and it's funny about films too. Exhibit A: \\"\\"Minority Report\\"... also has Tom Cruise in it, not a man you normally associate with complex philosophical issues. I mean, scientology? Give me a break.\\" (p. 121) Rowlands is nothing if not irreverent, and you will laugh out loud while reading this.So far, I have found only a few factual errors (references are to the English Ebury Press 2003 paperback edition). Heidegger's \\"Being and Time\\" was published in 1927, not 1926 (p. 7). Wittgenstein's \\"Tractatus Logico-philosophicus\\" was completed in 1918 and published in 1921, not published in 1916 (p. 53). And the Cameron Crowe movie starring Tom Cruise is \\"Vanilla Sky\\", not \\"Vanilla Skies\\" (p. 121). The only philosophical error I have found is that he refers to Occasionalism as \\"parallelism\\" (p. 72) (parallelism is a different position and can be espoused by a Dual Aspect theorist such as Spinoza). But that is just something discussed in a footnote.I am usually not happy with Rowlands' quick resolutions of various matters in the final sections of his chapters. But it would be unfair to beat him over the head about this. I also find some of the humor to be too laddish for my taste. It's not particularly funny to say how much you love beer and imagined sex with Sarah Michelle Gellar, and it becomes painful to say it the n-th time. But these are minor criticims of a refreshing read, on the whole."},{"Title":"The Philosopher at the End of the Universe: Philosophy Explained Through Science Fiction Films","review":"A great primer for philosophical thought that does not put one to sleep. In fact, this was such a good read, it kept me up late into for several evenings. Professor Rowlands also happens to be one funny man. Very well done."},{"Title":"The Philosopher at the End of the Universe: Philosophy Explained Through Science Fiction Films","review":"Just finished reading the book The Philosopher at the End of the Universe by Mark Rowlands. The feature of the book is that it uses many sci-fi movies to elaborate on the various theories of philosophy, making the dry subjects much more interesting to read. The author said that the book is equivalent to university year one course on philosophy. I did not study philosopher in college. So comments from those who know better are welcome. The theories discussed include the meaning of life, reality, identity, free will and morality. Each topic has one or two chapters and relates to a movie.One of the topics I like is on reality. The author refers this to the movies Matrix trilogy where the perceived reality was actually a virtual world projected by a computer with intelligence to the minds of captive men. It is not simply a case of virtual reality. A normal human in the movie spent the entire life in the world falsely created for him and never knew anything else, so to him it was the real world. There was a paradox in that Keanu Reeves was Mr Anderson in the virtual world, but he was also Neo who fought kung fu in the virtual world. In the last episode, we saw Agent Smith transformed into a person in the \\"real\\" world. This called into question which is the real and which is the virtual world.The concept was not created by the Wachowski brothers. I recall seeing several movies deploying the same concept. There is Existenze where players entered a virtual reality game. There is also the Thirteenth Floor where a laboratory resided there worked on virtual reality so real that a murder was committed inside the virtual world; it then turned out that the laboratory was actually a virtual reality created by another group of supreme scientists.The concept of reality, or the lack of it, dated back to 300 BC from the Greek philosopher Pyrrho who said that it was impossible for human to know things in their own nature. We also know well the story of Chuang Tzu at about the same time (300 BC) on the dream of the butterfly, where he questioned whether the butterfly was the dream of Chuang Tzu, or Chuang Tzu was the dream of the butterfly.The thought was made famous by Rene Descartes of the seventeenth century. He proposed that it is possible what we call the world does not really exist; that it is merely a dream. Descartes hypothesized that the world could be ruled by an evil demon who is very powerful and decides to deceive all mankind for fun. All we perceive through our senses are only what the evil demon makes us believe. In fact, nothing of what we believe is true. Indeed there is no world as such, as every feature of the world is supplied by the demon in trickery. Descartes was arguing for the theory of scepticism, which is a view that we cannot have any real knowledge. We may think there is a world around us, but we really don't know it at all; we merely believe it very strongly.However, this is not the goal of Descartes' argument. Having proposed the possibility that we could be tricked in all our senses, he went on to state that there is only one thing we could be absolutely sure: our existence, so that we are able to be sceptical; thus the famous expression Cognito, ergo sum, or in English I think, therefore I am. The author specifically clarified that \\"it does not mean anything silly like we exist only as long as we think\\". The main point is: we can think of the possibility that the world is not real, but we cannot think that we do not exist, the reason being we must exist to do the thinking. Or, doubting our existence automatically guarantees our existence, because otherwise we could not be around to do the doubting. Not matter how much the evil demon tries to deceive us, unless we exist he cannot be deceiving us. The conclusion drawn by Descartes is one on dualism, that the body and the soul are two different entities.But the dust has not settled and there are problems with the claim that I think, therefore I am. The nineteenth century philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche identified the problem. He proposed that the existence of self could just be a collection of thoughts, and some of the thoughts were thoughts to the effect that these thoughts belong to a certain person. But there need to be no person at all. All that is needed is the thoughts that all these thoughts belong to the same person. Nietzsche argued that all we can really be certain of is that there are thoughts, we cannot be certain of the existence of the person to whom the thoughts belongs. This point was made earlier by another philosopher David Hume that when we look in on ourselves, all we find are various mental states, i.e. thoughts, beliefs, desires, feelings, emotions, but we do not come across any self or person who has these mental states. So there is still a possibility that ourself and the world we sense, do not really exist. We are just made believed by the evil demon of Descartes, or we are actually in the Matrix.The author quoted a scene where Neo met the turbaned boy engaging in spoon-bending action. Boy: Try not to bend the spoon, for that is impossible. Instead, try to realize the truth. Neo: What is that? Boy: That there is no spoon. Then instead of bending the spoon, you see that what is really bending is yourself.Spoon-bending with the mind is a phenomenon reported many times in our world. So are we living in a real world and can we realize the truth? Philosophers stop short of providing an answer."},{"Title":"The Philosopher at the End of the Universe: Philosophy Explained Through Science Fiction Films","review":"Who knew that we would see big-screen heroes like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Keanu Reeves, and Tom Cruise take their rightful places beside the likes of Descartes, Heidegger, Wittgenstein, and Plato? And I don't mean at the Oscars!In this book Rowlands has brought together several areas of popular interest: philosophy, movies, and science fiction, in a way that benefits all three. It is a rollicking romp through often-dry philosophical fields such as the meaning of life, theory of knowledge, the mind-body problem, personal identity, free will, and ethics.While the tone is tongue-in-cheek, the content took me deeper down the rabbit-hole of philosophy than many such popular offerings."},{"Title":"The Philosopher at the End of the Universe: Philosophy Explained Through Science Fiction Films","review":"This was a great book.It made me appreciate these movies on a whole new level, (with the exception of the Matrix which I now enjoy for the FIRST time!)By applying philosophical concepts to movies the author brilliantly breaks them down into proverbial 'apples & oranges'.

Rowlands' philosophical perspective is from the \\"inside/outside\\" school, so to speak. In other words, the major backdrop for each of his sci-fi case studies is that when looking at a situation, say the self, from the inside, things seem to work, but when looked at from the outside, they don't. For example, a person can see themselves as a significant being from the inside, with feelings, opinions, thoughts, etc, but from the outside, that same person is just one in six billion whose life will come and go in a relatively short-period of time, for the most part to be forgotten. Yikes!The use of this dichotomy does not always work, however, and who's to say that the outside view should prevail, as Rowlands claims. Also, if I read and interpret Rowlands correctly, there is ultimately no thing as a self and all our actions are deterministic and we have no will. If so, then some of his claims are inconsistent, as he proceeds to talk about morality as defined by deeds of a self, but if no such self exists, then who is doing these deeds that define morality? There are other instances like this of inconsistency. Not surprisingly, after taking an occasional jab at Christianity, Rowlands spend a significant portion of a chapter describing the horrors of raising chickens for eggs and cooking. A lot of that may be true, but I find an odd match between people who are atheists and are also animal rights activists. I am not sure why there often seems to be that connection.The other problem with the book is that Rowlands seems to be trying desperately to communicate that despite being a philosopher, he is also funny and cool. His humor more often than not works, but at times he resorts to cheap shots. Despite these drawbacks, the sci-fi movie approach works as a way of teaching philosophical concepts in general. After reading this book I am eager to view for the first time or again movies like The Matrix and Blade Runner, with a keen eye to the philosophical themes described by Rowlands."},{"Title":"The Philosopher at the End of the Universe: Philosophy Explained Through Science Fiction Films","review":"Most books on philosophy are a bore because a) unlike art, which is ideas in motion, philosophy is merely ideas (no matter how wonderful nor complex they may be), and b) most philosophers (who claim that title in primacy) are simply bad writers- the two most notable exceptions to that rule being Plato and Friedrich Nietszche. And one of the main reasons why most philosophers are bad writers is that they eschew the notion that good writing (or good art, for that matter) has to entertain, as well as enlighten. Often the medicine must be put into a sugar lump, or, the exact opposite way the modern publishing industry, and Hollywood studios, work.A notable exception to this comes in the form of a 2003 book by philosopher Mark Rowlands, called The Philosopher At The End Of The Universe: Philosophy Explained Through Science Fiction Films, which takes its name from the Douglas Adams book, The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe, part of the Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy. The book takes the novel approach of explaining some of the basic \`big' problems of philosophy via some of Hollywood's biggest sci fi smashes. While Rowlands admits, early on, that he is no great wordsmith, in the sense of being able to craft prose that poesizes itself into the nooks and crannies of mind and soul (thus I will not be quoting from it, as I would merely be recapitulating the same things available in the Modern Library's European Philosophers From Descartes To Nietszche), his book is well written in the most prosaic sense. It is concise, cogent, and witty. There is precious little waste in the small book's 258 pages (excluding a glossary of handy philosophic terminology).While I would have liked to have seen the inclusion of such sci fi classics as Star Trek, The Planet Of The Apes, Solaris, Forbidden Planet, and 2001: A Space Odyssey, for all of those films and series raise serious philosophic queries, none of them has an overarching theme, the way some of the films Rowlands describes (decidedly lesser films, but better didactic examples of simply laid out problems) do, for they are necessarily more complex and multifarious, as well as being more grounded in purely scientific (or sociological), rather than just philosophic, conundra....Overall, the book entertains and uses the idea of the films in service to the idea, while sometimes the reverse might have been the better approach. Although he disdains arts films, one cannot help but wonder what Rowlands would make of some of the classics of Bergman, Fellini, Antonioni, Tarkovsky, Mizoguchi, Angelopoulos, and films that do not merely reflect a philosophic idea(l), but immanently employ it. Nonetheless, The Philosopher At The End Of The Universe is one of the best primers on the world of ideas that I've ever read, making a nutritious meal out of the junk food of Hollywood; i.e.- getting something from nothing, creatio ex nihilo. Oh, wait, now that's theology. One wonders the filmic references a book like that could make!"},{"Title":"The Philosopher at the End of the Universe: Philosophy Explained Through Science Fiction Films","review":"Rowlands does a good job of explaining basic human philosophy as filtered through the lens of various science fiction films. There's an organization and humor to this book to rival much of what you'll find concerning layman's philosophy. The book has a few logical hiccups from time to time (for example, Rowlands sees a goal as something that is either achieved or unachieved at a particular point in time; this boolean perspective doesn't allow for a goal that is achieved in degrees).I recommend it."},{"Title":"Foghorn Outdoors: California Recreational Lakes and Rivers","review":"I've used this book to research and plan a number of trips.

Ellis draws together unlikely bits of flotsam and jetsam of bible and archeological history to develop a compelling tale of a very human motivation for the New Testament. As he would have us consider, Paul's divine Jesus is the puffed up remant of a the story of a very human but ambitious royal exile. As a descendant of Moses (forget David as revisionist history), Jesus was actually a Hyksos king and of the royal bloodline of Egypt. All the references to the Kingdom were actually him speaking of his shadow nation living in Palestine. And since he was Pharoah, he was God. No wonder he referred to himself as the Son of God as his father, also a Pharoah, was also God. No wonder the Romans let the Jews crucify him - he was a seditious rebel ! For those who like alternative views of accepted history, this is a good starter in a four book series by Ellis. Be prepared to wade through details as he tends to make his case by endless lists of facts. But he makes you want to know more."},{"Title":"Jesus: Last of the Pharaohs","review":"It is nice to see a book that does not simply trot out the same old arguments all pillaged from other books and other authors. If nothing else, readers will find that Ellis' work is highly original and deeply thought provoking. Yes, it is true that his arguments are not entirely proven, but it is also true that he has systematically taken apart the traditional interpretations placed upon the biblical texts.The central thesis, that the Israelite leaders were actually the Hyksos pharaohs of Egypt, has a distinct ring of truth to it. I, for one, think Ellis is probably right here, but of course this small change changes every aspect of the biblical story."},{"Title":"Jesus: Last of the Pharaohs","review":"Could there be a more provocative premise? Ellis' book proposes that Jesus was one of a long line of Egyptian pharaohs. If you're going to read this, you have to decide in advance if you're going to give it a fair ear, or if you're going to dismiss the entire idea right from the outset.I had an open mind, with no vested self-interest, for or against. I wanted to hear what he had to say. As I went along, I realized I was going to have to accept that not everything Ellis said was going to be set on solid ground. But that didn't have to invalidate everything. I came to realize that if he could convince me, beyond reasonable doubt, that even ONE of the biblical patriarchs was actually a pharaoh, then EVERYTHING else we've \\"learned\\" suddenly falls flat on its face.Folks...his analysis of Abraham sold me. Sold! It was the most convincing of all the patriarchs, and one he addressed very early in the book. I was completely sold on Ellis' reasoning, and then he got to the coup de gras: the mambre tree. I almost fell over. He had already convinced me, and then he made that connection. From there on out, I had no choice but to at least give his ideas a fair shake.Do I think he proved all his ideas? Not at all. Some theories didn't have enough evidence to completely prove anything. But if ONE patriarch can be reasonably be proven to be a pharaoh, doesn't everything else we know suddenly fall flat? And Abraham, the original patriarch for Judaism, Islam, and Christianity...was the most convincing of them all. From there, all bets are off.This book changed my view of not only history, but present society. Suddenly the whole world looks like a different place to me. If you're open to a life-changing experience, read this book."},{"Title":"Jesus: Last of the Pharaohs","review":"Ralph Ellis has uncovered incredible insight into the evolution of the theological tenants of Western Civilization. His presentation is typical modern academic \\"rational material\\" perspective, and the reader needs to restore the ancient perspective to the wisdom Ellis uncovers. Ellis uses the words \\"lateral thinking\\" as a way of inserting his own intuitive perspectives. This serves him and the reader very well.On the other hand, Ellis is not presenting a religious book, and in general, he avoids the religious perspective of the ancients. This causes him to focus on the earth bound perspectives of the archaeology. To restore the holistic images behind the ancient perspective it is mandatory that the ancient metaphysics be applied. Metaphysics was the focus of all monumental cultures. They were driven by the desire for \\"higher science\\" rather than the mundane quest for \\"material science.\\" The ancients saw the universe through rational material perceptions and emotional spiritual perspectives. In fact, their primary objective in the monuments they created was to save the lost emotional spiritual perspective of a primordial Golden Age when \\"higher science\\" represented the \\"Word of God.\\"A reader who comprehends the repressed metaphysics of modern Western culture will recognize the evolutionary path of our heritage through all of the books Ellis has written on the genre. Unfortunately, most readers are looking for entertainment rather than evolutionary theological wisdom. They will be biased to see the Pharaoh Jesus in the books of Ellis rather than the God Jesus, which the ancients were attempting to convey. To those few who seek Divine Truth and have the perseverance to pass between these \\"clashing rocks,\\" the Dove of Peace will emerge in the Elysian Field of the Golden Age when Pharaohs were Great Houses of the Creator's Dream of Eternal Life."},{"Title":"Jesus: Last of the Pharaohs","review":"Very good.

However, key supporting elements are not documented as having been researched and bring the entire work into question. But, read for yourself and see what you think. This book is certainly \\"food for thought\\"."},{"Title":"Jesus: Last of the Pharaohs","review":"I read the 2006 edition of the 2nd revised version of 2001 of the originally 1998 book.Usually, I am open minded to challenging / revelatory books as can be seen in my respective reviews. However, this one is really stretching it. It startet all promising. In fact, after reading the revelation that the Hyksos were rather Egyptians in a religious civil war than foreign invaders, which made this much sense, as a lot of previous information I had acquired elsewhere, suddenly neatly fell into place, that I immediately ordered five more books by Ralph Ellis. As I read on, I realized that the author isn't exactly, well, my first choice of trustworthiness. I was really glad, when I finally finished his book. Now, I could hit myself over the head with a huge hammer like in a Tex Avery cartoon for having to endure another five.The main premise of astronomical precession leading to two-millennia-ages of veneration of Taurus, then Aris, then Pisces is indeed very revealing, including all of this representing the engine for major religious-political cataclysms at the respective transition periods. Orthodox historians perfectly know of former astronomical/Astrological ages getting vilified successively. That's why the devil concept was first associated with a bull (Taurus), then ram-features (Aris). It does indeed make sense to connect that with the Biblical Exodus, even saying two events were merged into one. Even identifying Saul/Paul with a certain historic figure und revealing the Gilgamesh epos as astronomy based is comprehendable. As for most of the rest of the history revision of this book, I am a little lost...In his follow-up bookTempest & ExodusRalph Ellis admits that he was writing the former book \\"at lightning speed\\". That is exactly, how it feels. For example that Tutankhamun isn't Akhenaten's son, but brother gets superficially \\"explained\\" very late and that in a footnote. Nice theories, for which no time had been found to really examine and verify. For the open minded, it may sound all swell, however, I have read many such swell theories, and they all sound logical. Usually, they contradict each other. And this book harbors the least proven theories of them all. Everything the authors ofThe Hiram Key: Pharaohs, Freemasonry, and the Discovery of the Secret Scrolls of Jesushave been (more or less wrongly) accused of, is so much more true for Ralph Ellis that the critics of the former probably regret having shot their bolt. Constructing evidence and neglecting other to fit a prefabricated theory; flawed use of sources; singlehandedly rewriting virtually all of history without thinking twice; building successively on ever more shaky theories. I did not really share the sentiments against \\"The Hiram Key\\". But I am not entirely sure, wether Ralph Ellis himself upfully believes in everything he is writing. After all his US sales men of the fittingly named publishing house \\"Adventures Unlimited\\" is David Hatcher Childress, himself an infamous yellow press style author of many dubious books, one of which I have read. In it (Technology of the Gods: The Incredible Sciences of the Ancients) he is openly suggesting that every reader has to please pick that, what she or he wants to believe. As very real information is mixed with the very absurd. The same seems to apply with Ralph Ellis, however, without THIS author openly suggesting that.Whatever the case, there are many things in this book I am downly sceptical about. Few things I am certain about. And all those certain things, Ellis has written this sloppy about that they are all wrong. Maybe insignificant details and maybe coincidental. But maybe very symptomatic.In the introductory Ellis is referencing two (teams of) authors. Ahmed Osman (Moses and Akhenaten: The Secret History of Egypt at the Time of the ExodusandThe Hebrew Pharaohs of Egypt: The Secret Lineage of the Patriarch Joseph) and Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas (\\"The Hiram Key\\"). For one thing, Ellis is referencing the latter title as \\"Hyram Key\\". For another, he is not bothering himself to disprove his latter role models in order to make his own theories possible, which would have been necessary once in a while. He IS going into that a little bit with the former, Ahmed Osman, but not all the way. Namely obviously not as soon as he is lacking any idea to synthesize one or the other head-on collision. Yet, by engaging in a synthesis once in a while, he is leaving the impression as if everything would have been worked out. NOT! In other words, for those, who would like to take \\"Jesus: Last of the Pharaos\\" at face value, I would recommend reading (at least) the three above mentioned books by the other authors before. Who did not write with lightning speed and at least provided a certain amount of evidence while putting forward new theories, as a result of their research (and not the other way around).Ralph Ellis relies heavily on linguistics. Even for experts, there's always the acute danger of folk etymology. For the most part, I would have to take Ellis' word for that what he writes about linguistics. Which I can't do, because that which I DO know about, he is wrong with certainty. He is averring a certain ancient Egyptian sign would be pronounced like the \\"-ch\\" in Scottish \\"Loch\\" or German \\"ich\\". The trouble is, these \\"ch\\"s couldn't possibly get pronounced any more differently. The \\"ich\\"'s ch is phonetically [], similar to the English \\"sh\\", while the Scottish \\"Loch\\" (lake) is phonetically [x]. Which is the same, ironically, as the German \\"Loch\\" (hole). Something like the combined attempt of hissing and gurgling at the same time. Yes, there are two ways of pronouncing \\"ch\\" in German... Curiously, Ellis is giving a German Egyptologist as the source. It is simply impossible that the German could have suggested such a linguistic blunder.Besides all of that, occasionally, Ellis history revisions are diametrically opposed to theological concepts. Not of the Church necessarily, but of the more original concepts. Without going into such a heavy alteration (if he is even aware of that and/or cares). For example, he takes Jesus as intending to become a literal king. Every teaching of Jesus concerning kings is the opposite of that and that for a reason. Next, Ellis is averring a happy end for the crucifixion. Hmm... When Jesus gets killed much later, it happens this quickly, that you might miss it while blinking. Out of nowhere, i.e. not even with any superficial attempt of claiming to have found any evidence for that whatsoever, he is relocating Sodom and Gomorrha into Egypt, getting destroyed by some pharao. He doesn't even say, where exactly in Egypt, it just gets included in the Biblical story according to the gospel of Ellis, which most chapters' second parts are comprised of. All earthly characters, but the content is still about homosexuality. (In reality, it is a very important teaching about the sin of violating the duty of hospitality, following the sin of greed.)By the way, the title is misleading. Jesus isn't even mentioned before page 166 (of 310 pages), and quite soon sight of him gets lost again.In its major theory about astronomical precession, Ellis' book, including about the length of this cycle, is ossified ever sinceLost Star of Myth and Timewas published. Which should also be read, when it comes to the round towers of Ireland and other places. Ellis' idea of simple phalli symbols is flawed. Most certainly, he should get a brush up on genetics. It is not true anymore that only female mitochondria are any source for tracing lineages. Patrilineal geneologies can be traced the same by now (or actually even at the time this book had been written...)Other revelatory books should get consulted, such as by Gary Greenberg and Rocco A. Errico, for in some instances, Ellis has escaped one or the other revelation - which are better proven than most of his..."},{"Title":"Jesus: Last of the Pharaohs","review":"What a fun book! A conspiracy theory in the extreme, but that's okay. Sometimes it's entertaining to simply recognize the parallels--in this case, the strong resemblance between Biblical characters and the Pharaohs of Egypt--and run with them, to see where they take you. This book leads deep into Egyptology, relating the stories of the Bible directly to ancient Egypt, and concluding that Judaism, including its offshoot Christianity, stems from ancient Egyptian ritual. You'll find Abraham, Moses, even Jesus among the Pharaohs.Ellis' analysis of the exodus as stemming from the eruption of Santorini is one of the book's more interesting passages. This isn't a new idea (see Acts of God, by Graham Philips) but Ellis fleshes it out, explaining the boils on the skin and more. His point is that the Biblical account is historical and fits nicely into the timing of his thesis, relating Moses to the Hyksos people.Ralph Ellis has produced a suite of similar books, and this is apparently the one that started the ball rolling. Jesus: Last of the Pharaohs has gone through at least two reprintings. There's an awful lot of original information here, and a lot of conclusions drawn on linguistics and minimal evidence, but if Ellis and his topic piques your interest, there's much more available to read.While this is not a religious book, its intent is to uncover the truth about Christianity. It is, according to Ellis, \\"The true history of religion revealed.\\" It's dedicated to his children so that they \\"may know the truth.\\" Ellis obviously wants us to take his conclusions very seriously, and change our view about religion. While I can accept that Egyptian history and myth influenced the stories written in the Hebrew scriptures on some level--this should not be terribly surprising if Israel really escaped from Egypt--I can't quite carry the parallels as far as Ellis does. But I still found the book fascinating and learned a lot."},{"Title":"Jesus: Last of the Pharaohs","review":"A truly mind opening view of the historical pharaohs of Egypt. His research is documented and detailed to support his conclusions. His knowledge of ancient languages and the historical misinterpretations recorded in the Bible were fascinating. For example. Jesus is referred to as a carpenter in the Bible and in current church teachings. It is misleading. The author explains that the true translation is more like cornerstone, builder, artison or educated man, master builder , master mason. He traces the geneology of Jesus as an aristocratic son, a prince of the realm and someone who was possibly in a position to take the throne from Herod and his sons. He notes Jesus as a descendent of Isaac, Jacob, Abraham, former pharaohs of Egypt and records his extensive education in the arcane as well as ancient traditions and religions. He explains that the biblical shepherds were Hyksos Shepherd Pharaohs. This book is a wealth of information in so many areas, power struggles between royal dynasties; it provokes thoughts and discussions about the concepts of the four western religions and has many references to the Masonic traditions, etc. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Jesus: Last of the Pharaohs","review":"To believe the views in Jesus, Last of the Pharaohs, one must believe that: (1) The Bible is merely an error-riddled historical text; (2) Coincidence is not an option; and (3) Word-play is an acceptable form of archeology. Now, even with all three criteria, this book is a stretch of the imagination. I knew nothing of this book or the author before I ordered it, so I'm informing others. I expected an interesting analysis and instead I received boring, useless fiction to include: Jesus' last name (Grail) and Paul's motivation (greed). Ellis' conclusion states it all: he wants us all to get back to the \\"oldest religion\\" - astrology."},{"Title":"H.G. Wells and the world state (Yale historical publications.

The author sounds surprisingly upbeat about the seemingly austere lifestyle he has chosen for himself. Maybe fate helped him choose this lifestyle, but whatever. He goes into purchasing inexpensive land, building a habitable (to him at least) structure, and some of what it takes to live this lifestyle. How to eat, provide for electric, and distinguish needs from wants. Most of what he describes he has actually put into practice, including a few mistakes. A few ideas are attributed to fellow desert homesteaders. While the author acknowledges the need for some income and describes some legal ways to generate it, he does not advocate what some might regard as ethically challenged notions such as stealing, petty crime, or even squatting on government land. Make no mistake about it; this is a lifestyle that will not appeal to most people. But it's great to know it can be done and how to get started doing it.This is a desert homestead so some of the principles may not apply to a more humid climate. The author also readily acknowledges he does not live here full time; he leaves for extended periods, especially those periods when the desert weather is harshest.I picked up a signed copy directly from the author (google him).

Hardly a dusty tome of how-to information, Phil tells his story with flair and humor that will have you chuckling to yourself as Phil describes how a city slicker tackles life in the backcountry. Even if you don't choose to take the road less traveled that Phil did, you'll feel a whole lot better about your options in these troubled times."},{"Title":"Rancho Costa Nada: The Dirt Cheap Desert Homestead","review":"I've been looking at purchasing this book for awhile, but I hesitated because I'd never read an e-book before. It was definitely worth it. I read it on my computer, but I'm buying a reader now. I don't want to miss out on books like this. This book is the story of living in the desert on the extremely cheap. Much more so than many people would want, but its funny, informative and the author says things that all of us have thought at times. It's the story of one persons quest for freedom, independence and the ability to set his own priorities and make his own choices outside of societal conventions and expectations. It's also a fun, easy read that isn't preachy. I don't believe I've ever found that particular combination in this genre. The side stories about his neighbors are a wonderful touch that completes the book. If he wrote a sequel, I'd buy it in a heart beat. I'd love to get to know other people of the valley and their stories. If you're thinking about buying this book - do it. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Rancho Costa Nada: The Dirt Cheap Desert Homestead","review":"Phil is a nice guy and a colorful and fun to read author. I bought my copy ages ago from Loompanics and Phil sent an autographed copy."},{"Title":"Rancho Costa Nada: The Dirt Cheap Desert Homestead","review":"Even if you have no interest whatsoever in homesteading, desert or otherwise, this book is just a great read, and well worth the five bucks."},{"Title":"Rancho Costa Nada: The Dirt Cheap Desert Homestead","review":"While I enjoyed the authors anecdotes about rural desert life and experiences I thought he was a little too cynical about most of the desert rats who dwell up here. While I admire the tenacity he showed in the construction of his homestead his choice of building materials left me wondering what he could have done with slightly more in the way of a budget. His plan drawings are not that detailed but with the materials used you really don't need that much detail. The most enjoyable sections of this book were his conversations with the demented vet. These anecdotes were cynical, wry, funny, and all too true comments on our modern society and I enjoyed them with great gusto."},{"Title":"Performance Tuning for Linux(R) Servers","review":"I like this book since it does give some really good hints at performance tuning Linux boxes. I will say if all your systems are working right is time to buy this book. If it is not do not buy this book"},{"Title":"Performance Tuning for Linux(R) Servers","review":"If you're responsible for Linux servers and you need to keep things running at peak efficiency, you *need* to get this book... Performance Tuning For Linux Servers, edited by Sandra K. Johnson, Ph. D., Gerrit Huizenga, and Badari Pulavarty. It's an excellent blend of theory and practicality.Chapter List:Part 1 - Linux Overview: Linux Installation Issues; Kernel Overview; Overview Of Server ArchitecturesPart 2 - Performance Analysis Tools: System Performance Monitoring; System Trace Tools; Benchmarks As An Aid To Understanding Workload PerformancePart 3 - System Tuning: System Performance Principles And Strategy - A Benchmarking Methodology Case Study; Scheduler Tuning; The Linux Virtual Memory-Performance Implications; I/O Subsystems-Performance Implications; File System Tuning; Network Tuning; Interprocess Communications; Code TuningPart 4 - Performance Characterization Of Linux Server Applications: Web Servers; File And Print Servers; Database Servers; Application ServersPart 5 - Tuning Case Studies: Case Study - Tuning The I/O Schedulers In Linux 2.6; Case Study - File System Tuning; Case Study - Network Performance On Linux; Case Study - Commercial Workload Tuning; Tuning Kernel Parameters; IndexThis is one of those rare books that ranks high on many criteria... It's got a lot of theory, the \\"why\\" of different features as they relate to performance. It's also packed full of practical material. They tell you how to measure key components in the system and what parameters you can change to affect those areas. When you get done, you've covered every conceivable area that exists in the Linux environment. I particularly liked the blending of measuring/monitoring along with the instructions on how to change performance. The chapter on system performance monitoring tools can be used immediately to see how your system runs. Once you become comfortable using those tools, you can use them to run before and after comparisons of tuning efforts. There's no guesswork involved. Measure, tweak, and remeasure. Repeat as necessary. Same with the benchmarking tools. They will allow you to know without a doubt whether the changes you made work or not.I'm also impressed with the readability of the book on a couple of different fronts. For one, books like this can be dry as dirt, especially in the areas dealing with theory and architecture. But surprisingly, it really wasn't hard to follow, nor was I getting bored. The other reason the readability is surprising is that the chapters are done by 21 different contributors. When you get different chapters being done by different techies (with varying levels of communication skills), you normally get a very uneven book. Not so here... The editors should be commended for taking material that I'm sure was all over the board and weaving it into a cohesive and coherent volume.Bottom line... If you run a Linux system and you are responsible for making sure it performs, this is the book you need to have."},{"Title":"Performance Tuning for Linux(R) Servers","review":"I just can't bring myself to like this. I did find it uneven in spite of the editors obvious attempts at blending. I want to like it - individually the chapters are excellent, but I just have trouble seeing this as a coherent work. For me, it's choppy and the different styles make me uncomfortable.Perhaps I can see it as a reference book. I could see myself pulling this down and going to a particular chapter for advice on that specific subject. As such, this surely has value, but I just don't care for it as a corpus."},{"Title":"Performance Tuning for Linux(R) Servers","review":"I bought this book because of some of the names involved in this book (both authors and contributors).However I share the similar thoughts with some other reviewers after spending significant amount of time reading the book. Every chapter seems to start from the beginning. Every authors (of each chapters) try to explain things from scratch. Some jump into deaitls with unexplained term very quickly, and if you are not already familar with kernel sources codes, or have done other researches, you will be lost. Some barely touch the surface, and again if you don't have prior experience, you will be confused and maybe misinformed.The book is suppose about Performance. But there are a lot of tunings and advice about sizings. If a webserver tells a user it is busy and cannot serve any page, that's a sizing problem, not a performance problem. If a server drop new network request because it has run out of resource (not because it's slow and timed out), it's not a performance problem either.Performance is also not about benchmarking. I don't see the use of large amount of numbers in the case studies. They may be significantly different when performance using different kernel version, and different hardware. This should not be a technical paper where numbers are important. The Authors should explain why or how something can be done to improve the \\"performance\\" and the side effects.And there are simple mistakes, and typo. Seems like someone collected all these notes and try to edit them. But obviously no one person or a small team of person is good enough to find those mistakes."},{"Title":"Performance Tuning for Linux(R) Servers","review":"Each chapter is written by a different person, and as result there's a rather disparate feel to the whole book. It's more like collection of scientific paper, authored by stuffy prefessors cooped up in a dusty office somewhere. The words are interesting and well written, and there's plenty to learn, but if you're expecting a group of quick hacks to impress your boss on Monday morning, you'll be disappointed. You will however, be a better and wiser systems administrator.for more book reviews, read &lt;a href=\\"http://www.street71.com/techbook/2005/12/26/performance-tuning-for-linux-servers/\\">Tech Books Reviews&lt;/A> on Performance Tuning for Linux Servers."},{"Title":"Performance Tuning for Linux(R) Servers","review":"I found this book to be uneven, and to have problems getting the details right, even in some simple cases.

Good pictures and illustrations, just the right balance in the writing between keeping you interested but learning something, and the first place I have run accross that thoroughly explained how the Rosetta Stone was translated and exactly how hieroglyphics work, including some of their meanings. A comprehensive overview of Egypt's history, and it's political, cultural, intellectual and religious life. Gave great insight into how much our own culture and civilization - and Christianity, I think - really owe to the ancient Egyptians. They had the first calendar - the resurrection of a god theory, the first writing, the first surgery and medicine, the first real architecture, including the first use of stone, probably the first indoor plumbing. And mostly they seemed to be a well-off lot."},{"Title":"Ancient Egypt (Great ages of man)","review":"When I look back, this was the book I remember poring over most as an 11 year old in my local library. The illustrations, the explanations, as well as a whole chapter on mummies, this book really has it all. While not pedantic and too scholarly, it is a great book for young readers, and comprehensively covers Ancient Egypt from the point of view of a novice. I remember making assiduous notes to remember tidbits of information (such as the origin of the double crown), and to this day I look back fondly on the many hours spent with this book. It has led to a lifetime of deeper study and passion about Egyptology.Now with children of my own, I was just delighted to find it on sale here and procured a copy as quickly as I could, so that they possibly could be as inspired by this book as I once was. And hey, I can relive some of my nostalgia too."},{"Title":"The Washington pay-off; an insider's view of corruption in government","review":"I was looking for books that would give more insite into the murky world of Washington lobbyists. Even though this book is old, it covers much of the period following the assasination of JFK and prior to the assasination of Robert Kennedy from a first hand perspective. Although a one-sided account, I think it gives much more information and realistic account than any other book I have read.It is far better than watching the \\"K Street\\" DVDs that are total hogwash. It provided more insite into the corrupt institution the government was and is now, how government actually operates, as well as, more about the time when our government could too easily cover-up multiple asassinations.It is eye-opening and depressing to see that a republic bears little relationship to a democracy once lobbyists take control. Without full disclosure of both lobbyist registration, and presidential and congressional campaign accounting, we will be a government only of the rich and for the rich which certainly applies in today's Bush administration with government stuffed to the gills with former lobbyists.I agree with the author that recycling former government officials, military officers, and lobbyists back and forth must end before the middle and lower class citizens will get a fair deal."},{"Title":"The Washington pay-off; an insider's view of corruption in government","review":"The purpose of democratic government is to provide the greatest good for the greatest number. You can't please all of the people all of the time. But this requires an egalitarian society, not one where 2% of the people own 80% of the wealth. Money represents the power of the super-rich, and trumps the votes of the ordinary people. This is why campaign contributions are in a bad odor; it represents the power of the few over the needs and wants of the many. This book from a Washington lobbyist tells about events that seldom make the newspapers. Editors and publishers have their agendas and priorities too. So be educated and entertained by Winter-Berger's stories.You can ask if anything is different today, but you can guess what the answer is. Do you ever wonder if things were different in the days of Washington, Jefferson, and Monroe? When the big landowners and rich bankers directly ran the government there was no need for campaign contributions. The need for broadcast advertising means candidates MUST seek money from the rich. So abandon any fantasies of idealism when you read this book. Politicians need money and votes to get elected, and each of these can translate into the other. Money gets things done in Washington by overcoming obstacles (p.12). Lobbyists get things done and collect their share. Different classes and sections have their interests, and legislators try to resolve the differences (p.13). Ever wonder how newspaper and magazine articles are created? See page 18. The red tape and delays of government agencies seem created to require pay-offs (p.20).Why was Lyndon B. Johnson a powerful Senate Leader? He had files on the personal indiscretions of his Senate colleagues, and a close personal relationship with J. Edgar Hoover (p.55). This allowed LBJ to control a Senator's vote. Page 57 explains the statesmanlike public images of legislators! Another chapter explains how justice works in NY (pp.128-130). Can one crook save himself by discrediting another (p.167)? Would the Establishment save the Speaker of the House (p.172)? Legislators deal with laws that spend millions and can either hurt or help people and businesses (p.128). Lobbying and campaign contributions affect legislators: \\"nothing for nothing\\". Page 184 explains why Big Business gets the big contracts. Page 186 explains why Nixon picked Jerry Ford for Vice-President. Why did House Speaker John McCormack resign from Congress (p.199)? Page 200 shows how political genius finesses a horse breeding bill. Page 205 explains how to fix government decisions in secret. Ever wonder about the purpose of a Washington party? Read page 261 to learn the price tag in government contracts. One hostess worked for tobacco corporations and kept health warnings off cigarette packs (p.268). Wealthy people still want money. Pages 269-270 tell of the lifestyle of the rich and famous, and their women.Winter-Berger met many of the richest people in the country, and found them to be deadbeats, hypocrites, bigots, and snobs (p.280). Their money allowed them to influence and control politicians on all levels of government. Most politicians are from the middle-class, and are easily corrupted by exposure to the corrupt rich. The rich get the most out of the economy, but do the least for it (p.289). Page 292 tells how to buy a draft deferment. The last chapter summarizes this book. If you think the ruling class will ever change things, you have infantile fantasies (p.308). Why must a good lobbyist also be a lawyer? To claim client confidentiality and avoid answering questions."},{"Title":"The Changing Languages of Europe","review":"Even those with little training in linguistics have remarked that the languages of Europe show some striking similarities, such as the use of \\"have\\" plus a participle to form the perfect tense. In THE CHANGING LANGUAGES OF EUROPE Bernd Heine and Tania Kuteva convincingly argue that these similarities are due not to coincidence or parallel development (= \\"drift\\"), but to a series of language contacts radiating outwards from various centres in Western Europe over the last two thousand years.Two substantial introductory chapters open the book. In \\"Europe as a Linguistic Area\\" the authors describe previous research positing a European sprachbund, with certain languages lumped together in one theory and a different set in another. The second chapter is an introduction to the process of grammaticalization, showing how language contact-based innovations begin as small tendencies in an individual's speech (use patterns) that may eventually become integral features of the whole language.There are four changes that have appeared in many European languages and, the authors argue, are due to language contact: the rise of articles, the rise of possessive perfects, the merging of comitative and instrumental forms, and the use of question words as relative pronouns in subordinate clauses. Using textual evidence, the authors show how these new features gradually spreading throughout European. Documentary evidence makes it very clear that the disappearance of the synthetic preterite and its replacement in this function by the analytic perfect began in Parisian French in the 12th century, had spread into Germany a century later, and then hit northern Italian dialects by the end of the sixteenth century. (The benefits manuscript evidence provide to students of language contact make me bemoan the short history of writing in the Uralic languages I study.)Through their research, Heine and Kuteva have been able to postulate stages of grammaticalization, revealing that in some European languages things haven't progressed as much as others. Indeed, some languages haven't even started on the path at all. This helps better deliminate a possible European sprachbund, where suprisingly the Celtic languages and Russian are squarely outside the fold.Heine and Kuteva are two of the leading scholars in grammaticalization theory, and each has amassed a hefty publishing record. Nonetheless, they have succeeded here in explaining the specifics of grammaticalization in European languages without using too heady specialist terminology. Even an undergraduate in linguistics could profit from this book. And for those linguists who deal all day with difficult specialist material, this is a downright *fun* monograph."},{"Title":"Bloody Albuera: The 1811 Campaign in the Peninsular","review":"Ian Fletcher's \\"Bloody Albuera\\" combines solid narrative on the 1811 Anglo-Portuguese campaign in the Peninsular War with a lavish variety of illustrations and remarkably clear battle diagrams. The introduction quickly places the reader in the context of the 1808-1814 Peninsular War to liberate Portugal and Spain from the Imperial French Army. Following are chapters on each of the key battles of the 1811 campaign.Most of the emphasis is on \\"Bloody Albuera\\", a hard-fought encounter in which the clumsy tactical handling of the battle by British General Beresford was redeemed by the initiative of subordinates and the sheer stubborn valor of the British and Portuguese infantry. The description of the Battle of Fuentes de Onoro and particularly of the role played by Craufurd's celebrated Light Division is almost heartbreakingly vivid. The Light Division went forward of Wellington's line to cover the retreat of another division, badly mauled by French cavalry. Although soon surrounded themselves, the \\"light bobs\\" maneuvered so adroitly in and out of square that they denied the French horse any real chance to charge and overrun the otherwise vulnerable infantry.Fletcher nicely mixes battle narrative with short portraits of key leaders and explanations of battle tactics. The narrative is closely supported by illustrations and sketches of the battle action and color plates of uniforms. This book should especially appeal to the student of the history of the British Army and of the Napoleonic Wars. The interpretation of events is standard and British-centric; those seeking a broader perspective should consult Oman's seven volume \\"History of the Peninsular War\\" or David Gates' single volume \\"The Spanish Ulcer.\\" The casual reader may find the density of detail to be daunting."},{"Title":"Bloody Albuera: The 1811 Campaign in the Peninsular","review":"Ian Fletcher's book has great text and is supported by clear maps and great illustrations. This is a detailed look at the events surronding a specific battle Albuera fought between the British and the French in the Spanish Peninsular during the Napoleonic Wars. Beautiful book - it just deserves 5 stars."},{"Title":"Woody's Boys: 20 Famous Buckeyes Talk Amongst Themselves","review":"Any football fan, no matter what his favorite team, will wear this book out. Seen through the eyes of a generation of players during practices, games, and off the field, a remarkably consistent picture of Woody emerges. He was clearly not the tyrant that he was sometimes described to be, but rather an old-school coach, tough, honest to a fault, intensely competitive, and highly entertaining. Natali's book captures the atmosphere inside a collegiate team's locker room walls that fans always wish they could see. If you want to immerse yourself vicariously in the world of big time college football, don't miss this book."},{"Title":"Woody's Boys: 20 Famous Buckeyes Talk Amongst Themselves","review":"Woody's boys is an excellend read with a lot of behind the scenes stories that define Woody Hayes from the players perspective. The artwork is awsome!"},{"Title":"Woody's Boys: 20 Famous Buckeyes Talk Amongst Themselves","review":"This book is a series of narratives on the subject of one Coach Woody Hayes. These narratives are culled from interviews with famous names from Ohio State's football program, mostly those of some of the great players to have donned the scarlet and gray. This collection of anecdotal accounts is assembled in chronological order of the time of the person's appearance at Ohio State, so it was easy to see through the different eyes that viewed the coach as time went on.The writing itself has a conversational tone, making for a smooth, quick read. Each person's story has its own distinctive voice, giving the reader the impression of listening to each of these people go around in a circle and tell their particular part of the tale. Some loved him, some hated him, but all had their opinion about the coach that went so far in defining Ohio State football.Since I am an Ohio State fan, a college football fan and someone fascinated by the history of both, I found this to be a fantastic read. Anybody who shares at least one of those interests and wants to read a very honest account of Woody Hayes would be well advised to pick up this book."},{"Title":"Woody's Boys: 20 Famous Buckeyes Talk Amongst Themselves","review":"This book is GREAT!

After reading the book however I was greatly disgusted with the gross factual and editorial errors which detracted from what should have been a great oral history of Woody Hayes and Ohio State football. If Alan Natali is a former player and/or fan of the game you wouldn't know it by this effort. It appears that he knew his subject not at all before undertaking to interview the great players in this book and thus missed a great opportunity to create a classic sports history that a more accomplished writer would have produced (Terry Pluto's fine oral histories come to mind). Natali did not do his homework and his unfamiliartiy with both the history and tradition of Ohio State football is patently obvious. As an example, Natali's ignorance of the games played by these men let's them put spin and state incorect data that the author never catches even in editorial comment. He lets both Champ Henson and Pete Johnson prattle on at length about the famous 1974 Michigan State loss without once clarifying for the reader the big picture and controversy of that game. Unless one were intimately familiar with that game the words mean nothing and the author does nothing to rememdy the situation. One can also see that the subjects were not pressed on details because the author did not know the details. There is a great differance between being a writer and just pushing the \\"record\\" button on a tape machine and then transcibing the words. Oh, he also puts Iowa State in the Big Ten. Unforgiveable, That's what this whole book is, unforgiveable. It gets two stars only because it lets the reader hear the words of these now increasingly annonymous men."},{"Title":"Kings go forth","review":"The book I received is well worn with several spotty areas on the edges of the pages. However , the book had been a library book from Dundee public library and I am sure was handled by many, many people during its lifetime. That is what gave it character.

I thought the typecasting in the movie was right on, but true to some of the morons in hollywood who changed the story's ending, the picture didn't have the true impact of the book. It's a bittersweet, sad story about love and war that I felt was significant. Read it!"},{"Title":"Gold of El Dorado","review":"Warwick Bray is the undisputed expert on the subject. He adds great archaeological depth to an otherwise incomprehensible collection of golden artifacts.

Unfortunately, the overall result is much less than the sum of all the research.Kellogg to the contrary, much of story of Scheubner-Richter and others of the Rubonia fraternity, of the White &eacute;migr&eacute;s in Germany and the extreme ideas they brought with them is well-known to the (relatively few) specialists, though not to the general public, being \\"locked away\\" in unpublished PhD theses and papers in obscure academic journals. What Kellogg does -- in a highly repetitive style (how often do I need to be told that \\"Scheubner-Richter\\" was really \\"First Lieutenant Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter\\"?) -- is to flesh out what was already known with fascinating details.Unfortunately, Kellogg also tends to mistake conjecture and possibility for proof. For instance, the money trail -- if any -- from Russian pretender Grand Duke Kirill to Hitler is undocumented; how much money and where it came from is a welter of qualifiers like \\"considerable\\", \\"likely\\", \\"not entirely clear\\" (pp 248-9). Likewise, the absence of Scheubner-Richter and others from Germany on the day of Rathenau's murder becomes evidence of their advance knowledge of the impending assassination (pp 177-9); and so on.More importantly, Kellogg fails in his primary enterprise, that of determining the Russian roots of Nazism. At most, his arguments support the notion of Baltic German roots; but he fails to show if and to what extent Baltic Germans like Scheubner-Richter or Rosenberg were influenced by specifically Russian ideas (as opposed to the general fund of ideas most European anti-Semites shared). As others have pointed out, radical anti-Semitism was not necessarily Russian, nor was the notion of identifying Bolshevism and Jews (after all, what with, say, Luxemburg in Berlin, Kun in Budapest, and most importantly, Levin&eacute; in Munich, did Hitler and his acolytes really need Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;s to equate Jews and Communism?)No less of a failure is the effort to establish Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; influence on the Nazi \\"Drang nach Osten\\". Given the notions displayed in Mein Kampf, Kellogg is forced to posit a radical change in Hitler's racial outlook after 1923, but without any evidence for it. In fact, Brest-Litovsk and the plans for the exploitation and colonisation of Russian Poland and Ukraine drawn by Ludendorff's staff in 1916-18 fit much better with the evolution of Nazi policy than any notion of White &eacute;migr&eacute; influence.One can only hope that this work, despite its all too many shortcomings, will stimulate more interest in a topic so far unjustly ignored, especially by the general public."},{"Title":"The Russian Roots of Nazism: White &#201;migr&#233;s and the Making of National Socialism, 1917-1945 (New Studies in European History)","review":"I had never thought to find the link between German right wing movements and white emigres within Germany and Europe and what impact they had on the future Nazi Party and Hitler. This book was an unexpected find and a pleasant one at that. Not too difficult to read, somewhat repetitive but at the same time this makes it easier to keep track of all the 'characters' that the reader is introduced to. This book gives an excellent analysis on how the white emigres affected Hitler and his party and how without them Hitler might not have turned east or if he did might have done some things quite differently. What surprised me most was that before 1919 Hitler did not really say or write anything anti-semitic, in fact at times he defended Jews and even spoke like a socialist from time to time, which to a degree is less surprising since the Nazi party was a socialist party. I was also interested to learn of the assassination attempts undertaken by these white emigres against both Soviet politicians and German ones as well. Bottom line is that there is a lot of information here put into a context I never thought existed before, the book is expensive but in my opinion worth the money for the input it provides and the new view I now have of how Hitler came about with some of his ideas regarding Jews, Bolsheviks, and the Soviet Union."},{"Title":"The Russian Roots of Nazism: White &#201;migr&#233;s and the Making of National Socialism, 1917-1945 (New Studies in European History)","review":"The various interconnections between Germany and Russia in contemporary history have become a recurring subject of research after the end of the Cold War. For instance, there has been a new wave of books and articles on the comparison between Nazism and Stalinism as well as on the Nazi-Soviet co-operation of 1939-1940. Another example would be the recent talk about \`Weimar Russia' when interpreting post-Soviet developments.With \\"The Russian Roots of Nazism\\", an extremely dense and well-researched text, Kellog provides an important new study on a still insufficiently explored aspect of the history of contemporary German-Russian relations. His book focuses on the years 1918-1923, and details at length the connections that a number of prominent &eacute;migr&eacute;s from the former Tsarist empire had with the early Nazi elite, in general, and Adolf Hitler, in particular. The central theme of the study is the rise and fall of the short-lived, yet important &eacute;migr&eacute; association Aufbau: \\"Wirtschaftspolitische Vereinigung f&uuml;r den Osten\\" (Reconstruction: Economic-Political Organisation for the East). With such an intriguing subject, Kellog will find many readers among historians and the interested public of both Russia and Germany as well as other countries.Kellog's analysis suffers, however, from an overemphasis of the pro-Slavic tendencies in the German extreme right and an insufficient consideration of the deep roots of the Nazis' rabid anti-Slavism. More generally, Kellog could have considered in more detail rival influences on Nazism such as \`scientific racism' or occultism in order to make a better case for his thesis about the \`Russian roots' of Nazism. While he, at one point, puts his position on the nature of Nazism close to Ernst Nolte's (p. 199), he, in fact, succeeds in providing arguments against Nolte's assertion that fascism is essentially anti-Marxism. Kellog's many quotes show that the \`bolshevik' part in the Nazis' talk about \`Jewish Bolshevism' was secondary and that the Nazis instead thought that the bolsheviks were guided by \`Jewish finance capitalism' (e.g. p. 226) - thus, oddly, making the Nazi interpretation of communism somewhat similar to the communist interpretation of Nazism."},{"Title":"The Russian Roots of Nazism: White &#201;migr&#233;s and the Making of National Socialism, 1917-1945 (New Studies in European History)","review":"When one considers for what short period the German Army occupied the Ukraine after the treaty of Brest Litovsk, it is interesting how many White Russian came out with the retreating German Armies.Their prejudices were a remarkable influence on the early Nazi Party in Munich, particularly the ideas engendered by the Protocols of Zion. Until this book Scheubner-Richter had been written off as a body, the only one shot dead, marching alongside Hitler and Ludendorff in the 1923 attemptef Putsch. However it transpires that he was as great an influence on Nazi doctrine as Rosenberg ( normally described as just a Baltic-German Russian , but actually also a White Officer )Interesting also is the relationship with Wagner clan in Bayreuth , so that the book is complementary to Joachim Kohler's Wagner's Hitler; and that both groups visited Henry Ford in Detroit to seek funds , arising from his anti-semitic attitudes.Kellogg does not explore the implications that the General Staff in Berlin was seeking a rapprochment with bolshevik Russia at this time .Nor does he assess Ludendorff as a politician.Above all , he does not refect on the confrontation between class-ridden White Russian Officers and the Bohemian Corporal who spent the war in the trenches on the Western Front.Anyone coming to study this period and phase of the Nazi Party/ Adolf Hitler will have to take note of this book and its importance.I hope that Michael Kellogg will go on to produce works that follow on this pivotal start."},{"Title":"The Russian Roots of Nazism: White &#201;migr&#233;s and the Making of National Socialism, 1917-1945 (New Studies in European History)","review":"In this highly enlightening book, Michael Kellogg argues that in becoming National Socialist Germany did not follow a special path predetermined by German culture. Rather, the genesis of National Socialism must be understood within the context of German defeat of WWI and the Bolshevik Revolution. The co-occurence of these events brought Baltic German and Russian Nationists to Germany where they joined v&ouml;lkisch leaders and radicalized the masses.

It is a must read for anyone interested in understanding Nazism and the development of its ideology. Kellogg shows how the Russian Revolution affected the thinking of various Russian and Baltic intellectuals who fled to Germany where they spread their poisonous brand of anti-Semitism based on a unique mythology. I strongly recommend this book which should be read alongside Karla Poewe \\"New Religions and the Nazis\\", New York and London, Routledge, 2006.

My father was the bush pilot, 'Saseen'. The correct spelling is 'Sasseen'. So, I guess dear old dad got his share of typos too. My parents divorced when I was 2-3 in the early 40s, and dad passed away in 1974. So, I never got to know him personally, but the Alaskan history books, like this one, helped fill in the gaps about what I know of him. I tracked down a long lost (37 years) half-sister (in Spokane). Her jaw dropped and she just stared at me when we met. She said that our dad and I looked, sounded, and acted like carbon copies! However, I never learned to fly. Neither did my son, but he was an Army Ranger parachutist during the Panama invasion of 1989. There are a lot of other familiar bush pilot names in the book, and I keep running into other people who knew them or worked for them."},{"Title":"Eskimo Medicine Man","review":"This is a good book on life in the remote North.

Born in the house of a celebrated Italian courtesan, he's soon off to London, now the property of an English gentleman who prides himself on collecting elegant objects.But Fortune is a heartless jade to Pompey, whose owners are constantly losing him, banishing him, condemning him to death, putting him to work or selling him. His worth in the eyes of the world varies astonishingly. One day he's exchanged for a gold watch. Next he's swopped for a pennyworth of oysters - a telling comment on shifting values in the \\"new\\" England of the eighteenth century.Being a mere dog, Pompey can move easily through all ranks of society. By following his enforced travels, the author is able to satirize the frivolities of Women of Quality, the escapades of young lords, the harrangues of coffee-house orators and the wiles of beggars, sharpers and social climbers.Considering the ribald behavior of many of the characters, I was surprised to learn, in the introduction, that Francis Coventry was an Anglican clergyman. But he was a great admirer of the comic genius of Henry Fielding. In the third edition of Pompey, Coventry wrote, \\"we cannot well laugh too often.\\"I never heard of Francis Coventry before this book appeared on my Amazon recommendations, probably because he died so young, at the age of twenty-nine. The History of Pompey is his one great literary success. Coventry considered it a slight thing, but in fact the novel is a little masterpiece of social commentary, rich in wonderfully witty dialog.The History of Pompey offers an intimate, often surprising and always hilarious view of life in the eighteenth century. I highly recommend it to adventurous readers. As always, the Broadview edition is superlative."},{"Title":"Operation Terror (Medallion SF, F694)","review":"I was delighted to find this book back in print.

Indeed, he was; and took real delight in his gifts and his exercise of them; he was a Celtic bard in the truest sense of that role -- the lonely public/private man who carried within him the lyric history of his race, the love of his language and a very vocal sense of wonder over his role in life; that he had song, yes; that he was funny, loud, boisterous, cautious, selfish, rude, unforgettable -- all of that and more; he was the poet's poet and the singer for those who longed for lost boyhood, who raged at death and who marvelled at the all the world's words rediscovered in a dewdrop; his stories, like his poems, should be read aloud; there is an incantatory quality to them -- as if something profoundly old and grandfatherly were suddenly shared with the reader; Thomas himself was a great reader; to hear him is to savor him at his best and to feel deeply and sweetly the majesty and holy compulsion of our mother tongue; the stories, while less charged than the poems, nonetheless captivate and break into a kind of lyricism that gladdens the heart and restores the ear. If he wasn't the best of our poets, he was easily the most tuneful and spoke from a very deep place that only the purest of us can truly know."},{"Title":"Collected stories (The Collected stories of the world's greatest writers)","review":"Reading Dylan Thomas's \\"Collected Stories\\" is like eavesdropping on another person's dreams. Ethereal, mysterious, often confoundingly subjective, it's the work of a very lyrical writer who wasn't always interested in typical short-fiction concerns like plot and character.The plus side of this is represented right away in the first story, a bewitching child-like fable out of Ray Bradbury. \\"After The Fair\\" presents a girl named Annie who creeps into a fairground at night and makes friends with one of the human sideshows. \\"I've always been a fat man, and now I'm the Fat Man,\\" he tells her with a touch of pride. There's something deeply satisfying yet hard to explain about the pull of this story, of utterly different people connecting to one other in a way that seems natural to the very young and impossible to anyone else.Three stories later, \\"The Enemies\\" presents us with another kind of off-center meeting, this between a lost and somewhat barmy Welsh minister and a couple of otherworldly pagans who view him with concealed contempt.Conversation is elliptical, to say the least. \\"It is quiet here.\\" \\"We have no clock.\\"Dylan Thomas won fame for his poetry, but during a career from the early 1930s to 1953 he also wrote fiction. For the first few years, it was in the vein of \\"The Enemies\\" and even more inscrutable offerings like \\"The Lemon\\" and \\"The Mouse And The Woman\\". Any plot seems hidden behind dense layers of descriptive, run-on verbiage. I found myself grimly turning pages with the dumb persistence of an armadillo on a desert road.Thomas didn't stick to that style, fortunately. The middle of the book contains the text for his short-story collection \\"Portrait Of An Artist As A Young Dog\\" which is written in a more grounded way. The best of them, \\"The Peaches\\" and \\"One Warm Saturday\\", present both a lived-in feeling as well as a clear well-developed narrative and compelling central characters. Thomas still meanders, but with real purpose and a welcome infusion of humor. Not all the stories are great, yet they work together in a way that develops Thomas's fictional Wales as a place of real solidity.I'm still not sure what to make of the last third of the book. They include the three chapters of Thomas's aborted novel \\"Adventures In The Skin Trade\\", which mix fantasy and realism yet seem to go nowhere. There's also \\"A Child's Christmas In Wales\\", Thomas's best-known story but really more of an overstuffed inventory of things Thomas remembered from his Yuletide past. It's not a story so much as a hazy reminiscence in the same way as other later efforts like \\"Return Journey\\" and \\"The Crumbs Of One Man's Year.\\" I was underwhelmed.But just as I was settling back into armadillo-reader mode, I came to \\"The Followers\\". Again, like with \\"After The Fair\\", there was something compelling in the murky storyline, in which the title characters stalk a woman with no malicious intent for reasons even they can't quite understand. The ending is either a wicked cheat or a clever nod to O. Henry, but like the similarly fantastic \\"One Warm Saturday\\", I found it worked quite well.So I wound up reading a bunch of stories I was indifferent to and a few I couldn't stand in exchange for four or five that wove a rare kind of magic. It was the kind of bargain I'd happily make again. Alas, it's not one I can recommend unreservedly."},{"Title":"Collected stories (The Collected stories of the world's greatest writers)","review":"This collection is a necessary part of the library of every Dylan Thomas aficionado.

Thomas lightened his load, by and by, with increasingly frequent jokes and essays into humour. In many ways the stories are an accurate account of the everyday absurdity of Everyman; by one who lived at the time personality was displaced by the development of commercial media hype. Thomas died at age 39 in 1953. If he'd lived a few more years he might have described to us the age of common emotion and undifferentiated humanity, which breaks down only under the influence of alcohol to anything interesting and never unique; that he interpolated and prophecied from his eavesdropping into the lives of his comtemporaries. (No, I don't think that sentence is too long and I think Dylan would have approved.) He didn't spare himself from his snooping. Much of the content is autobiographical.

The page with publication information says \\"Filiquarian Publishing, LLC is publishing this edition of Futility: Or The Wreck OF The Titan, due to its public domain status.\\" The fact that a book is in the public domain enables the publisher to avoid paying royalties, but publishing the work is more likely \\"due to\\" the profit motive. There is no mention of the original publication date. The text appears to be from the 1912 revision of the 1898 original.I can't figure out how this edition was thrown together.

The Titan hits an iceberg on its starboard side and sinks in the icy North Atlantic during the month of April. I wanted to read this story because it was believed by some that this story would foretell the sinking of the Titanic 14 years later. I found parts of the book to be interesting; but I had a hard time trying to follow all of the events without rereading some of the pages. At one point, I put the book down because it became a little boring at times. Overall, Futility is a good book to read, and no doubt was a good sea adventure in 1898! I cannot really say there is any similarities to the way the &quot;Titan&quot; sank compared to the Titanic disaster. I gave this book 4 stars, because Morgan Robertson spoke of important nautical terms (like the Titan's 19 watertight compartments, triple screw expansion,etc). These were on ocean liners of the late 1800's and early 1900's. Futility is not the best book I have ever read, but I think it was a pretty good one.

Unfortunately, once having read the story, most will find it a minor disappointment.&quot;Futility&quot; is not the epic story of a shipwreck. Indeed, the actual wreck and sinking of the &quot;Titan&quot; takes place over the course of only five paragraphs.Rather than a maritime disaster, the title &quot;Futility&quot; refers to the events surrounding the main character, John Rowland, before, on and after the &quot;Titan.&quot; Morgan Robertson (the author) uses the ship and wreck only to establish a circumstance in which Rowland's true character can be contrasted with the hypocracy of Victorian society.&quot;Futility&quot; is a novella, easily readable in about two hours. Robertson's writing is flowery by modern standards but always intelligible. After reading it, most are likely to understand why the book has been out of print for so long: it is not great literature. It is, however, part of the &quot;Titanic&quot; legend and therefor deserves to be on every &quot;Titanic&quot; buff's shelf.My strongest complaint with the 100th Anniversary Edition is the complete absence of editing. Mis-spellings abound and words are obviously omitted. Spell-check doesn't catch syntax errors or word substitutions such as &quot;to&quot; for &quot;two.&quot; We've all come to accept and expect this sloppiness in e-mail and on web-sites, but the printed word deserves closer scrutiny and better acuracy.Do buy the book.

April 15, 1912, the White Star luxury liner Titanic, on its much anticipated and publicized maiden voyage from Southampton to New York, collided with an iceberg somewhere in the freezing North Atlantic. Several hours later, the Titanic sank beneath its icy-cold waters. Over 1500 people were killed. In 1898, fourteen years before this horrifying tragedy, an American author by the name Morgan Robertson penned a short novel called Futility, which told the tale of a mammoth British liner doomed to strike an iceberg in the North Atlantic, killing nearly all on board. His ill-fated ship was named the Titan. This, nine years before the Titanic was ever conceived. An odd coincidence, maybe, but one peculiar enough to elicit goosebumps on the flesh of even the greatest skeptics of the paranormal. What is absolutely chilling is that Robertson's Titan was in fact nearly identical, detail for detail, to the true-life Titanic. From the vessels' time of sailing to their top speeds, from their dimensions to the number of passengers aboard, statistical data on both ships are hauntingly alike. Morgan Robertson, who died in 1915, surprisingly never received much acclaim or reputation for his book, and very little else is known about the man who claimed to have been inspired by an \\"astral writing partner\\". It is known, however, that he wrote fourteen novels, all ocean-faring adventures (Robertson himself spent his early life at sea). In addition to Futility, Beyond the Spectrum has also been included in the book you are now holding. It is yet another eerie example of his premonition, a short story alluding to a terrible war between the Japanese and Americans, as well as the use of secret super-radiation weapons. This, some forty-one years before the start of World War II, not to mention almost fifty years before the invention of the atomic bomb. Still odd coincidence?

From Lord's brief synopsis of Robertson's novel, I got the impression that \\"Futility\\" would be a comprehensive novel that went to great lengths to describe the ship (Titan), passengers, crew, disaster, and aftermath. I was very surprised when I opened the shipping box and instead received a very skimpy novelette, weighing in at a whole forty pages or so.Although \\"Futility\\" does have eerie similarities with the actual Titanic disaster, which makes it immediately of high historical novelty value, as a stand-alone novel in its own right it is simply not a very well-written piece of fiction. It has some nice ideas that should have been further developed. The cataclysmic sinking of the Titan is contained in about 1/3 a page, and amounts to \\"struck an iceberg, fell flat on her side, the end.\\"Amazingly, the extreme cold of the North Atlantic never seems to be an issue, as it is never mentioned. The story centers around a disgraced former US navy officer who, after his fall, became an ordinary seaman on the Titan. The plot revolves around his love affair (or lack of one) with a former girlfriend. The story is filled with cheesy dialog (even for 1890s Victorian standards) and interminable soliloquies that will have the reader rolling his or her eyes and going \\"whatever.\\"The plot of this story can be summed up thus:- Titan is a huge ship and represents Victorian decadence- Rowlands (the disgraced officer) loves some girl who's married to someone else- Girl mistakenly thinks Rowlands is trying to murder her toddler- Ship hits iceberg- Ship founders two paragraphs later- Rowlands rescues his ex girlfriend's toddler- Rowlands somehow defeats a 2,000 lb polar bear in hand to hand combat- no one gets hypothermia- the end.This story is interesting insofar as its similarity to the Titanic disaster, but beyond that, it is doggerel."},{"Title":"The Wreck of the Titan or, Futility","review":"According to http://www.im.gte.com/titanic/fof.html:English writer Morgan Robertson wrote Futility, an imaginary account of a collision between a largetrans-Atlantic oceanliner and an iceberg on her maiden voyage to New York.

The ship was far larger than any that had ever been built. The fictional characters on board were mostly the rich and famous. The ship set off on its first voyage. Halfway across the Atlantic, on a cold night in April, the make-believe ship hit and iceberg and sank. There was great loss of life.Robertson's book, entitled Futility, did not do well. Few people read it. Few people even knew about it.Certainly not the owners of the White Star Shipping Line.Fourteen years after the publication of the book, White Star built what was then the largest ocean liner in the world. In nearly every way, it was almost exactly like the one in Robertson's novel. Both were around 800 feet long and weighed between 60 and 70 thousand tons. Both vessels had triple propellers and could make 24 to 25 knots. Both could carry about 3,000 people, and both had enough lifeboats for only a fraction of this number. But, then, this wasn't supposed to matter; both ships were said to be &quot;unsinkable.&quot;On April 10, 1912, the real ship left England on her first voyage. On board were some of the richest and most famous people in the world. On a cold April night, about halfway across the Atlantic, the ship struck and iceberg. With great loss of life, she sank.The real ship, of course, was the Titanic. As for the name of the imaginary ship, the author called it the Titan.Taken from a book entitled &quot;Amazing True Stories&quot; by Don L.

The Titan is described as the largest ship created, and unsinkable. She has watertight compartments and only enough lifeboats to satisfy the law, but of course they won't be needed because nothing can sink this vessel.The book is very much a product of the Victorian era, from language to scenario. The publisher's foreword and introduction were extremely useful in explaining the discovery and reprinting of this story, and preparing me for the step back in time that I would be taking by reading it. There is an appalling, though not surprising, plot point using a negative Jewish character. There are other things that mark the story as being from 1898, but for all that it's a compelling read, and those who study the Titanic disaster should have this one on their shelves simply for its historic interest."},{"Title":"The Wreck of the Titan or, Futility","review":"I would call it an insipid sort of book, very loosely and clumsily constructed. If not for the fact that it resembled the Titanic disasterin some remote way, few would likely know about it. Its coincidence with the Titanic is not nearly so remarkable as some might make out. In fact, the 70-page story contains a few dozen sentences about the Titan and its wreck; most of the rest is unrelated and hard to understand. The style was very abrupt and choppy where the Titan was respected, and too prolific concerning the hero, John Rowland, by the way, who was altogether too heroic. His feminine love was much too perfect, of enough mention was made of her to be able to tell. The story centers selfishly around its hero, who, stranded on an island after the ship sank, one-handedly kills a polar bear with a jack knife to save the heroine's daughter.

I have been interested in the Titanic long before the movie &amp; was unable to find this book until now. Thank you Leo &amp; Amazon.com.

The story itself is only O.K., although the depiction of the greedy insurance agent that doesn't want to pay up for the wreck seems very true to life. Also has a somewhat drawn out and unromantic love story that one tires of, but it's a lot better than the cheesy love story from the recent Titanic flick.

The similarities between the Titan and the Titanic are mere coincidences, and the story is choppy and incoherent. This book is not a prophetic work. Perhaps if it were lengthened it would make a decent novel in its own right, but comparing it to the Titanic is a waste of time.

(You can ignore the ship on the cover: the Titan in the novel didn't have sails.) Robertson wrote the story before the RMS Titanic was designed, let alone built, and the fact that the Titan shared a lot with it historically (three propellers in a time when that was rare, the length that was only a few feet off, and it struck an iceberg on its maiden voyage and sank) is beside the point. As an historical sidenote, there was a copy of this book in the Titanic's library.The story itself is sentimental with many of the literary elements typical of the Victorian era: the gruff sailor with a heart of gold, the little girl who needs saving, and polar bears lurking behind every iceberg to attack unwary shipwrecked sailors.While the story would probably be more interesting to the historian as a chronological artifact, it's still enjoyable as an adventure of survival in a harsh climate following a disaster."},{"Title":"The Wreck of the Titan or, Futility","review":"Either this guy is psychic, or these stories were not written when they are said to have been. The story of the Titanic already was so amazing, so fantastic that it is easy to imagine that it may just be a story. Everything that happened with that ship was so perfectly fitting for a disaster on its maiden voyage, so good a story, that it actually was in &quot;Futility&quot;. But I ask you, how could so many details be so acurately described, even the name of the ship(Titan)? It is truly amazing. And that is why I, or anyone, has reason to believe that this story possibly was not written 1896, but after the real disaster. Think about it- it is just as logical, even more so, that &quot;Futility&quot; was written afterwards. And I see no way to prove either way, really."},{"Title":"The Wreck of the Titan or, Futility","review":"The book &quot;Futility&quot;, if taken alone, only deserves 1 star. Morgan Robertson, a self described &quot;visionary&quot;, was not a very good writer. His writing style was, in my opinion, a sure cure for insomnia! But on a fateful night in 1912 one of Robertson's books came true -- almost. He mispelled the name of the ship by two letters (Titan rather than Titanic) but everything else he got right: month, number of people on board, lifeboat capacity... the coincidences are astounding. If you choose Futility, be prepared for one of the worst written books you've ever read.... and chills down your spine!"},{"Title":"The Wreck of the Titan or, Futility","review":"I't's very odd how the book predicts history twice in two seperate short stories.

I have given the book a rating of 3 stars because although it would probably make the bestseller lists in the mid-1800's, the plots are rather simple for today."},{"Title":"The Wreck of the Titan or, Futility","review":"Futility or the Wreck of the Titan is definitely a book that deserves to be mentioned. However, many other books, documentaries, and so-called &quot;historians&quot; (e.g. Charles Pellegrino) have blown it out of porportion. Face it, it's a dry Victorian novel. Yes, I have to agree there are many coincidences -- number of passengers, collison with iceberg in April, the name of the ship. But they are JUST coincidences. Robertson was not only a WELL-KNOWN author in America and Britain, but a seaman who most likely kept up with all the shipping journals. It doesn't take much to predict what a ship might be like in the next 11 years. (construction of Titanic began about 1909)And when do icebergs begin to flow down to the middle latitudes? During the spring, of course, when it's warm. Also, most people never bring up the dissimilarities. For example, the Titan was on her third voyage, not maiden. She was heading toward England. The Titan had a hand full of survivors includin! ! g the captain and first officer versus the real ship, which lost over 1,500 people, including those two men. The people on the Titan experienced a haze or fog. The real people on the Titanic had a beautiful, though moonless night. Even so, only the beginning portion of the book is dedicated to the ship. Don't get me wrong, I do recommend reading the book as sort of a &quot;Titanic curiosity&quot;.

Add one more: &quot;If only they'd paid attention to Morgan Robertson.&quot; The &quot;Wreck of the Titan,&quot; is only one of several short stories in the book, &quot;The Wreck of the Titan.&quot; All of the stories deal with the sea, and through them, you can see that Mr. Roberts was very knowledgeable in all aspects of maritime science. Many of his stories deal with Annapolis, and one might assume that he was a graduate, though I have no way of knowing that for sure. Many of his stories show amazing insights - for example, in &quot;Beyond the Spectrum&quot; he speculates on a Pacific war between the United States and Japan, where submarines and secret weapons play an essential role. However, Robertson's main claim to fame was the title story: &quot;The Wreck of the Titan.&quot; Robertson knew everything about the Titanic disaster, fourteen years in advance. He knew where shipbuilding was going; he knew the length, and displacement of the next generation of ships, the power of their engines, the speeds they could achieve, and all about their &quot;safety&quot; features - including electronic control and communications systems and the approximate number of watertight compartments. He also knew that the ships carried too few lifeboats; that they raced at unsafe speeds through dangerous waters, and that watertight compartments wouldn't save a supposedly &quot;unsinkable&quot; ship if it sideswiped an iceberg. He even knew when and where a disaster was most likely to happen. He had his Titan sink in the month of April, just a few miles north of the actual spot where the Titanic went down. Was he clairvoyant? Probably not. In hindsight, his dire prediction should have been obvious to anyone. He realized that the way ships were being run a disaster was inevitable. On the other hand - what about the name of his mythical ship - the &quot;Titan.&quot; Just a lucky guess, perhaps. However, if that's true, then he guessed right twice. In his story &quot;Pirates&quot; he has a ship much larger than the Titan being torpedoed. Titanic buffs know that the Titanic had two sister ships, and that her younger and larger sister, the Britannic, was torpedoed in World War 1. However, &quot;Britannic&quot; was not the original name when the ship was first designed. White Star originally intended to call her the &quot;Gigantic.&quot; They changed the name after the Titanic disaster because &quot;Gigantic&quot; sounded too much like &quot;Titanic.&quot; So what was the name of Robertson's torpedoed super liner? The &quot;Gigantia.&quot; And one more thing - though I admittedly take this out of context - consider the following passage from &quot;Pirates:&quot; &quot;When he looked, the bow was under water, the stern rising in the air, higher and higher, until a third of the afterbody was exposed; then it slid silently, but for the bursting of air bubbles, out of sight in the depths.&quot; For all his insights, however, it has to be said that Robertson not a great writer. In fact, he was mediocre at best. Perhaps that's why his warnings went unheeded. Other than certain facts that turn out to be amazingly accurate, his plots are nonsensical. Still, the stories are entertaining, and there is a certain charm about all of his writings. This charm cannot be found in the great classics, because they are timeless; it can only be found in the lesser-known works of any era. Through Robertson, an average writer, we can gain rare insights into the mind of the average person of the Victorian era. From the way Robertson writes, it must have been an age of romance and chivalry. A world practically inconceivable by today's standards. Case in point: In Pirates, escapees from a military prison steal a supposedly deserted navy Destroyer. Once out to sea, however, the pirates discover that a single naval officer had been sleeping, unnoticed in the galley as they stole the ship. So what do these cutthroats do with him after they find him? Pitch him overboard, perhaps? Not quite. That would be murder; and just because they're pirates and condemned criminals, that doesn't make them murderers. Instead, they make him promise to behave, and and once he'd given his word of honor, they give him the respect he deserves as an officer, and complete freedom of the ship. Unbelievable!"},{"Title":"The Wreck of the Titan or, Futility","review":"It is strange that reviewers of this book so often obviously haven't read it. The World War II story as it seems to be, appears to have been written in 1912 though the list of three copyright dates in this four short-story book don't specify what date belongs to what story. There is no preface or introduction. No claims are being made no explanations offered. There are no sun bombs in Beyond the Spectrum, the afor mentioned story; just an amazing description of a lazer the Japanese use to cause a temporary blindness in American navel forces. It's as if the writer had a vision of the blinding light of an attomic blast and a lazer and thought the two were somehow related. He refers to the light emited as a radiation three or four times. A description of a WWII submarine and the persecution of American Japanese is right on. The Titan story is just as suprising, but again reviewers site some parallels that don't exist. The link that brought me here said there would be material from Dr. Ian Stevenson included. There isn't."},{"Title":"The Wreck of the Titan or, Futility","review":"The book is actually a collection of Robertson's short sories, including Futility, The Pirates, Beyond the Spectrum, and In the Valley of the Shadow. I have read both Futility and Spectrum, since these stories have gotten a lot of press lately. Much has been made of Robertson's tales about a great steamer named the Titan and the Titanic. Yes, there are a number coicidences between the two, but the stories diverge in a number of ways.Robertson displays an arrogance amongst the crew and the owners that exceeds even that of the Titanic and White Star Line. Sheer hubris sank the Titan; a blend of hubris and ineptitude sank the Titanic (see Lord, W., The Night Lives On). The Titan sinks almost instanstanously with almost no survivors; its demise differs quite a bit from the Titanic's. The story also spends a lot of time on the attempt to make an insurance claim for the loss from Lloyd's of London and where the liability for the tragedy lies. Finally, there is a subplot about a Titan crew member, his emotional breakdown, his heroism during the disaster, and the near tragic results afterward for him.The story was fairly interesting, the writing rather stilted (which I would expect for a story written a century ago), but it was not a great piece of literature. Like most people, my interest was peaked by the hype; the reality makes the story a bit disappointing, except where there is convergence between fact and fiction, which I must admit, are quite intriguing.The innacuracies in the comments about Spectrum make it even more disappointing than Futility. Yes, there is the Japanese attack on US interests in the Pacific, with the attack on Hawaii a component of that attack, and it's not clear to me that a war actually ensued. There are no airplanes and bombs mentioned in the story, and the weapon that blind combatants is designed to do only that. (The reviews intimate that the weapon is actaully a nuclear device, which it is not). The story focuses on bringing justice to the perpetrators, and the story of that weapon offers an interesting twist regarding its genesis.This story is a short read, only twenty pages, and again, the style is what you would expect from nearly a century ago. But beyond the superficial coincidences between the story and WWII, the hype and the reality are clearly disconnected.My suggestion, find the book in a library before investing twenty plus dollars in it. The stories are more intriguing curiosities rather than great literary pieces, and one should be sure they want to add this to their library before they make the purchase."},{"Title":"The Wreck of the Titan or, Futility","review":"I bought this book because it was referanced in an episode of the tv show \\"One Step Beyond\\".

It does not have the rich historical background of the &quot;Killer of Go&quot;, but this is only to be expected from a book that is, primarily, a workbook.On the practical side, this book does a far better job of examining tesuji than any other book on the same topic I've seen. Instead of subjecting the reader to a barrage of unfamiliar situations, Sakata (for the most part) takes his examples from joseki or almost joseki (&quot;the following pattern is joseki- but what if white plays here instead?&quot;). This gives the book a firm foundation and teaches you &quot;real board&quot; tactics as you study the problems. It is probably, for this reason, a little less comprehensive than some tesuji books, it being more efficient, space-wise, to merely present the relevant shapes without further discussion. However, since most tesuji books are so tedious that they never get finished, a comprehensive understanding of tesuji probably wouldn't be forthcoming from other tesuji books either. And at a certain level, of course, there are some things you only learn by playing."},{"Title":"Children's Blue Bird","review":"I have read this book several times over the years and have enjoyed it more each time.

He is also one of the best writers in psychology, and he has done a masterful job &quot;translating&quot; scientific jargon into words we all can understand.

I was captured from the first sentence to the final quote.&quot; Now, it must be said that certain readers are going to be disappointed with this excellent book. It is not a Fodor's-type travel guide to social interactions in China, and it's too complex and humble to be of much use to businesspeople eager to exploit the Chinese market.

It's the best."},{"Title":"Beyond the Chinese Face: Insights from Psychology","review":"I think the reader from Victoria, BC, Canada was probably most right here in this forum. You have to know what you can expect and what you cannot. What you cannot expect here, is a guide to the thinking of around 1,5 billion people, because that is the number of people we're talking about.And they are very very different, I would dare to say more different than any other ethnic (can we say so?) group worldwide: you have ABCs (American born Chinese), their parents and certainly CBCs, Aussie BCs and so on. There are Singapore-Chinese and overseas Chinese in other Asian countries. Taiwan Chinese and Hong Kong Chinese. And then there is this huge mainland area with around 1.3 billion Chinese, where the living conditions differ so greatly that it's hard to imagine for anyone who hasn't been there.All those people are Chinese, but the all have different backgrounds: capitalistic system or planned economy (though even the mainland is shifting very quickly towards capitalism, stronger than outsiders usually see), freedom of speech or getting killed for speaking out the truth, diversity or open hate from other societal groups (e.g. Indonesia) and so on and so on. And then there is the fact that people differ even within a society, with the result that you could very easily meet Chinese people from, say Beijing, who are very open sexual and have more sexual experience than, say, an American 30 year old who never had a girlfriend. Nevertheless it's a fact that most Chinese are not like that but instead having less sexual experience than their western counterparts (I'm not judging this, just stating the fact as the book says it and also as my own experience supports it).Now, one could say (and 3 other readers did so) that this book is therefore useless. I strongly disagree. First of all the author states exactly this fact at the beginning and warns about generalisations (as every psychological book should do so). Second the information he gives is in around 95 % of the cases supported by my own experience (nationality: German; 8 months living in Hong Kong, studying Business and Chinese and working, travelling on the mainland to Shanghai/ Beijing/ Guangzhou/ Shenzhen, also having lived in the US for 6 months meeting quite a few ABCs,).So use this guide as a background information but not as a \\"now I know everything about Chinese\\"- guidebook. Nobody will ever know everything about the Chinese, simply because there are no \\"Chinese\\" as such. But this is the general problem of all social sciences where there is no 1+1=2 like in maths. Knowing that, this book helps you a bit and gives you quite a few \\"I see!\\"s on your journey into the fascinating Chinese culture (which is indeed possible for a non-Chinese although the reader from San Francisco obviously doesn't think so).

A colleague lent me \`Beyond the Chinese Face' in my first week here in Hong Kong. I have lived in several different countries and cultures, and so have at least an intellectual understanding of different perspectives and ways of seeing the world. But it is amazing how unhelpful one's intellectual awarenesses are when faced with understanding actual events or situations in a new cultural setting. What \`Beyond the Chinese Face' managed to do for me was to assist me in building a framework in which to understand what I observed on a daily basis. By enabling me to feel that I understood more about the context I was in, I felt more relaxed, and so was able to engage with different customs and rules more easily. Even Hong Kong bureaucracy became more comprehensible! I liked the fact that the book made it clear that many of the existing research studies are flawed, but the overall patterns emerging from research were clearly laid out.

An important guide to dealing with the major economical influence of our time!"},{"Title":"Beyond the Chinese Face: Insights from Psychology","review":"What an insightful, sensible, readable and informative book that explores the question that many ask about other cultures - &quot;HOW and WHY do others think and behave as they do?&quot; Without a doubt an expert in his field, Dr. Michael Bond masterfully weaves for the reader an explanation to this question in a thorough and understanding fashion. A fascinating, yet understandable voyage into Chinese culture. This small yet valuable book truly goes - &quot;Beyond the Chinese Face.&quot;"},{"Title":"Beyond the Chinese Face: Insights from Psychology","review":"A very poorly written book. Being short, yet conprising a very large number of sub-sections, the book tries to cover a lot of ground, but fails to deliver anything of substance. Even the author concedes the studies for the book are conducted almost exclusively on Chinese immigrants in the US. So the book disproportionately presents a view on the Chinese immigrant community, and should be more appropriately titled &quot;Beyond the IMMIGRANT Chinese Face.&quot; But even at that, Mr. Harris FAILED to do a decent job. Ninety percent of the book is devoted to presenting social phenomena, without any coherent analysis. And what little analysis he manages is based purely on Western psychology, whose applicability to Chinese is at best questionable.For writing, Mr. Harris gets a B-. Again, short sections are strewn together without presenting any coherent views. The book demonstrates Mr. Harris' very LIMITED if not flawed understanding of Chinese culture.All in all, a poo! rly written book. I'd suggest you put your money else where."},{"Title":"Beyond the Chinese Face: Insights from Psychology","review":"I read Mr. Harris' book while on the way back from China, after studying in Beijing as an exchange student. Reflecting upon my experiences in China, I was amazed at how Mr. Harris distorts the truth. Almost everything he says in the book is incomplete or distorted. If anyone wants to know more about China and its people, the best way is to go and visit, and see for himself. The worst he can do is read Mr. Harris diminutive lies. I regret my parents wasted their money to buy this book for me."},{"Title":"Beyond the Chinese Face: Insights from Psychology","review":"The fundamental flaw in this book is that it is written by an American. For any Westerner to presume that they can, with authority, describe what makes Chinese tick is ludicrous. The book is all the more damaging because it is written in a style that leads some readers to believe it is based on scientific study by a well-healed professional.I know the author of this book. I have seen him as a client, and was dismayed by his lack of understanding of Chinese people. He is an American who has lived in Hong Kong for over twenty-five years, but has retained his American viewpoint. When his book came out, my Chinese husband and I both read it. There are so many Western-style generalizations about Chinese people in this book that it is an insult to all Chinese. I was very surprised to see it still on the shelves of the foreign language section of Xinhua Book Store the last time I was in Beijing."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"Even though I'm older than the average reader of this series, I was still drawn into it. My daughter was the one who introduced me to this series and I have to admit, I really enjoyed it. The whimsical way the author portrays the different characters was a refreshing change from my usual fare of fantasy.If you love fantasy, you'll like this seires. Start with the first book though.**A book I would also recommend is The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. This, the first installment of The Morcyth Saga is a great beginning for a new author.

Children and Adults will enjoy this story. The mix of humor and fantasy is a perfect blend. They are easily read - and are not all that deep, but if your up for an enjoyable laugh out loud read, then you must get these books.Each book is told by a different character, but all pretty much include the same cast as the others. If I have read it twice then there is no reason for anyone not to read it once. The different views add for an enjoyable time in the thoughts of that particlar character.

These books follow the adventures of a princess named Cimorene, who just refuses to be propper. Instead she is a bright, strong, and humerous person altogether, she is what was considerd the opposite of a princess. So what dose she do? She runs off to live with the Dragons in the Mountains of Morning. There she can study any activityes she forbiden to do back at the castle (fencing, magic, polotics, latin, ....) and she gets the adventures she always dreamed about, from Melting pescy wizards and fighting giant rock snakes to geting Maried to the man of her dreams.These books are the story of a princess who dared to dream of a life...... a life she wanted.I would definatly recomend these books to anyone who enjoys the Tales of King Arthur and Masterppice of Eragon."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"If you like fantasy and you've never read The Enchanted Forest Chronicles, get over to the library right now!

I recommend this series to anyone who loves fantasy!"},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"This series is wonderful. I originally bought it too read to my two year old daughter at bed time. We both look forward to story time now and have even added a chapter in at nap time because she is excited about this book. I like that this has a strong female lead and casts a negative light on the silly empty headed princess' It seems alot better to show our daughters in books that princesses don't have to wait to be rescued sometimes they rescue themselves. Great read for anyone who still reads magical stories."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"I read this book and the others in the series over and over when I was younger. It was one of my favorite \\"fairy tales,\\" combining fantasy, princesses, and girl power. The main character was determinedly sensible about completely ridiculous situations, and was able to launch herself on adventures while still employing common sense. It was nice to read a fantasy story where the heroine didn't run around reacting on emotion to everything. Moreover, the author has an energetic and funny way of writing that keeps the story moving quickly. Even now, years later, I'd still buy another book in the series if one were to ever be released."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"Well, i have to tell you, i am no fantasy fan. 9 out of 10 times i will continue to choose a good Science Fiction book over Fantasy, but the Enchanted Forest books are DEFINITELY the exception to that. My older cousin lent me them in an omnibus a llloooonnngg time ago, ima guess like 2001-02 (which is long for me, cause im only 19), i remember he gave me a brief over view of the world the books take place in, im guessing cause i asked him if he had any books like \\"The Lord of The Rings\\" and he told me about this. I was apprehensive at first, being like 12 or 13, i wasn't sure if i'd even be down for reading about dragons, wizards, and what not, or even if it could hold my interest for more than the first 3 pages (as his version had a plain color cover, containing all of the books in it, pretty much looked old as dirt), but i forced myself to open up and start reading after he encouraged me to barrow it until i was done with it. AND MAN, WHAT AN IMAGINATION OF THE AUTHOR! I mean really, a forest that moves? Magic, dragons, enchanted forrest critters, its amazing at how he flawlessly included it all in his writing! He goes into so much detail as to actually talk about the science of dragons and magic (if my memory serves me right). And its not an impossibly intellectual read either, not that thats bad, but at the time i was like 10 or 11 ( i'm no child prodigy, trust me) and i could NOT put the book down. I wanted to know more and more about this world, i wanted to see where the story goes and couldn't help but keep reading it well past my bedtime. I burnt through the omnibus in probably a month or two, then kept going back to read little excerpts over and over again until i gave it back to him (fter probably a year or two of procrastinating). The only thing that really sucks about this series is that (from what i remember my cousins girlfriend saying) the author is dead. And last time i checked (Which was about the time i finished), no one has even attempted tackling his world, and maybe it should stay that way, or not. I WANTED TO KNOW MORE WHEN THE LAST BOOK ENDED!!!! Anyways, this series is superbly written, and is DEFINITELY a reason why today i love writing stories. I love these books, and i hope to buy the complete set soon, as my cousin i think has lost his omnibus of the series. READ THIS !!!"},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"I first read this series in high school. Since then, I have read them to fifth and sixth grade English students, and now, my high school drama kids will read pieces for classroom exercises. My favorites are one and two which, to be honest, I tend to view as a single story told in two volumes. While the first and second books are, undeniably, my favorites, the third and fourth--as well as the short story about the same characters (found in \\"Book of Enchantments\\")--are charming.Book 1: Cimorene is anything but a proper princess. She loathes the idea of standing around with a look of vacuous stupidity, staring up at some equally empty-headed prince. She decides to take steps to control her own life, and she does.Book 2: Mendanbar is an overwhelmed king with an underwhelmed steward who wants to see him married to any princess. A problem takes a displeased Mendanbar to meet a princess who he assumes will not have \\"enough common sense to fill a teaspoon\\"...but he discovers (thank goodness) she has a brain!Book 3: Cimorene and Mendanbar work together to save the kingdom with the help of Kazul, the dragon king, and Morwen, the witch with sleeves like Mary Poppins' bag, and other friends. (My memory may be a bit sketchy on this one as it was borrowed from me...As I recall, there's less Mendanbar in this story than I'd like; the highlight of this one is the dialogue of the cats.)Book 4: Daystar, Cimorene and Mendanbar's son, sets off to set the Enchanted Forest to rights after a wizard finds them. In this one, we learn how the Forest recognizes the heir to the throne which is really fun.These appeal to all ages. My mother has read them multiple times, as have I. Also, these are the books that hooked my (significantly) younger sister on reading when she was in junior high. I highly recommend these and that you look into other Patricia C. Wrede books. Even as an adult, I have never been disappointed when I've picked a new one up; Ms. Wrede's books have never failed to entertain. She has an enchanted pen."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"These books are a joy to read at any age.

In the third the story is a little slower in the third,but the witch and her cats kept me laughing the whole time. Maybe it is because their blunt, witty coments, seemed to be exactly what one of my cats would say. Very funny.The fourth takes a different angle on the Forest, and keeps youn wondering the whole time. It has the best characters from all the books, and it playfully pokes fun at other classic fairy tales.The entire series is charming.

What initially attracted me, though, was the cover art, and I must admit that I purchased the boxed set of the entire series based on the art alone. However, the first story, Dealing with Dragons, is definitely worth picking up. Wrede tells a familiar story - a reluctant princess, a wise dragon, bumbling princes, scheming wizards, and a plot for power is hardly new ground, but Wrede's writing style is very natural and refreshing. A quick and satisfying read appropriate for all ages."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"I have loved this series since I was in the 5th grade!

It took me a few years to discover that there were sequels, but boy was I excited when I found them.This series stands out in my mind, even today among the Harry Potters and Twilights. The story, beginning with a princess who hates the princess norm (being a airheaded twit) and ending with a full-on assault on a magic castle in the middle of an enchanted forest, is expertly crafted, yet not overloaded with descriptions and unneccesary poetry (I'm looking at you, Tolkien). The characters are unique and well characterized, and the story always seems to be making fun of conventional fantasy norms.If you're looking for brave kings, beautiful princesses, and hungry dragons, you'll find them here; just make sure you leave the 'proper' cliches at the first page."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"purchased vol 1 as a gift for my 10-yr-old granddaughter.

(The original book was published back in 1990) I must have checked out each of the four book about 10 times. They are the 'fractured' fairy tale story of a non-traditional princess, Cimorene. The kind of princess that I was, who enjoyed cooking, reading, and wanted adventure. She 'signed up' to be a dragons princess and when she was told she couldn't and it 'wasn't done' her answer was to simply say \\"well I'm a princess, and I did it.\\"15 years later I am thrilled to find this series available in a box set (and for under 20 dollars no less!) After man trips to second hand bookstores I found the first book about 5 years ago and re-read it. There are few things in life that add up to what you remember as a child. Only now, months from my wedding, I'm thrilled to be ordering this box set for a different reason. They (though long) are the perfect bedtime story to read to a 'nontypical' kid.

It's a great series even if you're a little older, and there are some great twists on your classic faerie tales. Wrede is one of my favorite authors and she has fantastic character development.

Cimorene is self-possessed, practical, unflappable and straightforward: confronted by social pressures, unreason and outright aggression, Cimorene never loses her cool or gives in on what she believes to be right. We meet her as a young girl, a princess in a storybook kingdom who is completely uninterested in living out the same old stories or in accepting the roles that are set out for her: Saved by a prince? Yawn. Zapped by a fairy godmother? No thank you. Cimorene wants to be her own person and think her own thoughts, and she sneaks in fencing classes and magic-making and history lessons whenever she can, although she is continually thwarted by her tradition-bound parents. When she is given an ultimatum to get married to some boring schnook of a prince or else, Cimorene comes up with a third alternative, and runs away to go live with a dragon -- this is fate is acceptable to the folks back home, who believe that Cimorene's been taken prisoner, although really she's exactly where she wants to be.Her character is so wonderful and so wonderfully plain-spoken, level-headed and able to confront problems, so delightfully determined to think for herself and to defuse conflict whenever she can, using logic and commonsense... Cimorene really is a great role model and has a refreshingly original voice. Well, at least in the first book. Books Two and Three (\\"Searching For Dragons\\" and \\"Calling On Dragons\\") both drag horribly... I wouldn't say that Wrede is uninspired, but she sure gets repetitive, and both stories grind on with extended periods of little action and lots of talk, but it's repetitive talk with multiple chapters that recycle the same ideas over and over again... Schtick that's okay the first few times -- a longwinded, wonky magician, a whiny enchanted donkey -- wears thin when overused, and Wrede also develops an unfortunate tendency to repeat long specialized phrases over and over, which contributes to a sense of monotony: a bad-guy named Arona Michaelear Grinogion Vamist is constantly referred to by his full name -- never just \\"Vamist\\" -- similarly, the Head Wizard Of The Society Of Wizards is referred by by his full title, a magical plant called invisible dusk-blooming chokeweed is always called \\"invisible dusk-blooming chokeweed,\\" and never just plain old \\"chokeweed.\\" Thus the dialogue and the narration grow stiff and unnatural, conversations become boring and the story stalls out... This dynamic begins in the second book, and overwhelms the third, which was, frankly, a chore to finish.Still, these are compelling books. The first is fabulous, the second okay (and you could stop there if you wanted) and while the third book is a drag, it ends in a cliffhanger, and you really have to read the fourth book to get closure. Also worth checking out is Wrede's collection of short stories, which refers back to this series. You could just read the first book - indeed, you *have to* read the first one, but be forewarned that the rest of the series might not live up to the high hopes at the beginning of the journey. That being said, assuming that someday a movie will be made of this series, I can assure you that we will be first in line once it comes. 'Nuff said.

It was generally passed from her to me and back again as we each rd to through. It is a book that young children and adults alike can read and appreciate.It is filled with colorful decriptions, beautifully written it captures the imagination in such a way that many authors have not written. In a topic such as witches, wizards, dragons, and fairy tales it can be quite difficult to write a story that in such a way that has not been written about before. The author of the Enchanted Forest Chronicles has accomplished the difficult. I still have not read a book similar to it.I highly recommend this book for anyone. If you have a child third grade or above, especially one that loves to read, I would highly recommend this book. Below third grade readers I would recommend this book as a read together or read from book. A fantastic book well worth the money spent to acquire it. Warning: This book is a page turner and you may very well likely find yourself having to buy more than one copy as it is such a good book it is easy to read until it falls apart."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"I had originally read \\"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles\\" 10 years ago, but somehow lost it.

Highly recommended for fantasy readers of all ages."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"Cimorene is not your ordinary princess. In fact, she's exactly the opposite: she's sensible, interested in magic and sword fighting, doesn't want to get married, and isn't afraid of dragons! These are some of the greatest making-fun-of-fantasy fantasy books ever! All fantasy lovers looking to get out of the old cliched plots will find their answers here!Book One: Dealing With Dragons. In which Cimorene runs away from home, becomes a dragon's princess, learns magic, helps solve a murder and defeat and evil wizard, and helps Kazul (the dragon) to become king. What a romp!Book Two: Searching For Dragons. In which Mendenbar (king of the enchanted forest) has some problems with wizards and withering plants, goes to find Kazul to see if dragons are responsible, finds Cimorene instead, hears that Kazul is missing, sets off to look for her with Cimorene, has misadventures with a pink teddybear-covered flying carpet, nearly gets killed, rescues Kazul, and marries Cimorene. Whew, I'm tired just reading it here!Book Three: Calling On Dragons. In which Morwen tells the story, wizards start to invade the enchanted forest AGAIN, they meet a gigantic rabbit named Killer which then turns into a blue donkey, the king's sword is stolen, Killer, Morwen, nine cats, Cimorene and Telemain (the magician) set off to find it leaving Mendenbar home, they have adventures with wizards, firewitches, poisonous plants, and magic mirrors, they find the sword and bring it back, the king is captured and locked away by the wizards, the wizards have put up a protective bubble around the castle so no one but them can get in, the dragons put up another bubble so the wizards can't get in, Cimorene takes her baby boy Daystar out of the enchanted forest to wait for him to grow up so he can take back the castle, and the book ends in a stand off. Whoa!Book Four: Talking To Dragons. In which, Daystar is grown up, Cimorene sends him into the enchanted forest with a strange sword, he meets a lizard named Suz, he encounters a firewitch named Shiara who likes to be rude, they set off together, wizards pervade the scene with their terrible magic, nasty elves and firewitches try to kill them, they meet Morwen who gives them a cat named Nightwitch, they meet a young dragon who decides to accompany them, Shiara turns into a statue, Telemain directs them to travel through the Caves of Chance where they meet the terrible quozzel, find a key, and are buried under a rock slide, Kazul appears and tells Daystar how to break the spell on the castle, he breaks the castle, meets Mendenbar, finds his father, has the last battle with the wizards, and a happy ending (involving Morwen and Telemain) occurs.

I only have one problem, and that is with the first book. Cimorene seems to blink every two pages over something. Yes, I am perfectly well aware that blinking is a normal funtion of everyday life, but why it's necessary to tell the reader that Cimorene's doing it every chance you get is beyond me. You don't hear \\"Cimorene inhaled\\" anywhere in the book. Regardless. They're absolutely worth the money, although I lucked out when my aunt picked up the complete volume for me at her used bookstore. If I didn't own them, I would buy them. And I advise anyone with a sense of humour and a taste for light fantasy to do so as well."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"I am always on the lookout for interesting fantasy entries and remember stumbling upon Dealing with Dragons a while back. I had all but forgotten about this series until following some links here on Amanzon off Harry Potter lists. The is a wonderfully interesting series. The first book does an excellent job providing background and character development. The second book, Searching for Dragons, is a continuation to Dealing with Dragons, but introduces a new character while keeping it's roots with the original characters clear. Calling on Dragons, the third installment may be the best of the series while Talking to Dragons wraps it up neatly.

The main character comes alive in Wrede's writing so that you get to know her and feel like she's a good friend of yours.

She is a fencing, Latin reading, magic using, juggling, princess that also cooks cherry jubilee and volunteers for dragons. In the fairytale world that she has grown up in; there are many thing that are considered improper for a princess to do. Cimorene enjoys doing almost everything that is improper, unlike her fellow princesses that are also living as captured dragons' princesses. While she is Kazul's princess she discovers many things about herself, dragons, and her world. Some of what Cimorene learns is the correct behavior in different societies, and some are things that are just silly in hers. While Cimorene is making all of her different friends she discovers universal aspects; such as being polite, standing up for what is right, and it is always best to be yourself. This book is an award wining story and has honorable mention on multiple book lists since 1990 when it was first published. It could even be categorized as a Women's Rights book, do to the freeing of the female stereotype the character goes through. Any age of women can enjoy this book for its diversity in themes and humor, along with the fantasy world were dragons are intelligent magical creatures."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"Patricia Wrede has become one of our families favorite authors. This 4 book collection has become our favorite gift for little girls from 7 to 10. It is a funny play on fairy tales. It reads aloud easily for bedtime stories. It can be also be read by the older more advanced readers. My boys enjoyed it when we read it as a family but there are better books to give to boys."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"I read the first of these books and liked it quite a bit. The Enchanted Forest is certainly for children, but it also does a great deal in attempting to remove gender stereotypes, letting a female character reject traditional gender roles and be her own strong person. That is until the second book. In the second book she is declawed completely, she becomes dependent on a man to protect her, make decisions and guide the group. When another man speaks too smartly for her, she needs a man to explain things in lame terms, despite supposedly being very well read and educated. He's better in a fight than her and protects her, he's smarter than her and protects her and she quickly finds herself relegated more to domestic duties. It's like somehow the writer utterly failed to realize that she demonstrated exactly the kind of thing that the first book railed against. What's worse is the female lead who manages to create her own power in the first book, gives it up in the second to be with the man and share his. I found this extremely disappointing. I would of rated this higher had the story not pulled a one eighty and destroyed everything it worked so hard to create."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"I loved these books when I was a kid.

Thank you for the quick delivery and overall quality of the books."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"These are wonderful books; YA, certainly, but highly readable by adults.Will Shetterley, of the Scribblies _ the Minneapolis-area writers' group which also gave us Emma Bull, Wrede herself, Steven Brust and Kara Dalkey - describes a bookstore in one of his novels which has a section entitled \\"Children's and Unusually Perceptive Adults' Fiction\\". That's where these books would belong.(One of the books, BTW, is dedicated to the other Scribblies.)If you read and enjoy Diana Wynne Jones or Tamora Pierce's fiction, you should love these. They are literally magical, full of Beautiful Princesses (Cimorene, the main protagonist of three of the books, is a princess who refuses to fulfill her princessly duties, gets a job as a dragon's housekeeper, and chases away all the knights who come to \\"rescue\\" her...), Dastardly Wizards, Clever Witches and Enchanted Rabbits.Not to mention fire witches and Invisible Dusk-Blooming Chokevines.I cannot too highly recommend them.However, there is that little matter i referred to in this review's title, which might frustrate some people - a matter of sequence.Simply put, though the stories of the four books are, indeed, sequential, the fourth was actually written some time *before* the others.And, because of this, the first three books are one big spoiler for the fourth book.Which wouldn't be so bad; just read the fourth book first...*Except* that Book Four, in its turn, is an even bigger spoiler for the first three books.Not to worry - it's not like knowing a lot about the story in advance is going to spoil Wrede's cheerfully-skewed story lines or her nicely humourous prose.Buy. Read. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"I really liked the book. It was a good story. It was about a girl with long black hair who had to marry a prince. She did not want to. She went to a pond. There was a frog who could talk. He was really a dragon.

It's about a princess, Cimorene, who absolutely REFUSES to be proper. She is forced to do standered princess things like learning manners and how loudly to scream when she's being carried away by a giant. How boring. But she manages to sneak in fencing lessons, magic lessons, etc. On day she is going to be forced to marry (ICK!!!) and she runs away to become a dragon's princess.One thing I love about these books is that each one is from a different person's point of view. #1 feaures Cimorene, #2, Mendanbar, #3, Morwen, and #4, Daystar. To find out who these people ARE, of course, you'll have to read the books yourself!"},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"This review about the second book in the series. I've read all of them and especially like this one. It all starts when the king of the Enchanted Forest takes a day off. Cimorene and Mendenbar, the king, are great companions and have hysterical adventures. A fun adventure for excited kids. One of my favorite series. I highly recommend it for girls and boys under 100 (that basically means the whole family)."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"The Enchanted Forest series is a childhood favorite of mine. It's the perfect story for that little girl who knows that its the knights who need to be rescued, and that damsels in distress are some of the best actresses. You meet Cimorene, a strong willed princess who would rather learn how to fence than when to scream during a giant's abduction. When she runs away to keep from being married off, she meets a dragon who accepts her as her princess.

I love princess Cimorene, and the whole idea of the unorthodox characters. Cimorene is not an ordinary princess, but then, none of the characters are as you would normally think of them.

The books you can finish in a day if you're dedicated (and believe me you will be!)If the book your reading right now is on the slow side read this and you'll be rejuvinated!

Now together in a boxed set, this is one of the funnier, more imaginative reworkings of more typical fantasy and fairy tales.&quot;Dealing with Dragons&quot; introduces Princess Cimorene, youngest daughter of the king of Linderwall. Like most medieval tomboys, Cimorene is considered rough, unseemly and stubborn -- she wants to fight with swords and learn magic. On the advice from a magic frog, she goes out in search of a dragon tobe housekeeper for. But when she's not sending away valiant knights, she's dealing with some very troublesome wizards...&quot;Searching For Dragons&quot; picks up when the dragon Kazul goes mysteriously missing. Cimorene is, unsurprisingly, very concerned about this and wants to find her. Enter Mendanbar, a young king as unconventional as Cimorene -- not to mention in need of a wife. But even though he goes along to find Kazul, with wizards and laughter all around, he'll find that he's much more interested in Cimorene.&quot;Calling on Dragons&quot; skips ahead to when Cimorene and Mendanbar are mrried, and Queen Cimorene is pregnant. All is right, right? Wrong. Magic is vanishing in the Enchanted Forest; the king's sword has been stolen. To combat the troublesome wizards, Morwen the witch teams up with Cimorene, Kazul, Telemain the Magician, and a rabbit called Killer.&quot;Talking to Dragons&quot; skips ahead even further, to when Daystar is sent off by his mom Cimorene with only a magic sword. Poor kid -- he has to help King Mendanbar escape from an evil wizard's spell, without knowing that Mendanbar is his father. He teams up with a hot-tempered firewitch, Shiara, a dragon, a lizard, and a rather annoying princess. Can Daystar clue in before all is lost?The new four-volume release from Magic Carpet Books is a good one, with quirky cover illustrations and better quality. While the first book is the best, the following ones each have their own measure of charm. The third book is a little weak at times, and the dragons are a bit less prominent in the fourth book, but each one is still quite enjoyable.Cimorene is a solid, likable heroine who doesn't like being a stuffy princess, and much prefers keeping house for a dragon, learning magic, and cooking cherries jubilee. Mendanbar is a good love interest, quirky and pleasant enough; Morwen and Kazul are excellent supporting characters.So if you're a fan of fractured fairy tales, dragon politics and melting wizards, this series will be at the top of your list. Highly recommended for those who like their fantasy with a dash of comedy."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"I love this series.I first encountered these books in sixth grade, when my teacher began to read Dealing with Dragons to my class. She never finished it, and I forget why I began to read it, but after I had finished it, I loved it. For a long time, I didn't even know that it was part of a series. I read and reread the book so many times that the paperback spine broke, and I had to finally replace it. When I did replace it, I bought the entire series.I always tell people that this is a great series for young adults who like fantasy, and that the first book (Dealing with Dragons) can stand alone pretty well. It is a series that uses common tropes from fairy tales and fantasy myths, but satirizes and mocks them. For example, in Dealing with Dragons, Cimorene (the very IMPROPER princess) meets a talking frog... but one that she doesn't need to kiss, although he offhandedly remarks that he's met a couple enchanted frogs in the past. :)The second book, Searching for Dragons, is a continuation to Dealing with Dragons, but it introduces a new character, Mendenbar, the ruler of the Enchanted Forest (and we discover why the series is called The Enchanted Forest Chronicles) and revisits some of the older characters. Calling on Dragons, which is one of my favorites in the series, focuses on the witch Morwen-- it is the silliest of all of them, in my opinion, mostly because of Morwen's cats. Finally, Talking to Dragons, which is my least favorite of the series, ties up some of the loose ends. Unfortunately, this final book takes place one generation from the lovable Mendenbar and Cimorene, and it is kind of disconcerning to lose them but keep Wrede's wit. But, the series is fun, the characters are (for the most part) wonderful and unforgettable, and it is a very creative (but underrated) fantasy series that I strongly recommend."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles are an amaizing collection of fun and witty fantasy books. Written mostly from the third person point-of-view, they tell of a wonderful, exciting world which you just can't get enough of!The first , Dealing with Dragons, follows the spunky, strong-willed, yet lovable Princess Cimorene on her journy to get away from her dreadfully normall kingdom and embark on an adventure, in wich she befriends dragons, meets witches, and melts some wizards. I thoughroly enjoyed this book! But be warned: after you pick up this one, you simply MUST read the others as well!The second book, Searching for Dragons, focuses on Mendanbar, king of the enchanted forest, as he meets up with the same great characters from Dealing with Dragons and many equally great new characters on his journeys to save the enchanted forest. An amaizing tale, it's hard to see how Wrede was able to match the greatness of the first one, but yet she does, with great skill!The third book, Calling on Dragons, is more centered around the witch, Morwen, as she teams up with dragons, donkey-rabbits, firewitches, and many other fun characters to rescue the King's magic sword from meddling wizards. Again, Wrede dazzles us with her ability to keep the story alive and exciting.The fourth, and final, book in the series, Talking to Dragons, follows Cimorene's son, Daystar, on his quest to return order to the enchanted forest. Although he doesn't even know it, but it seems that everyone else does!! along the way he meets a young dragon and a hot-headed fire witch, who aid in his quest. Although my least favorite in the series (this book is told in the 1st person point-of-view) Wrede doesn't fail to give her readers a fun and captivating story!I highly reccommend this set! not just for the younger audience, but adults as well; I am fifteen, and LOVED them, and my Aunt (who is quite a few years my senior) enjoyed them as well. These books will make you wish you too could share in the fantastic world of the enchanted fores chronicles. I would give these books a ten if I could!!"},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"I originally bought each of these books individually, and it was quite a pain finding all of them. This is a convenient way to purchase these very cute, very fun fantasy stories.The first book, \\"Dealing with Dragons\\", is a very witty, very cute book about the improper princess who decides to live with dragons rather than get married to someone she doesn't even like. Cimorene becomes the dragon Kazul's \\"princess\\", doing her chores for her, cleaning out her library, and cooking for her. The story has a lot to do with the relationships between wizards and dragons and in a sense, everything mocks the \\"real\\" view. Throughout this book, Wrede is practically laughing at every fairy tale ever written, and it is hilarious.Book two, \\"Searching for Dragons\\", introduces a new character. Mendanbar, King of the Enchanted Forest, needs to go talk to the dragon king (and there's a new one from the last book!). Unfortunately, the dragon king has been kidnapped, so he and Cimorene go looking for her. It's more action filled than its predecessor and has a lot more magic going on.\\"Calling on Dragons\\" is clearly the weakest book in the bunch, though it's. It's least memorable of them all, its new characters are the most boring, and the plot is more of a preview for the final book, \\"Talking to Dragons\\".And speaking of, \\"Talking to Dragons\\" once again brings us the fun and excitement the first two books brought. While each of the other books had a gap of time that stretch across a year or so, the gap between COD and TTD is much bigger... Sixteen years! We've got a whole new generation of characters, whether its the cats, the fiery girls, or our (!) narrarator! Yes, TTD is written in first person, which is a first in this series. We truly get into Daystar's head, which is fun and enjoyable. In a sense, TTD continues where COD left off, but obviously much later, and many things have changed.So if you like rather mocking fantasy stories that are both fun and cute, you'll love this. If you love witches, evil wizards, cool dragons, and awesome characters, than this is a great set to pick up. Just remember that COD is more of a transition book and all will be well.So go join Cimorene, Mendanbar, Kazul, Daystar, Morwen, the cats, those evil wizards, and the lot by buying this great set!"},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"I was a book-a-holic when i was younger. i first discovered these books in elementary school, and i probably read each one about 10 times. now i'm in college, and just finished re-reading the whole series.they are intelligent, witty, and twist traditional fairy tales into wonderful, interesting, new things. the characters are great and intelligent. a great book for girls, it shows that we can have adventures too and don't have to be content with waiting for our prince in shining armour to come rescue us. we can be bad-ass, independent, free-thinking princesses like cimerone and still find great guys (mendanbar).i would reccommend these books to anyone, even if fantasy isn't typically your thing. they are the kind of books and characters that just...become a part of you. although i hate the new paperback versions. if you really love these books, go for the hardback versions if you can find them...these books are worth keeping forever, keeping for your children, and the paperback ones are noticably cheap. of course, the hardback ones are out of print now i beleive, so it can take some hunting. paperbacks are better than no book at all!!these books have brought me pure joy and vicarious adventure. five stars and 1000 words can't even begin to describe how great they are."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"This is a great collection of books with a strong heroine and a good sense of humor. They are an excellent choice to read out loud due to the fun characters and the whimsical nature of the writing, and the recurrent message of non-conformity is carried out well without feeling too didactic.Other reviewers have given capsule summaries, but I would recommend against reading them if you can resist. Part of what was delightful about reading these books for me was seeing the story and Patricia Wrede's pattern unfold.That being said, I will immediately contradict myself, and note that the third book is, in my opinion, the weakest of lot. I think this is because when I read the books, I was reading out loud. The third book has more fractured conversations and irritating voices popping up all over the place, and the pattern gets in the way of the narrative. Additionally, compared to the other books, the ending is unsatisfying, merely setting up the action for the fourth book. For what it's worth, my wife (who also loved this series) recommends skipping the third book altogether and allowing the story of the fourth to slowly fill you in on what happened in the third.One other note that I will add is that the vocabulary used in these books is advanced enough to make them a better pick for 10+ year olds, in my opinion. I mistakenly recommended them to the 8 year old daughter of a friend and she struggled to read the first couple paragraphs. The first couple of pages use: philosophers, fashionable, periodic, prosperous, etiquette, etc. Nothing unheard of, obviously, but these are probably better read out loud to early readers. These younger kids will still love the story and the characters, though I guess they may miss some of the humor.With the discounted Amazon price, this box set is a lot of story for the dollar. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"Patricia C. Wrede breathes a little life into the young adult adventure/fantasy genre with her series \\"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles\\".Fiction and Fairy Tales collide in these entertainingly witty and unique novels, chronicling the adventures of Princess Cimorene as she deals with Dragons, witches, warlocks, and more!The series starts off with my favorite book \\"Dealing with Dragons\\", in which a young princess rebels against the societal expectations placed upon her. Princesses from all over the world are expected to be \\"captured\\" by dragons in order to be rescued by a Prince and run off to get married and live happily ever after. However, Cimorene has other ideas. She runs away, willingly goes to live with the Dragons, and refuses to let a Prince rescue her! She is happier serving the Dragons than living a hum-drum life in a castle somewhere. She would rather have excitement and adventures than be stuck blindly obeying princess protocol and attending balls.Although the books are set in a middle-ages kind of environment, where women were not equal to men, and princesses were meant to do nothing except look pretty and get rescued, the character of Princess Cimorene reflects a strong, independent, intelligent feminine role model ideal in todays setting. She doesn't adhere to what society dictates she can and can not do, and she chooses to follow her own path, which is admirable and makes for a very interesting journey.Each book in the series contains strange and interesting new characters, and follows a unique storyline. The \\"Enchanted Forest Chronicles\\" would be a perfect gift for anyone who enjoys \\"Harry Potter\\", or \\"The Chronicles or Narnia\\". The imagination involved in each story is incredible, and can be enjoyed by people of all ages!"},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles are an absolutly wonderful set of stories. They take the simple premise of your standard fairy tales (Everything from toad princes, knights in armor, and the standard evil witch.) and turn the stereotypes on their heads. Perfect for children, these books are also a wonderful delight to anybody who enjoys a good read. The writing is witty and smart and the tales move at a wonderful pace that will have you devour them wanting more.

She voluntarily becomes the personal assistant to a dragon.

Whether your buying these books for your child or for yourself, you won't be disapointed. Also, don't be afraid to get this for a younger child who reads at a higher level, there isn't anything questionable in these books as far as maturity content.

Cimorene is My Ideal Heroine, and these books and this author and her characters have had a profound effect on me as a thinker and writer (my first attempt at novel-writing was three chapters in Patricia C Wrede's remarkable world. No, I had never heard the word \\"FanFic\\" back then). There is no better role-model for any young girl than Cimorene (Except, perhaps, Tamora Pierce's Alanna).Buy these books--give them early and give them often to your favourite bright, eager-to-read children. In my opinion there are no better 1st-8th grade fantasy books."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles are a wonderful fantasy adventure.

She runs away from her \\"boring\\" princess destiny one day and asks to be taken in with some dragons. The story progresses from there leaving on a wild adventure.

I loved it. I have read it more than once now, once just after it came out and again not long ago. It is a very involved novel, and you get into it very quickly. It is long, so when you don't want the good to end, when you are really hooked, it doesn't. Even still, in the end, you wish it was a neverending book, because it is that good. In short, this is a very well written book, a very good read, and I would recommend it to anyone, but good luck finding one. I hope you enjoy this book as much I did, more than once."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"\\"Always be polite to a dragon. It's harder than it sounds. Dragon etiquette is incredibly complicated, and if you make a mistake the dragon eats you.\\" These are the words, or rather writings, of my favorite author, Patricia Wrede. I think it means be nice to everyone because if you don't, there will be bad consequences. Patricia was born in Chicago Illinois without thought of writing at all. She started writing in the seventh grade and graduated college without taking any English classes. She has written and published thirteen books including The Enchanted Forest Chronicles. This set of four books is the best sires ever made! The first, Dealing with Dragons, is about a princess named Cimorene who, instead of being short and blonde with blue eyes was tall with brunette hair and brown eyes. She didn't like the etiquette and sewing her father (the King of Linderwall) made her go through. Instead she liked the secret classes she took, fencing and magic. Cimorene volunteered to be a dragon's princess and became Kazul's. Meanwhile, wizards poison the king of dragons, Tokoz with the help of a dragon named Worog. From then, things go crazy involving Collins Stone, another use for soapy water with lemon juice, and the punishment for a bad dragon. I highly recommend you read the next three masterpieces, Searching for Dragons, Calling on Dragons, and Talking to Dragons. Patricia's theme for the sires is probably that it might take a long time to finish a task, but it is worth it in the end. I would recommend this book to everyone that has a great imagination. Specifically ages eight to sixteen. It is an outstanding sires that will take you all over the magical world!"},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"I remember struggling through these books one Christmas while visiting my grandmother (I must have been in elementary school--fourth grade at the latest). Now, as a sophomore in college in mechanical engineering, these books are on of my favorite possessions. These books stress that being a tall princess with jet-black hair is OK. Not all witches have to be mean, old, and ugly. They can be pretty, full of common sense, and run an exceptionally clean house. These are the lessons that girls need to hear, and they are told in such a light-hearted fashion that it is a joy to read, time after time."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"I first read these books when I was in elementary school. I read them out of order, and it took me a few books to realize it was a series. I recently started thinking about the books again, and decided to see if I could find them. I absolutely love the series still. While it is a little young, I read the entirety, all five books, in less than a day, it is still an excellent read. the main character is a heroine, which is still a rarity for fantasy novels, and she isn't a masculine heroine, which is an even further rarity. It's an absolutely wonderful series of books, which am glad I was able to find compiled. My little cousins have read it as well, and they like it also. It's a wonderful read for all ages."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"Got this set for my 9 year old, who is an avid reader.

It wasn't like I thought it would be from what I read about it, it was better! This is a very unique set and I must say that if all of Patricia Wrede's books are as surprising as this one, I would love to get more of her books. This is definitely a fairy tale, but it has so much comedy mixed in with it, plus there's the romance and all the other good stuff you want in a book. Buy this set, and you won't be sorry.

Superficial, fluffy reading, but still fun and relaxing to read. The last book in the series kind of annoyed me because I hate it when there are characters who are in the dark about their history and they just bumble around trying to figure out what's going on. Still, there was a happy ending, of course, and it all turned out in the end."},{"Title":"The Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Dealing with Dragons / Searching for Dragons / Calling on Dragons / Talking to Dragons","review":"One of the best series I have ever read.

The Enchanted Forest Chronicles put a great spin on the classic tales. The heroine, Cimorene is a princess who doesn't like doing princessy things so she runs away and becomes head chef and librarian to a dragon. The cast of characters range from a real frog who also so happens to speak to a descendant of Rumpelstiltskin who gets stuck with a bunch of kids since no one can figure out his name. I still go back and reread these books today, because I get such a kick out of them.

I recently read them again as an adult and still loved them! They are, in a way, your typical fantasy books with an alternate world and a quest. However, there is just enough of the unconventional (a princess who would rather make cherries jubilee than be a princess) and the wacky (melting wizards with lemon scented wash water) to keep you smiling through the whole thing.

The instructors intended for us to realise that we were not the first to walk down this road. As idiotic as it might sound most if not all new leaders belive that the decisions they make and the situations they encounter are new.

Enjoyed the comparisons with each other. This will be great for future military leaders to study"},{"Title":"The defence of Duffer's Drift","review":"The British spent the first part of the Boer War having their heads handed to them by the Boer farmers with the most modern rifles and artillery. In typical British fashion they muddled through and eventually learned how to deal with this unfamiliar military environment.This little book, one part fiction, one part lessons learned, shows the evolution of their tactics against Brother Boer. It is told as a series of dreams in which the hero, a young officer, repeatedly lives the same scenario of trying to defend an isolated outpost. In the first dream he gets his head handed to him in the best British fashion. But in each succeeding dream he learns more and eventually triumphs completely.This is really a series of lessons on small unit infantry tactics at the beginning of the 20th Century. It was enormously popular in its day and still holds the reader's interest. A lot of the lessons are so basic they still can teach us things, especially in low-intensity warfare like Iraq and Afghanistan.Recommended."},{"Title":"The defence of Duffer's Drift","review":"Swinton, through a series of six dreams, presents readers with several solutions to (what in military parlance is) a \\"field problem\\" - how to defend a position from superior numbers. Each dream shows basic tactical errors, one building off the lessons learned from the mistakes of the preceeding dream until the \\"correct\\" principles are applied. While the problem is specifc to the Boer War in South Africa, the broader principles remain a part of teaching sound military strategy:1) begin measures of defense immeadiately2) maintain noise and light discipline3) be suspicious of the locals4) spread out your resources into interlocking fields of fire5) in creating defensive lines, be mindful of cover and concealment, exposure to enfilading fire, and rising ground that provides the enemy cover6) choose firing positions with the eye of those who will eventually use them7) ensure communication with good coverThe real strength of this slim book are the maps and they way in which these practices are used in conjunction with the geography. While it is a quick read (it is under 60 pages), it clearly and succinctly demonstrates the hard lessons of not following these simple principles - high and unnecessary casaualties, the position being overrun, the drift falling into enemy hands or capture. Recommended for staff NCOs or company grade officers, or those interested in small unit tactics."},{"Title":"The defence of Duffer's Drift","review":"Small Unit Tactics Primer!\\"The Defence of Duffer's Drift\\" by Major General Swinton, a noted English soldier and author, wrote this marvelous tactical primer as a captain shortly after he served in the Boer War. In six dreams, Swinton offers various tactical solutions to Lieutenant Backright Forethought, who is defending an imaginary piece of ground during the Boer War. Originally published in Infantry Journal (now Army) in April 1905 and now available as a reprint from the Combat Studies Institute, U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, this book is great for junior officers to read and discuss the finer points of counter-insurgency and small unit tactics."},{"Title":"The defence of Duffer's Drift","review":"I first read this book back in 1994 at the Engineer Offiver Basic Course. As a newly minted Second Lieutenant, the fundamentals taught by Swinton were fresh and necessary. As an Engineer Officer, where our responsibility was mobility, countermobility and survivability, the lesons were especially relevant. First published in 1907, this classic tale of Subaltern Backsight Forethought and his detachment tasked to defend Duffer's Drift during the Boer War, is a lesson in basic small unit tactics. From the very first lesson of ensuring that the defenses are perpared before resting to the last lesson of expert use of terrain, cover and concealment, the easy reading book reinforces the lessons of terrain analysis, solid tactics and common sense.On a deeper level, the book remains relevant to the business person in a way that is similar to a Sun Tzu or Machiavelli. Understand the fundamentals, do not trust the enemy, understand the landscape you will fight on, see yourself from the enemies point of view, use available resources, continue to learn from your mistakes and continuously improve.Still relevant for the modern soldier because of the focus on fundamentals, the non-soldier has much to gain by reading the book as well."},{"Title":"The defence of Duffer's Drift","review":"An unusual and interesting book, very entertaining and recommended for even the more casual military reader. Swinton's book is a classic for good reasons. Rather than instructing cadets with a dry textbook approach, the dreams of the main character demonstrate the different ways a young officer attempts to defend a river crossing, making the lessons more interesting and informative. And certainly more interesting to read than a textbook!"},{"Title":"The defence of Duffer's Drift","review":"Marine officers are often required to read this book during The Basic School (the six month infantry-focused training all lieutenants undergo after OCS or the Naval Academy). I have read that some Army schools also list it as required reading. Swinton takes a simple issue, the defense of a small swatch of land during entrusted to a young officer, and uses dream sequences to illustrate shortcomings of various tactical approaches to the problem. The officer realizes via hindsight the solutions to each problem and the reader becomes engaged in a sort of Monday-morning quarterbacking of his methods. Just when you think you have the answer, Swinton tears your theory to pieces with the next report of failure. After reading all of the scenarios, one realizes that the answer was so simple and some basic but careful analysis would yield the answer. That is the heart and core of tactics. Making a quick decision with limited information but moderate knowledge in order to come up with a 90% solution. Not only is this book a must-read, it yields new lessons every time I go back to it. It's one of those books you buy and come back to every few years. Highly recommended for the military historian, NCO or junior officer."},{"Title":"The defence of Duffer's Drift","review":"A perfect primer for every small-unit leader and above. Learn guerilla tactics and how to counter them from the series mistakes in a series of dreams of another young Lt.

An enjoyable primer on small unit leadership of counterinsurgency."},{"Title":"The defence of Duffer's Drift","review":"Hypothetical Lt Backsight Forethought has 50 men and a mission to hold a drift in South African territory during the Boer War of 1899-1902, and he starts his mission fresh from officer training and being totally unaware of the realities of combat. In the first trial he gets beaten really bad but he analyzes his faults and learn from them. He also gets beaten in his second, third, fourth and fifth trial, every time making different mistakes which the enemy does not forgive. Finally, when he has a sixth chance to re-fight the battle he puts up a splendid performance making his opponent to pay dearly and holding the drift until friendly reinforcements arrive. It is a very enjoyable little book and although it was written a hundred years ago it is still very useful for anyone who wants to learn about the core of tactical prowess in infantry battle."},{"Title":"The defence of Duffer's Drift","review":"Swinton is a military professional with experience in the Boer War who wrote this famous short book based on a series of thoughts he had on how a infantry unit with only 50 men could defend a river crossing. A young Lieutenant has the role but you are given his perspective, the terrain features, the political situation, conflict with civilians and limits on your own military support. There is a brief history of the war with the \\"Dutch\\" and then your Lieutenant receives his assignment. With the use of maps, there are six scenarios of the Lieutenants approach to defending the crossing (drift). Each scenario is acted out and with each of the first five scenarios there are several lessons learned such as the effect of enfilading fire, the limitations of a simple trench, the use of the military crest versus being located on top of the hill, the effect the local sympathetic population may have on aiding guerrilla fighters, the effect of surprise, disguising your defense from view, proper posting of sentries and responsibilities, how to combat artillery, dealing with multiple directions of attack, using the terrain to advantage and on. As the Lieutenant in each scenario learns from his mistakes, he alters the outcome to his advantage but only incrementally. Only at the end and sixth scenario does he get it right but with realistic loss. The same map is introduced in each scenario with defense features matching the new defensive tactics. Fascinating book for all interested in basic infantry tactics, which has been used as a training manual for militaries world wide. This is a very readable book that can be read in less than 2 hours time. Applicable to any war but this book would be interesting to read with an account of Rappahannock Station, which was a spearhead position held by Confederates in advance of Lee's line on November 7, 1863 where Meade's forces overwhelmed the defenders and took almost 3,000 prisoners. Duffer's Drift would be very applicable here."},{"Title":"The defence of Duffer's Drift","review":"While undoubtedly a must read for ground troops, you don't have to wear combat boots to enjoy The Defence of Duffer's Drift. If you enjoy problem solving, visualizing varied scenarios, and anticipating the next move, this book may be for you. It's well written in fluid, almost interactive, and easily understood language; you don't have to be a General or a military buff to immediately be enveloped by the dilemma at hand. You can finish the book in one sitting or ponder each chapter as if it were a game of chess. This is a rare type of book that can, and perhaps should, be enjoyed by almost everyone."},{"Title":"The defence of Duffer's Drift","review":"This free edition does not have the maps which make the situation much more understandable.

Read this and then come back and re-read it.Update: The review above refers to the version by Avery Publishing. In 2010, I wanted to give a copy as a gift. Luckily, I skimmed it before wrapping it. This new version by Dodo Press is missing several of the most useful sections of the original book. It omits the historical notes that put the Boer War in context, is missing most of the maps and even omits Swinton's own preface. It is far less useful as a primer than the earlier version.Amazon apparently doesn't allow separate ratings for different editions of a book.

As a matter of fact, the lessons LT Forethought learns compare remarkably to the nine Priniciples of War and five Fundamentals of Defensive Operations contained in US Army doctrine.

And Other Lies That Are True","review":"\\"Ultimately, the forces outside of us have little significance other than being a distraction. If men look to an illusionary outside world for answers, we will continue to get illusionary answers. There are challenges we need to face, alone in the dark, to learn to channel our strengths.\\" ~Mike DuganMike Dugan reveals all the challenges he faced in the past and how he thought his way into an intimate and fulfilling relationship by taking an honest look at male sexuality. He takes on the lone wolf, the dragon and the problems of antisocial behavior.\\"Men Fake Foreplay\\" is an honest look at male sexuality. This book will not only lead men to deeply fulfilling and profound spiritual moments, women will find the insights and understanding to be intellectually satisfying and emotionally fulfilling. It is rare for a wildly funny book to also steal my heart.Mike Dugan succeeds where many fear to even begin. There is insight into why women don't want you to change who you are, but instead want you to become more aware of who you are. He asks: \\"Where are the gentlemen?\\"Though a variety of intellectually intriguing examples, Mike Dugan shows the need for male role models in our society. I loved the story of the elephants and his comments about defeating inner dragons. This book is not just an analysis of the male/female connection; it is more an analysis of how men connect with their deepest self. Mike Dugan reveals how a boy becomes a man and explores the choices a man makes once he takes on the responsibility of caring for the women in his life.There is a deep, penetrating intimacy throughout this work. While this book is also wildly funny, I laughed my way right into an understanding of some profound male wisdom. One of the best lines in this book: \\"A man's power should be wielded compassionately.\\" Like a true comedian, he entertains you with a few jokes and then once he has your attention and respect, there is a place to discuss communication, feelings and sexual ethics.It took me a few minutes to get through the last two pages. I couldn't see the words. This is what I wanted from all the men in my life. I want to feel safe and nurtured. I want there to be safe places in my life where I'm loved as a soul.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Men Fake Foreplay ... And Other Lies That Are True","review":"My sense reading this was that the author believed that all men tend to devalue women and treat them badly. I know that not to be the case. The early pages were humorous & fun, but the last half of the book seemed pretty apologetic to me."},{"Title":"Men Fake Foreplay ... And Other Lies That Are True","review":"The problem with 99% of all relationship advice books is that they are written for women because women read them and women buy them. Most guys aren't buying books about how to have better relationships. Consequently, all the advice is some variation of what women need to change about themselves in order to land the right man and be happy.Many of the Amazon Reader reviews of \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" seemed to say, \\"Okay. We'll raise our expectations because we deserve better. THEN what? Where are the books asking men to change THEIR behavior? \\"This is that book. Mike Dugan writes about all of the obstacles men face in trying to become decent men in a \\"boys will be boys\\" world. It's about men learning to be accountable for the results of their behavior. Dugan looks at the importance of treating women with respect - and he slams the absence of that attitude in popular culture.The world isn't designed to help men do the right thing. The world is designed to help men do the easy thing. Unfortunately, the right thing and the easy thing are rarely the same thing. Dugan bucks the status quo and slams Howard Stern, Tom Leykis, and other \\"terminally adolescent\\" men who think it's cute and funny to diminish women to their sexual and physical attributes. This isn't some \\"men don't put the toilet seat down, and women get PMS\\" look at the difference between men and women.This is a thought provoking and very funny book. For any woman who has ever wondered, \\"WHAT... is he thinking??\\" or any man with a sincere desire to better understand the forces that drive him, this is one of the funniest and best written books you'll find."},{"Title":"Men Fake Foreplay ... And Other Lies That Are True","review":"My husband insists that since most books of this nature are written by women, that he's just \\"misunderstood\\". I can't believe how relieved I was to read one written by a MAN, and a REAL man, that happens to agree with everything I've been trying to explain for years. I'm sure his book isn't popular with the male segment of society...he's ratted them out. But for those of us who were beginning to believe that we might actually be frigid, unemotional, and bordering on insane, this book was a welcome relief. I laughed out loud many times, and ended one chapter in tears. Way to go Mike Dugan, you just might be the only REAL man on earth!"},{"Title":"Men Fake Foreplay ...

It's really entertaining, but before you know it it sneaks up on you and reminds you that you know in your heart what's right - you've always known what was right - but somewhere along the line you lost your way and you're having trouble finding your way home. This is NOT a joke book. It's funny as hell all the way through and the humor is great and sucks you in, but soon you're on a ride taking a look at all of the good and bad \\"influences that shape a man's character.\\"Dugan reminds men that the easier, softer way is rarely the route to the kind of character that they should be bringing to their relationships. He talks about men taking more responsibility for the effect they have on the world. He talks about \\"gentle strength\\" and describes it beautifully. And he gently nudges men and women towards an ideal that might just work for all of us. I agree with the reviewer who called him a philosopher. The fact that he gets a powerful and compassionate message across without preaching, or shaming men, and it's funny and he accomplished it all in 118 pages, makes me really admire his writing ability.Men Fake Foreplay is a fun ride, full of insight, and when I finished it I immediately wanted to read it again. It's that good. Read it. Then send it to your ex-boyfriend and help make the world a better place."},{"Title":"Men Fake Foreplay ... And Other Lies That Are True","review":"My mom gave me this book.

It is an easy read on a serious issue that will make you want to read it several times to make sure you didn't miss a point. You will want to call your girlfriends to discuss it with them. Women will hand it to their boyfriends or husband and say \\"read this, HE gets it!\\" Moms will want to give it to their older teenage sons or older teenage daughters. This book is full of practical information spiced with a fantastic sense of humor that adds a light air to a serious subject matter.

There are alot of Supermen, but it is a matter if they choose to change out of their normal everyday suit to be one. but just don't let the phone booth be the only place to do it and reason to change. Cause the world won't wait for you to save it."},{"Title":"Men Fake Foreplay ... And Other Lies That Are True","review":"I read this book after it was recommended by another Amazon reader and am so grateful I took the advice. In an entertaining yet very concise manner, Dugan explains how our culture has lost it's way in what it means to be a real man. He then narrates his own evolution from a typical All-American guy who refers to women as \\"B-----s and Ho's\\" to someone more evolved and rewarded. His transformation has nothing to do with changing just to please women - that's the beauty of this book. Dugan's evolution is motivated by wanting his OWN rewards. And in the process of finding the deep satisfaction in life that has eluded him in the past, he earns the admiration of the women in his life. And he make it seem so simple - just learn to question one or two things that our culture values but maybe shouldn't, or open your eyes to the fact that men and women really do want some of the same crucial things. While I still remain somewhat skeptical that every Ho-lovin', B-slappin', red-blooded American man can undergo the same evolution that Dugan has, I would love nothing more than to be proven wrong. Guys, give this one a try! It's a short book, a really fast read - can easily be done in a day. Then you'll want to read it again! And then give it to all your friends who don't seem to \\"get\\" women. Because it's not about getting women - it's about getting yourself. The reviewers who say that's it's changed their lives are not kidding. You'll never see yourself the same way again, and imagine what doorways to incredible places will suddenly begin to open."},{"Title":"Fire Truck Nuts and Bolts (Carolrhoda Photo Books)","review":"The book was informative of how fire trucks are built.

To save both their clans from annihilating one another, Rob and Carys were forced into marriage - but what is to save them from one another? A rocky yet powerful tale about learning to accept what life brings and find unexpected joy in the heart of difficulty.

I often do that when the characters are compelling to me enough at the end that I want to go back and re-read their story now that I \\"know\\" them, so to speak. When you wipe away all the historical setting, this book is about real people, flawed, but real people trying to live their lives in peace and make their part of the world a better place.

It's perfect."},{"Title":"Colloidal Dispersions (Cambridge Monographs on Mechanics)","review":"Colloidal Dispersions is an excellent text, both for graduate students and for physicists/physical chemists foraying into the field of colloidal dispersions. The book starts by talking about particle hydrodynamics, then introduces Brownian motion and follows it up with description of different interaction forces experienced by colloidal particles. Thereafter, it discusses the thermodynamics of polymer in solution, how it affects the forces between the particles. In following chapters, it details the electrokinetic phenomena, and the physics of polymer mediated and charged mediated stabilization. The last few chapters return to dynamics again, with a chapter each devoted to sedimentation and rheology!The book is beautifully written, and most of the material is useful as it is. Since this book was written in 1989, it requires a revision to bring it to the level of current understanding. The whole realm of nanoparticles is based on principles described here, as is the field of colloidal self-assembly. With a revision and few additions here and there, and maybe addition of some references to the work done between 1989-2005, the book can be made into workhouse of all colloidal scientists. I highly recommend this book to everyone interested in understanding the physical behavior of colloids. Coming with a background in Statistical Mechanics would be certainly helpful, and for people with training in Polymer Physics, the book can be understood by drawing analogies with the concepts used there. This is one of the best book in terms of the balance between the use of equations and words used to present physical picture and definitely one everyone in the field must read:) But as I said before, I will be greatly indebted to authors if they bring out a revised edition: I hope they do so soon!!"},{"Title":"Colloidal Dispersions (Cambridge Monographs on Mechanics)","review":"This book, despite not being updated for about a decade, is still at the top of its class... This book should be on the desk of every scientist who is interested in interparticle forces. This book covers the theory and the development of colloid science from its early days to modern times. It is likely to be useful for theorists who will lean on the math and good references in the book and useful to experimentalists who seek to understand interparticle forces. Most experimentalists will probably also want to buy Jacob Israelachvili's book, which I haven't read much of, but I know Israelachvili is the man behind the surface forces apparatus (SFA), so many who seek to measure the interparticle forces described in WBR's book will want Jacob's book as well.I am a graduate student at Princeton, home to the authors, and, not surprisingly, this book is a strong reflection of two courses in the chemical engineering department called Colloidal Dispersions I and II. I'm taking the series now, and, if you are in the class, you already know you need the book, and you shouldn't be reading this review.I'd give the book 5 stars instead of 4, but I feel that it needs to be updated to reflect the increasing use of computer simulations (Note that I am biased, as a computer person) and new developments in colloid science. And lastly, though I feel the book is highly readable, the math is intense, and I suspect there are many scientists and engineers (myself included) who will have wished WBR had skipped fewer steps. Largely though, you can't blame the authors for that. The book would be a million pages long if they didn't skip steps. Try to use the extensive references to fill in the steps in the math if possible.On a value basis, a 4 star book that costs only 2/3 what you usually pay means you are getting a steal here."},{"Title":"Colloidal Dispersions (Cambridge Monographs on Mechanics)","review":"This book is famous among people studying colloids.

First of all, Babe Ruth seems like an unusual subject for a kids' book about childhood, since from what I know, Ruth had a fairly unpleasant childhood. After all, his father signed off on parental rights when Babe was seven and he spent the rest of this youth living in a boys' reformatory (St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys in Baltimore).In the story, seven year-old George (before he became known as \\"Babe\\") breaks a window while playing baseball with his friends, runs away from the scene, sees an ice cream cart, later steals a dollar from his father's inexplicably empty tavern, then buys ice cream for all his friends with the dollar. His parents discover his theft, and after a heartfelt exchange with his mother, the book ends with George's father chasing the boy out of the house with a wooden paddle! (I found myself checking the back of the book to make sure I didn't miss the last page--I couldn't believe that a childrens picture book would end in this manner).This book may have worked better if it had been about Babe's relationship with Brother Matthias, who was Ruth's mentor (and baseball instructor) at the St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, but it makes no sense in trying to write about the Babe's rather indifferent parents (and to end the book on such an odd, unresolved, and sour note that will just leave kids confused)."},{"Title":"Babe Ruth and the Ice Cream Mess (Childhood of Famous Americans)","review":"Strange tale for a young kid.

I only gave it one star because you had to, otherwise it would be zero."},{"Title":"Chekhov's Doctors: A Collection of Chekhov's Medical Tales (Literature and Medicine)","review":"The greatest works of fiction afford a glimpse into human nature, into its dark secrets, pettiness, and callowness, as well as into moments of true magnanimity. Conflict and misunderstanding between individuals is another core ingredient in the best of fiction. The best writers have an innate grasp of what makes up the human creature, and have a fluency in psychological analysis that comes only from keen natural intuition. Yet even the most subtle grasp of human nature alone is insufficient material for the creation of great fiction; for the successful author must also be able to draw from a rich backdrop of life experience.Medicine, like few other professions, provides such a backdrop and as such it is likely not coincidental that there exists a glorious intersection between the fields of writing and medicine. A physician, in the course of his daily work regularly comes across the themes that most people encounter only infrequently-fear, illness, suffering, and death, as well as hope, courage, and perseverance. These titanic forces flush out the essence of human nature, and the physician who is so inclined is provided with boundless material for the exploration of humanity through fiction.Anton Chekhov (1860-1904), the great Russian author and playwright, was a physician by trade. Chekhov draws abundantly on his experience in medicine in his fiction and drama, and this is brought out in a recently published compilation of Chekhov's medically-related short stories.In this volume of stories, Chekhov imposes a frank-almost brutal-examination of human nature, and a critical look at the practice of medicine and at those who practice it. The themes in his stories are apparently timeless; any practicing physician will recognize the cynicism, politics, burnout, and overwork that is described by Chekhov. In one story of a beleaguered, overworked rural doctor in the employ of the state, Chekhov even provides a glimpse into what must have been a nineteenth century Russian version of the frustrations of working in a managed care environment. In the story, the physician is forced to care for a large, impoverished population in a clinic over which he exercises no executive authority. Not only is he powerless under the system to fire his incompetent, corrupt, and drunken support staff, but in his prescriptions is at the mercy of a central power that determines the source of pharmaceuticals.Another story traces the devolution of an earnest, ideological young physician into a money grubbing, lazy, and cynical doctor who treats his patients like objects. This same doctor, who possesses abundant theoretical knowledge of pathology and the practice of medicine, is utterly unable to apply his wisdom to heal patients because of his stifling arrogance and lack of empathy for his patients.Some of Chekhov's physicians struggle to strike a balance between adequate time for their own lives and families and availability to their patients. This conflict is starkly illustrated by a story in which a physician is forced to choose between attending the deathbed of his only child and responding to an emergency call.Chekhov also examines the proper role of professional objectivity and distance in medicine. At what point does the curtain that every physician draws between himself and his patient in order to facilitate detached, objective thinking become a mighty bulkhead constructed primarily for self defense? Several stories explore this question, and Chekhov seems to conclude that the answer lies in a happy medium.All is not dark, however, in the world of Chekhov's doctors. Even amidst the burnout, substance abuse, and money-worship of some of his characters, there are the redeeming qualities of absolute dedication, devotion to the pursuit of medical knowledge, and perseverance even under very unfavorable circumstances. The doctors in his stories are complex, and some of these redeeming qualities even coexist with the uglier traits in some of Chekhov's characters.Chekhov's Doctors is a well-edited volume that arranges stories in an inviting and readable sequence, (saving lengthier, heavier stories for later in the volume). Dr. Coulehan, the editor, also places Chekhov's stories in historical context, providing the reader with, for example, an ample yet not overwhelming background of Chekhov's relationship with Tolstoy (whose titan influence was difficult for any contemporary Russian author to escape). Of particular interest is a series of commentary in the back of the volume that provides a brief analysis of each story from the author's perspective as a medical doctor."},{"Title":"Chekhov's Doctors: A Collection of Chekhov's Medical Tales (Literature and Medicine)","review":"Read for Ward No. 6 and Enemies.

These rhymes are great for him to start noticing how language works. My little girl, four now, she loves the sound of the rhyme and the fun images of the words. Now lets talk about the illustrations. Just for one instance, there is a red dress made of what looks to be tiny pieces of cut out paper carefully tiled like fish scales -- and the dress is really big. Thousands and thousands of fish scales individually cut out and pain-stakingly placed. The illustrator must have gone BLIND doing that work. Very impressive. That's just one illustration. The book is gorgeous. I don't know about you, but I love finding little hidden things in the illustrations the tenth time I read the book. This is that kind of book. For example, when you open the front cover, at first the page looks like two-dimensional holes. But the illustrator is playing with your perception. By putting a little (very carefully constructed) figure in one of the holes, the image looks, suddenly three dimensional.

The books trace the lives of the pioneers, Americans and immigrants from the North and South, Caucasians, Blacks, Asians and Native Americans, who daily waged a battle of survival. &quot;Washington&quot; is Book 9 in a series of 24 novels which truly bring history to life during one of the United States' most important and fascinating periods. I have become addicted to this series and plan to read all twenty-four books.The terrible Civil War has finally ended, having decimated the male population of the United States, and left the South in ruins. Millions of people will have to make major adjustments to their lives now that the war is over. Many will move west. Washington Territory is a rich land ripe for settlement, but relatively unknown back east because of its remote location and because of the war.Toby Holt, son of &quot;Whip&quot; Holt, the Oregon Trail's first wagon master, returns home to his family, wounded in body and spirit. His wife, a former courtesan, leaves him for another man. Toby and his partner Rob Martin are given a commission to survey Washington Territory for the northern transcontinental railroad line, avoiding as many major obstacles as possible. The goal - to layout the railroad across Washington and link-up with rail lines in Montana, Dakota and all the way across the continent. The entire future of the territory depends on this assignment. Both Rob and Toby stake land claims in Washington. However, there are ruthless profiteers there who take advantage of the lack of law enforcement and will go to any lengths, commit any crime, to amass personal fortunes.Many of the characters from the former novels appear here and they continue to grow and develop, while a new generation, born on the Pacific coast, begins to assume responsibilities as they come of age. A &quot;cargo of brides&quot; is sent to Washington to marry the lonely men, so there is romance galore.The novel's history, characters and plot are wonderful. I love history, and while I have read and studied this period in America's development, I have learned so much from reading these nine &quot;Wagons West&quot; books. I plan to continue until I read them all. A wonderful reading experience.JANA"},{"Title":"Wagon West #09: Washington (Wagons West)","review":"This is the ninth book in the Wagon's West series.The civil war is finally over.

To a certain extent, that is true.&quot; (p.xii) I'm afraid this is too true. Sally's effort to give more detailed discussions only insults the intelligence of trainers.

Several of the short pieces represent a sort of hybrid form between the poem and the essay; others seem to represent a melding of the poem and the short story. Although Paz can be obscure, and even somewhat indulgent, at times, &quot;Eagle or Sun?&quot; is marked by flashes of brilliance which make it an important piece of 20th century literature.Some of the book's highlights included section X of &quot;The Poet's Works,&quot; a nightmarish vision of language gone awry; &quot;The Blue Bouquet,&quot; which is undoubtedly one of the greatest horror stories ever written in any language; and &quot;My Life with the Wave,&quot; a surreal fantasy story that is rich in irony. &quot;Eagle or Sun?&quot; may not be easy reading, but it is a rewarding and memorable work from one of Mexico's most important writers."},{"Title":"Eagle or Sun?: Prose Poems","review":"A superb collection of early writings from 1949-50, Paz explores Mexico from three fronts, past, present and future. Influenced by Surrealists his prose is vivid and colorful as he explores the relationship between language and poet, reality and language and his vision of the past. His exploration of the apocalytic future, as foretold by the Aztec calendar stone is haunting.

The description of the book promised as much, love, romance, intrigue, undying devotion. How can I resist! I rushed to ordered the thing. In fact, I rushed to ordered Book Two before I had even laid eyes on Book One. The story must be pretty grand if it goes on for two books, right!? I was giddy with anticipation.The books arrived, I dived right in. Not a few pages into the first chapter, I was bewildered. By the time Will Remington was summoned back to Boston, I was aghast, bemused, and amused. Is the writing really so hopelessly bad, or could it improve with a good edit? The author, in his acknowledgement, thanked his friends for reading the books. (I assume, prior to publication.) Did no one bother to point out the clunky run on sentences, the stilted exchanges, and the torturous paragraphs that ran on for pages?Not only does the writing in these books leave much to be desired, the chronology is often as muddled and as exasperating. Nothing irks this reader more than an author who can't even keep track of his own characters. Here's an example, we have Ben Smithson, who was fourteen (we are told) when he moved to Boston, and there meets his first lover, Michael. Together, they go through four years of High School and graduates in 1868, making him 18 if I did my math correctly. Yet he arrives in Auburn in 1877 at the age of 25? Hasn't 9 years elapsed? Shouldn't he be at least 27? Not to be nit-picking, but there are other instances which detracts. Take Shamus Mouldoon, the evil villain who maims Ben, seduces Chris and subsequently blackmails him. At the time of the blackmail, around 1878/79, we are told that Mouldoon is about 22. What!? Didn't he go to school with Ben and Michael before he was kicked out for good!? Here's the clincher, how about Michael's father dying twice. Wasn't he already dead when Ben went to Boston to fetch Michael in hopes of convincing him to be the town doctor for Auburn. How is it that he died again in Book Two, after Michael had set up house with Kyle? I'm confused.Still, the books do have their little moments. As a 'bodice ripping' romance, or is it 'shirt ripping' romance in this case, there are more graphic gay couplings than I would have anticipated, and not all of it so badly written that they are not down right erotic. There are even a few brave attempts to denounce bigotry and injustice. I, however, could do with a lot less long winded, syrupy sentiments that seems to drool from the mouths of most of the characters like bad spit. So, here's the chance for the author to start anew, the Remington twins, a gay one and a straight one maybe. Surely, there's enough fodder there to continue this 'epic' love saga. But please, Mr. Hill, write shorter sentences; and for heaven's sake, hire a good editor."},{"Title":"The Love You Leave Behind - Book One","review":"A novel of extraordinary interest and scope, epic in the traditions of Mitchner and Stone, riveting and passionate and well researched. I will be insulted if it is not made into a major motion picture. I had difficulty putting it down each evening to get some sleep. It is about time that an intelligent book of this genre has entered into the mainstream literature of America.

This work has something for everyone -- it is an epic love story with facets of mystery, suspense, action adventure as well as painstakingly researched historical references. The characters of this work are well developed, multi-dimensional and wonderfully defined; the storylines are artfully outlined and executed -- managing to completely explore all facets and levels of each storyline while maintaining the intregity of the relationships within the story.

This book came in second on my list for a few reasons.1) Poor explanation of how to set up the Tomcat server with the class code. I would have had to write up a separate installation chapter for any of the students to make the code samples work.2) Too much \\"here it is\\" without enough \\"why we do it this way.\\" Some subjects are little more than code samples when what's needed is a basic understanding of the reason for the code.3) Good for JSP, too shallow on Servlets. Covering JSP first is easier, but by the time you get to servlets you're wondering \\"why go to all this extra work?\\" Not enough explanation in the book to justify it to students.Overall, a good book for learning JSP and Servlets without getting bogged down in jargon and obscure technicalities like most texts.

It's obvious that Murach has stooges who are trying to bury this one, because it can't be refuted.Others have focused on the positives, but they are vastly outweighed by these negatives:1) In an unbelievably irresponsible section of chapter 6, the authors suggest that Javascript validation is sufficient and never even mention that server-side validation of data from the client is absolutely necessary for security.2) To prove that was no fluke, they state that 40-bit SSL \\"is appropriate for most sites\\". I'm not joking - chapter 13, page 402.3) Chapter 13 is 18 pages with a couple of paragraphs of useful information4) Chapter 16 is dedicated to XML, but incredibly ignores XHTML, and gives no information at all on using SAX.5) old versions of software on CD6) no IDE (like Eclipse) on CD7) HomeSite could not be installed on my PC8) many broken links in example apps on CD9) poor typography - bad usage of bold, italics, etc. - compare to O'Reilly books10) no coverage of JSTL11) skimpy chapter on EJB12) \\"paired pages\\" format often results in repeated text - adding to heft of book without adding to information13) inadequate and confusing explanations of where to store an app, and how the path relates to the URLGo ahead - those who voted \\"thumbs down\\" - try to contradict any of the points above."},{"Title":"Murach's Java Servlets and JSP","review":"If you are looking for a book that is going to teach you Servlets and JSP in a very easy way with a lot of hand holding then you are looking for this book. The authors make the assumption that the reader knows the basics of Java but has absolutely no knowledge of internet programming.The book starts by guiding the reader through the process of installing Tomcat (all the samples use Tomcat as the servlet engine) and creating a simple HTML page before they introduce you to Servlets and JSP. Servlets and JSP are covered separately and then working together in the Model 2 architecture. The one thing missing from this section is any mention of Struts or other MVC frameworks. Advanced topics such as using SSL and restricting access to a web site are covered very well and in a way that makes it easy to follow and understand. The authors even show how to write your own tag libraries. Unfortunately, no mention is made of JSTL. The authors show how to install and use MySQL and how to code SQL before moving on to explain using JDBC in a web application. The book ends with a complete sample application of an online store including secure credit card handling.This is an excellent tutorial that will painlessly teach you how to write complex web applications.

However, I've never developed a web application. I needed a crash course on all things web and Java. On my shelf I have about two feet of new books on a variety of Java topics including three books on Java servlets and JSPs. Almost without exception all of these books make these mistakes:- Assume the reader knows too much and in some cases assumes the reader is already familiar with the topic- Takes a complex subject and makes it more complex by taking many digressions, explaining something without explaining why and referring to technologies not explained in the book.- Is loaded with undefined acronyms- Has a \\"smirky\\" attitude as though there is some private joke- Only shows code snippets without providing the complete context allowing for your own testing- Doesn't take a building block approach so that you learn the topic step by stepMurach's book makes none of these mistakes. I think all technical \\"how to\\" or tutorial books should follow Murach's format. There is one concept for each two pages. The left page explains the concept with clearly written text and the right page shows the example that demonstrates the concept. Each concept is built on concepts already learned in previous pages so that if you have understood all the previous concepts you easily understand the next concept. In this book the only assumption is that you're familiar with Java but not necessarily an expert. Along the way unimportant details are identified or there is an indication that the detail will be explained in a later section. If you read the book from start to finish you will not be confused at any point.Because there is an assumption that the reader only knows Java some basic topics such as HTML and the web paradigm are explained. The good news is that these topics are clearly identified and if the reader is already familiar with the topic they can be skipped without fear of missing something important and required for future sections.Aside from the format and process of this book there is the spirit of the book. It is clear the authors care very much about whether their book will help the reader become conversant on the topic. They act as a technical sherpa and are never condescending.I believe this is the only book a beginning Java servlet and JSP programmer will need. I'm not a servlet and JSP expert but I'm guessing this may be the only Java servlet and JSP book you'll ever need.My only disappointment in Murach books is that they don't have more of their books on more recent technologies such as Jakarta Struts or Enterprise Java Beans. It seems that most of their books are on legacy technologies (has Java servlets and JSPs become legacy?)."},{"Title":"Murach's Java Servlets and JSP","review":"This is a GREAT book. It's methodical, easy to follow, and in the process, it shows you that Java really isn't as difficult as those junky Sun tutorials lead one to believe. I actually used this book along with Sun's Java Web Services Developer Pack and it really made things easy to set up servlets and JSP.If you already know servlets and JSP, buy this book anyway just to see where other tutorials left out the fundamentals.In my opinion as a trainer and developer, it is a major feat of skill and patience to bring somebody from zero knowledge to a productive level of skill in technologies like this. These authors make it look easy. Sun should hire them to redo all of their tutorials. That way, Java would be more widely adopted and could eventually overtake security-hole-riddled Microsoft products."},{"Title":"Murach's Java Servlets and JSP","review":"This book on Servlets and JSP is truly a self explanatory tutorial for those who wish to get some hands on by themselves.Murach's two page trick works very good. This book is comprehensive in getting you know the basics of JSP and Servlets. I was a guy with just core Java knowledge and when I wanted to get myself in learning the advanced concepts like JSP and servlets, this book proved one.This book caters for those who want to get a flying start into JSP and Servlets but for an indepth knowledge on the subject you'd better look for other options."},{"Title":"Murach's Java Servlets and JSP","review":"The one quality that makes \\"Murach's Java Servlets and JSP\\" (buy from Amazon) a clear winner is the quality of the content and clarity of author Andrea Steelman and Joel Murach's writing. They use a friendly, humorous voice that eases the normal tension accompanying such a complex topic as programming Java servlets and designing JavaServer Pages. I'm a C# developer, so this was most appreciated by someone like me. You'll also be thankful for this tone as the book takes you through some very challenging scenarios in developing winning browser-based apps.The book is the rare breed of tech manual that stays relevant to the neophyte reader and the experienced developer alike. It's outstanding as a college-level classroom reference, with oversized dimensions (it's a large book, height- and width-wise) are loaded with rich illustrations and healthy amounts of code with thorough explanations of the concepts behind then. Physically the book is ready to sustain the harsh conditions of the learning programmer. Its rigid design will survive a reader's rampant paging through chapters to find that one code sample and stretching the book's spine, in the classroom as well as the web shop.The book presents the reader with the holistic JSP experience, and the organization of the chapters is very logical. I particularly enjoyed the chapters dealing with JavaMail programming, working in SSL environments, database access with JDBC and MySQL, working in the HTTP pipeline, custom JSP tags and use of XML. Also featured are basic discussions of incorporating componentization in your projects through JavaBeans. I also liked wrapping up my reading with the capstone project: designing, coding and deploying a very practical Music Store web app.The accompanying CD-ROM is outstanding, including the Java 2 SDK for Windows, Tomcat 4.0, MySQL, and trial versions of HomeSite and TextPad.In criticism, I felt the book to be ironically a little light on servlets themselves. I would have liked to see more on servlets and beans programming discussed, and perhaps highlight a bit more some of the key classes in the Java 2 API. The book also I feel neglects the object-oriented programming concepts that are so critical to modern-day development. Maybe such topics are out of this book's range, but simple class design would have been nice. However, the best-practices approach to development - use of patterns, proper system organization and implementing MVC architecture greatly offset the book's very minor shortcomings.I fully recommend this book to anyone looking to get into beginning to intermediate JavaServer Pages programming. It's essential to becoming a well-versed Java programmer."},{"Title":"Murach's Java Servlets and JSP","review":"In my 20 years as a computer professional, I have never seen a book so well written as this one.

Starting with \\"The Eagle Has Landed\\" (hereafter \\"Eagle\\"), he wrote like a factory, producing a great many almost identical thrillers, only a few of which really measured up to \\"Eagle\\". This book, \\"Day of Judgement\\", is a work that, in my opinion, meassures up to, and in some waays surpasses \\"Eagle\\". Set at the height of the Cold War, \\"Day of Judgement's\\" plot focuses on an East German effort to deflect the impact of US President John F. Kennedy's forthcoming visit to Berlin, where history tells us he made his electrifying \\"Ich bin ein Berliner\\" speech. The East Germans want to nullify the projected effect of Kennedy's visit, so they kidnap a beloved Roman Catholic priest and try to \\"brainwash\\" him into making anti-US statements..

Highly enjoyable, if that is your goal in fiction reading! I know JH books aren't for everyone: they are often quick on the description and huge amounts of plot fly by in a chapter, but nobody writes like him. This story, that takes place in East Germany before Kennedy visits Berlin in 1963, is a little far fetched, but I find myself preferring Higgin's books to some thrillers where if the unnecessary description were 'squeezed' out, the book would be reduced by half! I do enough fact based scientific and medical reading for my work; away from that I need escapism and JH provides this with some interesting charactors and locations.

Almost every page is supported by black and white photographs showing many different aspect of life in the Luftwaffe in addition to pictures of various aircraft in the skies. In the middle of the book is a 48 page colour section. Colour photography was not the more popular medium during WW2 - if only because there were very few outlets for colour photographs.

There, as he has dreamed of for months and years, he is reunited with his pretty young wife Ellen, and his young son Joe, a baby when his father went off to war.Soon enough, it becomes apparent that the happy reunion was only the tip of the iceberg. A tangled web of emotions, frightening to both Ellen and Sam, and unspoken by both, threatens to destroy the relationship they both want so badly to keep. Sam is haunted by the atrocities and death he has seen in the war, and can hardly keep in his own skin as he dreams of escaping to far-off lands to make a new start. Ellen, used to being on her own, is frightened by this stranger with her husband's face, and clings even more desperately to the village of her birth and the way of life she is accustomed to. And in between them is little Joe, accustomed to having his &quot;mammy&quot; all to himself, and now misplaced by a stranger he must call &quot;daddy.&quot;Alongside this very private drama of three very private people is the larger story of the village of Wigton, which suffered all manner of privations during the war--but whose people are still clinging strongly to village ways.Bragg, who grew up in the Wigton area, has created a masterpiece, in my opinion. It is followed by &quot;A Son of War,&quot; a continuation of the Richardson saga, and something I intend to read immediately."},{"Title":"The Soldier's Return: A Novel","review":"Melvyn Bragg's The Soldier's Return is the memorable and poignant story of Sam Richardson, a young man from rural England who has fought in the Burma campaign in World War II and who then returns home to a world totally different from the world he has left--everyone and everything has changed.Sam has seen such atrocity that he is now harder and less willing to show a soft side. His son Joe, now five, doesn't know him. His wife has been successful working two modest jobs and does not want to give them up. Sam has been exposed to the outside world, a world which has shown him how limited his future is in the socially inflexible world of Wigton, while his wife Ellen, in contrast, has been supported by the friendships, traditions, and familiarity of this community, where she knows everyone.The tensions within the family and within individual characters grow and boil over, as stiff-upper-lip-ishness comes into conflict with the human need to communicate and share, creating real drama and intensity. Bragg's written dialogue is completely natural, and his descriptions and his narrative style are simple, as is his choice of vocabulary. The reader will have no trouble following the various threads of the story while learning much about Cumbria, post-World War II social upheavals, and the kinds of personal problems that may have been typical for many other young soldiers. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Soldier's Return: A Novel","review":"Based on the reader reviews, Bragg is not well known, but those who have read him are impressed. In this book, his portrayal of the people in the north of England is masterful. They exemplify what Flannery O'Connor said about her family: that the only emotion they allowed themselves to express was anger. Loving, forgiving, and understanding thoughts run through the minds of both Sam and Ellen, but their expression is stifled in the hard atmosphere of their home town. They are at an impasse trying to decide whether to try to re-establish their lives in the familiar but devastated town or to risk everything for opportunity in Australia.England took a long time to recover after WWII, and the efforts of Bragg's characters to put the deprivations and horrors of the war behind them are poignant. In 1946 rations were still short, housing was scarce, job opportunities demoralizing. After coming of age and proving himself in the jungles of Burma, Sam finds himself adrift without so much as a pat on the back. Ellen too has grown during her husband's absence, working, raising her young son, and finding support from an ad hoc family. She finds that Sam's return, which she's longed for for four years, doesn't automatically set things right.The reader is rooting for these obviously intelligent and capable people. Their ultimate decision, literally the last gasp of the book, leaves the reader wanting the rest of the story. And there is a sequel I'm anxious to read."},{"Title":"The Soldier's Return: A Novel","review":"I was very impressed by this book.

This is a very well-researched book. It describes a returning soldier's coming to terms with the horrors of war which he had experienced in Burma during WWII. The story opens with his return; very little of it is flashbacks, except when necessary, and only to tie it in to a current happening in the plot. The soldier's wife and young son have learned to be self-reliant while he was away, and their adjustments to his return are slow and painstaking. Well written, yet the ending was too hastily composed, in my opinion. A long, drawn out plot which ends abruptly, toying with one's emotions, is a characteristic of books which some like....I prefer a calmer resolution."},{"Title":"The Soldier's Return: A Novel","review":"This book has been read by myself and others in a reading group.

While he desperately wanted to get out of the familiar and routine surroundings, Ellen and Joe wanted to stay put almost as desperately.Unsentimental and almost glommy, this book is not for readers looking for dramatic plots or romance.

I've always like Grayson and his band and even the totally formula routine of betrayal, overwelming odds, and final triumph, didn't ruin the fun for me. I must admit that the plot is the same basic one used in the first two books in this trilogy (Decision at Thunder Rift, and Mercenary's Star) but it contains some key elements that are fundamental to how the Inner Sphere &quot;finds&quot; the scientific breakthroughs brought about by Hanse Davion in later Battletech books.The problem I have with this book is a continuity problem that leaves a hole in the plot you could fly a jumpship through. Ricol had a company of Battlemechs with him, clearly discussed when he and Grayson decide to cooperate and try to retrieve the Star League weapons cache. But in the final showdown when the Gray Death has its back to the wall, outgunned and facing a numerically superior foe, those 12 Mechs would have made all the difference in the world. But to make the final battle more &quot;skin of the teeth&quot; Keith reworks the plot and suddenly Ricol has no battlemechs with no explanation where they went.

A must-read!"},{"Title":"The crisis","review":"Hundred year-old books often make for difficult reading, and this is no exception, but the story at the heart of it is one that you probably haven't heard before - especially if you went to elementary school in the North. On the surface it's a sentimental Civil War romance novel: Northern boy with an abolitionist mentor meets Southern girl from old, aristocratic, slaveholding Virginia family in antebellum St. Louis Missouri. Get beyond it.Get deeper into it though and we meet Ulysses Grant, not as a General but as a failed businessman. We meet Sherman before he got his stripes. We meet Abraham Lincoln during the period of the Lincoln-Douglas debates, and the author takes the time and respects his readers' intelligence enough to get into the philosophical and rhetorical merits of Lincoln's debating techniques and the Republican Party's platform. The title of the books is drawn from a question put by Lincoln to Douglas at their Fairfield, Illinois debate. In developing his thesis on the Civil War, the author goes into great detail to explain how a desire for Liberty drove a wave of German immigrants to American shores in the mid-1800s where, as war approached, they displayed pro-Union sympathies. The author's thesis itself is that the American Civil War was not an indigenous event but was rather an chapter in an ongoing struggle between factions of the Anglo-Saxon race, a struggle between Cavaliers and Puritans going back to the days of King Charles I.All-in-all, a book that opens the eyes to different ways of thinkin'. Readers looking for expressions of true equality of the freedmen or non Anglo-Saxon Europeans will not find these."},{"Title":"The crisis","review":"Hopefully the confusion over the two Winston Churchills has been straightened out for anyone searching this page; the Churchill who wrote THE CRISIS was an American novelist, not the British leader (though they knew each other and even met once). During the time this book was written the novelist Churchill was much better known than Sir Winston.This book is Churchill's second historical novel and is concerned with the Civil War mainly around the St. Louis area. As with the previous novel, RICHARD CARVEL, Churchill did a great deal of research before writing his book. In fact, it's the history that's revealed in the book that most impresses; those things that make for a superb novelist , especially plausible character development and credible dialogue, were often lacking in Churchill's works. Stephen Brice, a Bostonian lawyer, comes to St. Louis and falls in love with Virginia Carvel (daughter of Colonel Carvel from the earlier novel), who shuns him because he's a Northerner. Brice joins the Union army when the war breaks out, and through him we encounter major historical figures, including Grant and Lincoln. The climax comes when Brice goes to Lincoln to ask for the release of Virginia's captured lover, Colfax; Lincoln agrees and Virginia is amazingly impressed with Lincoln's goodness and wishes all in the South could appreciate him as she has learned to do. It's about as bad as it sounds.Although parts of the story are pretty exciting, just about all the characters are cardboard cutouts. Even Grant, perhaps his best drawn character, appears and sounds nothing like the general encountered in the history books. Churchill refused to make his characters multi-dimensional: they are either all good or all bad, there is no in-between. He also followed the standard formula for romantic fiction, with the lovers at odds over opposing \\"principles,\\" who over time, in which they are able to demonstrate their noblest qualities, are reconciled. This formula has fallen out of fashion today (though when done well can still make for exceptional fiction), and most modern readers might find the history in the book more appealing than the love story (if they can make it through the love story). The best thing in the book might be the way St. Louis is portrayed; Churchill accurately represents the city, especially the less familiar German element of it. The novel was extremely popular when it first came out - it sold 100,000 copies in the first few days of publication - and it probably will still find favor with those who enjoy old-fashioned romantic novels who can suspend much of their disbelief for 500 pages or so."},{"Title":"The crisis","review":"Forget the above quote about Eliphalet Hopper. Turns out he's a minor player. The true main character is Bostonian Stephen Brice and his long, long, looonnnnggg unspoken love for uppity Southern Belle Virginia Carvel. In between the years when they first meet to finally confessing their love for each other a minor thing known as the Civil War occurs. The setting is mainly St. Louis, a city like many others that is divided in its loyalties. Real-life people pop up now and then, like an unknown Grant delivering firewood and energetic Sherman in charge of a car line. Abraham Lincoln might as well be the Second Coming the way the author goes on and on about him. I'm giving the book three stars because it does move at a good pace and keeps you interested until the end. However, you must keep in mind the times and ways things used to be when this book was originally written. If you're offended by the N-word this novel may not be for you as it is used regularly."},{"Title":"The crisis","review":"This account of the Civil War was written by the American author Winston Churchill, whose poularity at the turn of the century was apparently enough that a similarly named young Englishman though it necessary to add his middle initial, \\"S\\" to his name to differentiate himself. This book is set in St Louis, covering the period from 1852 to 1865. By today's standards it is politically INcorrect as all get-out. But is still an interesting look at the Civil War and a look at turn-of-the-century America's view of the conflict and its protagonists."},{"Title":"The crisis","review":"The book arrived in good condition. To my surprise this was a 1901 copyright book."},{"Title":"The crisis","review":"I found this book in my grandmother's collection and had some problems with the first chapter. But once you slip into the prose, it becomes much easier. First of all, yes, the novel could be seen as politically incorrect. Though using the language of an era doesn't necessarily denote endorsement. Furthermore, the entire vocabulary of multiculturalism had not even begun to be conceived of when Churchill wrote the book.The book is an interesting look at St. Louis during the prelude and main act of the Civil War. It is interesting both because the historiographic perspective of the writer is different from that of contemporary writers and because of the novel's setting in the Western theater. I recommend the book for anyone looking for a different take on a Civil War character-driven novel."},{"Title":"The crisis","review":"The American author, Winston Churchill, chose to set the action in his home town of St. Louis, because it was the site of pivotal events in the western theater of the Civil War, with historically prominent citizens having both Northern and Southern sympathies. St. Louis was also the pre-war home of both Ulysses Grant and William Sherman, who are depicted with drama and realism.Romantic tension develops between the four main characters: one the fashionable daughter of a southern gentleman of the old school, another her n'er-do-well cousin who becomes a stalwart cavalier in the Southern cause to win her approval, the third an earnest young lawyer from Boston who antagonizes her by his zeal for Abraham Lincoln's cause, and the fourth a hard-working clerk with ambitions to advance himself both financially and socially.\\"The crisis\\" is provoked by Abraham Lincoln's opposition to the extension of slavery, and the power of his personal integrity to win people to his cause, including the young lawyer, who becomes a devoted admirer and proponent following a personal interview on the eve of the Freeport debate between Lincoln and Stephen Douglas. This meeting depicts Lincoln's determination to advance the cause of freedom through the possible (and likely) sacrifice of his own political ambitions, and is related with a very believable combination of rustic humor and political acumen on Lincoln's part.The events prior to Lincoln's nomination and his eventual election to the Presidency elicit different reactions among the citizens of St. Louis, from the determined antipathy of the Southern sympathizers, to the equally determined patriotism of the population of German immigrants who have fled from their homeland and whose devotion to liberty has caused them to transfer their allegiance to the ideal of American democracy. One of them is a fellow lawyer who bears the scar of a duel fought with broadswords between himself and an arrogant German noble; a duel based on an actual incident in Berlin.Although the personal rivalries follow an almost soap opera style formula, the overall events of the war from the perspective of St. Louis and the Western theater of war are dramatically depicted with well-researched authenticity, and both Grant and Sherman are depicted as having a personal involvement in the lives of the main characters. A pivotal moment in the heroine's life is presented through her transformation from being self-centered and self-absorbed to becoming self-sacrificing and dedicated to easing the suffering of others. This is represented as a Christian metaphor for the way that God uses challenges to mould a person's character.Eventually she and the young lawyer find themselves meeting Lincoln together to try to save her cousin's life, and together they experience Lincoln's power to bring about a reconciliation between them; just before the national reconciliation which Lincoln proposed between the North and the South would be aborted by John Wilkes Booth's bullet.This novel is a story about Abraham Lincoln in the same sense that the novel Ben Hur is \\"a tale of the Christ,\\" in that Lincoln only appears twice, for a total of about two dozen pages, but his philosophy is a dynamic presence throughout the story. As a side note: General Lew Wallace wrote Ben Hur partly as a way to revive his reputation in the aftermath of the battle of Shiloh, in which his division played an undistinguished role, marching and countermarching futilely the first day of the battle, the aftermath of which left Sherman so discouraged that he remarked to Grant, \\"They sure whupped us today!\\" To which Grant replied, \\"Yep. We'll whup them tomorrow,\\" and they did.In his post-script, the author offers this apology for supporting Lincoln's point of view, by explaining, \\"Lincoln loved both the South and the North.\\""},{"Title":"The crisis","review":"I found this book on the shelf of books we moved in with my grandfather.

He spent his entire ministry at one church (30 years at 10th Presbyterian), in the city he loved and grew it to thousands.I have used his commentaries now in Ephesians, Acts, Genesis, and John, and in my opinion his work in John is his best. For one it is his most thorough -- about 5 times as long as the similarly sized book of Acts. It was also the subject of his graduate work. Lastly, his NT work tends to be less moralistic and more Christ-Centered than his OT work. This is esp. true of this John work."},{"Title":"The Gospel of John: 5 Volume Set","review":"Simple.Explores EVERYTHING about each bit of text.Explained in complete fashion, yet can be understood by even the most casual reader.The only commentary I've read that wasn't WORK to read."},{"Title":"Billy Bishop Goes to War","review":"John Gray's play, a musical tribute to Canada's famous WWI ace Billy Bishop, VC, first performed in the 1970s, has become a classic of the Canadian theatre.

What makes this one stand apart is that it is less predictable than his other novels, in that everyone doesn't end up riding away into the sunset. It has been years since I read this novel, but I can still remember it vividly."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"I've read all of Louis L'Amour's westerns, and appreciate the straight-arrow ethics of his heroes and heroines, the starkness of the environment and their responses to it, and the appreciation of the men and women's appraisals of each other. Most are truly love stories, with action/adventure wrapped around them. This is also one of his saddest stories.Told in the first person, Tell is shot, and by the time he's able to recover and get back to where he left his wagon and bride, all traces of them are gone. He finally finds her grave. Anyone who knows Tell from previous books knows his determination and that he should not be underestimated. It's similar to movies such as \\"First Blood\\" in that a man who seems like any other man can step beyond others' comprehension in his ability and willingness to inflict the same measure of carnage on his enemies. As his attacks and the rancher's reprisals escalate until the odds are 40 to 1 against him, word reaches other Sacketts of the war, and they gather as well. The messages of justice, family, love, heartache, and duty all resound throughout The Sackett Brand."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"When I read this book I got a rush because I could tell it was a good one from the beginning. The Idea of the book was what got me interested in the first place. I had read some of the other Sackett books by Louis L'Amour and this one got me jumpin. It is just the Idea of every one coming to Tell's aide when he needs it the most. It has the makings of becoming a classic if more people would recognize it's greatness. I read it almost tree months ago and I can remember every bit about it. I am Seventeen and if I can like this book so much I am almost positive that others my age, older, and Younger would love it too. I loved reading it so much that I could not put it down."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"Louis dates this book between 1875-1879, with the action taking place in the Mogollon (muggy own) Rim and the Tonto Basin of Arizona Territory. The Apache wars are still in progress as we visit Camp Verde and while there are exposed to Al Seiber. Camp Verde was originally named Fort Lincoln in 1861 when established to protect people from the Apache, the post was originally manned by volunteers, and then later by regular Army in 1866.Al Seiber, 1844-1907, is a name immediately recognizable to any reader of the Apache Wars period. Al was of German ancestry who scouted for the Army, later being chief of scouts over the Apache scouts. Earlier he had fought at Gettysburg, among other civil war battles, receiving at least two wounds. History still holds Al, or \\"Sibi\\" as he was known by Apaches, with great respect. And his times with both Tom Horn and the Apache Kid remains in the mind of any reader spending time with Dan Thrapp's 1964 biography of Al Seiber.This western novel assumes a somewhat strange storyline in that Tell's wife, Ange Kerry Sackett, comes to harm, and is actually murdered. Not just murdered but strangled to death. It seems very much out of Louis L'Amour character in that in all his other novels he continually reinforces the thought that a woman alone would never be harmed by a man, no matter how bad that man may have been. It is therefore somewhat hard to accept, at least for me, that this is the storyline Louis chose to begin one of the Sackett novels. But there it is, and one has to deal with it to try to understand this book.As stated in other reviews, I have all of the L'Amour books in hardcover and read them over from time-to-time. In all my reading of his books over the last 40 plus years, this is one of the more unique Sackett books. If you have not read that much L'Amour it may not strike you in that manner.One interesting aspect, however, of this western novel is that Louis continually mentions the manner which the Sacketts will come to the aid of any Sackett in trouble. Well, in this novel he shows exactly how that would happen, using the word-of-mouth grapevine the fact that Tell is surrounded by at least 40 gunmen in the Tonto Basin area quickly causes any Sackett hearing of it to ride to Tell's assistance.And it is always pleasant to encounter Cap Roundtree in the Sackett books. And I will let Louis himself describe Cap Roundtree: \\"A salty old customer, a mountain man, trapper, cowboy, all-round western man. Dry as alkali dust and twice as bitter. A tough old mountain man who had hunted gold and fought Indians and had the scars to prove it\\". That pretty much not only describes Cap Roundtree but can safely be applied to all the Sacketts as well.This book will afford its readers a couple night's reading pleasure. Let'r rip!Semper Fi."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"Somebody ambushed Tell Sackett and left him for dead. It takes more, however, than cowardly sidewinders to kill a Sackett. Even worse, Tell's wife is missing. After Tell determines that somebody of Lazy A ranch is guilty, he launches a one-man war against the cowboys. Word spreads of the conflict, and Sackett brothers and cousins come out of the sagebrush to even the odds.Typical of Louis L'Amour, this novel is a quick hit of Western action. The Sackett tales stress family solidarity. L'Amour is adept at writing of the lure of distant trails, the freedom of the big sky country, and the Code of the West. He breathes new life and spirit into the usual elements of Western fiction. This is good downtime reading. Enjoy the ride. ;-)"},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"I read this book for the first time in the 4th grade. My dad gave it to me and said \\"You are old enough to understand what Louis is saying here.\\" It was my first book without pictures, and it lead me to read everyone of Louis' books!The message I got from the book was: \\"Doesn't matter what has happened in the past or who the person is, if family is in trouble, you help.\\" As I grew up, I added to it, certain friends, (Like Cap Rountree, and the Tinker) are family. They deserve the same support.I had my oldest son read this as well for the same reason. He may never read another western, but he understands the message I was trying to pass on.If you have ever wanted to read one of Lamour's books, this is a great place to start. If you want a good action book, with excitement, this is a great one as well. I have just downloaded this for my kindle so I can reread it at my leisure. I hope you will too."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"Hey, I'm all over the place as far as what I'm reading, and by golly I sometimes enjoy reading a good ol' cowboy story. It doesn't take allot of brain cells, they're usually a fast read, and usually the good guy wins in the end. That sounds pretty good to me as this world is a pretty serious place sometimes. Westerns are pure escapism for me. The Sackett series, and probably all L'Amour novels can be enjoyed by young readers and adults alike.This is the 16th (and next-to-the-last) book in \\"The Sackett\\" series of novels that L'amour published. The series is basically a collection of stories about the fictional Sackett family who were some of the first settlers to come from England to America in the 1600's. The books follow the lives of multiple Sackett family members through several generations. The first 5 books are set in the early 1600's, and then all of the last 10 books have been cowboy stories set in the time frame of the 1870's. All-in-all I've really enjoyed the series, but some are certainly better than others. The books are also written in a way that you can pick up any one of them and read it, without ever having to have read any of the previous stories........ but it's really more fun to go through them as a series as there are always places, characters, and situations that the author refers to in a previous book, and that makes it kind of fun.Anyway, in this story Tell Sackett is ambushed and left for dead. All of his belongings are burned, and his wife is murdered. That doesn't set well for any Sackett as they're all John Wayne/Clint Eastwood clones........no matter what........the bad guy is gonna get it. This story was extra fun as many Sackett brothers and cousins from the previous books came together to help Tell out on his quest to take care of those dastardly sidewinders. He Get Along Little Doggie......I liked this one better than many others in the series. A quick read and just some good old fashioned cowboy escapism."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"One of the hallmarks of the Sackett novels is the consistent concept of family members coming to the aid of other family members. In this novel, Tell Sackett, one of the roughest and toughest of a very tough family, gets in trouble. He needs help, and the word gets out. This is L'Amour's chance to really highlight that theme of family and he tries...but just misses the mark. There are scenes in the book of Sacketts that were in other books (Orlando, Logan, etc) getting the word about Tell and leaping into their saddles to join the fray. The Sacketts are gathering, and you just know that the bad guys have no clue about the storm that is about to break. But alas, that storm never breaks. The book ends with all the Sacketts lined up, ready to draw, and the fight never comes off. This is very disappointing. His other novels don't hesitate to bring about the fight - why not this one? All in all, it is still a very good book, and if you are a fan of the Sackett series it is one of the top five. Tell's anger and sadness, and his measure of revenge, are all very well handled by a master storyteller. I just wish he would have allowed his characters to mop up the floor with the bad guys!"},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"This is one of Louis' classics. In addition to being a great adventure read, it will definitely pull your strings in a lot of ways. It is at first sad (when the event that is the fulcrum of the plot occurs), and then eventually very uplifting and satisfying. Highly reccommended."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"This book builds superbly, holding one's interest throughout. One can easily sympathize with Tell Sackett, being generally hassled for no good reason, and the hard confidence of his kin as they ride to his aid sets up two or three of the best scenes I've ever read in a Western, period. By the time they get there, you wish that you were yourself a Sackett--of whatever occupation--with the right to stand as one of the family when your relative is being ganged up on.While the Sackett series is generally accepted as one of the best Western series out there, this one stands above the others. Words are used economically to portray the characters; L'Amour doesn't waste your time. I've probably read 200 Westerns in my life (not many, I realize), and if I could keep only one, this would be it."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"\\"The Sackett Brand\\" starts with a bang--almost literally--and doesn't let up. Six paragraphs in and Tell Sackett is falling off a six-hundred-foot cliff. \\"Fear clawed at my throat, and I heard a wild, ugly cry...my own cry.\\" This is action from the get-go. We are off and running and we are hanging on Tell Sackett's every move as he finds his murdered wife Ange and then, pumped full of determination, tracks her killer and takes all the steps that are necessary to extract revenge. When he finds Ange's body he digs a grave up on a mesa and burns words into in a \\"crude cross\\" using the heated edge of a shovel. (Bet that took awhile.) Sackett thinks: \\"Now the chips were down. They would be hunting me, but I would be hunting them too, and there was no mercy in me. There was only the desire to hunt them down on their bloody trail, and give them a chance to try killing somebody who was not a woman alone.\\"Loaded with motivation, \\"The Sackett Brand\\" rockets along. There is precious let-up. The greater Sackett clan, even the outlaws, get word and come to Tell's rescue just as Tell is cornered and counting his last minutes. Yes, family rules. \\"The Sackett Brand\\" is straightforward, punch-to-the-gut action interspersed with the occasional thunder of guns on fire.I agree with at least one other reviewer who thought L'Amour should have shown us more of the bad guys going down, but by this time we know how it ends and feel quite satisfied nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"Tell Sackett is only wanting a life of his own with his wife Ange, then all hell breaks loose. Ange has disappeared and a big cattle rancher wants him dead for some reason. This is an absolute good read, packed with action, emotion and I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"This novel sticks to your fingers and is difficult to put down. Join Tell as he struggles to survive. His future destroyed, Ange murdered, hunted and harried he eventually reaches safety. As soon as able he continues searching for her killer. A few letters from a friend bring other members of the clan riding to his aid. An explosive finish grips you by the seat of the pants. Family values at their best and a great story."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"Taking place several years after The Daybreakers, this book tells of the adventures of Orrin and Tyrel Sackett's oldest brother, Tell. In this story Tell Sackett and his wife are moving to Arizona with everything they have to establish an outfit and a new life. But when Tell leaves the wagon for a few hours and goes scouting ahead he is shot in the head with a grazing bullet. He immediately plummets down the near vertical hillside hundreds of feet but miraculously he survives. Of course, since somebody's after him for a reason that he finds to be a mystery, he escapes pursuit and gets away for the time being.He eventually manages to return to the site of his wagon. There he finds it virtually gone and burnt to pieces. And his wife Ange is missing. Eventually Tell makes it to a fort and finds aid for his wounded and battered body. He also discovers that he is being hunted by an outfit of forty men hired by Swandle and Allen. After having mostly recovered from his fall, Tell returns to look for the body he hopes he'd never find but he does. After giving his wife a proper burial he swears to hunt down the man that murdered her, and get revenge. But the odds of 40 to 1 aren't good. Tell eventually finds his luck running out along with supplies and places to hide. But an occurrence such as this is not common so the word gets out. And eventually another Sackett hears about it. Shortly afterwards there is a large group of Sacketts running to help Tell, including his brothers, Orrin and Tyrel. But some of them fear that Tell will kill all forty men before they get a taste of the action.I thought this was a relatively enjoyable book. I don't think it was as good as The Daybreakers but it was better than others. It had a lot of good action and gun fighting in it and I liked that they included Orrin and Tyrel. I also liked the part in the book where Tell is being pursued by hired guns up a high ledge when he comes face to face with a mountain lion. I think I will continue to read the adventures of the Sackett family in further books."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"If you like Louis L'Amour, I can't think of a better narrator than David Strathairn! He's able to play multiple roles to the point you feel as if you're listening to a larger cast. And not many folks can do \\"local/period piece\\" accents without sounding forced...this sounds as if you've been eavesdropping.A hearty round of applause for a quickly shipped product which was as advertised."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"A pair of young men once pulled Louis L'Amour out of a fight in Tucumcari. They told L'Amour that their opponents steered clear of them because they had over a dozen brothers, and whoever might beat one of the family would be attacked by all the others. L'Amour modeled the Sackett clan after his Tucumcari benefactors.Knowing this, I was puzzled to find that this defining feature of the Sackett family had never come into play in any of the five Sackett stories* I had read before. A Sackett in trouble rarely gets help from anybody, and when he does, it's only from one or two of his kin. But now, I understand. In The Sackett Brand, the family's power finally is fully mustered against one of its enemies, and the sight of a bunch of Sacketts dogpiling the villain turns out to be flat boring.And that's a shame, because the setup of The Sackett Brand is damned good. \\"Tell\\" Sackett and his wife are on their way West to start a new life with the wealth they won in their last novel. While they stop to rest, somebody shoots Tell in the back, he falls down a cliff into a stream, their wagon is stolen and his wife is kidnapped. In the first two minutes!From that point on, Tell has a desperate nonstop struggle to evade a whole gang of merciless, skilled killers, not knowing who is behind them or why they want him dead. Victory is out of the question for the moment; mere survival is going to take everything he has. He also needs to find his missing wife, and even though you know he'll succeed, the scene where he does so is surprising and original.And then, alas, all of Tell's efforts and suffering are pounded into irrelevance under a thundering avalanche of Sacketts, who set the course of the whole final act. The villain is unmasked, and turns out to be dull. The only glimmer of entertainment in the denouement is from Parmalee Sackett, who fights the family's enemies with his wallet instead of his gun. But a lot of Parmalee's charm comes from David Strathairn's voicing of his Tennessee accent, and may be lost if you read the hardcopy.For the Sacketts-all-come-running idea to work, L'Amour would have had to come up with an enemy that actually could give the whole Sackett clan a stand-up fight - something like the consortium of Wyoming cattle barons who started the Johnson County War, or San Francisco's Big Four train tycoons with their army of Pinkertons and railroad detectives. Maybe something like that lies hidden in the big pile of L'Amours that I haven't read yet. But such a concept doesn't play to L'Amour's strength. He was at his best when he was telling the story of a man alone who defines his manhood by struggle: struggle against other men, struggle against the environment, but most of all, struggle to maintain his own integrity.*My previous experience comprised Sackett, Sackett's Land, Lonely on the Mountain, Mustang Man, and the short story The Courting of Griselda."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"Everyone of Louis L'Amour's books deserve 6 stars"},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"After reading this book and thinking back to it then I realize how much I really liked it. The main thing that I like about it so much was not the plot but how accurate the story was portrayed. The author did a great job of portraying how cowboys lived and felt back then. He showed the type of men they were and described in detail the way a man would go about things in the old west. This story had a great start that grabbed your attention and had suspence around every corner. It left you woundering what would happen next and if the main character would live or not. I enjoyed every part of the book except for one. The only chapter I did not like was the 9th because all it did was tell about the brothers of Sackett finding out what happened to him. Other than that borring chapter I would recomend this book to anyone that likes an old western adventure book."},{"Title":"The Sackett Brand","review":"Not one of Louis L'Amour's best. He stretches credibility too far. How can a single man, make a woman, a wagon and a team of mules vanish while mustering cattle with his forty cowboys , in country where everybody is an expert tracker. Also our hero, Tell Sackett, hides himself out in this wild country, but gets himself discovered with great regularity by the searching bad guys, not to mention a bad woman. The rest of the Sackett clan are given a great build up, but play disappointingly minor parts. However they come from all over the west and turn up together just in the nick of time to save our hero from impossible odds."},{"Title":"What To Do When Faith Seems Weak & Victory Lost","review":"Kenneth Hagin's book equips you in 10 easy steps on having your prayers heard and answered !

Verses from the Qur'an are included in such a way as to make the Qur'an itself more understandable to the Western non-Muslim reader. The most refreshing aspect of the work is its lack of reliance on many of the old axe-grinding sources that lead the Westerner down a road not to further understanding of one of the world's great religions, but rather to a dismissal of millions of people as deranged fanatics.To the reader of Islamic history, the author's Persian extraction does come through a bit in his depiction of the status of Ali as the rightful successor of Muhammad. I imagine Sunni Muslims would take issue with that point of view, but still this history is one of the best that I've seen over the years."},{"Title":"Muhammad and the Course of Islam","review":"I read this book 2 years ago and was fascinated by the detail on the life of Mohammad and the history of Arabs and their conquests post-Islam. I recommend this to anyone interested in history and learning about the events that led to Islam becoming one of the major religions of the world today. Unfortunately this book was out of print for a while and I am glad to see it is back."},{"Title":"Muhammad and the Course of Islam","review":"It has been several years since I read this book, but I still recall how clear it was. It provides a detailed yet comprehensible history of Muhammad and the time in which He lived. Some of the events in the early history of Islam are dramatic and make for an interesting read. Verses from the Koran are included and explained. This book is particularly valuable to the Western reader."},{"Title":"Muhammad and the Course of Islam","review":"I found this work to be an excellent study of the Life of the Prophetand the unfoldment of Islam.

This bok is clearly written with love for the world of The Sandman.The art is also gorgeuos. images from the comics are replicated here in a wonderful format. also there are many images taken from other comics and trading cards and several that have been hiding in the editorial vault.though this book is not as detailed as Hy Bender's wonderful ode to the series, and the two do cover the same ground on occasion, this is an excellent addition to anyones'sSandman library."},{"Title":"The Sandman: King of Dreams (Sandman)","review":"From the fall of 1987 to the beginning of 1996, Neil Gaiman worked mostly on the \\"Sandman\\" series of comics, . . . which became trade book collections, and merchandise, and fannish websites, and spin-off books by other writers. Morpheus gave it all up in the end, but the readers haven't. One of the best spin-offs is this overview, or commentary, or summation, of the series, from the first issue to the last, by one of the assistant editors with whom Gaiman worked. She's gone on to other things, too, but she obviously can't leave the Endless behind any more than the paying readers can. It's nice to be able to revisit, all in one place, the wide range of artists who worked on the series and to read Gaiman's brief comments on the origins of certain story arcs and the interconnections between others, not all of which were intentional. And, as Kwitney says, if you've picked up this book without having read about the Sandman, . . . well, now's your chance."},{"Title":"The Sandman: King of Dreams (Sandman)","review":"I admit, I never read Sandman.

I loved it. I'm really looking forward to getting the book and reading the whole thing.For those who don't know William Lane Craig - he a great scholar and known for public debate skills. He had a pretty awesome debate here in Columbus with an atheist thinker. I've only ever seen his writings in textbooks, but this book \\"No Easy Answers\\" is a devotional-style book about prayer.In the chapter I read \\"Unanswered Prayer\\", he explores Jesus' promise to answer our prayers and the seemingly different experience that many people have had. It's easy to understand why some prayers go unanswered, but it's a harder pill to swallow in other areas.He gives 5 suggestions for having an unfettered spiritually powerful prayer life:1. Confess and repent from sin in your lives. Psalm 66:18 says, \\"If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.\\" Also, 1 Peter 3:7 gives biblical precedence to the idea that prayers can be hindered because of sin.2. Ask for things that will glorify God rather than just asking for things \\"with wrong motives that you may spend what you get on your pleasures.\\" - James 4:33. Have faith the size of a mustard seed. James 1:6-8 says that the double-minded man needs to ask and \\"believe, and do not doubt\\" because the one who doubts \\"should not think he will receive anything from the Lord.\\" Now, I think I should point out - as a sidenote, that it doesn't say God won't answer that sort of prayer - it just says that we shouldn't expect Him to if we are just words without faith.4. Develop earnestness about the things we pray about. If we're having a hard time with earnestness, if we just pray for something at a prayer meeting and then never think about it again, we can ask God to help us develop a burden or a passion for the things we are praying for. He talked about when he and his wife raised missionary support and certain people would say, \\"we're not going to support you financially - but we'll pray for you.\\" and how they didn't expect that those people would actually be earnest to pray for them. \\"Unfortunately, Christians have the idea that prayer support is a lesser commitment than financial support, when in reality precisely the opposite is the case. It doesn't take much effort to write a check every month or so and never think of it again, but it's a tough thing to pray earnestly and regularly for a Christian worker or missionary.\\" (p.49)5. Persevere in prayer. \\"Some Christians will tell you that all you have to do is pray once about something, commit it to the Lord, and then relax and trust Him to take care of it. But I think I can say confidently that this is not the teaching of Jesus.\\" (p.50)In the last half of the chapter, Wright talks about Paul's prayers for the churches as an example to us, and wonders if any of us pray that way for others and for churches. His conclusion is as follows:\\"Are you just muddling along in the Christian life, never seeing God really work in response to your prayers? When was the last time you moved the hands of God through prayer? If you're not satisfied with your prayer life, maybe it's time to take inventory of the obstacles to answered prayer in your life...prayer is hard work. But the promises of prayer are great. Let us strive to lay hold of those promises.\\" (p.57)I think as a whole, there are some really good thoughts here. Although, I find myself qualifying some of his points because I think that there are plenty of messed up people who have their prayers answered; and plenty of good people who have their prayers unanswered. And, this can't be about law or formula. However, if you (like me) know that there is no formula and simply want some advice on how to become a better prayer warrior - this is a great book and a great chapter for stirring up the prayer warrior inside."},{"Title":"No Easy Answers","review":"William Lane Craig (b. 1949) is Research Professor of Philosophy at Talbot School of Theology in La Mirada, California. He is also a prominent philosophical apologist (see his debates with atheists, such asGod?: A Debate between a Christian and an Atheist (Point/Counterpoint Series (Oxford, England).)andDoes God Exist: The Craig-Flew Debate).He has written many books on apologetics in general, but this book focuses more directly on doubt, and the problem of evil. Here are some representative quotations from the book:\\"First, recognize that doubt is never a purely intellectual problem. There is a spiritual dimension to the problem that must be recognized.\\"\\"doubt is controllable so long as reason does not usurp the magisterial role. So long as reason operates in its ministerial role, the spiritual assurance of our faith cannot be undermined. It is only when we allow reason to usurp the magisterial role and take the place of the Holy Spirit that doubt becomes dangerous.\\"His philosophical answer to the Problem of Evil is: \\"God could not have created a world that had so much good as the actual world but had less evil, both in terms of quantity and quality; moreover, God has morally sufficient reasons for the evil that exists.\\"Here is a more \\"personal\\" answer: \\"Now we may never know why God permits any particular evil in our lives. But why should we know? ... if the Christian story is true, then we don't need to know either. We are simply called upon to trust in God and His goodness no matter what the circumstances. This is not blind faith; there are good reasons to believe in God's existence, and we have the self-authenticating witness of His Spirit as well. We are not called upon to figure out why God has permitted us to suffer some evil; we are called upon to trust Him.\\"In response to the objection, \\"Why couldn't God create a world with only persons who would receive Christ?\\" he replies, \\"it's possible that there is no such world. It's possible that in every world which God could create, someone would freely reject Christ. Again, God could force them to believe, but then that would be a sort of cosmic rape. Love for God that is not freely given is not truly love.\\"He also includes occasional brief biographical asides, such as that he initially failed his doctoral exams."},{"Title":"No Easy Answers","review":"William Lane Craig is one of the foremost apologists of our time.Even though WLC introduces his book in the Preface as \\"my first attempt at a devotional-style book\\" its difficult for me to dampen his apologetic tone - Maybe its because I have listened to so many of his well prepared and intelligently crafted defences of the Christian faith that I can only hear an apologia throughout the book.He addresses;Chapters;1.

If he would have left certain things unsaid, I believe the readers would understand -- instead of pounding his point over and over again. I know that most of the readers will probably not be familiar with the workings of the Chicago Police Department, but Adamson tends to speak down to his readers in some sections of his book, which at times reads like a campaign to get Pape's badge on some Fraternal Order of Police wall. As an eighteen-year CPD veteran, Adamson no doubt has insights others do not. The problem is, he cannot seem to make his mind whether or not he wants to be part of the story or not. All that being said, I really did enjoy the book.Adamson did a fantastic job researching and storytelling, making me identify with Pape and his co-workers.

Craver is the Freda H. Alverson Professor of Law at the George Washington University Law School and a frequent contributor to The Negotiator Magazine. Professor Craver has taught courses in Legal Negotiating at several Law Schools over many years. Additionally, lawyers will know him for his continuing legal education courses on the negotiation process and alternative dispute resolution and well as for his many books and articles on labor relations, alternative dispute resolution and negotiation. He is, therefore, a true expert in negotiation.Effective Legal Negotiation and Settlement was first published in 1986 and with revised editions every four years or so it has been tested in over sixty law schools and by thousands of lawyers as a negotiation resource. In that time, it has been polished and updated repeatedly and this latest edition is no exception. It is as close to a \\"must\\" for every negotiator's reference shelf as you will find.Craver has an easy to read style, bereft of mysterious Latin terminology and legal mumbo-jumbo. It is a practitioner's book exploring the phases of the negotiation process and providing the \\"nuts and bolts\\" for moving successfully through any negotiation. It is also a comprehensive guide to the special areas of the field and focuses on them and integrates them into the negotiation spectrum. You will find clear and valuable discussions of negotiating with government agencies, international negotiations, assisted negotiation through mediation as well sections on ethics and a variety of negotiation issues.The book is truly a compendium of information, advice and carefully crafted illustrations. You will find the entire family of who, what, when, how, where and why always brilliantly represented no matter what the topic. Easy access to the material is through a carefully constructed index as well as through the table of contents.Want to know more about: how to ask questions, reading the meaning of non-verbal signals, opening a negotiation, or crafting and carrying-out a concession strategy in various stages? It is all here and I do mean all. Facial signals? Twenty-nine are described. Negotiating techniques? Twenty-nine separate techniques are described, their risks illuminated and defenses appropriate to each tactic are suggested. Negotiating via e-mail, telephone, letters? Advantages, disadvantages and risks of each method are clearly spelled-out.All that suggested, let me focus briefly on a single area in Professor Craver's work by way of illustration of what you will find in this book. Every negotiator and every sales manager, corporate executive, government or non-profit leader, every union leader needs to know: how to conduct a meaningful and instructive post-negotiation assessment. There is no single area of more importance to managing one's organization than improving its negotiation performance.Professor Craver is correct when he writes that \\"win or lose ... it is only through objective post-mortems focusing on every negotiating stage that individuals can continuously enhance their negotiating capabilities\\" (p. 308). Now, here is the real stuff of improving the results of your organization. You must know, whether or not you got the agreement, if you did the best possible in the negotiations. In these times of fractional point margins, you have to know the answer to that question about this deal and from it learn how to better prepare and conduct the next deal.Craver tells you how to conduct that essential review, the questions to ask, the areas to focus on. The rest of the book is, of course, the prescription, but first you have to have an accurate diagnosis.The author guides the reader quickly through the essential aspects of a professional evaluation process. First, we explore the stages of the process and then we move into specific topics of importance in evaluating the performance. He suggests that focus should be placed on some specific elements. For examples, Craver directs the evaluator to a review of the concessions; an assessment of the impact of time pressures; a look at the techniques used, including deceitful ones; an assessment of which party got the most beneficial results; and of course, and study of the mistakes made and new tactics employed. Readers will find a valuable three page checklist for post negotiation reviews at the end of the section.Readers should recognize that although this book was primarily crafted as a law school text and is dauntingly lengthy, it is a rich trove for all negotiators. They may also be surprised that according to research cited by the author, most attorneys settle over 90% of their cases through negotiation and yet have no formal training in negotiation. Additionally, we learn that successful litigators may have no more of negotiation skills than any other effective negotiator.This is, therefore, a book for every negotiator, enriched by the author's experience as a negotiator and a teacher, requiring no legal training for its precepts. It is based on the best of psychological and social science research and, of course, seasoned by legal reason.There is an Appendix with several negotiation training exercises that readers may find most interesting and consider employing for training purposes. Additionally, there is an extensive and carefully updated Bibliography.Best book in the field of negotiation.John Baker, Ph.D.EditorThe Negotiator Magazinewww.negotiatormagazine.com"},{"Title":"Effective legal negotiation and settlement","review":"There are a lot of books which deals with the the subject of legal negotiation. Since I am currently writing the first book on this subject to be published in Norway, I have read basically all of the books available. Some books are not so good, some books are quite good. Professor Craver's &quot;Effective Legal Negotiation and Settlement&quot; (Fourth Edition) is simply excellent! In my view, both as a Supreme Court Attorney and partner in one of Norway's biggest law firms and as a scholar/author, this is by far the best book on the market. Why? I have three main reasons: 1) Contrary to many other books it does not loose itself in the world of academics or theories. This book is written for lawyers and others who are negotiating in the real world. As a former lawyer, professor Craver has been there himself. He knows what the lawyer is facing and how the lawyer should negotiate both to obtain the maximum result for the client and to be a value creator. 2) The book is backed by references to studies and examples which show that what the author is saying is correct and backed by real life studies. 3) The book is very well-written. It is clear, it is concise and it is easy to follow what the author means, why he means it and where he is going.I could not have competed with professor Craver's book even if my book had been written in English. I have read his book many times, and I will read it again. This is an outstanding book and superb reading.

I had to use it in a course on negotiation but got very little from the book. Don't know anything about other books in the field but this is full of cliches. An example:'If negotiators can induce their opponents to make the initial offers, they can bracket their objectives by adjusting their own opening offers to place their goals near the midpoint between their respective opening positions. For example, if plaintiff attorneys hope to get $300,000, they can begion with a demand in the $500,000 range to keep their $300,000 target in the middle.'One would hope that anyone who has gotten as far as law school would not need to be told such obvious things."},{"Title":"Paul: Follower of Jesus or Founder of Christianity?","review":"David Wenham answers the question posed in the title of his book by affirming that Paul was a follower of Jesus and not some sort of founder of a new religion. The opening chapter, entitled &quot;Introducing the Question&quot;, was helpful in that the author was forthcoming about his methodologies and biases. No scholar is &quot;completely un-biased&quot;, and Wenham deserves credit for sharing the path his argument will follow before blindly leading his reader down it.A convincing argument is made that Paul was aware of far more details of Jesus' life than for which he is often credited. Wenham tries to avoid what he calls &quot;parallelomania&quot; which is the overzealousness of some scholars to find connections between Paul and Jesus in places where they don't actually exist. Some skeptics may find Wenham guilty of what he claims to avoid, but I believe the vast majority of his arguments are highly probable.Wenham groups the connections between Paul and Jesus in degrees of probability. For example, the &quot;highly probable&quot; category includes Paul's knowledge of the Last Supper, resurrection appearances, Jesus' teaching on divorce and others. His next category is simply labelled &quot;probable&quot; and contains such things as Paul's awareness of the baptism of Jesus, the commissioning of Peter, and many more things. He then moves to connections which he considers to be merely &quot;plausible&quot;, and believes Paul's awareness of the Sermon on the Mount, parables of the prodigal son and vineyard tenants, among several other items, fall into this category.By using degrees of probability, I think Wenham safely avoids the charge of &quot;parallelomania&quot;. He doesn't use statements such as &quot;Paul must have known X&quot;. Instead, he uses terminology like &quot;Paul probably knew X&quot; or &quot;It is very likely that Paul was aware of X&quot;. Taken as a cumulative argument, Wenham's case is highly persuasive. The one shortcoming I found with this book was that Wenham fails to adequately interact with those who would say that Paul was the founder of Christianity. Its apparent that Wenham is more than able to meet the task, so my assumption is that he wanted to focus on developing his case without constantly being sidetracked by the need to refute his opponents. If the book is ever revised, it would be great to see him address this issue. Doing so would make this an absolutely perfect book."},{"Title":"Paul: Follower of Jesus or Founder of Christianity?","review":"This is the most thorough discussion of Paul's relationship with the teachings and life of Jesus available for the layperson. Wenham has struck a masterful balance between scholarly discussion and accessibility. No one should be intimidated by this book, but they also need not fear that they are missing out on relevant issues.A real strength of this book is the seriousness with which Wenham approaches the issues. Discovering what, if anything, Paul knew and carried on from Jesus is not a simple matter. One cannot just throw scriptures at a wall and hope that as much sticks as possible (he even includes a section on avoiding what he calls \\"parrallelomania\\").To his credit, Wenham spends the first 30 pages + framing the issue. He candidly admits that Paul rarely refers explicitly to Jesus's teachings or ministry. He notes that the two usual explanations for this, that Paul either did not know much about Jesus or assumed that his audience knew much about Jesus, fail -- standing on their own -- to explain the situation satisfactorily. But as Wenham points out, there is an even larger issue. To what extent is Paul's message consistent with or the same as Jesus'? Given Paul's influence on Christianity and these questions, Wenham takes no offense about the question that entitled the book: Was Paul a Follower of Jesus or Founder of Christianity?To make his comparison, Wenham does not simply take Gospel verses and compare them to Pauline verses. Instead, he probes underneath to determine what Jesus' message, for example, regarding the Kingdom really was. Then he does the same with the Pauline letters. Only then does he make his comparison. Wenham finds many points of contacts, such as Jesus' use of Abba, the Last Supper narrative (notably determining that the Lukan version was most likely used in the Pauline churches), Jesus' teachings on divorce and paying ministers, and others. He concludes the book with a very helpful summary. Because he covers so much ground, the summary neatly provides the answer to the question raised by the title of the book: \\"Paul saw himself as the slave of Jesus Christ, not the founder of Christianity. He was right to see himself in that way.\\"This book is an excellent resource for anyone interested in the relationship between Paul and Jesus. If you want answers instead of polemics or simplistic reassurances, then you will benefit from this book."},{"Title":"Paul: Follower of Jesus or Founder of Christianity?","review":"This book is a comprehensive presentation of the teachings of Paul and Jesus from the New Testament. I liked the way the various concepts were presented and analyzed. For a scholarly book, it is written in an easy to read fashion that contains enough detailed information for the theological scholar and is easily followed by the layperson. The book basically blows the doors off the theological theory that Paul was unaware of Jesus and created his own version of Christianity.The book is outlined in such a way that many concepts which are presented by both Jesus and Paul such as the Kingdom of God, the Christian Community, and the essentials elements of who Jesus was and claimed to be, are compared, contrasted and dissected against each other. The result is that the author demonstrates that the absurd theories about Paul being unaware of Jesus life and teachings are unfounded.It is clear after examining the evidence that Paul was presenting the message of the Gospel, and was in fact a follower of Jesus Christ and not the founder of a new Gnostic religion. If you have heard these theories and are curious, please read this book."},{"Title":"Paul: Follower of Jesus or Founder of Christianity?","review":"Wenham disputes the consensus of many liberal Biblical scholars that the Apostle Paul is Christianity's true founder. Some scholars insist that Paul, influence by Greek mystery religions, invented much of Christian theology, and particularly the religion's view of Jesus as Son of God.In painstaking detail, Wenham demonstrates that Paul actually knew and drew from much of the tradition captured in the Gospels, in contrast to the liberal scholarship view.Wenham constructs a challenge to those critics who too lightly dismiss the connections between Jesus and Paul. There are some points, though, where he is forced to admit that the connections are tenuous.It's a good study for someone seriously interested in the subject, but too detailed for a casual reader. Anyone who has been persuaded by more radical Pauline scholarship (such as Hyam Maccoby's &quot;Mythmaker&quot;) should give Wenham a fair chance to present another perspective"},{"Title":"Paul: Follower of Jesus or Founder of Christianity?","review":"David Wenham makes a tight case for Paul's dependence on the Jesus tradition. The author shows that Paul displays a thorough knowledge of the life and teachings of Jesus. This is shown by Wenham's pointing out verbal similarities between the Pauline corpus and the Gospels, as well as the tremendous overlap of thought-forms between the two. Wenham does not waste the reader's time examining some of the moot questions which would no doubt be interesting to some readers, but rather shows how his message of salvation by grace is solidly based upon the teachings and works of Jesus. One might have hoped that the author would have dealt more in-depth with Paul's expansion of Jesus' parabolic teachings, but nobody's perfect. Wenham provides a brief, interesting, if not altogether convincing, excursus on whether Paul was aware of the Virgin Birth teachings. His non-dogmatic conclusion is not watertight, but will give the open-minded some rich food for thought. In my opinion, Wenham has taken this oft-neglected, narrow topic to new and exciting heights. All who write on the relationship between Pauline thought and the Jesus tradition in the future will have to contend with the argumentation found in Wenham's stimulating book."},{"Title":"Paul: Follower of Jesus or Founder of Christianity?","review":"Paul has come under the verdict of not being a loyal follower of the Jesus of history but rather being a creative if not even a misleading founder of Christianity. This is the stuff of the Baigent/ Leigh and Eisenman kinds of books and permeats even some areas of the scholarly discussions. As this may be considered a not seeing the wood for the trees, it appears to be a helpful enterprise to examine the trees in order find out about the wood. This is what Wenham's book is about. No doubt where Wenham sees Paul located at the scale, that is as a loyal follower of Jesus. His book is mostly grounded on a convincing reasoning. He doesn't actually claim to be original in a sense, although his argument concerning the transfiguration may be called rather speculative for example. On the contrary his book takes a solid down to earth line, lacks an apologetic overtone and trusts in the power of sound reasoning. His style is highly readable, written not only for academic professional but also for the informed lay person. I recommend this book, because it gives those who already know about the wood serious information about the trees. And - so I hope - even those who may not see the wood for all the trees enough reason to rethink the matter again."},{"Title":"Paul: Follower of Jesus or Founder of Christianity?","review":"I found Wenham's argument more compelling than I had expected. The data he surveys on the connectin between Paul and the gospels is far more exaustive than the dozen+ other books I looked at on the general topic of Paul's Chritology combined and is generally well structured. My main critique is of his strategy of lumping evidence of widely varying likelyhood. This resulted in very thin allusions coinciding with strong cases. On the whole though, it is a well put together volume andworth the pages."},{"Title":"Paul: Follower of Jesus or Founder of Christianity?","review":"New Testament specialist Professor David Wenham demonstrates conclusively that Jesus, not Paul, was the founder of \\"Christianity\\", as it is now called. Paul was, in fact, a faithful disciple of Jesus in every respect.Paul's contributions to the development of Christian thinking and church life were undoubtedly massive. With God's direct inspiration, working through his own personality, Paul worked out an interpretation that was accepted by Jesus' other disciples as faithful both to Jesus Himself and to the social context in which he was working.Therefore, despite the significance of his conclusions, Paul himself would have been horrified at the suggestion that he was the founder of \\"Christianity\\". For him the fountain of all theology was none other than Jesus Himself. Therefore, although Paul's theological thought and teaching was of the highest importance, it was not original to himself, but in essence actually a transmission of Jesus' own thought and teaching. Wenham shows this by means of detailed comparisons between Jesus' teaching and that of Paul.Paul was always aware that the Jesus whom he encountered on the Damascus road and the Jesus of Christian tradition were one and the same Person. Indeed, Paul saw himself as the \\"slave of Jesus Christ\\", not as the founder of \\"Christianity\\". And Wenham's book demonstrates in the clearest terms that Paul was accurate in seeing himself in that way.This has the further implication for theologians that, instead of trying to read Paul's Letters in isolation from the Four Gospels, his Letters should actually be read in the light of these Gospels."},{"Title":"Paul: Follower of Jesus or Founder of Christianity?","review":"It seems that theology is like science; ever changing, ever evolving because of the revelation or discoveries that come as Bible students and theologians pursue the deep things of God found in His written Word, we call the Holy Bible, as well as through archeology, nature, or other unbelievable means. Though it seems also that there are some theological things we are never sure of, it is imperative that we continue in the quest to understand the things of God as He Himself intends them for us to understand. In his book, author David Whenham is pursuing the perceived dilemma of Paul's exposition or presentation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ in contrast to the way Jesus presented the Good News of the Kingdom of God. Jesus came with the message, \\"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\\"Jesus introduced the message of the Kingdom of God as a new rule or a new way of life, not as a physical Kingdom, though Paul later understood the Kingdom as something present and yet with the promise of a futuristic physical establishment of such Kingdom. Jesus' message was accompanied by works of miracle, healing, and spiritual restoration. He spoke in parables that many could not understand and left people in amazement in the way He taught and lived. Paul on the other hand, presented the Gospel in terms of preaching and teaching of this new life rather than through healings and miracle works, though God used Paul on both. For Paul, Jesus was the Old Testament Promised Messiah and King though Jesus never explicitly use those terms for Himself.The book is filled with possibilities and probabilities whether Paul knew the Jesus' traditions. He is, as much as possible, trying to present and defend Paul as a true follower of Jesus Christ and not as the founder of Christianity. The issue whether Paul was a follower of Jesus or the founder of Christianity has as a foundation/origin on the fact that Paul did not refer much to the Jesus' traditions as most Christians knew them then and even today. What needs to be understood on the issue is that Jesus, in the Gospels, was inaugurating a new era before the crucifixion while Paul is writing post Jesus' crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, which implies an understanding for Paul of Jesus as the Son of God. So Paul sees Jesus, not from a historical point of view but from an eschatological point of view.When Paul's works are read, they must be read in light of the Gospel narratives and not as if he is coming with a new message apart from the Gospel of Jesus. Even many of Paul's contemporaries question Paul's apostleship in contrast with Peter and other apostles because the message Paul presented seemed to them as different from the one Jesus handed down. In his book, Mr. Wenham is trying to present evidence that Paul was in fact following in Jesus' steps though the evidence presented was not enough to bet the farm on it, except for the fact that Paul was a well educated individual who, in contrast with other people of his time, knew how to read and write. He was well educated in Judaism, so he knew the Scriptures very well though at pre-conversion he did not have the revelation of Jesus Christ. When Jesus encountered Paul on his way to Damascus, Paul was then in a great advantage over others by knowing the OT Scriptures and having that knowledge coupled with the revelation of Jesus Christ. What Paul is, at the end, is a follower of Jesus.What he in essence did was to take the whole oracle of God though Christ Jesus and present it in relation to his present historical, social, and spiritual surroundings. For Paul, there was no necessity to retell the story of Jesus to his hearers because some of them, as implied by the author, knew the story well. Other hearers, while ignorant of the Jesus' traditions, were not in disadvantage because Paul knew the story of Jesus, whether handed down from Christ Himself or His disciples, and he shared the message in a manner that fit the circumstances while maintaining the message intact and complete in every teaching of Jesus on the Kingdom of God and His righteousness. Paul was not trying to establish a new religion but present the Gospel of Christ as he understood it though he barely or rarely quoted Jesus or referred directly to Jesus' life or traditions."},{"Title":"Paul: Follower of Jesus or Founder of Christianity?","review":"I found this book to be disappointing. The author is obviously a scholar well-versed in the literature and controversies over Paul's relationship to Jesus and to Christianity in general. He knows the issues very well, and he generally seems to resist unfairly characterizing those who disagree with his viewpoint.That said, many of his arguments just seem tenuous and unpersuasive. He finds supposed allusions to Jesus in Paul's letters that are too creative for my taste.Of course Paul knew some of the Jesus stories and traditions - it would be almost inconceivable to me that he wouldn't know anything of Jesus considering his wide travels and discussions with fellow Christians. The question is how much meaningful knowlege and congruence was there?Here is where I find the principal weakness. In order for Wenham to find the maximum number of congruences, he fequently abstracts concrete statements and terminology to a higher interpretive level. For example, the Kingdom of God concept was very important to Jesus but relatively minor to Paul - unless you start theorizing what the Kingdom of God MIGHT mean and then show that some of Paul's teachings MIGHT mean the same thing.Wenham also tries to explain some discrepancies between Paul and Jesus based on historical context. Supposedly, some of Paul's ideas were just specific to churches he is addressing, for example, and that causes him to sound different than Jesus. On occasion, Wenham suggests, Paul (or gospel writer) avoids certain language that might be used by their enemies.While theorizing on Paul's knowledge (or ignorance) about Jesus and his teachings has some interest, the broader question of whether Christianity is Jesus-based or Pauline in character is more critical. I came in thinking that Christianity is more Pauline oriented and I wanted to give Wenham a fair chance to unconvince me. He did not. And that's the bottom line to me. I found his opinion that Paul basically continued & expanded the ideas of Jesus - rather than radically re-directed some important areas of dogma - to be less based on evidence than his personal conviction."},{"Title":"Paul: Follower of Jesus or Founder of Christianity?","review":"Touted as a rebuttal to the Pauline scholarship of e.g. Hyam Maccoby (author of _The Mythmaker_ and _Paul and Hellenism_), this alleged rebuttal never gets around to doing the rebutting. Maccoby is mentioned early on, in a footnote, and then his views are NEVER mentioned again.In particular Wenham never deals with Paul's own claim (in 1 Corinthians 15) to have received his &quot;gospel&quot; by direct revelation rather than from the apostles in Jerusalem. This single verse alone would topple Wenham's case -- yet he NEVER ONCE addresses Maccoby's cogent arguments in favor of this reading.In short, this book leaves Pauline scholarship very much where it was: with Paul as the true founder of Christianity. Wenham's work will be convincing only to those who already believe."},{"Title":"Paul: Follower of Jesus or Founder of Christianity?","review":"I have bought this book some time back, and have decided to read it in a bid to understand the arguments regarding the issue of Paul and Jesus. The author has done a good job of utilizing the evidence, textual and otherwise, to prove his conservative position on this issue, and thus show that even by the standards of modernist scholarship, a reasonably good case can be made of the essential continuity between Jesus and Paul.What erodes the usefulness of this book and undermines its case however, is the wholesale capitulation to the prevailing \\"scholarly\\" paradigm of Modernism especially in this case Higher Criticism. The entire humanistic presuppositions behind Modernist \\"theo\\"-logy is assumed to be correct even though there is no rationale (and no proof) for why such is so. The author's case thus utilizes the Modernist hermeneutic of unbelief, instead of the Biblical hermeneutic of Sola Scriptura and the epistemic primacy of Scripture. This can be seen for example in this statement found early in the book: \\"We cannot take for granted in this study that the Gospels' description of Jesus is historically accurate in all points\\" (p. 20). Presumably, the Modernists do not find it strange that they can take for granted \\"in this study\\" that Rationalism and Empiricism (both used in the process of Higher Criticism) can discover historically accurate proof - a logically fallacious enterprise. Rather than begin with the Truth of Revelation and deduce truths from there, they rather commit intellectual suicide through embracing the logically fallacious and cognitively vacuous process of rationalist and/or empiricist \\"historical accurate proof\\". Thus they prove the Scriptures correct as stated in Rom. 1:21-22 - that in their rejection of God's truth and in professing to be wise, they in actual fact become fools; exchanging the glory of God for the image of \\"god\\" they create through their historical and textual deconstruction. It would be much better for them to decontruct their own skepticism and humanism instead."},{"Title":"Paul: Follower of Jesus or Founder of Christianity?","review":"I am still not convinced that Paul is not the great villian and founder of the new religion called Christianity. Just read the book called \\"Mythmaker: Paul and the Inventions of Christianity\\". I thought this book would be more convincing. I wasted almost $10 on this book. That money could have gone towards better use such a charity donation. I am going to be more careful before I purchase religious books (especially ones that claim the Christian way to be the only way backed up by evidence). I am stupid for making this mistake twice.All I can say was the author needs more citations to back up his findings that Jesus (not Paul) was the actual founder of Christianity. I wasn't amused by all his citations in the back."},{"Title":"Meeting at Infinity","review":"Meeting at Infinity (1961) is a top notch effort which can be read both as fast paced adventure story or a scathing attack on pure capitalism. Likewise, John Brunner successfully turns the clich&eacute; of the noble primitive society-prevalent in so many works of the 50s and 60s-completely on its head (a theme he returns to in his masterpiece Stand on Zanzibar, 1969).Plot Summary (rather minimal spoilers)The Market looms above a city of twelve million still partially paralyzed by the devastation caused by the White Death. This horrific disease came was introduced through the indiscriminate use of the Tacket Principle. This Principle allows passage between an infinity of parallel worlds (at various stages of development). Because of the contamination brought from another parallel world, The Directors, a group of merchant princes, franchise out the use of the Tacket Principle to trusted individuals. These merchant princes journey to various parallel worlds in search of technology and food (to import back to the home world) The entire world survives ONLY by taking advantage of various peoples they encounter in parallel worlds. The city itself is dominated by various factions who survive by collecting information for various merchant princes who are constantly fighting other merchant princes.The plot follows a jumble of characters who slowly uncover information about the world of Akkilmar. Akkilmar, a seemingly primitive peaceful altruistic society, supplies technology to Ahmed Lynken, the merchant prince who first \\"discovered\\" them. The famous physician, Jome Kenard, purchased a piece of equipment from Ahmed Lynken (from Akkilmar) to treat a serious burn patient (Alyn Vage) who develops peculiar skills despite being completely bandaged. I best not reveal the rest!My ThoughtsJohn Brunner adeptly weaves the various narrative threads together (although initially they seem impossibly disparate). I'm still not exactly sure of the point of the bizarre prologue. By far the most interesting concept developed is the purely capitalistic state which utilizes colonialism in its most basic form in order to survive which is, subjected in turn to similar impulses under a drastically different guise. Don't expect well rounded characters. But, there's great action and the plot unfolds nicely! There are also some harrowing images. Tacket, the creator of the Tacket Principle, is completely vilified by the populace since his discovery resulted in the White Death. Despite the fact that the limited use of his principle is the ONLY way which society is maintained, various cults have emerged in opposition to the merchant princes. These cultists pound nails into the mouth of wooden carvings of Tacket!John Brunner, within the constraints of early 60s pulp science fiction, produces a remarkable (forgotten) little gem."},{"Title":"Meeting at Infinity","review":"Another reason Brunner remains my favorite science fiction author! After reading fourteen novels by Brunner and thinking \\"I must have seen it all\\", I pick up a mint-condition 1969 Ace edition of Meeting at Infinity (1961) and realize that Brunner holds as many surprises as he does mysteries. Being one of his earlier novels, it's a great place to start if you avoid The 100th Millennium (1959) and Echo in the Skull (1959).For a 1960s novel and only being 155 pages, the complexity and intrigue Brunner manages to weave into the fold is impressive from the cryptic start in the prologue. It's one of those novels, which as soon as you start, you realize you going to need to take notes. It's not like a droning lecture on economics where every topic holds some importance, rather it's to keep track of the variety of character names and character duty (for me, plots are easier to track than characters).The Earth we know has discovered the science of transportation to parallel worlds of alternate histories of earth. With this connection comes administration of the new earths and the import of items. This administration is controlled by The Market, who are strict about import because of the White Death which was accidentally imported and destroyed half the earth's population.Ahmed Lyken is a mercantile prince with a franchise over the earth-sister planet of Akkilmar, linked by Tacket portals to Earth. The portal/planet administration in The Market finds the latest shipment of wheat to contain a mold and they move to strip the planet from Lyken, albeit with ulterior motives. Lyken won't go down without a fight and begins to recruit resistance among the city's masses. A detective named Athlone hunts for an attempted murderer, Luis Nevada, but only becomes entangled in the web of deceit which The Market had begun to spin. Nevada was cleared of murder charges because his wife lived through her ordeal and she is now supported by an exotic technology imported from Lyken's earth-sister of Akkilmar... which is the nexus of struggle conveyed in Meeting at Infinity.That rather lengthy summary only touches about 15% of the overall plot, which only becomes headier and headier with each passing chapter. It's a novel requiring concentration and understanding; it's not a novel to be picked up and read on commute or when bored as it requires some passages to be re-read. With the logistics aside, the reader will also be immersed in a subtle yet rich urban landscape which Brunner creates. Without as many words, Brunner paints a dreary, capitalistic society bent on segregation and exploitation yet still managing to survive because of the love/hate connections between parallel earths. A timeless essence shrouds the ongoings of the scurrying street gangs, the lofty administration, and the preparation of battle for the earth-sister of Akkilmar. The dark and subtle tone of the onset of the novel is engrossing.Compound this eternally nocturnal setting with a cast of quickly yet craftily humanized characters and you'll the life emerge from the pages: \\"The Rememberancer gave a nod; he liked to recite verbatim, which was his greatest pleasure because it was his only accomplishment.\\" (page 21) With a single sentence, the reader can identify with the quasi-profession of the Rememberancer. Another particularly well crafted wordiness orchestrated by Brunner is how he ignores a simple sentence like \\"Then he fainted\\" and spins it into, \\"Curdy let slip his hold on consciousness and drifted into the comfort of darkness again.\\" (page 147)Meeting at Infinity is a complex yet fascinating gem in the hit-or-miss bibliography of Brunner. This early \\"definite HIT\\" of Brunner's launches itself into my Top Three Brunner novels thus far, along withTotal EclipseandThe Long Result. Onward it is, with the other 10 or so Brunner yet-to-be-read novels lining my shelves!"},{"Title":"Meeting at Infinity","review":"Meeting at Infinity (1961) is a top notch effort which can be read both as fast paced adventure story or a scathing attack on pure capitalism.

Specifically, he links the imagery used in John's apocalyptic writing to the imagery in the apocalyptic writings of the \`Old Testament,' e.g. Daniel. This enables readers to anchor John's symbolic, and often confusing, language within his own tradition, i.e. the tradition of a first century Jew. Furthermore, Maahs's provides provocative insights about how said linguistic symbols refer to specific social-historical issues, such as the Roman Emperors and/or Roman cultic practices.He begins his commentary by analyzing the seven churches. In this analysis, he exposes why each church, in its \`uniqueness,' is a targets of John's letter/s. After introducing the churches themselves, he allows his commentary to follow the text, verse by verse, exploring the strengths and weakness of these seven early churches, while equally addressing how these strengths and weakness are directly related to the churches' involvement in the broader Roman community.Finally, Maahs uses his analysis of these first century churches to expose weaknesses within the modern day church. By doing so, he shows us how the prophetic nature of John's letter is most firmly anchored in its ability to address the church's failure to live out God's call throughout history, whether that be in first century Rome or modern day America."},{"Title":"Of Angels, Beasts, and Plagues: The Message of Revelation for a New Millennium","review":"I have read a number of commentaries on the Book of Revelation.

Jamey Cadmus, 17, was part of a pilot project of highly gifted adolescents 5 years earlier and Dr. Delaware was a consultant for that project.Jamey, disoriented and confused, calls Delaware from a private hospital in the California Canyons. He is kidnapped from his room and it falls to Dr. Delaware to investigate the hospital and Jamey's tangled family tree.Set in 1987, Dr. Delaware makes numerous references to the university project that accepted Jamey in 1982, when the boy was nearly 13. He uncovers a questionable family history, a web of murders and corrupt developers in the canyons. Jamey, by now found and incarcerated in the County Jail, tries to, in his own incoherent fashion tell Dr. Delaware what he knows about the series of cases.Robin has a more prominent place in this story. Although I never cared for her, the one thing that annoyed me in this book was one scene where Delaware greeted her, \\"shushing her with a kiss.\\" To me, the \\"shushing her with a kiss\\" was simply a way of shutting her up. That act sounded as if he had no use for her opinions or anything she ever said and smacked of chauvanism. Notice his shushing her with the standard kiss came on the heels of providing food. Robin and meals can always be found in the same place and that is really old.Delaware was plainly far more cerebral than Robin ever was and I felt that single act was to underscore his mental superiority to her, not unlike Jamey's mental superiority prior to his breakdowns. The theme of glass houses is revisited throughout this story.This is truly an outstanding work. Readers are taken on some very painful, bumpy roads through the seamy, seedy parts of Southern California and encounter some equally seamy, seedy characters. Bikers, corrupt developers, questionable family ties, persons not involved with the cases -- each appears to be a likely suspect. The conclusion is powerful and very satisfying; it makes sense, yet stays several steps ahead of the readers. Each character is richly drawn and believable; each new layer of mysteries interlock believably. Jon Kellerman is truly the Michaelangelo of the Mystery genre."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (An Alex Delaware Novel)","review":"A mind-blowing look into the nature of madness. The psychological background is totally fascinating. I learned a lot about how the mentally ill are treated by the system, some background of schizophrenia, the difference between psychosis and schizophrenia and how they relate to the law, and so on. There's more, but I won't give away any surprises.The dialogue, as always in Mr. Kellerman's books, rings true. Watch out for the main characters, though! The twists and turns keep coming right to the end of the climactic chapter.A few minor complaints. I felt some secondary characters could've been developed more. This is just my taste, but I find the lengthy descriptions of buildings, landscapes, etc. a bit tedious. I had hoped for at least the beginning of a resolution to Milo's problems with homophobes at work. But you gotta save something for later in the series. I was taken aback to learn that, at the time OVER THE EDGE was written, gays were officially(?) considered deviants.Lots of food for thought in this book. There are many ideas here that'll get your gray cells going.If you have any interest in the workings of the human mind -- the sane and not-so-sane -- grab this book!"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (An Alex Delaware Novel)","review":"When Dr. Alex Delaware is woken up in the middle of the night by an incoherent, frantic call from a former patient, he suspects that not all is well with the world. Things take a decided turn for the worse when said patient is found in the midst of a bloody murder scene, what appears to be one of a long series of sexually-motivated murders. Thrown into the middle of the fray by his desire to find the truth out about his patient, Dr. Delaware once again must put his experiences as psychologist and a sleuth to the test.The third of Jonathan Kellerman's Dr. Alex Delaware novels, readers will find a cast of familiar characters amongst the throngs of the new and the suspicous. In addition to the good doctor himself, we also have the return of Detective Milo Sturgis as well as luthier and love interest Robin. The familiar characters are comforting, because the rest of the cast of characters are a frantic mess of psychological problems which leaves the reader dizzy.I found the pacing and the character development in this book to be odd, and somewhat off. It's nothing that I can really quantify, but something didn't feel quite right throughout the work. That being said, Kellerman has once again produces a psychological thriller that is compelling and leaves a couple of bits of mystery left until the end, even for those who can unravel the threads of the tale before the denouement.Definitely worth reading if this is your genre, though I still find Kellerman's first Alex Delaware novel (When the Bough Breaks) to be my favorite in the series thus far."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (An Alex Delaware Novel)","review":"As a writer, and as someone who reads 100 books a year, I can usually spot where writers are going before they even get there. I've read several of Kellerman's books, but this one is not predictable and never gets old, and is so skillfully written that no matter how many times I read Over The Edge, I can't figure out how he ties everything up in such a neat package and ends the story with such a meaningful last sentence, which makes me cry every time I turn the last page.As for the plot: How could the imprisoned and nearly comatose (when we first meet him face to face, and for most of the novel) Jamey Cadmus have strangled and mutilated a handful of prostitutes? But all the evidence points toward him. When we eventually find out why he is the only suspect, we have uncovered some of the rottenest, meanest forms of inhumanity towards the most vulnerable in our society.Kellerman has filled Over The Edge with larger than life, colorful characters, even the secondary ones: Tully Antrim is kinda hip and cool; the art store owner has a major attitude; even the players in the Mexican restaurant seemed to have full lives beyond their short scene. I imagine Kellerman had a lot of fun with the two cops and all their scenes; I crack up every time they show up. As for the major characters, Alex Delaware is always a delightful pleasure to meet and get to know; Milo is a sweetie; Robin is a pleasant mystery; and Jamey, every time we meet him, is an uncomfortable reminder of whether or not he is guilty of extreme violence.Kellerman tapped into some of my deepest fears: I was considered highly gifted at an early age, was aware of the term \\"genius/madness\\" shortly thereafter, and subsequently terrified that something horrible would go wrong with my brain, as happens to Jamey. The ride Kellerman takes me on every time I read this is frightening, thrilling, interesting and ultimately satisfying. I will never forget Jamey's story."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (An Alex Delaware Novel)","review":"This is the first novel featuring Alex Delaware, child psychologist and it is a stunner. I don't know why I have resisted reading Jonathan Kellerman for so long, but I sure do regret it. When Dr. Morton Handler and Elena Gutierrez are found mutilated in Handler's apartment, Det. Milo Sturgis recruits Dr. Delaware to help unlock the mind of the only witness, 7 year old Melody Quinn. As Dr. Delaware tries to help this child, he unwittingly unlocks a deeper secret, one that has existed for over 40 years. This novel is a fine debut for Jonathan Kellerman.

Overmedicated, hallucinating and confused, Jamie spits out a bizarre message that is calling for intervention. He is a patient at a hospital in the Canyons. Dr. Delaware races over there only to discover that Jamie had been kidnapped from his room.Jamie's abduction and subsequent breakdown lead Dr. Delaware on a labyrinthine chase involving the head of Project 160, who had an agenda of her own; Jamie's aunt and uncle who grudgingly took in this gifted, tormented boy; a spurned gay lover; some wild bikers...the list is quite long. Dr. Delaware has to find Jamie within a certain time frame. Developers, also, want to know about Jamie and what information he might have. Jamie's uncle has an attorney, a man with long established ties to Jamie's family who is key figure in the case.This book takes you through the underbelly of parts of Southern California.

A few theories regarding Schizophrenia have changes since the 1980's but still a fun read. If you enjoy a twisting mystery with a background of old money and mental illness you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (An Alex Delaware Novel)","review":"This story is good from several aspects, the best being his realistic portrayal of psychosis and psychological illness. He is not a journalist of the 20/20 variety trying to get it right--he's got the knowledge and experience to make the details believable. Kellerman is a nice narrator, and he has some characters we can really root for--Detective Sturgis, Alex himself, and the true victim in this story, Jamey.Unfortunately, this book is twice as long as it needs to be. You can skim so many paragraphs that don't contribute to character or plot development--you know, all the times Dr. Delaware goes to feed his fish, or the descriptions of some tract of houses off some California freeway.In the end, the plot is fairly contrived. The final scene has all the suspects in the same room. The villain is unmasked, those characters we thought were benign turn out to be malignant, a few gunshots ring out--but just who shot who?!! The plot is also implausible as well. If you sit down and summarize how the bad guy(s) pulled off the plot, it seems pretty silly.All in all, it's a pretty good read, but it's an early enough effort to still have significant drawbacks. Delaware sure is a nice guy, though!"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (An Alex Delaware Novel)","review":"(Book 3 of author's Alex Delaware/Milo Sturgis series.) When child-psychologist Alex Delaware gets an incoherent, late-night call from a former patient, he is pulled into an investigation of the brutal murders of male prostitutes, among others. This rather salacious story has a lot of twists and turns which end when all is fully revealed during the final Sturgis/Delaware confrontation with the masterminds (i.e. guilty parties in the 'drawing room'). If only the book actually ended at that point. But Kellerman decides to grant Delaware a chance to be a psychologist - a session that should have stayed confidential and not brought the book to a dull ending.Most Kellerman fans will enjoy this book. While the twists and turns are fun, some clues in the unraveling appeared too contrived. Kellerman also leaves some interesting threads dangling undeveloped - particularly in regards to detective Milo Sturgis. The beginning of the book continues to develop the friendship between Delaware and Sturgis, as well as issues Sturgis is having in his department and personal life. These threads are simply dropped about half way through the book. Delaware girlfriend, Robin, actually contributes a contact in this investigation, but continues to be a stick-figure, Barbie."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (An Alex Delaware Novel)","review":"This is the third Alex Delaware novel written by Jonathan Kellerman, butit's the second one I've read. The first one I read was a much morerecent novel (Therapy) and was kind of slow going at first, but this onehad me hooked on page one! Alex Delaware is an intriguing character andit makes a nice twist to have a crime novel told by someone more on thefringe of the investigation. Delaware is a Psychologist who sometimesdoes consulting for the police department. His good friend Milo Sturgisis a homicide detective, so Delaware is often drawn into complicated andgrisly cases.This book starts with a phone call in the wee hours which turns out tobe a crisis call from a former patient. James Cadmus had been a childgenius, but now has evidently gone off the deep end. When he is foundwith two mutilated bodies and the bloody knife in his hand, it seemsobvious he's a homicidal maniac. But Delaware isn't so sure. It's awickedly tangled web, but Delaware finds help in some unexpected placesand the truth slowly becomes clear. Great stuff.I love the dynamic between Alex and his friend Milo. Poor Milo has a newcaptain who doesn't like him, so he's going through hell at work at themoment and that leads to the bottle and trouble at home too.

So buy comfortably and knowing that if something went wrong with your order thy would take good care of you. :)"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (An Alex Delaware Novel)","review":"Over the Edge, the third book in Jonathan Kellerman's highly successful series starring psychologist Alex Delaware, is more technical and clinical, though no less exciting, than the first two. Like its predecessors, the book addresses dark acts committed by disturbed individuals, but unlike the first two books, Over the Edge focuses more on the psychology behind the acts than on the acts themselves or the investigations that follow.When Delaware is awakened in the middle of the night by a frantic and disjointed phone call from Jamey Cadmus, a former client, his concern leads him to the institution where the Jamey is hospitalized. Upon arriving, he finds that Jamey has escaped and is now being sought in connection with a series of grisly murders. When Jamey is apprehended, his lawyer hires Delaware as a psychological consultant in his defense. But the more Delaware researches Jamey's condition, the less likely it seems that Jamey actually committed the crimes of which he is accused, despite the indicting physical evidence. As the investigation continues, Delaware must embark on a frightening virtual journey into the dark depths of the human mind.All three of Kellerman's early fiction books focus on the evils that people do to each other, but this one takes it a step further and explores the evil a person can do to himself. Schizophrenia, drug abuse, and suicide are prominently featured with lots of technical descriptions and jargon, slowing down the pace a bit in the middle of the book. But as always, the first-person narrative style and compelling interpersonal conflicts drive the story, and the unexpected ending is a tribute to the author's storytelling prowess.Unsurprisingly, there is little in the way of redemptive or uplifting content beyond the eventual triumph--for the most part--of human good over human evil. Depictions of drug abuse, some sexuality, and an entirely secular worldview are cause for caution in reading, but Kellerman is an excellent writer, and fans of the psychological thriller will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (An Alex Delaware Novel)","review":"This, the third book in the Alex Delaware series doesn't disappoint. While at times a bit mired in psychiatric and psychological details, it is after all a psychological thriller. An interesting debate in this book is are we psychological beings, capable of being helped through psychotherapy, or are we simply biological organisms who can only be helped by pharmaceutical ingredients. I look forward to the rest of the books in the series. While redundant in details at times, it was still a very good read."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (An Alex Delaware Novel)","review":"The copyright date on this Alex Delaware novel is 1987. I had not realized the series was that old ~~ or Dr Delaware, for that matter.Even then, at the beginning of the series, the writing is fluent and well thought out. The plot is carefully planned, with a lot of interesting ideas to ponder as you follow the story.Something that interests me: I really enjoy Kellerman's work, but in the last couple additions to the Dr D series, I have been able to spot the Bad Guy the moment he appears on the scene. I can't put my finger on what it is, but there is something that tips me off right away. (You can probably tell I have read a lot of Kellerman's books. They're all good!)However, Over the Edge kept me guessing right up to the end, with extra unexpected surprises. As I have suggested in another review, maybe the author, like the villains he writes so vividly about, falls into patterns that give him away.Never mind all that, just read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (An Alex Delaware Novel)","review":"Psychologist Alex Delaware participated in a study of teenagers with extemely high IQs. One of the participants in the study, Jamey Cadmus, began to show psychotic symptoms during the study and Alex was dismayed that he could not help Jamey and, in fact, might have caused him some harm. Five years later, James places a late-night call to Alex which sounds like a cry for help. Jamey's disjointed and bizarre ramblings are difficult to untangle, but Alex decides he must try to help the young man. In doing so, he becomes involved in a court case which will have serious ramifications for Jamey's future.Jonathan Kellerman uses his background as a psychologist to spin a creative and complex story. Jamey is a fascinating character, at once sympathetic yet terrifying in his actions. Author Kellerman at times uses too many psychological and pharmacological terms for the typical lay person, but despite this, the book is an engrossing read."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (An Alex Delaware Novel)","review":"Jonathan Kellerman's may not be the most impassioned writing, or the most elegaic, elegant, beautiful, etc, but it has that one quality which all great writing should have: Intense readability.His prose is bright and breezy, cheerful and just plain easy to read. He creates a good cast of varying characters, the development of whom could only be improved upon a slight bit.This novel is certainly his best so far (im reading them in order) it has a complex, detailed and interesting plot, and it is packed full of interesting psychological stuff. (Although sometimes he goes too far with some of the exntensive medical explanations and words which mean squat to me.)The plot is interested, and the book powers along at great pace.

This tightly written story, about a former child-patient of Dr. Delaware's that supposedly grows up to become a schizophernic serial-killer, reads much like a Q &amp; A session: the reader follows Alex Delaware on numerous &quot;interviews&quot; as he attempts to gather information to establish his former-patient's mental stablity. At times the novel gets a little too technical in all of it's psychological terminology, but makes up for it with strong character development and an amazing ending.

I found myself fitting into Alex Delaware's thought patterns with no trouble and I managed to hang on through all the plot twists without getting lost or bored.

The characters were well-developed and that can be the most crucial thing of all in a book like this with lots of details that eventually need to be pieced together.

This is the only thriller I've ever read twice. I was so excited about this novel that I purchased several copies of OVER THE EDGE and sent them to my friends. Some people who'd never read a single book by Kellerman thanked me for getting them hooked on this highly intelligent and gifted author.I love Kellerman's poetic prose. It manages to be imaginative and hard-core realistic at the same time.

Dr Delaware is telling everyone who will listen all about the psychological theory, then it is repeated again and again by other characters explaining it to yet other characters. Then there is the excruciating detail of the drug research he and 17-year old genius pretty girl do (seriously!). Do we really need to hear all about the different drug combinations that could NOT be applicable to the case he is investigating?If you are new to Kellerman, don't read this one first.

But, on the other hand, a lot of the plot felt contrived with far too many serendpitous events which served only to enable the author to make another plot turn. Some of it was very un-realistic: a shrink wouldn't act the way Delaware does in some of the situations, and it's highly unlikely that any professional police force would allow Delaware to be so personally involved in much of the investigation and ultimate denouement. Diehard Kellerman fans will probably love this offering; I'm lukewarm about it."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (An Alex Delaware Novel)","review":"I've read several Alex Delaware novels, and have enjoyed them. Sadly, this novel was not as easy to enjoy.The mystery itself is interesting, and the insight that Jonathan Kellerman has when it comes to his characters is in top form. Milo and Alex are both well rounded and enjoyable, supported by a wide variety of characters that make the world of the novel deeper than most mystery novels. I wanted to know what the answer was. I wanted to know the why, and when it was finally revealed, I felt satisfied.The problem is that the pace of this novel is painfully slow. This is not a short book, clocking in at over five hundred pages, and the flowery prose and over use of description make parts of this book a chore to get through. I can say that Kellerman has improved in his later novels, but in Over the Edge, the constant focus on scenery and detail is mind numbing. This same problem bleeds into the obviously well researched, but overly complex facts of the case. Material that could easily be given in five pages ends up filling ten to twenty. If all of this had a purpose in the story it would be fine, but in the end it just feels like the author was throwing in facts, and again the pacing suffered. Any sense of urgency was lost, and I found myself skipping over pages worth of descriptions (specifically clothing and furniture) just to get to the point of the scene.Basically what should have been an enjoyable mystery became an overwritten chore. This novel could easily have been trimmed to four hundred pages, and not a single aspect of the story would have been lost.Now, while I didn't enjoy this novel, I can say that the series is still one of the best written, and best researched I have read, and luckily Jonathan Kellerman has gotten his prose under control. Still, I would say skip this book, and try a different novel in the series. The Murder Book and Bad Love are both great entries.Also, it should be noted that this book contains many offensive homosexual slurs, and because this book was written in the late eighties, most of the characters have a very negative view of gay men (although it is arguable if this view has really changed much in recent years). All of this is appropriate within the context of the story, but understandably many readers could find this offensive. (Although they would be missing out, because Milo has to be one of the most interesting and well rounded gay characters in popular fiction that I have read in a long time.)"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (An Alex Delaware Novel)","review":"Not one of his best.

This was for my elderly blind mother who was truly enjoying the novel, only to find the last two cassettes were garbled."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (An Alex Delaware Novel)","review":"When I start getting antsy, I automatically go to the back of the book and read the last few chapters. If I can easily connect the dots from what I've read from the beginning to what I read at the end, I put aside the book and move on.This book not only had a surprise ending, but I wanted to know how the characters progressed to get there. I found myself reading forward and skipping back to the end multiple times to try to understand how it got there. I wasn't even able to skip a single page because the plot was so in depth and the events unfolding were so intriguing.In general, I do like Jonathan Kellerman for that reason - most of his books make me want to read it from beginning to end. I find myself learning more about the characters and understandng Alex and Milo and Robin a little bit more each time. While many \\"series\\" books tend to get repetitive, I feel that most of Kellerman's books (and indeed this one) is unique and intriguing."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (An Alex Delaware Novel)","review":"Okay, I have been reading a lot of Kellerman's books lately (4 in the past three weeks) and like a lot of other mystery novels, they are compulsively readable. But am I the only one who thinks his plots are just TOO conveniently convoluted? In this book and Monster as well there are plots that go back 40 years that conveniently spring up just in time for Delaware to dig them up. Why does everything have to be soooooooo complicated all the time? Why can't it just be interesting? Part of the fun of having a shrink sleuth character would be in examining WHY people behave the way they do but this often just becomes a plot device. Still, a great series but it could be so much better!!!"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (An Alex Delaware Novel)","review":"This was the 4th book I read of Kellerman's. I found it to be very interesting, it kept my mind going. I thought some of the technical lingo was hard to pronounce and understand.

Just wasn't as impressed as I hoped I would be."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (An Alex Delaware Novel)","review":"In his third Alex Delaware novel, Jonathan Kellerman, award-winning, bestselling author of When the Bough Breaks and Blood Test, has produced his finest work yet -- a relentlessly suspenseful thriller that is destined to become a classic and that confirms his status as a writer of enormous power, and immense popular appeal.This gripping journey into the genesis of madness begins when psychologist Delaware receives a garbled, middle-of-the-night crisis call from a former patient -- a young, troubled genius whomhe last treated five years before, and who has apparently suffered a devastating mental collapse. Alex's attempts to trace the origins of Jamey Cadmus's breakdown place him at the hub of the investigation into a string of vicious serial murders -- and cast him into conflict with the detective on the case, his long-time friend, Sergeant Milo Sturgis.The setting is Southern Californiain all its rich variety: gleaming limousines and august mansions reeking of old money; a county jail where psychopathic inmates roam the corridors; the paneled offices of formidable and manipulative attorneys; the ghostly, parched ravines of the High Desert.The cast of characters is finely drawn: a psychiatrist who views himself as a \\"biochemical engineer\\"; a shadowy pair of outlaw bikers with a ravenous appetite for bloodletting; a deranged former cop with a grudge against Milo; and Jamey's friends -- a group of young prodigies whose towering intellects fail to insulate them from guilt and fear.As Alex plumbs the mystery of Jamey's deterioration, he uncovers the secret life of one of California's most powerful families and is witness to a climactic explosion of murderous passions and shattering revelations."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (An Alex Delaware Novel)","review":"For the most part, I enjoyed OVER THE EDGE. It's a very effective psychological thriller about a young man who may or may not have committed a horrible series of murders. It works well as a whodunit, and Kellerman knows how to keep the suspense alive in his stories.OVER THE EDGE does suffer from many of the flaws that characterize Kellerman's work. The storyline is not particularly realistic, and is very complex and convoluted (Kellerman takes 50 pages to explain it at the end). This novel also contains a lot of pages of technical jargon, including some rather incomprehensible discussions about how certain drugs affect the limbic system of the brain. While I'm impressed by the depth of Kellerman's research, I think he dumps way too much of it in his novels, leading me to skip over quite a number of paragraphs.Still, I really enjoy Kellerman's writing style, and I found OVER THE EDGE quite engaging for the most part. While it isn't as good as WHEN THE BOUGH BREAKS, I think this is definitely one of the better Alex Delaware novels that I've read."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (An Alex Delaware Novel)","review":"Having also read THE BUTCHER's THEATER, WHEN THE BOUGH BREAKS, and BLOOD TEST, this book has only encouraged me to read more of Jonathan Kellerman's Alex Delaware. Although it moves slowly at first, the story is rich in detail and characters, and the plot develops very intellegently. Milo Sturgis cas become more complicated and more likeable at the same time, although Robin, Alex's girlfriend, seems irrelevant. Everyone other character emerges as a possible suspect, if even only for the reason that they are all psychologically a little OFF. Certain parts read like a psych textbook, that's true, but it's only at a point that research becomes very important in the discovery process of the case. This should only seem fascinating if you've been paying attention, and if you are, you might be able to figure it out only a step ahead of Dr. Delaware, whou doesn't actually get it all until the end, anyway. Altogethor, I thought this was a terrific advancement of the series, and I can't wait to read SILENT PARTNER."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (An Alex Delaware Novel)","review":"For a while I had lost interest in the book, but the last 100 or so pages were excellent. OVER THE EDGE becomes too complicated at times, with many characters. I'd recommend reading Kellerman's novel SELF-DEFENSE before reading OVER THE EDGE."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (An Alex Delaware Novel)","review":"A psychologist unrolls a case here and develops it to one of the finest thrillers I have ever read. I do not know whether the case of this boy is realistic, but the story is excellent. All the other characters are very well developed and believable. The plot is breathtaking and has several unexpected twists. The ending reminds of a classical Agatha Christie show-down, with the difference that the characters in this book are genuine and psychologically sound in their presentation. The author does use his professional terminology but as a non-expert I did not get lost. The author explains everything, but not in a dry, professional way, the explanations are an integral part of the story and even contribute to the suspense. An extra class page turner."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (An Alex Delaware Novel)","review":"This is the third in Jonathan Kellerman's series of detective novels featuring psychologist Alex Delaware. So far, this has been a great series, and this book is no exception. I just wish that Mr. Kellerman hadn't gone into so much detail about the psychological information he presents in his book - that put me to sleep REAL fast.This story's been done before - but never quite in this way. The plot was totally believable, although the character of Souza the lawyer wasn't - he seemed to be too pompous to be true. But Delaware does ring very true, as does his policeman buddy, Milo Sturgis.I know that a new Alex Delaware novel has just come out - I look forward to reading it, but I prefer to read series in order, so I don't miss anything. I just hope that Kellerman de-emphasizes the research in the rest of his books. I grant that it's important, but he should know when enough is enough."},{"Title":"Over the Edge (An Alex Delaware Novel)","review":"It was ok, I have read better books by this author, it started out exciting but then bogged down, easy to figure out the villians"},{"Title":"Over the Edge (An Alex Delaware Novel)","review":"great book.

Her grandmother is known all around for being a midwife and healer. Both Margaret and her mom Sophia go along with Charlie Kate on house calls and help take care of the sick. I loved the relationship between these three smart, strong women. They stick together, they watch out for each other, and they take care of everyone. This book has some really sad moments, but overall you feel good reading it.A couple of great quotes from the book:\\"My grief had been plain and unpoetic, and the hole in my heart would've grown wide enough and deep enough to consume me had my mother and grandmother not kept me with them, and still.\\"\\"In our house, the point of reading and learning was neither to impress outsiders nor to get a job or a husband, nothing like that. It had nothing to do with anybody but the three of us. When a good book was in the house, the place fairly vibrated.

My favorite character by far was the grandmother and matriarch, Charlie Kate. She is a self taught healer, and treats her patients with a combination of common sense and tradition. Charlie Kate is feisty and isn't afraid to speak her mind or take on the powers that be.

Charlie Kate represents a forward thinking woman who was not afraid to care for sick and desolate people of that era. I found much substance in the novel. I am in the medical profession and felt that Kaye Gibbons did her homework regarding herbal remedies and medical treatments that seemed appropiate. Take time to read this novel it is worth it!"},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This book is good, but only if you can tolerate the rambling narrative style it is written in. The characters are solidly developed, and the anecdotal episodes are well-done. It can be predictable at times, and I'm not sure if a male audience will like as much as a female audience, but both genders could find this book entertaining. Only the femaile audience may find it enlightening, however. As a college literature professor, I read this book in hope of perhaps using it in a course, but I decided against it. That doesn't mean it's bad; it just means it's a nice piece of light, easy reading which women will enjoy ... and men probably won't."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This story is more than a little farfetched -- quirky unlicensed but sought-after physician grandmother enlightened enough (in the U.S. South, in the 1940s and 1950s) to give abortions and do CPR on colored folk -- silly mom -- plain young girl who has no exposure to males in any form or at any age, who suddenly falls in love with a rich privileged handsome guy with curable war wounds. It instantly blended into a dozen or so such chick-lit feel-good southern stories I've read over the past decade or so, and like them left not a trace on my brain or imagination."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This book is a kind and gentle read. There are no startling insights or life-altering observations, but it is worth reading because it does speak of values and ethical behavior. The grandmother is a strong woman whose opinions are revered and who doesn't tolerate fools. She is unfailingly consistent in her outlook and mission, which is to help other people - with or without their consent. Her daughter is lonely and well-meaning, and the granddaughter is growing into herself and her beliefs with help from her grandmother. This book has charm."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Kaye Gibbon's Charms for the Easy Life will be a shock for most of us, accustomed as we are to the doomed, dysfunctional women of Southern literature. The book deals with the lives of three generations of hyperfunctional Southerners: Charlie Kate, grandmother and miracle working midwife, her vamp daughter Sophia and her intellectual grand daughter Margaret. Gibbons used WPA interviews as background to the story, and the closer she adheres to the WPA stuff, the more interesting it is. All in all, it is an engaging read with lots of interesting detail on Southern superstitions and folk cures. After a while though, my B.S. counter started to tick. Here are people who came up from nothing, yet manage to have the literary taste of Boston Brahmins. They sail quite comfortably through the great depression with all the comforts -- including indoor plumbing. Despite being an uneducated midwife, Charlie Kate is firmly in control of all the doctors and hospitals in her area, she has a better success rate than the Mayo Clinic, and Margaret, the clever misfit, never seems to have a lonely moment."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"The three women in this book are possibly the strongest characters I have ever read about. The story is told in lovely prose, reading this book is like sharing a weekend with your best women friends. I wish this exquisitely told tale was one without an end."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Charms for the Easy Life, written by Kaye Gibbons, was in my opinion, very heart-warming and inspiring. The novel was set in the mid 1930's to 1940's in Raleigh, North Carolina. Margaret, the narrator of this novel, shares with the reader her story of the women she lived with: her gorgeous mother, Sophia, and her grandmother Charlie Kate-Birch, an unlicensed physician/healer. Although there were two unsuccessful marriages within the two generations before Margaret, in the end, all found love and happiness. Charlie Kate made a name for herself for being one of the kindest, hard-working physicians in North Carolina and was included in an edition of Busy North Carolina Women. Sophia became involved with an intelligent, handsome, charming lawyer, Mr. Baines, a graduate of Yale. The three generations of women were engaged in helping those who were ill. Hence the reason why Margaret became a doctor. The Birches were women who promoted strength, loyalty, love, and compassion, not only to their patients, but also to each other.Kaye Gibbons has done a grade A job. She provided the reader with great plot elements, showing each character's strength to carry on a good life. Charlie Kate's will to continue her legacy of reaching out to the community, regardless of her aging, was an inspirational aspect of the novel. As was the journey to finding Sophia's future love. Gibbons presented to us a lovely story, not just another unbelievable fiction.This story of how women made it through life during the time of World War II is not only inspirational, but also engaging."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I have wearied, in recent years, of reading novels by authors whose characters are interesting only by virtue of their being from the South, and whose plots depend on rural Southern details and the characters' Southern eccentricities. I feel this is a cheap ploy, so I wasn't particularly interested in picking up Gibbons' book, Charms for the Easy Life. But I'm glad I did! OK, the novel benefits from its &quot;Southerness&quot;, but I got the sense that such a skilled writer as Gibbons could make proper Bostonians glow in realism. This book is not only a delightful read, but it also touches on the not-so-easy relationships between mothers and daughters, and the equally difficult relationships between women and men. Gibbons also exhibits a detailed (but not obvious) research of the Depression Era, and, on top of it, she makes a sturdy comment about the value of non-traditional medicine. My only complaint is about the book's resolution, which came too quickly and tidily for me. Although I read it in one afternoon, the characters have stuck to my ribs and, the more I think about the book, the more its layers are revealed to me."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I like to keep a second copy of this book handy in case I need to recommend it to someone. I don't ever want to be without it. The women in this story all live on in my mind/heart long after the last time I read it. I was not crazy about Ellen Foster when Oprah went on and on about it...I always thought she should have chosen this book.I guess if you're \\"forced\\" to read this for school I would recommend that you have a quick attitude adjustment first. Having been stuck reading some seriously dry assignments long ago in the stone ages, how I WISH a story like this would have been put in my life when I was younger! I can't understand a word of the negative reviews here.It's like chocolate.I understand how people might not like brussel sprouts even though I do.

That's what Charms for the Easy Life is for me."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I loved this book.

It is great!"},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"The narrator is top high school student Margaret Birch, who lives with her mother Sophia and grandmother Charlie Kate in a small town in North Carolina in 1940. Charlie Kate is the well-read town medic with no formal training but a whole lot of experience who upstages the doctors from time to time. Margaret can't be persuaded to choose a college, because she loves assisting her grandmother on house calls too much to leave home. Charlie Kate is Margaret's main adviser and confidante. Sophia is a good mother, but she lacks Charlie Kate's wisdom when it comes to unconventional Margaret, who shows no interest in boys, clothes, or cosmetics. Both Sophia and Charlie Kate made bad choices in husbands, both of whom strayed and are now out of the picture. Margaret constantly laments that she wasn't sired by the doctor who Charlie Kate chose as a suitable mate for Sophia but whom both parties rejected. My favorite section of the book is where Margaret is volunteering at a hospital and takes on the task of reading and writing letters for wounded soldiers. Appalled at what they dictate, as well as a screwy Dear John letter that one receives, she and her grandmother fabricate their own letters to send home for these men, with mixed results.

While the relationships were interesting, I felt that they lacked certain emotions or realities, which alienated me as a reader. As a whole I found it to be an easy read, but flat.

I am searching for a book that is equally as awesome as 'A Virtuous Woman', but it looks like Kaye Gibbons isn't going to give it to us. In this book the women are survivors because they have to be. I was disappointed in the cold, compassionless character of Charlie Kate. Her character shined through her words and actions: beneath that arrogant surface lay a very insecure, unsatisfied, unfulfilled, and angry person. I can understand why she didn't have a man: who would want her? Her hatred of men, I think, was more of a jealousy. She had no compassion, so she tried to make up for it in her 'intelligence' and 'literacy'. She tried to hide behind those midwife skills.

Unfortunately, the plot was facile, superficial, and unbelievable -- a fairytale with pretensions to reality. The characters were stereotypes, drawn with the broadest brushtrokes, with no remotely &quot;human&quot; qualities. What qualities they did have were repellent, a trio of do-gooders with no compassion for human failings other than their own. In short, I found this novel insultingly smug and sanctimonious, the kind of novel that gives Southern literature a bad name."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"What a desappointment!

I'm ure I'd love A Seperate Peace if I didn't have to write an analysis of Finny and Gene's relationship. damn school."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I don't know if I would have appreciated this book quite as much if I hadn't listened to the audio version read by the author. This is not your 43rd American president's southern accent. Nothing clipped, cocky, or clumsy about it. Kaye Gibbons speaks earnestly in extended syllables and dulcet tones, her voice imbued with serenity, compassion, and intelligence. Think drawl, not twang. Similar to, but thicker and warmer than even the loveliest of my North Carolinian friends' accents, it transported me southward in place and backwards in time.The audio edition my library carried was abridged, and so immediately upon finishing that, I read the unabridged print version, more because I couldn't bear to leave Sophia, Margaret, and Charlie Kate's company than any feeling that I'd missed something, though it was rewarding to delve even more deeply into their richly-drawn, highly idiosyncratic world. While I quite enjoyed Ellen Foster, as well as all of Gibbons' books (in fact, I prefer Diving Women to Ellen Foster), it didn't impress me nor draw me in nearly so thoroughly as Charms.Since the description Amazon provides of this book is not very detailed, and since I can't do a better job, I'll quote the one from the Harper Collins website:\\"A family without men, the Birches live gloriously offbeat lives in the lush, green backwoods of North Carolina. Radiant, headstrong Sophia and her shy, brilliant daughter, Margaret, possess powerful charms to ward off loneliness, despair, and the human misery that often beats a path to their door. And they are protected by the eccentric wisdom and muscular love of the remarkable matriarch Charlie Kate, a solid, uncompromising, self-taught healer who treats everything from boils to broken bones to broken hearts.Sophia, Margaret, and Charlie Kate find strength in a time when women almost always depended on men, and their bond deepens as each one experiences love and loss during World War II. Charms for the Easy Life is a passionate, luminous, and exhilarating story about embracing what life has to offer ... even if it means finding it in unconventional ways.\\"If I ever get around to making such a list, I'd say Charms for the Easy Life would be among my top 20 favorite books. It's such a shame that Amazon offers none of Kaye Gibbons' books in audio."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"\\"I have read two books a week for thirty years. I am satisfied that I know everything.\\"So says Charlie Kate Birch, and she's not shy about sharing her knowledge, whether you want to hear it or not. Charlie Kate is an early-1900s North Carolina midwife, herbalist, and self-styled doctor (with no official credentials). She's feisty, outspoken, and somewhat manipulative, but also very civic-minded and generous. You can't help liking her, even if she is a little too full of herself. Her daughter Sophia and granddaughter Margaret live in her orbit and are mostly grateful for the direction she gives their lives as a threesome.Kay Gibbons' writing is highly polished and carefully restrained--a quality I'm coming to appreciate more and more for its rarity. She also has a sly gift for humor that sneaks up on you. One of the characters will make a seemingly dry observation, but if you circle back and read it again, you catch the subtlety and burst out laughing. For example, when her mother Sophia asks God for help in a hurry, Margaret notes: \\"He no doubt knocked Himself out getting to her, as she was such a trophy among his creations.\\"This is a quaint, charming, and at times hilarious story. I really liked the portrayal of these three highly intelligent, book-loving Southern women. They learn from their mistakes and don't take any guff from men.***If you want your own easy-life charm, you'll need to find the hind foot of a white graveyard rabbit caught at midnight, under the full moon, by a cross-eyed Negro woman who has been married seven times.***"},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This was first book of Ms. Gibbons I'd ever read.

HIGHLY recommend."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I have read and enjoyed Kaye Gibbons' other works (\\"Ellen Foster\\", \\"A Cure for Dreams\\", and \\"Sights Unseen\\") and I think, with the possible exception of \\"Ellen Foster\\" that she has outdone even herself. The characters- grandmother Clarissa \\"Charlie Kate\\" Birch, a self-taught alternative healer, mother Sophia, the most romantic of the family, and main character and daughter Margaret, practical, intelligent, yet romantic- are unique, they stand out from the average woman of the 1930s-1940s of the South. Yet at the same time, they have the same basic desire, to be loved and respected, as anyone else.Gibbons' portrayal of Charlie Kate as eccentric yet admired by the community for her healing work showed that one does not necessarily need to follow the mainstream in order to be successful and happy.

The book follows each woman as she finds love, manages family relationships, and blazes an unconventional path towards her own happiness. Through it all, the women demonstrate an insatiable and admirable thirst for knowledge.The story is told from granddaughter Margaret's point of view. The writing is evocative and engaging. In addition, the character of the grandmother is one for the ages. Uncompromising, set in her ways, and sure of her talents, she is not a woman you will forget easily.The novel is largely about how family cares for one another, about how Charlie Kate, Sophia, and Margaret are each one another's \\"charms,\\" making life easier, happier, and more livable.

What interested me as I skimmed the book was the location of the novel in the South. Ms. Gibbons writes like McCullers, Welty and O'Connor, not in their unrelenting manner of the Southern grotesque (although there are some gruesome tales of people suffering from all kinds of afflictions), but in their portrayal of vivid, memorable characters. The core of this novel is a three-generation family of intelligent, strong women, and the most remarkable character is the grandmother, a de facto doctor, without a license. She is the healer of the town, but more importantly, she heals her family and gives them the strength to perservere. She gives her daughter and her granddaughter the resolve to leave their cloistered home and venture into life self-assured. Ms. Gibbons' writing is simple, profound and compassionate. My only criticism of this work is that at times I felt that it was a bit simplistic and contrived, but I recommend it nonetheless."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"This may be the first school reading assignment that I have ever actually fully enjoyed, except for maybe a few exceptions. I really liked reading this book because it talked about a young girl's life growing up in a family of women, which is something I believe many teenaged girls can at least partially relate to. I really liked how not one bit of it was boring. The author kept it interesting by meshing the main character's grandmother's doctoral experiences with the entire family's daily life. I especially enjoyed how towards the end the author created a bit of a romance between the main character and a young man.

I read it for escape, and this book &quot;escapes you&quot; to a place where women are strong, where your grandma can tell you everything you need to know, where there are some bad, lost, and abandoning men, but not all men are bad, where life is full of hope and magic is possible.It is literate, with references to many authors we should all read. There is some social commentary, some sadness, some things everyone should know (papaya tablets for digestion, aloe for burns, etc.)Charms for the Easy Life (&quot;depending on your definition of easy&quot; should have been a subtitle) was wonderful. I will be reading more of Kaye Gibbons books in the future.A lovely novel."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Kaye Gibbons has one of those rare gifts that not all writers possess: the ability to take the lives of fictional people who are seemingly nothing in a high profile society and make them sparkle with with more interest and more reality-based magic than any heavily financed publicity machine could ever do.You come to believe these three beautiful, strong women and the reasons for why they stand together--not because--but in spite of the unworthy men they've encountered. Grandma Charlie Kate, a smart, literature loving, though uneducated woman, is gifted in natural healings and believes that when a person dies and purges (foam at the mouth), it is all their hopes, dreams, and things left unsaid. She is odd by others' standards, outspoken, and that's what makes people respect her!Daughter Sophia is the more openly dreamy side of Charlie Kate, hopelessly romantic in spite of a disappointing marriage to a man in yellow shoes, and she loves high fashion. She faints easily at the sight of infections when she helps her mother on housecalls, and is mad for a man named Mr. Baines who takes his sweet time going to the altar.Sophia's daughter Margaret tells the entire story of the family's somewhat Hemingway-like suicidal history and recounts their lives mainly around WWII. Margaret is more like Charlie Kate, but she still has enough of her mother in her to fall in love with a wounded soldier who comes from a good home, having broken the circle of bad men on the first crack.Everyone makes such a big deal about the Vietnam soldiers suffering more than any others, and I know that they did their share, but if you read this book and the life breathed into it, you will see that no war and what it does are any good. Beautifully written, easy to accept as nonfiction, and full of bittersweet richness, this is easily a book that should reap rewards for its quiet grace, humility, and strength of character. I love this book dearly, and urge you to read it because of the human interest. You will never forget it long after you are finished."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Contrary to some of the reviews I have read for this book, I found it believable and enjoyable. Just because you come from a rural background does not mean you cannot develop an appreciation for fine literature or are unable to rise above your origins to make a better life for yourself -- college education notwithstanding. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Charlie Kate was an inspiration and reminded me of similar older people who I grew up with here in the much-disparaged rural state of South Dakota. Most of the people living in the 1930s had no other resources besides themselves. They had to rely on their own ingenuity and that of their neighbors, to pull them through. I think that was very well-illustrated in Gibbons' narrative. The main reason I enjoy Gibbons' books is because in spite of all the trauma her characters go through, they rely on humor to deal with it. That is one of the most valuable lessons that can be learned whether you live in urban America or not."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"I cannot get enough of Kaye Gibbons!

I now want to jump up and down on my monitor after the Kirkus review. Boo. Hiss. The review criticizes the book mostly for it's Southern storytelling influence and values, and as someone who read it while temporarily living in the deep South, I have to say that those elements made it all the more special. As a &quot;Transplanted Yankee&quot; I not only learned about the South from this book but it make me appreciate the sense of family that is so abundant there. This book moves through generations of women gifted with honorable traits and as a reader I related to a bit of each of them.

Charlie Kate is the larger-than-life character, an \\"Ubermensch.\\" Charlie delivers babies, heals with herbs, reads two books a week, and directs the lives of her daughter, Sophia, and Margaret (Charlie's granddaughter). Since the impressionable Margaret is the narrator, it stands to reason hero worship takes precedence over a more reliable picture of the family's history of the first half of the twentieth century. She recites events before her birth with a fondness that is reserved for those we do not truly know; some warts of the family tree are exposed, such as the history of several suicides that provide some morbid humor. One male family member whose sexual orientation is questioned by everyone except his mother, \\"shot himself after having spent two miserable years grieving over the death of Rudolph Valentino.\\" Women's clothes are found in one of his drawers. The son's mother says, \\"Oh, Charlie Kate. He had a girlfriend. Look at all her things here. I always knew what people said about him wasn't so.\\" Margaret recalls, \\"my grandmother stuffed the dreamland girlfriend's things into a paper sack and marveled that a man would cram his feet into shoes so high and narrow.\\"The meat of the novel centers on Charlie and her indomitable spirit (she surely would be labeled a feminist today). One conflict both Charlie and Sophia have endured, that Margaret is determined to avoid, is the deserting husband. As far as dating advice, Charlie would often say, \\"Kiss all you want. Kissing's fine, nothing more than uptown shopping on downtown business. But if you suffer him to put that ugly thing in you before you're married, do not come to me to ask how to undo what you have so stupidly done.\\" Somehow the three of them live under one roof in Raleigh, North Carolina, and quite well financially, since Charlie's mobile medical business (no license) is booming. Margaret recalls several stories of how grandmother saved this person from a lynching; sewed body parts together, treated malaria, and comforted the dying. After awhile one half-expects to read Charlie donning a cape and running around in tights with a big \\"S\\" on her chest (Charlie would have to wait at least until 1938 when Superman was created).Besides the over-the-top portrait of Charlie, the novel still seems to plow forward as Gibbons fleshes out characters with dialogue that is sharp and has no effects of sounding contrived in order to say something witty. \\"Charms for Easy Life\\" may not offer a rounded character description of Sophia, Margaret, or a realistic one of Charlie, but the novel still manages to enliven a picture of life down South from the turn of the century to World War Two. Life may have not been easy for these renaissance women, but Gibbons sure has afforded us the pleasure to partake in their charms.Bohdan Kot"},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life (Chivers Sound Library)","review":"Three generations of women are the focal point of this novel, and though their familial bonds are tight, there are unique characteristics of each that make the reader care for each. Charlie Kate, a headstrong &quot;medicine woman&quot;, says it like it is and won't take no for an answer. But she is not just forthright with her opinions, but also with her feelings for her family. Her daughter Sophia tends to &quot;need&quot; to be someone's companion, whether it be a man, her mother, or her own daughter.

Her daughter, Sophia and granddaughter, Margaret were secondary characters but their stories are just as charming.Charlie grew up poor. She married the river ferryman. After their daughter, Sophia was born, they moved inland. Charlie kept her midwife practice going and soon, her husband abandoned her to work on the Ohio River. It was just Charlie and Sophia, till Sophia married a man who made a mockery of their wedding by wearing yellow shoes. While Sophia's daughter Margaret was still young, Sophia became a widow.

The grandmother, Charlie Kate, is a fascinating, well developed character whom the reader cannot help but admire (she reminded me strongly of the aunts from Alice Hoffman's 'Practical Magic'). Somewhere between a medicine woman and a psychic, she was nevertheless predictable, in that she hung around until her daughter and granddaughter's lifes were fixed and then she died. Terribly predictable, but sparkling with its descriptions of WWII Raleigh and the life of an herbalist/midwife.

Finney and the Spirit of American Evangelicalism (Library of Religious Biography Series)","review":"After having read this book, I have mixed emotions. First, I'd say that I learned quite a bit, and enjoyed the tremendous amount of research the author put in. Hambrick-Stowe is clearly knowledgeable and it comes through in the book.My main hesitations in recommending this book are the almost gratuitous jabs the author takes at Finney and others that take away from the scholarly feel. For example, after his conversion, Finney quit his practice as a lawyer and told a client (as he writes in his autobiography), \\"I have a retainer from the Lord Jesus Christ to plead his cause, and I cannot plead yours.\\" Hambrick-Stowe decided to follow this up with the line \\"A famously witty utterance, it is also the kind of line that may have gotten better with each telling until it finally saw print\\" (p. 19). This type of cynical statement, grounded only in the author's speculation, almost ruined the book for me. He does it several times. Sometimes it's based on his opinion (as the above example). Other times, when there are two conflicting accounts, he will select one as the \\"correct\\" version and then put the other version in a bad light. He does this a few times with Finney's Memoirs. Charles Finney wrote his Memoirs (his autobiography) when he was in his seventies, about events that happened up to fifty years earlier. Interestingly, he asked his wife to burn it the day before he died. He never even intended his autobiography to be published! Though there are undoubtedly some errors in his Memoirs, it was actually a \\"prodigious feat of memory\\" as Hambrick-Stowe calls it (p. 292). Whenever Hambrick-Stowe finds a discrepancy in it, he should have been more charitable, realizing it was the work of a man in his seventies who did not intend it to be published. In general, I wish he had been less caustic in general, especially in the early parts of the book.To his credit, Hambrick-Stowe does nicely set Finney in the historical context, and acknowledges the immense accomplishments and genius that Finney had. He ends with the appropriate quote from James Morgan that \\"There was in him [Finney], in prayer, the most remarkable power that I have ever seen in any human being.\\"Instead of this book, I would recommend three other sources to start learning about Charles Finney. The first would be his abridged autobiography (edited by Helen Wessel). This is an excellent place to start to learn about the man. For those with more interest and time, the complete and unabridged autobiography (edited by Garth Rosell and Richard Dupuis) is a very long but *very* thorough and well done work. It is even more scholarly than Hambrick-Stowe's work, carefully footnoting many other external sources to fill out Charles Finney's life story. Finally, to get a sense of what Finney preached and his style, there is a volume of his sermons called \\"True Christianity\\" that is an excellent place to begin."},{"Title":"Charles G. Finney and the Spirit of American Evangelicalism (Library of Religious Biography Series)","review":"Charles G. Finney And the Spirit of American Evangelicalism By Charles E. Hambrick-StoweThe book Charles G. Finney by Charles E. Hambrick-Stowe is a biography of an influential nineteenth-century Christian, Charles G. Finney. Hambrick-Stowe writes of the ways that Finney influence on the people brought forth the spirit of American evangelism. The author looks at Finney as a typical American, and as a Spirit filled believer mixed into one. One of the major themes in the book is how this complex man, Finney, managed to hold together the very different religious beliefs. These beliefs were of Presbyterian New School-Old School schism, and the Calvinist and Wesleyan versions of the Protestant gospel. Another theme is about the effectiveness of Finney ministry and his way of preaching. Before his conversion Finney was an apprentice to a lawyer, and Hambrick-Stowe points out how this had much influence on the way that Finney preached. Finney began his preaching career in and around New York after the first Great Awakening, and before the Civil War. According to Hambrick-Stowe's account of Finney's conversion and preaching ministry, was anything but traditional. Hanbrick-Stowe continually points out different times that Finny broke with the traditional ways of preaching and went on to forge new ways to evangelize the American people with much vivacity. Hambrick-Stowe did not believe that Finney started the Second Great Awakening, but he was a major contributor influenced by preachers from the Great Awakening. His critical thinking skills and the poor preachers that he heard before his conversion helped strengthen his conviction to present the gospel with furor. Hambrick-Stowe makes Finney out to be the spark that lit the fire of evangelism. Because there was much turmoil in the church, and a lack of enthusiasm in preaching, Finney's style spoke directly to the people and brought on deep conviction of even the hardest critic. People responded to Finney's preaching because he used whatever method was necessary for the congregation. The greater the crisis in the community where Finney preached, the greater the response to the Holy Spirit. If a town or city were experiencing turmoil in any sense of the word, they would look to religion to lighten the burden of the social and economic status. Finney used this to his advantage in the pulpit. Hambrick-Stowe lets the reader believe that another reason for the effectiveness of Finney's preaching is due to Finney's personal interest in the people Spiritual wellbeing. In his ministry, Finney would go to different people's house to talk to them on a personal level, and to get a better understanding of them. He would talk to the local authorities and the religious leaders as well. Finney would encourage people to pray for the ministry, for penitents to give their lives to Christ, and for those who had special needs to come up to the front to be prayed for. Hambrick-Stowe tells us that another factor that contributed to Finney's influence was his message for all peoples regardless of age, race, or sex. Even during a time of heated theological debate between the denominations, Finney brought harmony where there was discord between people. Finney's role in the time was of a person who led the way for a new means of revival that continue today. His idea's of salvation for all persons was a new idea after the puritan and Calvinistic ideas of predestination. Finney encouraged door-to-door evangelism, personal testimonies in a service, and even women's testimonies. This is a good educational book."},{"Title":"John Newton and the English Evangelical Tradition: Between the Conversions of Wesley and Wilberforce (Oxford Theological Monographs)","review":"Bruce Hindmarsh goes far beyond the common understanding of John Newton to describe a gospel servant who began as an adolescent sailing with his father in the merchant marine. Later, he lived a blasphemous and destructive life after being impressed into the British navy, punished as a deserter and sent to service on a slave ship. Even after his earliest conversion he engaged in the slave trade, ultimately as a captain, before quitting that business which he found disgusting. He found new employment, new friends in the Evangelical community, and with his young wife, Mary, at first settled in Liverpool. His independent biblical and theological studies set him on a course that tied him closely with members of the English Evangelical movement but ultimately resulted in his ordination as a clergyman in the Church of England. Hindmarsh has carefully detailed Newton's growth over many years toward maturity and service as an Anglican parish minister and a preacher often mistaken for a Methodist because of his exuberance. Of course, Newton wrote hundreds of hymns for his parishioners to sing in worship services. The most famous today is &quot;Faith's Review and Expectation,&quot; or &quot;Amazing Grace.&quot; This is a scholarly book, well worth the price if you're serious about understanding Newton's theology, his rich and admirable service as a parish priest, his personal warmth and commitment to the people he served, and his historical significance as an Anglican who was a sort of bridge between his own church and the broad Evangelical movement during his long and productive life. Hindmarsh has done a great job of humanizing Newton; after reading this fine book I admire Newton so much because of the rich, committed life he lived for many years after he found conversion and quit the slave trade."},{"Title":"Get Back","review":"It is said we all have a story to tell. Anthony Connolly's novella, &quot;Get Back&quot;, is a thinking man's (what makes you think?&quot; work of fiction that portrays his central character Michael Cross following a stream-of-consciousness path of a man caught between the present and the doctrines that framed his youthful illusions.Connolly's protagonist bridges the gap separating Michener's wandering sojourners from &quot;The Drifters&quot; to an older, and questionable, wiser generation. In context so much had changed, and so much hadn't as Michael Cross follows the taillights leading him back to the past.As Cross travels with his daughter to the heartland of his youth he is caught in a time warp that returns him to the mantra of the '60's.This charming tale is punctuated with a cornucopia of &quot;whats?&quot; that applies the wisdom of the writer to our own everyday lives.A must read for a rainy afternoon."},{"Title":"Dateworthy","review":"I loved this book and I loved that Ms. Hughes didn't just write about this from an analyst side-line point of view. She was really in those dating trenches and all the advice works from a real life perspective. The quizzes make you think. The relationtips alone are worth the price of the book. And the dating stories were must-see-TV worthy. With all the post-it notes I have stuck in it, it has literally become my constant dating reference book. Buy this book and be prepared to share it with your friends."},{"Title":"Dateworthy","review":"As a happily married woman, I chose this book not for myself but for my sister who has re-entered the dating arena...I like Dennie's style in her weekly column so I figured my sister would feel comfortable with Dateworthy. I ended up reading the book before I saw my sister and to say I was impressed is an understatement.As a professional with degrees (BA, M.Ed., Ed.S.) in various fields of human relations and education, it is refreshing to see an author that doesn't bash either sex, try to manipulate men (remember The Rules?), advocates NOT jumping into the sack in the beginning of a relationship, and (the most refreshing part of all)leads the reader to realize that while no person is meant to be a partner with all people, if there is a consistant problem with relationships in a woman's life, perhaps she should look within herself and honestly evaluate what she is about. Dennie does a beautiful and gentle job of leading the reader through a series of thought provoking questions and quizes which, when answered thoughtfully and honestly, can open a new chapter of self-realization for the reader. It is at this point the reader can determine what she is truly looking for in a date/mate and unlike some popular books, (like He's Just Not That Into You) Dennie gives over 300 pages of good, solid, safe advice for any dater on what to do while in the dating arena during the 21st century.Dating can be fun and very funny...just read some of Dennie's personal anecdotes which are liberally scattered throughout the book. But Dennie also offers a solid dose of reality with the unstated message of"},{"Title":"Dateworthy","review":"I know this book is geared toward girls more but there are even many points in this book that can be for guys as well.

I'm a freelance stylist, so I travel for work, and I seem to have an endless amount of gay guy friends (who I love) but no boyfriend. After reading Dateworthy, I realized I might be just a touch of a Diva.(Yes, I admit it!) I'm going to take Dennie's advice, take February off from serial dating, and in March take a fresh look at things... This book is perfect for girls willing to take an honest look at themselves and the men they are attracted to!"},{"Title":"Dateworthy","review":"I'm a regular reader of Dennie Hughes chats and a huge fan of her very down to earth and caring advice so I couldn't wait to read Dateworthy,especially because He's Just Not That Into You didn't help me at all when it came to getting advice about dating better. It was a fun book - but not nearly as helpfull as Dateworthy. I find Dateworthy pretty constructive with sound advice. I love the dating stories and was able to relate to afew of Dennies relationship mishaps.Dateworthy to me is a fun learning experience that has nothing to do with playing games like in The Rules and makes you think before you go for that next bad boy. My co-workers and myself are reading her dating stories during our lunch break and it helps to know that no matter how wrong you have dated before, you still can get something from it to make it right next time. The little tips all through the book are really smart and rightto the point and I'm using some of them as screen savers.I enjoyed this book and recommend it to any woman who wants to feel like she's just as in control as the guy is in the dating process so as to leave him asking the question \\"is she just not that into ME?\\"Two of my co-workers are buying it for Christmas gifts for their teenage daughters, especially because the first dating commandment, never ever have sex on a first date, isn't judgmental, but is instead is all about making a choice that is powerful and as Dennie says, selfworth-full. It's nice to have someone who has actually dated (not a person who learned about dating from textbooks) tell you like it is."},{"Title":"Dateworthy","review":"I never read dating books, but a friend recommended this book to me as a \\"smart girl's guide,\\" and I have to say, I was surprised to find myself so affected by it. If you take only one thing away from this warm, wise, and funny book, let it be this: we're each ultimately responsible for the relationships we find ourselves in, AND THEREFORE IN CONTROL OF GETTING THE KIND WE WANT. You can't control what you won't take responsibility for. What a revelation! And the author gives you some realistic tools to put this into practice. Like HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU, DATEWORTHY makes it easy to face some of the cold, hard truths about dealing with the opposite sex, but unlike it, it doesn't leave you hanging with the sobering knowledge that there's no defense against indifference."},{"Title":"Dateworthy","review":"This book is totally keeping it real.

I read a number of books, this was by far the best of them. Ms Hughes writes well and engages you in the book, while giving essential advice on how to be truly \\"Date Worthy\\". In todays dating world, you need to know what is really important to you and where you are looking for, this book will help you.

Also enjoyed the personal submitted stories throughout the book."},{"Title":"Dateworthy","review":"I agree with C's review. This author is not qualified to offer advice on dating and relationships. Most of the personal examples she uses in this book are about the men who cheated on her when she was still in the dating trenches: and she writes that there were many. However, she didn't adhere to her own \\"Dateworthy\\" advice to work through these issues. She married a man who leads a double life and cheats on her with multiple women. The author's personal choices aside, she comes across as very condescending in this book. She frequently talks about what she looks like in an insecure way (she seems to have body issues) but then very meanly describes many of the men she's dated in negative physical terms. In conclusion, one has to consider the source when considering the advice inside this book."},{"Title":"Dateworthy","review":"It's ironic this author has written this book to help women have better relationships when her own marriage is a sham and her husband has been cheating for years."},{"Title":"Dateworthy","review":"While she does have some incite into what is wrong with women. I do not think it all women who have done the wrong in relationships.... I hate the whole WOMEN fix yourself then a man will want you idea. And this feeds right into it. It seems to zap the power of the women to accept themselves alone. I would love to read one of these books written for men... that tell them that if they fix themselves then women will die for them. I would not suggest any women read this book. You are not single because there is something wrong with you but because you havent met the right man. Just that simple."},{"Title":"Dateworthy","review":"I bought this book after reading all of the positive reviews. It's unique in that instead of focusing on how to understand what really goes on in men's heads, it helps the reader focus on what she may be doing wrong in her dating experiences. (Basically, the common element in all of your relationships is YOU, so perhaps you're the problem...she has a nicer way of saying it...) Her categories of different types of women are quite insightful, and I was pleased to discover some unique ideas that provided good perspective. Instead of being a PhD and offering philosophical mumbo-jumbo, this person was writing from real-life experiences that rung true. It reminded me a bit of the book \\"If I'm So Wonderful, Why Am I Still Single?\\" It's good that it's empowering, rather than having a victim mentality. A good read."},{"Title":"Dateworthy","review":"\\"Dateworthy\\" is a MUST READ for the dateweary. Dennie Hughes takes lessons learned from her own dating experiences and incorporates years of know-how as a relationship or should I say \\"relationtip\\" columnist for the USA Weekend to offer good solid dating advice that works. However, if you are on your way out the door for your next date attempt, this is not for you. \\"Dateworthy\\" requires thought before practice. This book is ideal for women reevaluating current situations or starting from scratch. The adventurous need not read.

He sent me 8 books by S D Gordon, of which I have read Quiet Talks on the Tempter, and am finishing this book. Together they have revolutionised my prayer life. I am positive in fighting Satan in the lives of saved and unsaved people about me, and especially in my own life. For the first time I am fighting my besetting sin with confidence that Christ who has victory can have that victory in me. Yes, the sentences are longer than in modern books. But he uses plenty of sentence breakers like commas, and the end result is worth it. Christian teaching is divided (as the apostle Paul labels it) into milk and meat. This is definitely meat - rare steak, just as I love it. This book will help you to a new relationship with the Father who is seeking to recover his prodigal world.

Jesus does call us everyday into an intimate relationship with Himself. This book helps to hear His gentle call!! A must have!!"},{"Title":"Quiet Talks on Prayer","review":"S.D. Gordon's book, Quiet Talks on Prayer, presents an intimate look into the life of praying Christians. Throughout the book, Gordon presents a comprehensive picture of the power of prayer via providing picturesque examples of those prayerful leaders before us, tactics for warding off Satan's confounding attacks on our lives, and supplying us with recommendations for taking our prayer life to the next level for God's glory.As Christians, we are blessed with a variety of powerful outlets (e.g., service, our life, prayer) to validate God's power. Gordon emphasizes, however, that prayer is by far the most powerful. So powerful, in fact, that prayer extends our power farther than we thought imaginable. Whereas we are confined by space and time, our prayers can transcend these physical constraints and minister to those in far reaches of the world! As such, we are able to intercede for our brothers and sisters across the globe even if we cannot be there in person.Additionally, Gordon emphasizes the importance of prayer when it comes to engaging in spiritual battle against the enemy and his battalion of fallen angels. Satan, being the prince of this world, is engaged in a constant rebellion against God and it is his goal to drive a wedge between the Father and us. Gordon reminds readers that we give God His footing against Satan through our pure and righteous prayers (which, by the way, he simply cannot stand). Because Satan is relentless in his attempts to thwart God, we, too, must persistently pray and remind the evil one that he has already been defeated.Throughout the remainder of the book, Gordon takes a deeper dive into the various forms of prayer (i.e., communion, intercession, petition), some common pitfalls to prayer and how to overcome them, how to pray effectively, and even some prayerful examples of our Savior and other spiritual leaders. The combination of biblical based evidence and practical recommendations makes it easy for readers to understand and employ effective tactics when praying.Visit [...] or follow me via Kindle Blogs for more book reviews, devotionals, sermons, and more!"},{"Title":"Quiet Talks on Prayer","review":"His sentences were so long that I lost my train of thought before the sentence ended.

They are as new. I bought them because a family member of mine was featured in the book and I bought the books for other family members. From what I know of her heroism as told to me my mother, her aunt, the book's account of the events is accurate - although not in great detail because she was a humble lady and did not speak of her actions or the extent of her own injuries or when she did, she minimized it. However her receiving the Air Force's Distinguished Flying Cross for valor is proof of that heroism.

The last chapter touches on wider issues including the vexed questions of valuation of knowledge and of ownership of knowledge, but does not go into these in any great depth. The rest of the book is concerned with the practicalities of identifying and exploiting the commercial potential in various forms of knowledge held in 'knowledge objects' or by persons.The aim of the book is to help practitioners 'to build a thriving knowledge business'. Broadly, it works within well-established conceptual principles. Its value lies in the thoroughness of its identification of the various forms of commercial offering, where they can be applied, their strengths and weaknesses and what a seller of knowledge needs to do to be successful.At first, the book looks indigestible. I nearly put it aside before recognizing the value contained in its rather dense structure. If you contemplate using the Internet to sell knowledge products, it is well worth persisting. The table of contents and index are good enough for the book to be used as a ready reference."},{"Title":"Reason and Revolution: Hegel and the Rise of Social Theory","review":"I agree with the previous review. However, when you pick Marcuse, you should know you are selecting no &#34;right wing&#34; theorist. His lore is historically significant and should be considered as an expose of a particular stream of thought, which had originated with the Enlightenment philosophy and has not ceased wielding influence over us today."},{"Title":"Reason and Revolution: Hegel and the Rise of Social Theory","review":"Marcuse's goal in Reason and Revolution is to demonstrate that Hegel was not as right wing as people believe him to be, and that there is no excuse for using him to vindicate Nazi practice. The later is true, but the former is not. Marcuse is certainly a deeper Hegel scholar than I am, or ever will be, but page after page it's clear he's reading his own Marxism into Hegel, and not the other way around. In passages that most people would find to be reactionary, and repressive, Marcuse ask that we ignore what he's actually saying, and dwell on Hegel's method as a revolutionary method. While the method may be revolutionary, why are Hegel's results always so authoritarian?His Chapter on Marx is interesting, but hardly worth picking the book up over, and he spends too little time defending Hegel from Kierkegaard (8 pages). In short, he concludes Kierkegaard must be wrong because Kierkegaard wants to find man's solace in religion, and despises socialism. It's not a very philosophical argument, but more of a presumptuous one, where Marcuse just presumes the reader is a socialist and/or not a christian, and therefore won't see any wisdom in Kierkegaard.Overall a mixed bag of a book, I'm not sure I'd recommend it to anyone though."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Rainbow","review":"Children native to Chesapeake Bay as well as everywhere else will be be fascinated by the whimsical discriptions and beautiful artwork that make the colors of Chesapeake come alive.

Indeed it is somewhat shocking to realize how little psychology has advanced since this time (1908 and 1915) and the time of William James. Trotter's basic argument is that being a social species marks us collectively and especially individually with strong psychological characteristics. We respond instinctively and readily to group suggestions and are thus easily trained to suppress the most basic instincts (survival, sex) in the service of the group. Parallels can easily be drawn to other social species, including wolves, dogs, and bees, who are enthusiastic servants of their group as well as recipients of group communication and training, even while other species such as cats, are much less social and lack many of these instincts.Indeed what we regard as morals are the implanted instinctive or trained promptings of group service, which necessarily conflict with selfish instincts, and thus set up the mental conflicts that are the bread and butter of psychotherapy. \\"Normal\\" people are fully adapted to this regime, submerging their selves into the larger group and thus are ready to go off to war and other group activities. Trotter is rather biting in his analysis of war (WWI was to come as he presciently wrote in 1908, and was underway as he wrote in 1915). He also identifies religion as the natural consequence of this social instinct, which progressively hypostasizes the imaginary emblem and enforcer of the social order, until it is both all-powerful and psychologically internalized.Trotter's take on the then-new Freudian corpus is especially interesting, taking him seriously, but also identifying Freud's remarkable excesses of assigning all causes to sex and all scientific objectivity to himself. Trotter explains that while Freud's school is exceedingly interested in the causes of individual resistance to communal indoctrination, it is remarkably uninterested both in the sources of this indoctrination and in our natural suggestibility to it. Thus this book and this thread of thought is an important complement to whatever is left of psychoanalysis. It is somewhat depressing to realize that perhaps the principal current inheritor of Trotter's tradition and insights is the advertising industry.Lastly, Trotter indulges in long mid-war and post-war analyses of German instincts and character, contrasting the militaristic wolf-like follower/leader system of the German nation with the more advanced bee-like, collegial, bottom-up integration of countries like Britain, which is virtually allergic to strong leaders and external aggression. This section would be comically jingoistic were it not that his analysis became realized to an unimaginable degree in the \\"F&uuml;hrer prinzip\\" fifteen years later. Sadly, his prescription for post-war treatment of Germany is to \\"give it a good whipping\\", which may have done more to reinforce the psychology he writes about than any other treatment."},{"Title":"Instincts of the herd in peace and war","review":"Wilfred Trotter was a surgeon (born in the same year as Bertrand Russell) who, coming up to 40, wrote about the 'herd instinct'. A few years later, these essays were incorporated into this book, published in 1916, before the USA came into the war. The title of course reflects the war. There was a second edition in 1919.His essays may have been suggested by Gustave le Bon; but le Bon was enormously influenced by the French Revolution as it appears in conventional history, and usually regarded crowds as irrational and easily swayed, So this book is not just a nationalistic version in the way Sargant (British) ripped off an American author on 'brainwashing' and Korea. Trotter mentions Freud, then rather new, possibly because Freud was medically qualified too, distinguishing him (and other psychoanalysts) from ordinary medically-untrained psychologists. Trotter's writing style is agonisingly plodding, I'd guess as a gentlemanly badge - I'm sure he could easily have written in a more sprightly manner. He reminds me a bit of Dalrymple, writing today, an expert wanting to step into a more general field.Trotter thinks 'herds' should be expected to have 'instincts' for evolutionary reasons. 'Herd' is perhaps an attempt to translate the Latin grex, from which 'gregarious' was coined - it's not meant in a pejorative sense. Trotter thinks one-celled creatures were limited evolutionarily; evolution into multicellular creatures allows evolution fresh scope. (He doesn't attempt to explain how organs developed, though). Trotter then extends this into herds, which have further scope - though it's not exactly evolution, since a herd doesn't reproduce itself. Some of his evidence comes from animals - not the vast range as deployed by Dawkins, but more domestic dogs, cats, bees, sheep, horses - and also, especially, wolves. (E.g. solitary herbivores could not exist, if they spent most of their time watching for predators). Some evidence is from human beings - mostly English and Germans. He does NOT discuss bringing up children, which surely is a good reason to develop groups - maybe he thought it's unmanly? Much of this is derived from Karl Pearson (who for decades has provoked shrieks of 'eugenics'). Trotter is unobservantly nationalistic: 'The nation, if the term be used to describe every organization under a completely independent, supreme government, must be regarded as the smallest unit on which natural selection now unrestrictedly acts'.Interesting idea, but hard to develop. As regards people, Trotter regards self-preservation, nutrition, and sex as 'obvious instincts' but then adds gregariousness. There's obviously a problem with ingrained, but wrong, beliefs, so he includes 'suggestibility' as a factor. And he distinguishes 'stable minded' or 'socialized' people, typically military or religious types, who believe and do what they've been told, from the 'feeling' type who because of what they've experienced may not to.Trotter, following Freud, regards the unconscious as a squalid, animal-like thing, which seems a bit unfair; if someone e.g. works hard through cold weather, and then makes him/herself comfortable in an animal way by warming up before a fire and eating - why should that be 'primitive'?Trotter also doesn't seem to realise (this is from Leibnitz) that an unconscious is necessary, just as memory is, or you'd spend all your time just thinking the same thoughts over again.He's also irrationally fierce on 'irrationality': 'He will have strong views upon military and naval strategy, the principles of taxation, the use of alcohol and vaccination, the treatment of influenza, the prevention of hydrophobia, upon municipal trading, the teaching of Greek, upon what is permissible in print, satisfactory in literature, and hopeful in science. The bulk of such opinions must necessarily be without rational basis, since many of them are concerned with problems admitted by the expert to be still unsolved, while as to the rest it is clear that the training and experience of no average man can qualify him to have any opinion upon them at all. The rational method adequately used would have told him that on the great majority of these questions there could be for him but one attitude - that of suspended judgment.'He has a solution to irrationality: 'The solution would seem rather to lie in seeing to it that suggestion always acts on the side of reason; if rationality were once to become really respectable, if we feared the entertaining of an unverifiable opinion with the warmth with which we fear using the wrong implement at the dinner table, if the thought of holding a prejudice disgusted us as does a foul disease, then the dangers of man's suggestibility would be turned into advantages.'---ENGLISH VS GERMANS. Much of this book is on the difference between Germans and English (not British - the word barely appears). No doubt the readers liked it... England tends to be taken off guard by foreigners. Trotter regards wolves as highly organised, and thinks they take mad vicious risks when they're in pack mode - he doesn't see them as animals needing to eat. So the Germans are 'lupine' - and the fall of the Roman Empire, as taught in England, illustrates this. He says Germans (or Prussians) are nasty and punishing to their underlings; he doesn't seem to factor in such facts as English trenches being far worse than Germans - trench foot was commonplace; deserters were shot, and so on. He doesn't consider the geography of Germany as a relatively exposed vaguely-defined land area. He mentions Germany as having brilliantly won a series of small wars, without mentioning that Britain had done more of the same. He doesn't even mention, in the second edition (1919), that Britain didn't win on its own.So all this is conventional and disappointing. And by Trotter's own criteria, Trotter had no right to any of these views!---There are a couple of famous bits -MEETING SOMEONE NEW: 'When, therefore, we find ourselves entertaining an opinion about the basis of which there is a quality of feeling which tells us that to inquire into it would be absurd, obviously unnecessary, unprofitable, undesirable, bad form, or wicked, we may know that that opinion is a non-rational one, and probably, therefore, founded upon inadequate evidence'THE DOG SNIFF TEST, quoted somewhere in Aldous Huxley: 'When one hears or takes part in these elaborate evolutions, gingerly proffering one after another of one's marks of identity, one's views on the weather, on fresh air and draughts, on the Government and on uric acid, watching intently for the first low hint of a growl, which will show one belongs to the wrong pack and must withdraw, it is impossible not to be reminded of the similar manoeuvres of the dog, and to be thankful that Nature has provided us with a less direct, though perhaps a more tedious, code.'----I'd intended to quote some more examples of Trotter's writing style, but on second thoughts they're simply too long. But take it from me - it's an endurance test. Scriptwriters who wanting a boring post-Edwardian interminable sermon-like speech, while the hero and heroine plan something exciting, might copy chunks of it.This is a smug non-urgent book, by an author with no idea of the destructiveness and harm likely to result from war. It's quite sickening in that sense, in fact. However it is not aggressively nationalistic or warlike. I doubt if it sold more than a few tens of thousands."},{"Title":"A Red Heart of Memories","review":"If you've already read this and are looking for similar books, I fear you'll be disappointed. Hoffman's novels are quite unique. That said, read the rest of her books, especially Past the Size of Dreaming and Stir of Bones. These are also about Matt and Edmund. Brother to Dragons, Companion to Owls by Jane Lindskold, many stories & novels by Charles de Lint, say The Ivory and the Horn or Trader, the anthology The Armless Maiden ed. by Terri Windling who also wrote The Woodwife, a novel. Like Hoffman, these are urban fantasies. Where magic and faerie exists alongside McDonald's and malls and homeless people.Matt (who is a woman, but since she's homeless she dresses and presents as a man) and Edmund have magic that most people can't see. Edmund calls his Spirit. Is that the Holy Spirit? Maybe. They don't say. Do other people think they're mentally ill? Matt's spent some time in hospitals. They're warm and serve meals, but since she can ask trash cans and dumpsters to give her their freshest food, finding food isn't a problem for her. Edmund's car takes care of him, in a very real way.The magic in this book isn't like Gandalf's or even Harry Dresden's, it isn't *big.* But it is transformative of several lives. Maybe yours too?"},{"Title":"A Red Heart of Memories","review":"Nina Kiriki Hoffman's surrealistic A Red Heart Of Memories (tells of Matt, who can speak with inanimate objects and witness the dreams of others. Her association with the equally enigmatic wandering witch Edmund and his various personality changes leads her to even stranger new worlds in this story of two lost personalities and their odyssey."},{"Title":"A Red Heart of Memories","review":"This was a pleasantly strange book. I liked the idea that Matt can talk to inanimate objects and I liked Edmunds sense of magic and mystery, however - there were a few things that bothered me. For one thing, calling Edmund a witch seems a bit out of whack. I don't think that's an accurate description of what a witch is. The only other problem was how quickly things moved! I barely had the chance to meet Edmund and they were off like old chums from school. Then everyone has thier life turned upside down only minutes after meeting Matt. It was too fast, but the story was intruiging enough to keep me going and make me want to read other books.I think you'll like this book if you can read &quot;through&quot; things like this. You have to be able to ignore certain things and read around others. All in all I liked the characters and the storyline, I intend to get another book by this author soon."},{"Title":"A Red Heart of Memories","review":"As a very well satisfied reader of Hoffman's two earlier books, I was overjoyed to find this one. Unfortunately she goes too far in the fantasy department for me. I can suspend belief so far as to accept ghosts,magic and presences but when never-antimate things communicate with the living it's too much. If you have not read the other Hoffman books treat yourself to them first."},{"Title":"A Red Heart of Memories","review":"I have never read any of Hoffman's books and only bought this one because it was a \\"highly recommended\\" read at my local bookstore. This book is awful to say the least and I don't understand how it can get such high praise. The first thing that bothers me about it is Hoffman seems to be romanticizing being a homeless and aimless drifter. The main characters Matt and Edmund are exactly that. Matt \\"asks\\" houses and other places if she can stay in them, there is a word for that it is called squatting or trespassing and it is illegal. She gets her food out of dumpsters. Matt apparently got her powers after too much drinking and drugs, interesting message there, be a homeless drug addict/alcoholic and get the power to talk to inanimate objects. Hoffman refers to the garbage bag Matt has her property in as her luggage. Give me a break. The story itself doesn't flow well and goes off in weird directions. Matt and Edmund visit his sister and find this wild magic lying around and his sister and her family just accept it and are all OK with it. They finally meet up with Susan, totally blow apart her carefully constructed world and she blows off her job and her carefully put together life without a second thought and goes off with someone she doesn't know (Matt) and someone she hasn't seen in over 10 years (Edmund). That makes absolutely no sense.I will not be reading anything else by Hoffman."},{"Title":"A Red Heart of Memories","review":"To all you geniuses who hate this book for either a. the fact that it champions the life of hobos, or b. the fact that you don't understand real psychological problems, maybe you should go back to the safer land of epic fantasy novels that don't require you to actually have feelings.If you have ever experienced any of the following: abuse, incest, rape, depression, dissociation, and/or an identity disorder, you should read this book. Not only it is a fantasy book that reads like my talks with my therapist, but it cleverly comes up with magical solutions for all our psychological issues. I am partially glad that it exists because it lets me know someone else has figured out that we don't need anti-depressants, we need magic, but it also frustrates me that I don't have any Gold to make me not depressed anymore. That stuff would really come in handy."},{"Title":"A Red Heart of Memories","review":"I love everything by Nina Hoffman, and this book is probably my favorite; she has such an amazing command of fantasy. \\"A Red Heart of Memories\\" combines unique and fascinating fantasy elements with reality and the issues people face.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves unique fantasy - something different than what is typically out there in the fantasy world."},{"Title":"A Red Heart of Memories","review":"I just bought this book on a whim. What a great little book. I read a lot of fantasy mostly Mercedes Lackey and I really enjoyed this novel. She has wonderful prose! I have decided to try another of her novels!

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Red Heart of Memories","review":"I've not read many adult fantasy novels, but if this any indication of what I've been missing I'll read more. Not a lot more, but some. Once I was able to get used to the fact that the bizarre is usual and no one the characters encounter is bothered by this, I quit being bothered and began to truly enjoy the novel. The magic is fun -- wish I had some &quot;gold&quot; -- I think!"},{"Title":"A Red Heart of Memories","review":"Although the setting of this well-written novel is the modern world, it is a modern world with a rich, pagan spirituality. But the heart of the story is the redemption that occurs when painful memories are faced. Resolutions are but too tidy, perhaps. While the worldview undergirding the story is pagan, the ethics are, in the main, traditional. Loyalty, home, forgiveness, understanding, tolerance: all all valued; child molestation, murder, and magical curses are understood to be wrong. There is no sex, although one of the protagonists thinks about sex (though not graphically). Magic helps the protagonists find redemption, but since in reality there is no magic (at least as described in the book), the reader may wonder whether humanity can really find redemption without divine aid."},{"Title":"A Red Heart of Memories","review":"why isnt this available for the kindle??? the second book is. Why are only some of these author's books available. when the hardware version is expensive and difficult to obtain.... I enjoy all of the books by this author and want to have the flexibility to have them on my kindle."},{"Title":"A Red Heart of Memories","review":"While billed as a young adult novel for grades eight and up, the story follows real adults finding their identity in the world and working to accept their past. The writing is well paced and high quality. Great focus. The magic is weird and self-consistent, and characters recognize their own dependencies and work through their psychological pasts in order to become better people. It's emotional, uplifting, and redemptive.The female lead Matt can speak with all inanimate objects, and ask them to do things for her. The male lead follows the Spirit at the heart of possibility and acts as a troubleshooter for needful things. The book follows them as they travel together and heal themselves. I'll say it again -- terrific and compelling prose.The major stuff is well-resolved, but the last thing the main characters say to each other in the book is 'What happened with XXX and with YYY?'. (Spoiler free, here!) Cliffhanger (resolved in book three). Since it is resolved eventually, I can safely give this a full five stars.Edit:A Stir of Bonesis book one -- read it first. (The book reviewed here is #2).Past the Size of Dreamingis the direct sequel (#3), and covers for the incomplete ending."},{"Title":"A Red Heart of Memories","review":"When Matilda \\"Matt\\" Black meets Edmund Reynolds after he emerges from a wall that she was able to talk to, the reader knows thatA Red Heart of Memoriesis a book filled with magic. An almost matter-of-fact magic and that is Nina Kiriki Hoffman's strength as her writing is full of matter-of-fact prose that is actually gorgeous.This is my second time reading this novel. Originally released in 1999, I had a yen to re-read it after picking up Hoffman'sA Stir of Bonesat the library. \\"Bones\\" was written after \\"Red Heart\\" but it is the story of Susan/Suki who is intro'd in \\"Red Heart\\".But \\"Red Heart\\" is about Matt and Edmund and their strange little road trip to help Edmund figure out what he has forgotten and why Suki needs to be found as well.Matt has the ability to speak to and understand inanimate objects such as a wall or a coat rack, even a counter at a doughnut shop. Edmund is a witch of sorts. A young man who was given the ability to do magic. Both are nomads of sorts for similar yet different reasons.As Matt follows Edmund to his old hometown where they meet Nathan and House (the house that Nathan haunts) and then to his sister's home and then finally to find Suki, she learns as much about Edmund as she accepts about herself.Hoffmann has a way of making magic seem realistic and mundane. That's her strength because she uses the 'magic' as an outlet for her cast to deal with the bad things that have happened in their lives. If there is a weakness in Hoffmann's work is that the 'bad things' are dealt with in a passive voice of sorts. The 'bad thing' has happened and been pushed away and even when it bubbles up, Hoffmann layers it in a few too many metaphors when a good dose of bluntness would help.But that weakness aside, the reader gets the gist of what pushes these characters to lead the odd life they choose to lead. In that sense, that detachment helps because in many ways, her characters are detached from life as they move in a world of magical realism.For me, that's the enticement of her novels. Hoffmann gets me to a place where I understand Matt and Edmund and I accept them as they are instead of wanting them to be something else. Within their world, they make a certain kind of sense.I don't think the book is for everyone. The pace is meandering and interactions can sometimes seem too precious and the metaphors a little too heavy handed for a reader who might like things more straightforward. But if a reader likes to meander, doesn't mind a little bit of preciousness, and doesn't mind metaphors, then this is a novel that is worth a read or two."},{"Title":"A Red Heart of Memories","review":"A very good book to help figure out one's own psychology. Paying attention to one's own responses to this book while reading it can help untangle one's own \\"messes\\" both of head and heart. Hoffman's work makes me think of what \\"Women Who Run with the Wolves\\" would be like if it were a novel."},{"Title":"A Red Heart of Memories","review":"Nina Kiriki Hoffman is a terrific writer and I am glad that I purchased this book."},{"Title":"A Red Heart of Memories","review":"Matt Black, a homeless woman, is sitting on a park bench eating discarded sandwiches when a man steps out of a nearby ivy-covered wall. &quot;The leaves wove together into green skin, the skin smoothed and formed a man, and then a man all green stepped away from the wall, shaking his head slowly.&quot;The man is Edmund. Edmund wanders the world, going where the spirit moves him, and the spirit has told him to follow Matt. Thus begins a most extraordinary fantasy adventure set in the contemporary U.S., slightly to the left of reality.I'm not going to say much else about the plot of A RED HEART OF MEMORIES because I don't want to spoil it or prejudice readers. Not being a big fan of fantasy or some of the book's themes (or California for that matter), I would likely have avoided it based on a plot synopsis. However, Hoffman's terrific writing made it a novel that I'm glad to have read.The characters in A RED HEART OF MEMORIES are well drawn and compelling, but what impressed me most was the amazing sense of wonder Nina Kikiri Hoffman brought to her magic scenes, and her whimsical humour. Hoffman uses magic to transform the ordinary into the extraordinary. For example:&quot;The rocks were singing.Matt kneeled and placed her hand on them. Gold bared her palm --Hello?-- she thought.''Greetings, man-thing. Thing like those that chopped us and split us and carried us and buried us, looking for seams and nuggets and ore. Greetings, thing that stripped us from our parent and brought us to a new place. Greetings, thing that left us shattered here an age ago.----Uh, greetings,-- Matt thought. None of these events sounded very positive, but the rocks didn't seem too angry about them. On the other hand, all the rocks had sharp edges.&quot;My only serious criticism of A RED HEART OF MEMORIES is that the end of the book lacks impact, particularly given the emotional intensity of earlier chapters. Part of the weakness is structural. The book's viewpoint character, Matt, is pulled into a quest to solve Edmund's problem, and this in turn draws them into solving someone else's problem. These two steps distance us from Matt's needs and emotions, thus making the ultimate payoff inevitably less intense. Moreover, the climax of this magical quest begs for pyrotechnics and, unfortunately, Hoffman opts for a low key resolution. It is more realistic in human terms, certainly, but it lacks dramatic closure.The disappointing end of A RED HEART OF MEMORIES reminded me a great deal of THE HEALER'S WAR, a fantasy novel by Elizabeth Anne Scarborough, based on her experiences as a nurse in Viet Nam. Because Scarborough hadn't resolved her feelings about Viet Nam, she wasn't able to resolve her protagonist's problems either, consequently this otherwise excellent book drizzled to an uncertain stop.Hoffman has done a better job, nonetheless she tackled an ambitious, thorny theme and it's little wonder she had difficulties. I still recommend this book strongly, and will be watching for more of Hoffman's work...."},{"Title":"A Red Heart of Memories","review":"I'm not usually a reader of fantasy books, but I couldn't resist picking this up. And I'm not sorry I did. Once I plunged in, I couldn't stop. I identified with Matt and Edmund, and almost drank the story line. It was mercilessly easy to follow, and as I finished the story, I found myself wanting to read more of their adventures. This book completely flew by, and I was sorry to see it end."},{"Title":"A Red Heart of Memories","review":"Matt (Matilda) Black has been drifting from town to town, away from home, polite society, and her past, when she meets Edmund, a wandering witch who has a bit of an identity problem. Matt uses her magical gift of speaking with inanimate objects to make friends with a ghost of a haunted house (the ghost happens to be an old friend of Edmund's), who starts Edmund and Matt on the journey to recover Edmund's lost memories. An imaginative, engaging, and well-written urban fantasy that made me seek out Hoffman's other books."},{"Title":"A Red Heart of Memories","review":"In Hoffman's world, the nature of good and evil is not always clear. Magic is real, but evil is human--and it exists in both hero and villain. The novel deals with redemption, but more--it explores trust in a world of flawed people. How can you trust others when you have been hurt? And when you have hurt others, how can you trust yourself?The novel is more narration than action--the plot expands primarily through the stories that characters tell to Matt. Given the nature of the novel, this technique works well to emphasize that events do not have meaning only in themselves, but in our interpretation of them.While the themes are mature, the book is appropriate for teens."},{"Title":"A Red Heart of Memories","review":"What a wonderful book! Nina Kiriki Hoffman has a flavor that I'd never tasted before. She took the story of a woman who communes with houses and man-made things, 'talks' to them, and therefore creates her own community and language in a world bereft (safely, for Matt) of people, and mixes her with a man so natural and earth like that HE can mix with anything of the earth, or organic and stay with it until it's 'fixed'. So you get the idea. Matt (woman) runs into the fix it man (his name eludes me right now) and becomes the next thing that he has to fix/ heal. This story was the first I'd seen where a man is compelled to help a woman in just such a way as Hoffman invents. I found my heart about ready to split at times, with the shear relief and cartharsis that this book/story provides. If you've ever been through something that really shook you, and you've wanted (even if just secretly) someone to somehow see the emptiness/the hole/the pain and somehow do JUST what you needed without you ever having to explain... someone that was so safe that they COULD be there. Well, that's what this book provides. Just so not to leave it out, Matt provides some healing too (predictably) and somehow things turn out differently than the young man has ever experienced before. Really interesting book. If you read it, I hope you like it as much as I have."},{"Title":"A Red Heart of Memories","review":"I really enjoyed this fantasy! It would have left me hanging if I hadn't known about the next book in this series; Past the Size of Dreaming. I enjoyed both and wish that Nina Hoffman would continue on with other books of Matt and Edmund plus the rest of the &quot;house's&quot; children!"},{"Title":"A Red Heart of Memories","review":"Normally a mystery fan, I don't know what prompted me to purchase this book, but I'm glad I did. It was one of my first tries at fantasy, and it was totally enjoyable. The main character, Matt, is able to communicate with inanimate objects. She meets a guy named Edmund who happens to be a witch. They travel together to Edmnund's hometown and then leave there to find one of Edmund's childhood friends in order to put to rest something that happened when they were teenagers. I liked the storyline and the characters, and Matt's ability to communicate with inanimate objects was enjoyable. I will definitely try another of her books."},{"Title":"A Red Heart of Memories","review":"Hoffman is one to watch. For those of you who loved Zelazny, Sturgeon, and Bradbury, keep your eye on this lady. She's the next generation. She has a very sweet style, and blends fantastic imagery with a kind of magic that helps, hinders, and drives charcters to discover themselves."},{"Title":"A Red Heart of Memories","review":"I normally don't read books like this but it just sucked me in.

Nina Hoffman has delivered a work of art with something for every kind of reader and I only hope that we can see more books with Matt."},{"Title":"A Red Heart of Memories","review":"As usual, Nina Kiriki Hoffman has written a story that flows easily about characters one can't help caring about and with a dash of hair-standing-on-end witchcraft.

It may be readily purchased from the UK site of your favorite Web bookseller.WHAT'S IN A NAME alphabetically lists roughly 270 stations - I counted twice, with a different result each time - of the Underground, and another 34 of the Docklands Light Rail system. The name's origin, the year the station opened, and the name changes that have since occurred are described for each. A typical entry:\\"DEBDEN takes its name from a natural location of the area and is recorded as Deppendana in the Domesday Book. It is derived from the Old English DEP, 'deep' and DEN, 'valley' - which means simply 'the deep valley'. It was recorded as Depeden in 1227. The station was opened by the Great Eastern Railway as Chigwell Road on 24 April 1865, and re-named Chigwell Lane on 1 December 1865. It was again renamed as Debden on 25 September 1949 when first used by Underground trains.\\"The book is liberally sprinkled with black and white photos of the stations or their immediate environs. Most date from the early 20th century, and none are later than, say, 1955.Surprisingly, the book includes no overall schematic of the Underground system - not even on the back of the back cover, where it usually makes an appearance.WHAT'S IN A NAME is for Tube obsessives, or for those whose hobby is the derivation of English place names. Anyone else may find it as interesting reading as a dictionary. Despite my love for London and its Underground, I'm ambivalent."},{"Title":"Robert Creeley: A Biography","review":"As a longtime reader of Robert Creeley's work, I was lookingforward to this biography. I should have figured that Creeleywould not authorize a &quot;traditional&quot; biographer, and Ekbert Faas'sjuxtaposition of different perspectives and inclusion of a hugechunk of (Creeley's first wife) Ann MacKinnon's autobiography/diary as a 100 page coda make the book somewhat non-traditional(although the &quot;life-writing&quot; technique, where the &quot;voice&quot; ofCreeley is present in the narrative, should be familiar toany reader of Nick Tosches' fine biography of Dean Martin).Creeley's pre-1970 poems would sometimes take a seemingly autobiographical moment and view it in intense detail, or takea slice of the persona's stream-of-consciousness and break itdown into extreme close-up (not just to the level of the word,but to the level of the syllable). This biography now providesthe &quot;background&quot; for those works. Many intimate details are given, but fortunately we are spared TOO MUCH intimate detailand Mr. Creeley is able to keep some things private!The book also does a fine job of showing Creeley's complexrelationships with literary figures and the literary communityover the years--RC has always devoted a lot of time to championing thework of his fellow writers (and thus turned me onto many writers who have become important components in my life--thank you, Mr. Creeley!).My only complaint about this book is that right near the end (before the MacKinnon narrative), biographer Faas pretty muchtrashes the 80s/90s career of Creeley. It's as if Creeley'swork (and, as written by Faas, his life too!) has become blandand commercial because RC is no longer as combative and angryand frayed-at-the-edges. This reminds me of the people whoaccuse punk-rockers of &quot;selling out&quot; when they stop cutting themselves with razorblades and smashing their heads againstconcrete walls when they get past age 40. What's wrong withMr. Creeley enjoying life more, settling down, finding theeternal verities in the commonplace, and being a happy person?I admire the man's ability to evolve, and his work still useslanguage in fresh and unexpected ways while leading me to seelife and relationships in similarly fresh and unexpected ways.Faas's inability to see the &quot;whole picture&quot; of Creeley's lifeleads me to question how much he really understood Creeley atANY period in his life.Still, this is a necessary work for any Creeley reader or anyonewho cares about post-WWII American poetry.I also commend Creeley for allowing his biographer such freedom (I'm reminded of Bob Dylan's film DON'T LOOK BACKin that way), although I came away from the book with even morerespect for the man. Poetry is an important part of many people'slives thanks to Robert Creeley (both through his own pioneeringwork and his tireless championing of and providing an entryway into others' works), and this book does give the reader a senseof the man behind the work."},{"Title":"The angry planet: An authentic first-hand account of a journey to Mars in the space-ship Albatross, compiled from notes and records by various members ... ; the illustrations are by Robin Jacques","review":"I must disagree completly with the other reviewer!Did he read this book as a child or an adult?I am 57 and read and loved this book when I read it at 10 years of age.I still have very fond memories of this book , which is why I looked it up on Amazon."},{"Title":"The angry planet: An authentic first-hand account of a journey to Mars in the space-ship Albatross, compiled from notes and records by various members ... ; the illustrations are by Robin Jacques","review":"Certainly one of the strangest science-fiction juveniles I have ever read.

The three stowaway kids along for the adventure are depicted with completely ambiguous sexuality. There is essentially no plot, and very little action, until a final \\"battle\\" between the baseball bats and the bad guys. The pseudonymous author, \\"Cross,\\" was best known, I think, for short stories with a supernatural theme.

The physics in this is still fresh and germane to a newcomer to nuclear physics. A previous background in elementary quantum mechanics is needed. This text then applies that knowledge to the special conditions in a nucleus.The measurement of fission products and alpha, beta and gamma emissions is explained. Vital for experimentalists, so that you can deduce what the nuclear reaction was.The fact that this is not primarily an experimentalist book helds keep it useful. The latter type would need to be updated with the latest instrumentation capabilities and results. Whereas the ideas and derivations here still hold."},{"Title":"Theoretical Nuclear Physics","review":"Blatt and Weisskopf is a good, thick compendium of nuclear theory developed from a quantum mechanical point of view. It's become something of a classic it its time, and I think this is well deserved, since it is written with a good flow and clarity and also covers everything a nonspecialist in nuclear physics would ever need to know (and provides a good basis for those who are specialists). The Dover edition is nice and also inexpensive. I would highly recommend it as a reference for all physics and chemistry people."},{"Title":"History Begins at Sumer: Thirty-Nine Firsts in Recorded History","review":"Although I've been known to grumble at Kramer's dullness, the present book, far from being dull, ought to be of real interest to many. Professor Samuel Noah Kramer was the world's leading Sumerologist, but in this book he seems to have risen above the dry academic persona we find in some of his other books and allowed his love and enthusiasm for things Sumerian to show.Basically the book sets out to explain and describe, using extensive quotations from Sumerian Literature, what Kramer took to be thirty-nine civilizational firsts of the Sumerians. Many new archaeological discoveries have been made since the 3rd revised edition of 'History Begins at Sumer' was published in 1981, and current thinking seems to be leaning towards the view that, far from beginning in Sumer, civilization first arose further East in India.But whether it first began in Sumer or in India, since the Indus script hasn't yet been deciphered, and the Indians didn't write on imperishable clay tablets anyway, we have as yet no thirty-nine Vedic Indian firsts, and perhaps should give Kramer the benefit of the doubt and enjoy his splendid book.After a brief Introduction, the thirty-nine firsts follow. Mutterings have been heard about the 'pop' overtones of the term 'firsts,' but it seems to me an interesting way of treating Sumer's history, and the book, in my opinion, is far more successful at capturing and holding one's attention than Kramer's later and more conventional study, 'The Sumerians.'Most of the chapters are centered on a Sumerian text, some quite brief and others fairly long, which Kramer envelopes with his full and interesting commentary. Often we are given a line drawing of the actual cuneiform tablet from which the text was taken, and these have a special fascination all of their own. Besides the 28 line drawings, the book is further enriched with 34 halftones - sculptures, cuneiform tablets, stelae, artefacts, archaeological sites - which greatly add to the interest of the book.Among the firsts covered are such things as: The First Schools, The First Case of Juvenile Delinquency, The First \\"War of Nerves,\\" The First Bicameral Congress, First Historian, The First Case of Tax Reduction, The First Legal Precedent, The First Pharmacopoeia, The First Moral Ideals, The First Animal Fables, The First Literary Debates, The First Love Song, The First Library Catalogue, The First \\"Sick\\" Society, The First Long-Distance Champion, The First Sex Symbolism, Labor's First Victory, and so on.Many of these and other chapters are memorable, and once having read them you'll never forget them. You'll never forget them because, in fact, they are about yourself. What I mean is that one of the more important things we learn from Kramer's fascinating book is that, whether we realize it or not, we are all, in a sense, Sumerians.The patterns that were perhaps first laid down in Sumer - urbanization, monumental architecture, kingship, writing system, distinct social classes, laws, lawyers, lawcourts, taxes, formal education, libraries, a regular army, organized warfare, labor disputes, etc. - are still very much with us today. We usually refer to the whole package as 'Civilization,' without realizing how indebted to the Sumerians we all are. But Sumer, sadly, after a relatively brief efflorescence, crashed in ruins. Here are a few lines from Kramer's 'Sumerian History, Culture and Literature' describing that crash:\\"In the course of centuries Sumer became a \\"sick society\\" ... it yearned for peace and was constantly at war; it professed such ideals as justice, equity and compassion, but abounded in injustice, inequality and oppression; materialistic and shortsighted, it unbalanced the ecology essential to its economy.... And so Sumer came to a cruel, tragic end\\" (in Diane Wolkstein and S. N. Kramer, 'Inanna - Queen of Heaven and Earth,' page 126).Why, after achieving such brilliance, did Sumer crash in ruins? And Egypt? And Athens? And Rome? And why does this pattern seem to be repeating itself today in the West? Is civilization inherently unworkable? Or is there another answer? Personally, I think there is another answer. But you won't find it in the works of Professor Samuel Noah Kramer."},{"Title":"History Begins at Sumer: Thirty-Nine Firsts in Recorded History","review":"When this book was first published in 1956, it undoubtedly was one of the best books on the subject. Unfortunately, even though this is called the Third Revised Edition, it is not clear in what way this book has been updated. It contains the preface to the first edition, but no new preface or introduction is added for the third edition.It does include a \\"Corrigenda and Addenda to the Second Edition\\" after the main body of texts, but the question is: Why weren't these addenda included in the text instead of put outside of the main text, and where are the addenda for the third edition? To make matters worse, the second edition addenda information uses page numbers that do not align with the third edition publication.There is still a lot of valuable information in this book, but it is important for the buyer to be aware of what they are actually getting when they purchase it."},{"Title":"History Begins at Sumer: Thirty-Nine Firsts in Recorded History","review":"This book is essentially a summary of various cultural achievements of the Sumerians, listed as \\"39 firsts\\" in human history. It is not a chronological history of Sumer, so this book is more of a supplement to one's studies in ancient near east. The book covers little known aspects of Sumerian culture, like education (\\"1st Apple polishing\\"), sex (\\"1st Sexual Symbolism\\") and possibly even pets (\\"1st Animal Fables\\", \\"1st Aquarium\\"), as well as the facets that are well known--Gilgamesh, Utnaptishtim, Sargon, ect. The key theme that arises from this book is how civilized the ancients were--these were not clueless barbarians roaming the Mesopotamian plains, they were not idiots, but thoughtful people who tried to make sense out of their (oftentimes chaotic) lot in life. A good companion to the library of any ancient-history-ophile."},{"Title":"History Begins at Sumer: Thirty-Nine Firsts in Recorded History","review":"This book is a collection of essays written by Samuel Noah Kramer regarding various cultural \\"firsts\\" in Western history as discovered on Sumerian cuneiform tablets. Kramer's experience and prolific career as a Sumerologist lend credence to the observations and interpretations that he puts forth here. Essay topics range from anecdotal illustrations of the first recorded lullaby and the first written description of an aquarium to more profound subjects such as the first cosmology and the first heroic age.I particularly enjoyed Kramer's comparative discussion of the three \\"Heroic Age\\" cultures (Greek, Indian, Germanic) and the suggestions that this raises regarding the origin of the first Heroic Age in Sumer. Also interesting are his interpretations of literary imagery in Sumerian poetry, as well as his treatment of the extensive parallels that exist between the Sumerian literary tradition and the Bible.All in all, \\"History Begins at Sumer\\" provides a well-rounded perspective of Sumerian spirituality and culture. However, since this book is really a collection of independent, stand-alone essays, the reader may find it difficult at times to extract a unified impression of what the author was trying to express."},{"Title":"History Begins at Sumer: Thirty-Nine Firsts in Recorded History","review":"Along with Edward Chiera, Samuel Kramer is one of the most influential of early English-language Sumerologists, in part because of his extensive fieldwork, and in part because he published several popular accounts of his findings. Looking at this book I expected something like an account of early cultural and agricultural developments (earliest plow, barn, religious altar, etc) but that's not what this book contains.Kramer is a philologist and concentrates single-mindedly in this book on deciphering and explicating the Sumerian clay tablet literature. The book is a readable general introduction to basic genres and tropes of Sumerian literature, and is satisfying enough if one seeks nothing else.I cannot love this book as it evidences flaws that are admittedly common in the early writings of Biblical-Archaeologists. First, his primary concern and point of reference for interpreting texts is Biblical, e.g. the most salient feature of the great myth cycle of Inanna's descent into the underworld is its early depiction of a resurrection.Second, Kramer is extremely logocentric and displays a pronounced indifference to non-textual forms of evidence including architecture, pottery, statuary, tool artifacts, et cetera. He does not seem to regard texts as existing in any kind of historical context, or at least does not regard such information as important.Third, Kramer regards clay tablets as purely literary artifacts and does not consider their possible use or relationship to liturgy or initiation rites. That strikes me as extraordinarily odd ... surely in 1954 when the book was published it was known that the recitation of Enuma elish on New Year's Day was the great high holiday of Babylon? I do not know if we have evidence of similar ceremonies performed Sumer but it certainly warrants consideration, and would cast most of the extant Sumerian literature in a considerably different light.Fourth, Kramer evidences a prejudice throughout in which the Semitic Babylonians are regarded as more intelligent and more insightful than the Sumerians, and the Hebrews likewise above the Babylonians. Perhaps it doesn't even need to be said, but it seems odd to me that a man would study this literature for decades and still only be capable of regarding it as crude proto-Biblical material instead of having its own virtues and values.Still, many of these were the faults of the time and it was an easy and stimulating read. A bit basic for anyone with more than a token familiarity with the literature."},{"Title":"History Begins at Sumer: Thirty-Nine Firsts in Recorded History","review":"Kramer was one of the foremost scholars of Sumerian history a generation ago, and in this work for a popular audience he lets his obvious love of his subject shine through.The format - a brief self-contained chapter devoted to each of the 39 \\"firsts\\" he ascribes to Sumerian culture - lends itself to browsing through topics of interest without having to wade through areas of lesser appeal. It's a pleasant and easy way to learn some basic aspects of an ancient and highly influential culture.The weaknesses of the work for the modern reader are those inherent in its format and decades-old publication date. The scholarship is a bit dated, so some of Kramer's claims of \\"firsts\\" are not as secure as in his day. (Kramer makes clear in the text that he is describing the first known or first recorded instance of a given cultural innovation, a status that obviously is affected by future finds.) Also, he strains to make certain interesting finds fit into the \\"first\\" category - such as the \\"first recorded instance of juvenile delinquency\\" to describe an interesting Sumerian text describing a father's disappointment with his son's lackadaisacal approach to school.All said, this is an easily-digested introduction to Sumer, useful as a first book on the subject for the casual reader, or as an interesting sidelight for those with greater interest in this ancient kingdom."},{"Title":"History Begins at Sumer: Thirty-Nine Firsts in Recorded History","review":"I bought this book to further clarify the origin of the stories (myths) of the Bible -- Genesis creation story, Noah and the flood, Moses and the Law, resurrection stories, etc. This book enlightens one on this and much more. Easy and entertaining read (though serious). Fascinating to learn about the most ancient known civilization, and how its mythologists and poets and stories (as recorded on tablets) have shaped subsequent civilizations and gave rise to ancient pagan religions and our own modern religions."},{"Title":"History Begins at Sumer: Thirty-Nine Firsts in Recorded History","review":"I had fun reading Samuel Noah Kramer's book \\"History Begins at Sumer\\". This isn't a typical history book. It doesn't go into any detail at all about the different city-states of Sumer, who ruled what lands, where Sumer was, or even mention any dates or events of any widespread significance, etc.What this most unique book is is a collection of 39 essays on daily life taken almost exclusively from information recorded on 4,00 year old cuneiform tablets. There's an essay on a tablet, Kramer describes, where a father tries to convince his son to study hard and become a scribe, how a farmer should tend to his fields, Sumerian proverbs and wisdom, and Sumerian mythology stories. There's even an essay on sexuality. If you can imagine the Sumerians were a little less inhibited than we are about these matters! There are extensive quotations from these tablets, so you surely get the full flavor of the Sumerian experience right from the source.What most people don't realize is that there are now perhaps tens of thousands of tablets with Sumerian language essays and documentations in existence that only in the mid 1800's became translatable. This opened up a vast world of insight into a civilization that was in many ways one of the first to use written language extensively yet had vanished beneath the sands of the Mesopotamian desert in 1500 BC. It also means that unlike civilizations and cultures that came before us, the Sumerian civilization in large part failed to gets its due credit.Surprisingly, there aren't many scholars who can read these tablets and from what I understand thousands of them still sit undeciphered in the British Museum and many more lay buried and many more were recently illegally excavated, heading for antiquities auctions during the current turmoil in Iraq.Kramer was probably one of the worlds foremost scholars on these tablets and he writes beautifully and effortlessly, like you're reading an article in the New Yorker literary magazine.Lastly, although Kramer doesn't come right out and say it, I believe his passion to understand and write about the Sumerian culture is that he is probably Jewish and it appears that many of the Bible stories were taken from the Sumerians, including the flood, Eden, and a \\"rib\\" story, and Abraham was born in Ur. The Old Testament was complied somewhere between 1200 BC and 200 BC. The Sumerians wrote the same stories down perhaps over a millennium before that."},{"Title":"History Begins at Sumer: Thirty-Nine Firsts in Recorded History","review":"The best way to get to know a culture is by it's own people. Kramer, the world's leading sumerlogist, brings to life Sumerian times by introducing us to the remnants of cuneiform tablets produced by the Sumerians. Spanning from expressions & sayings, a pupil arriving late at school, book-lists, tax-cuts to the first laws, murder-case, cosmology myths and love-poems we get a close insight into the first city-state culture that invented writing in the first place. Kramer guides us through these works with a clear love and passion for the subject. Adding commentary to help you understand and to provide context. When necessary Kramer has gone to great lengths to bring to light the ideas of the Sumerians as for example in the chapter on philosophy. The book is well written and easy to follow. Of course parallels with the bible are commented on, and the world famous gilgamesh epos is also featured. I believe this is the best way to get to know a culture, up close and personal, so I really enjoyed this book and strongly recommend it to everyone interested in this subject."},{"Title":"History Begins at Sumer: Thirty-Nine Firsts in Recorded History","review":"Though professional or student archeologists interested or working in the field of ancient Mesopotamian studies may find much here to be dated, this, one-time, very infuential book is still well worth the read by the academic nonspecialist or member of the educated lay public. As such, I found the book to be a very useful resource when I recently edited my own work about the history of southern Iraq: \\"Wetlands of Mass Destruction: Ancient Presage for Contemporary Ecocide in Southern Iraq\\""},{"Title":"History Begins at Sumer: Thirty-Nine Firsts in Recorded History","review":"We owe much of our knowledge on Ancient Sumerian civilization to Mr Samuel Kramer. As one of the specialists on Sumerian cuneiform and written culture, he traced the clay tablets of Ancient Mesopotamia in various places and brought together the parts of puzzles that belonged to very early Sumerian myths. In this legendary work, Mr Kramer presents us the &quot;39 firsts&quot; of history, including &quot;The First Farmers Almanac&quot;, &quot;The First Law Codes&quot;, &quot;The First Noah&quot;, &quot;The First Resurrection&quot; and so on. The book does not follow a chronological order but presents the achievements of the Ancient Sumerians in an &quot;item-by-item&quot; basis. You not only learn the historical basics on Ancient Mesopotamia in various chapters of this brilliant work, but have fun by reading the fascinating original Sumerian myths, including &quot;Inanna's voyage to the land of the dead&quot;. If you're into ancient history, this book should be on your &quot;Top 10&quot; list. If you need further reading from Mr Kramer, &quot;Sumerian Mythology&quot; may well follow the suit."},{"Title":"History Begins at Sumer: Thirty-Nine Firsts in Recorded History","review":"This book is well-organized but it still has the feel and look of the original edition of 1956. It has a lot of good information but I can't help thinking that archeology has probably provided us even more insight than we had 50 years ago. What should be added? Worse, what info in this book has since been found to be incorrect?Nevertheless, this book opens the door on our first civilization, and one we cannot appreciate enough."},{"Title":"History Begins at Sumer: Thirty-Nine Firsts in Recorded History","review":"Our views of history have barely caught up with the archaeological revolution of the twentieth century. The sources of our traditions in Classical antiquity always had a murky prelude, the world of the Assyrians, a late Mesopotamia with an unknown provenance. And yet the sources of all this remained obscure, as if we had forgotten the Greeks behind the Romans. Now the full scope of the complete historical cycle of civilizations beginning in Sumer (and Egypt) has come into view throwing the whole of world history into its real pattern. For we see that the Sumerians were the real creators laying the foundations for what was to come. Our perceptions of the evolution of civilization have yet to catch up."},{"Title":"History Begins at Sumer: Thirty-Nine Firsts in Recorded History","review":"When I ordered this book I expected to read about the real, \\"material\\" first achievements and inventions of this wonderful people, the Sumerians: the wheel, the road, the writing system, the irrigation, the social structure, the domestication, the institutionalized religion etc.Instead of that Mr. Kramer feeds us with such ephemirical things (that can be in any culture) like the 'first' lullaby, the 'first' eulogy, the 'first' labor conflict etc. And how does he know they were the first back there in Sumer? He gives no proof. It looks like all his information comes from a number of translations of cuneiform tablets that occurred to be in the couple of univeristies and museums that employed him for some time and, basically, the book is nothing more but a collection of extracts from several low-value papers written by him and his students over the years.On the positive side, the book is quite amuzing and easy to read. In my opinion, the knowledge in the book does add to better understanding of this relict culture.Concerning the book's style, it looks like it's written by a typical mid-20th century university reseacher who is full of himself and his research, good or otherwise, and who does not shies off from shedding praises upon himself and his pupils in a hope to attract more grants and donations. It is also too obvious that the author heavily avoids writing down any, any piece of information that could help a competing Sumerologist to advance an inch."},{"Title":"The pocket dictionary of art terms,","review":"This text is a very handy pocket-book to take along to museums and on architectural tours. The opening pages of the book are devoted to drawings of architectural terms -- there is a heavy emphasis on church and cathedral architecture, with a few pieces on Greco-Roman aspects of architecture. That makes this helpful in terms of European tourism, but it leaves out the greater range of non-sacred architecture, at least among the graphics (a few terms are included, without visual aid).The dictionary is, as most dictionaries, arranged alphabetically. However, this proves the problem of most dictionaries of this sort -- if you don't know what something is called in the first place, it takes a great while to thumb through the pages to find the terms one seeks. More graphics showing visual clues would be helpful throughout the book.These shortcomings aside, this is a very handy book, easily carried and easily used. It has usefulness to those interested in art history, studio arts, architecture, photography, decorative arts/crafts, and more. Terms are generously cross-referenced, and terms in common use in museum publications, descriptions and labelling are all included.The book includes a generous bibliography arranged topically suggesting further readings. A must have for the avid museum-goer, it will also be a welcome addition to any student or casual observer of art."},{"Title":"The pocket dictionary of art terms,","review":"Yes, this little book is really great.

At the bottom, she finds herself in a room with a tiny door and a bottle labeled \\"drink me.\\" She grows and shrinks depending on what she eats and drinks, and as a small version of herself, finds herself swimming in a pool of tears. Swimming to shore, Alice and some other creatures decide that \\"'the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race'\\" (26). Alice continues to chase the White Rabbit and the White Rabbit sends her into his house for his fan and gloves. Once in the house, Alice gets into more trouble with an unlabeled bottle, quickly growing too big to move. The White Rabbit and Bill the Lizard try to get her out, and Alice only escapes by eating some small cakes. She runs into the woods and meets a hookah-smoking Caterpillar, who gives her some advice on ways to grow bigger and smaller. Next, she stops at the house of the Duchess with a pig for a baby; the pig escapes, and Alice asks the Cheshire Cat for help. Directed on to the March Hare's house, Alice takes part in the Mad Tea Party, perhaps the most famous scene in the book. Alice moves on to the Queen's croquet ground, where she encounters the Queen of Hearts and tries to play croquet with a flamingo and a hedgehog. Next, Alice encounters a Mock Turtle and a Gryphon, who tell her the story of the lobster quadrille. The book closes with a trial on the case of the stolen tarts, as the Queen accuses the Knave of Hearts. Alice is accused also, and she scatters the attacking cards, only to find herself awake on the river bank where the book began."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Alice in Wonderland is a great book that I truly enjoyed.

First I saw the Disney-Movie from 1951... those lovable figures, like the brave Alice, the crazy Chesire Cat, the big red Queen and her tiny little king, the wild expressive story. Great. Then the remake or second part of the story with the extraordinary Jonny Depp. But nothing of these great pieces you can find in this book.The only good thing in this book is the crazy story, about a girl in her wonderland with the insane inhabitants.It was a dull writing. Sentences like \\"He said... Then she said... Then he said...\\" will make you lazy. There is no heart in the story... just a pure and clean describing of the chapters of this story.

Of course she was chasing the white rabbit in the waistcoat. The world she fell into was a wonderland of non-sense.

I did find one part that has largely been omitted from recent works. It was when Alice made her way to the Duchesses house. A frog in a uniform, which was an oddity to Alice in its self, guarded the home but she ventured further and found upon entry into the Duchesses house it was filled to the brim with pepper. The cook of the house was randomly throwing pots and pans at everything and everyone. Curiously the Duchess sat in the middle of the violent cook and the cloud of pepper nursing a baby that she thrust to Alice to care for.

In \\"Wonderland\\", Lewis Carroll questions everything about life that is normal, and gives us a picture of a world where everything that we accept as normal is turned upside down. With Alice, you'll fall into a rabbit hole and enter an imaginary and wacky world where nothing is at it seems. Here's a small taste:\\"By-the-bye, what became of the baby?\\" said the Cat. \\"I'd nearly forgotten to ask.\\"\\"It turned into a pig,' Alice answered very quietly, just as if the Cat had come back in a natural way.\\"I thought it would,\\" said the Cat, and vanished again.And another quote:\\"...they drew all manner of things - everything that begins with an M -\\"\\"Why with an M?\\" said Alice.\\"Why not?\\" said the March Hare.If you find this kind of maddening surreal world even remotely attractive, then you're sure to love Alice's \\"Wonderland\\". You'll be amazed by the cat-less grin of the Cheshire-Cat, amused by the absurd logic of the mad Hatter, and in hysterics over the antics of the murderous Queen of Hearts with her constant refrain of \\"Off with his head.\\" \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is full to the brim with wild humour, farcical fantasy, witty wisecracks, and slapstick comedy. What I especially enjoyed were the abundance of delightful puns, paradoxes, and parodies. Much of the deeper significance will escape young children, but they will enjoy it as a fantastic story, and rediscover it with even greater pleasure as adults. A \\"classic\\" is a book that appeals to people of all times and ages, and that's certainly the case with \\"Alice in Wonderland.\\"Is \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" all nonsense? I don't think so. Behind the outer layer of nonsense Carroll conveys a great deal of sense. He allows you to return to reality with a renewed appreciation for everything that is normal and accepted. Yet this fantasy world is at the same time so nonsensical and enjoyable, that you'll want to return there many a time.

Lewis Carroll, the great author of this book, is actually a mathematician. This book has so much creativity and deep meaning. It explains the transition of Alice becoming a grown and mature woman from a young child. This book is a perfect book for all ages, preferably seven years old and older."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I'm 11 and I read this book because it was free. Funny reason, yes, but it's true. I have never read this book before now, having only watched the cartoon movie. It's an interesting story, since it is supposed to be dream like, and so fun to read, out loud or silently. I think this is a great book for young people and young-at-heart people. If you've never read it, it's a must-read!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is for most children pure pleasure. While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's codes in the text, or debate this or that, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing \\"The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new.\\"There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters, my preferred is the Cat! - fantastical and totally normal creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences.For more than 130 years, children love the delightfully non-moralistic, non-sense, nopn-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education.Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are almost as important as the well-loved story.And for 0,00 Pounds, Dollars, Euros to pay - what can You lose?It is a whole win-win situation!Grab, people, grab!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Point: Dreams can be life-like and life can be dream-like.Path: Originally told as a children's story while rowing on the Isis river, this story was eventually written down and published. Carroll follows an inquisitive Alice down rabbit burrows, through animal homes, flamingo croquet games, under disappearing cats, and back home again.Sources: Many have suggested ideas for possible illusions and references in this work. The most likely is that Carroll was imagining what a dream would be like in real life.Agreement: I enjoyed the musings following the book more than the book itself. While reading it everything seemed so disjointed and combobulated - which is exactly the point. After completing the book I found myself pondering reality through through the eyes of a dream.Personal App: In a dream, extraordinary happenings make sense. Perhaps reality would be a little more exciting if I were to slow down and really think about what I take for granted. There is magic all around.Favorite Quote: \\"Alice looked at the jury-box and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move.\\" Moving its tail in a melancholy way! That is funny.Note: It is worth it to pick up an edition with the original sketches."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I just couldn't get enough of this book. I loved this book so well I can't give it enough stars. This story and its characters was so pure and simple I could imagine myself with Alice. It was humorous...sometimes I was laughing so hard I was crying. I enjoyed this book more than words can express. This book, everything about it, was beautiful, simply beautiful. The setting was so vivid and expressionfilled. The funniest parts were when Alice met the Queen of Hearts. The were playing crochet with living animals. Then there was the time Alice was talking with the Gryphon and the Turtle. The Turtle was obviously extremely erroneous concerning education. He was describing his school to Alice, and he said \\"history\\" was \\"mystery\\" and a lot of other twisted up tales. Then there was the Rabbit, March Hare, Hatter, and the Dormouse, who alone made up a curious group. The Dormouse apparently had problems with a sleeping disorder, as he could fall asleep standing up. Then there was the Duchess, who had a baby who resembled a pig, and the silly cook who threw everything within reach at the Duchess. Another odd character (all of Lewis Carroll's characters are odd) was the Chesire Cat, who could disappear just like that. There were many others, including a courtroom full of poor fools who toppled over when Alice made a sudden move, which I did not mention. The extra bossy Queen seemed to have a problem beheading anyone for the slightest offense, while the weak King pardoned them all behind her back. As it turned out, this whole story was all a strange dream which Alice had while she was resting outside with her big sister. Anyway, this was a wonderful book, and you should read it for yourself...one of the best books I've ever read, and yes, up till now. This book had a really great impression on me, and I found myself saddened to see myself coming to the end of it. I highly recommend this book to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Jim Dale could read a cookbook and it would be awesome. This audio rendition of Alice in Wonderland is well, wonderful :-)"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Lewis Carroll's nearly 150 year old story has never gone out of print. It has been translated into over 120 languages, and there are over 100 different editions. This classic fairy-tale is deeply imbedded in both children and adults of the Western world.The young blonde protagonist was inspired by 10-year-old Alice Pleasance Liddell, who so loved Carroll's candid story about her that she persuaded him to write it down. He provided her with a copy that he illustrated himself called Alice's Adventures Underground. Soon after, he expanded the story adding the scenes with the Cheshire cat and the Mad Hatter. And with help from an incredible illustrator, John Tenniel, he published the first edition called Alice's Adventures in Wonderland in 1865.The book is very short. I read it on my iPhone Kindle app all in one sitting (I was on the bus for TWO hours because of Red Sox traffic). It jumps right into the story: On the first page, Alice is already falling down the giant hole where the Rabbit disappeared. Alice is a strange child and you get the impression that she often plays by herself and mostly lives in her head (perhaps she's an INFP?). She has very entertaining conversations with herself that the narrator handles beautifully:She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.The story is very similar to the Disney version that I grew up with. There were only a few minor things that Disney omitted and with good reason. For example, I could do without the completely absurd scene where a Gryphon and a Mock-Turtle tell Alice about the Lobster Quadrille.On a road trip to Colorado from Arkansas a few years ago, a friend of mine read about half of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland out loud to the rest of us in the car. The illustrations were awesome and......................the words..................................made patterns...................................................on the screen....................................................................like this.That's the way I suggest you read/hear this story. So, download the audio book or coax someone into reading this book to you.

Actually, Lewis Carroll was a very smart man. He invented Wonderland to show people truths in their own world most people wouldn't even bother thinking about. In fact, I think the whole point of the book is that even though Wonderland seems so unreal and full of nonsence, it's really just the same as our own world! I admit, I was curious about what a book so popular written for children would be like. It was great! I'd recomend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"\\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" is a scrumptious new large-format imaging of a favorite classic for children. The text of the story is familiar and vivid, but the paintings and illustrations are like a forgotten dream of the original intentions of the Alice editions' illustrations. Oleg Lipchenko's fabulous art work is both nostalgic and fresh, imaginative, and familiar. Suitable for all ages, \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" makes a beautiful gift to share with any beloved child."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Jim Dale is a hoot to listen to. He captures the sarcasm and word-play that Lewis Carroll weaved into the stories. For those who have heard his reading of the Harry Potter series, some of the voices will sound very familiar. I am listening to this in preparation for the new film version of Alice that is being released.I enjoy audiobooks generally because I can listen to them on the road, or while confined to a sick bed, or waiting for a plane and so on. Easy to carry many of them on an MP3 player rather than carrying several books. Jim Dale is an excellent reader that really captures the characters and feeling of the stories. I've heard other readers that were quite lackluster, but this one is a keeper."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The book was great reading-it contained the entire story. The pictures were accurate representations of what was described by the author. The hard cover and the ribboned book mark make the book a great buy that will last for a very long time.

Plus, the books I had found hadn't printed the illustrations very well (they were always dark and smudged). Then I found this edition of Lewis Carroll's classic, and I was extremely pleased! Rackham's artwork left me speechless. I adored the simple pen-and-ink illustrations to the full-page paintings. This is a splendid book to own if you enjoy the original story and want new illustrations to admire."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I ordered this book for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas and was very pleased at the high quality edition I received. Specifically, I was looking for a book that would draw her into reading it with exceptional artwork and craftmanship. This is exactly what I got in this edition. One possible drawback is its size. It's a bit large for little hands and portability, but that is a small trade-off for this work of art. Also, the pages are thick so watch out for paper cuts!!! This edition is nice enough to display as an unusual conversation piece on a coffee table, or pass down to the next generation.The booklist reveiwer mentioned that the print was at times distracting, but I think he misses the point. It's meant to enhance the story. For instance, as one character falls the print spirals and gets smaller. It wasn't difficult to read and my daughter \\"got it\\" and thought it was fun!Bottom line is that if you are looking for an edtion of a beloved story that can be kept for years to come for your treasured daughter or that special neice, this is without question the one you are looking for!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is the cleanest and best formatted version of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland on the Kindle market.

I highly recommend this version!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This Kindle edition is a VERY POOR choice - 1 star. 5 stars is for the original book. I sampled many Alice in Wonderland and all the Through the Looking Glass books I could find available (at Amazon and Gutenberg org - though today I discover some I missed). I believe I found that the best available editions, if you want both, are:The BLTC at 1.79Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (BLTC Press Edition)- this edition is very well formatted with all the Tenniel illustrations that I recall and is the one I purchased myself.The Bompacrazy at .99Alice in Wonderland (Illustrated)orAlice's Adventures in Wonderland (Illustrated)(these two appear to be exactly the same from the samples as both have the 'blotted out' picture of the Drink Me tag): this is almost as good a choice, though not quite as well formatted. The sample has a Rackham illustration (and there may be more) as well as the many Tenniel, though, which is a plus.The free Gutenberg org versions - lacked the improved linking and formatting, but there are various illustrated editions; may be worth it to you if .99 is too much or you are looking for something other than Tenniel.I did see a kindle version of an 'Original First Edition' Alice which appears to be illustrated by Arthur Rackham - in case you are looking for that one instead of the better known John Tenniel version.Alice In Wonderland - Original First Edition Version Published For Kindle - Lewis CarrollThat edition has no Tenniel illustrations in the sample; also the text seems to be abridged (or just maybe an earlier version?) and the formatting is poor. Note that the picture of Alice looking at the Cheshire Cat in a tree that appears on this linked product page is not the cover that appears on the downloaded sample; the cover that does appear is of Alice walking with the Duchess and looks like this kindle book:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through the Looking Glass- now for more typical Amazon mis-linked craziness, this latter edition has Tenniel illustrations, but beware that they are very small thumbnails and enlarge to very poor quality. I do not recommend either of these editions. The Rackham is available at Gutenberg for free.Today I discovered the Master EditionThe Complete Alice in Wonderland (Kindle Master Editions)which I missed before (likely because I was concentrating on Through the Looking Glass, which has far fewer editions, and then pursuing the 'matching' Alice in Wonderlands). Today the price is .89 and I am going to buy it. It is at least as well formatted as the BLTC (based on the sample) and has even more Alice writings (beyond Wonderland and Looking Glass) as well as essays and historical info and other 'add-ons'. He has all the illustrations from Tenniel and additional ones from Holliday and Carroll (I think he should add Rackham's, too).As many others have said, the basic Kindle edition is a very poor choice, and most others also lack the illustrations. Thank goodness for samples.Re Through the Looking Glass, it was the chess board appearing in the BLTC sample (and not in the BompaCrazy sample) that finalized my choice in their favor (before finding the Master). Here are the BLTC and BompaCrazy links:Through the Looking Glass- BLTCThrough the Looking Glass (Illustrated)- BompaCrazyI hope this review helps you find your best choice far more quickly than I did."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Unlike other versions for the Kindle, this one has the illustrations and properly formatted poems and songs.

It has been adapted into numerous cartoons, films and plays over the years, and it has become an important backdrop of the World culture. It is a brilliant and zany fairy tale that remains fresh and engaging well over a century after it had been written. This is in large part thanks to the unforgettable and unique characters that are as famous (if not more) as Alice herself: the White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the \\"Mad\\" Hatter, the Queen of Hearts and many more. They are among the most idiosyncratic characters in all of literature. However, the aspects of the book that I found the most fascinating were the clever use of language, the numerous puns, and the plays on the difference between the literal and actual meanings of different expressions and saying. It was very amusing to read these, and realize how clever and verbal this book actually is. The book made me reflect again on so many aspects of the world that I take for granted, and it made me feel like a child exploring and learning about various objects, ideas and relations for the first time. This alone makes this book worth reading and rereading, and I expect to come to it many times again."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The classic is still the same, but the art-work is all new.

However, this edition is quite poorly compiled. It really contains the bare minimum of the story. For example, the illustrations are missing. (The author seems to feel they're significant.

The formatting is erratic. It would be nice if the book included the typical acknowledgment to Project Gutenberg (which is how this edition came into being) and its small text.I do think it's wonderful that this wonderful story is available at no cost to so many people.

In this particular book they are such an important part that the text refers to them."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Alice in wonderland is one of those flights of fantasy which appear to come from an extremely creative imagination.There is some very interesting life metaphors in the language used by Alice and the Caterpillar, as well as between Alice and the Cheshire cat, my favourite parts of the book were the dialogue."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"It is a very easy download from Amazon.

Well, I suppose you could dislike the book and turn in a bad rating.

If anything I remember seeing pieces of a cartoon if you're lucky and so when I downloaded this book, I didn't expect to like it. As to be honest, I have an odd taste in books, I thought Alice was not my thing. But I was sucked in from the first sentence. I give this book four stars right now as I am still reading it and also because it's a bit confusing at times and repeats itself a tiny bit here and there, nothing major."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"There is something in these books, maybe too fictional. It was not for my daughter. She like books such asMatildaorRoald Dahl/Charlie Boxed Set (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator)orThe Invention of Hugo CabretorThe Complete Little House Nine-Book Set. This book was not cut for her."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Okay, I admit to reading this after playing Alice: Madness Returns. I was in the mood for some classic literature too!Having never read this, I didn't know what to expect. Rather than having a cohesive story with a beginning, middle and end, like the nature of the writing, things are a little bit...bizarre. We have a collection of scenes which Alive stumbles her way through with (let's face it) atrocious intro and conclusion tacked on. These are so brief (a few paragraphs) that do nothing. In fact, I know this is an older story, but the ending is awful. Maybe it hadn't been done to death in Carroll's day?Despite my contemporary complaints, I actually feel the story would be better off without the intro and conclusion, and be left as a collection of very strange conversations.Okay, there are dialogue heavy with some great images and everything is twisted and fired back and forth, but even this gets a bit...repetitive. It's easy to see why the tea party scene is so famous however, as the writing and humour here is superb. Though I have problems with this, I can recommend the book for this scene alone!In summary, it was good to read something a bit different and the language is approachable and it's all very, very silly. Good to dip into. Just ignore the after-thought ending."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Having read it when I was four it is getting more boring as I get older!

The cartoon is great, but nothing compares to the book!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"\\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" by Lewis Carroll, is a classic (and also famous) tale about a girl who ends up in a very strange world, where almost everything is puzzlingly backwards. No, I'm not talking about that 'new movie that just came out last year', I'm talking about the original book, which follows a completely different storyline. This book keeps you (and the main character, of course) in curiosity from Alice's fall 'down the rabbit hole', her meeting with the Duchess and Cheshire Cat, to the twisted crouquet game with the queen. Through this story, Alice struggled to keep her mind straight in the many places where reality curved. In the end, however, she learned that only constant fear can keep you a-maze, as she ecaped Wonderland."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"a wonderful classic must read for any fan of stories, one of the finest masterpieces to date. if you can challenge this please let me know"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"It shipped in just around the time I was expecting it to. Unfortunately the brown package did not live very long once it made it into my hands. :) The book came in perfect condition, better yet the books edges had gold-trim! I was very impressed!That is what I have to say about the outside. Might I also say its outside perfectly represents what's inside. This is such a wonderful and enjoyable book to read. I find myself reading it out loud a lot of the time to try and capture the emotion of the characters. This is such a well-written story. To all those who are reading this, this book is definitely worth getting and keeping."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"This is a Beautiful book... a treasured keepsake for any child! The illustrations are of artfully sculpted dolls by the amazingly talented Nancy Wiley. Absolutely Beautiful!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I saw the recently released movie Alice in Wonderland and that prompted me to read this book. The movie has great visuals and thus complements this text-only Kindle version."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"You cannot go by stars alone really on things like books. Especially books like Alice in Wonderland. There are people out there,(ahem see the three star reviewer) that have no imagination. This story is just a silly bit of imagined nonsense covering up deeper meanings. Anyone apposed to nonsense, or those who cannot read \\"between the lines\\" need not apply. :D cheers"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Long time ago, I should have read this story as a child, but I don't remember how come I didn't, but I don't remember either how I came to know Alice so intimately, as if this was a legend that had leaked out to me and never to be forgotten. No doubt, this is one hell of a legend.The title itself belies it to be just a fantastical childhood tale but it is actually a book that will get adults curiouser and curiouser until all the puns that are intended to taunt the deluded adult world will boil down to giving you a crazy smile. I swear by a mouse's tail- this Alice book is charming, and so full of funny, far-out characters. I cant resist being crazy with the mad tea-party, and the wacky game-story of cards and chess, of the chesire cat, and of course, Alice who is smart, proud and always snappy. Although my favorite of all is the wise caterpillar who smokes a hookah and sits on a mushroom.Alice in Wonderland is actually a story of growing up, or more like a child's discovery of wisdom, or maybe an exploration of wisdom in a child's perspective. The setting of cards and chess is an allegory of the world of chance and determinism, and the pervasive foreshadowing of death seems silly but anyway childish. Sometimes I don't understand why the book is one of the most quoted. Perhaps because aside from being popular, I am sure this tale really brings out the child in anyone.Lewis Carroll might have only told this story to put a loquacious girl in silence but fortunately, he has not made a very simple fantasy. He has invented an Alice in a lot of us."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I love this book so much,I couldn't wait to get Through The Looking Glass.I like this book,because of the adventures such as:Going down the rabbit-hole,using the key,being ordered by animals,meeting the Cheshire Cat,and meeting the Queen of Hearts.Buy it,now!"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Lewis Carroll tells us a fantatic tale of a little girl who is caught in a satircal world, filled with paridy and weirdness. The book is a children's book with a sense of politcal humour for an adult. That is what makes Alice so wonderful to read."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Alice's Adventure's in Wonderland is book that is like no other that i have read. At first it may seem simple and non moralistic but after you read it over more than once you can see what Carrol was trying to say and how it reflects his life. I think I enjoyed it because it is something that would never happen. Well the odds of me falling down a well chasing a talking rabbit with a pocketwatch is slim to none. Because it's unsual, quirky and comical it's fun to read and hard to put down. I'd recommend it to people of all ages."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"My 16 year old son asked me to get this book for him from the local library; (I think he saw the cartoon). For whatever reason, I was happy to see him reading! He enjoyed it so much that I decided to read it again. It was still as magical as the first time I read it 25 years ago. If it's been awhile since you followed the White Rabbit and enjoyed a Mad Tea Party, do yourself a favor and read 'Alice' again"},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"After Lisbeth Zwerger's work on &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, I had pretty high hopes for her artistic interpretation of &quot;Alice in Wonderland.&quot; Her &quot;Wizard&quot; was a bold, refreshing take on some very familiar characters, and stands in particular contrast to the MGM movie. But, sadly, the illustrations for &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; don't offer the same interesting take on classic characters. Her version of &quot;Alice&quot; gives us the most depressed looking Alice I've ever seen. She appears to be almost drugged, and not at all the curious and engaging little girl we know. While Lisbeth Zwerger is known for sparse illustrations, here they seem almost barren at times. Her version of the Caterpillar for instance takes an almost sacrilegious liberty of giving us a modern seeming caterpillar smoking a cigarette instead of the traditional, more exotic hookah. Her artistic vision here offers us a scene more mudane than surreal. Perhaps, the artist is illustrating too many books, since this effort doesn't seem to me to be a fully realised one. I recently purchased &quot;Aice in Wonderland&quot; illustrated by Angel Dominguez (Artisan, 1996) and that's far and away a much better version. I would say buy this book only if you're looking for another &quot;Alice&quot; book for your collection. I just don't feel it's a standout addition."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I bought this book for my daughter. This quality of this book tells you that it is meant to be a keepsake. It is very well printed on high-quality paper, beautifully bound, and comes with a hard slipcover. The illustrations are amazing, but I found their style to be a bit dark for my 7-year old. The book is very text heavy, making it cumbersome to read aloud to a child, and a lot of the prose itself is on an adult level. Although my daughter is an excellent reader for her age, she has lost interest in trying to get through this book. I have read it myself, and while it captures the story of Alice in Wonderland nicely, it is, indeed a commitment to get through."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"I loved this book.

It's one of the most famous line from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and I think it pretty accurately sums up the entirety of the book. I traveled through wonderland and came out feeling a tad conflicted over this book. On the one hand, I fully acknowledge that Lewis Carroll developed a truly awesome story. I can't even imagine how shocking this book was when it was first published in 1865!! On the other hand, I spent much of the book feeling like I was missing out on some kind of drug-fueled inside joke.There were times when I literally had to read the same sentence 5 times because I just had no clue what he was talking about (and re-reading usually resulted in me being even more confused than after the first read through). To be fair, I know that after writing this book, Lewis Caroll spent countless hours with an artist trying to perfectly capture the essence of Wonderland. Unfortunately, the Kindle version didn't include these pictures, which I think would have clarified some of what Carroll was trying to convey through his mad mad words."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"Ordered for my kindle and it is an awesome book to have.
