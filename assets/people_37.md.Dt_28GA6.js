The battle at Shiloh was, for some, just another battle, but for many it was their last. Shelby Foote does a fantastic job describing the scenes so that you can almost feel the heat from the lead whizzing past you. He does a wonderful job with disgusting details of the men that never returned home. I don't usually enjoy war novels because the ending is rather obvious, but for this single battle I was on the verge of flipping ahead just to find the outcome. I would recommend this book to anyone that wouldn't get grossed out by blood and death because Foote paints a clear picture with his fantastic detail. Again, if you usually don't like Civil War novels, you may find there is something about Shiloh that is different. It puts you on the battlefield, lets you feel both sides of the fighting and it is definitely worth checking out of the library!"},{"Title":"Trial & Death of Jesus","review":"I truly enjoyed reading this book.

If only Justice Cohn would now use his detailed and logical approach, to explain and clarify some of the old testament passages that are highly questionable and nonsensical.For instance ... there are events that happened during the course of our lives, that were so drastic, so important, that the memory of them will stay with us until the very last breath of our earthly existence.The pilot of the Enola Gay who dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, will attest to this fact.

Cohn goes through everything we know (or think we know) about the trial and death of Jesus, in excruciating detail, with an expert's knowledge of the Gospels, the Jewish and the Roman laws. Although, at times, the English is less than perfect, and Cohn's overuse of legal terms is annoying, the book reads well and the documentation is exceedingly good."},{"Title":"Trial & Death of Jesus","review":"At last a refutation of the misconception that the Jewish leaders killed Jesus. Contrary to what the majority of scholars say, the Jewish people had no reason to oppose Jesus. Oppose him for what? Preaching Torah? Healing the sick? Teaching the love of God? Cohn's book details how the Jewish leaders attempted to save Jesus and how no trial took place, rather a hearing that carried out that attempt. Essential reading for all scholars. Its arguments are meticulous and perpiscacious in anticipating and refuting the traditional objections. One of the best books you could own."},{"Title":"Trial & Death of Jesus","review":"Cohn provides fresh insight into the trial of Jesus, approaching it from the perspective of one steeped in Jewish tradition and extremely knowledgeable of the law and legal proceedings.Cohn's work, however, both profits from and suffers from his experience with the legal profession. Lawyers, especially trial lawyers, have trouble writing sober history. They are geared to literary polemic. Almost everything they write is a brief for one position or another. \\"The Trial of Jesus\\" is a brief for the proposition that the Sanhedrin's aim was not the punishment, but the salvation of Jesus.By Cohn's lights, the Sanhedrin worked diligently to avert Jesus' trial for the capital offense of treason. Although his argument is ingenious, it fails to carry the day. It suffers from a number of flaws, not the least of which are set forth below:1. There was no public prosecutor in the days of the Roman Empire. All prosecutions were instituted by private citizens or groups of private citizens. (SeeThe Criminal Law of Ancient Rome, pp. 4-5. Also see Acts 24:1).2. The Gospels name Jesus' prosecutor before Pilate, and the prosecutor is the Sanhedrin. (See Mark 15:1. The Greek \\"sunedrion\\" is translated \\"council\\" in most translations [probably because most readers would be unfamiliar with the term \\"sanhedrin\\"], but a few versions translate \\"sunedrion\\" as \\"sanhedrin\\").3. The Sanhedrin's best course of action if they didn't want Jesus punished was to decline to prosecute him.Throughout history various people have sought to inculpate selected people or groups and/or exculpate other people or groups for Jesus' crucifixion. The most recently published attempt at exoneration is \\"The Gospel of Judas,\\" which seeks to prove that Judas was just following orders when he handed Jesus over to the soldiers.Efforts to fix the blame for something that happened almost 2,000 years ago are interesting exercises in academic parsing, but should make little difference here and now. As Ezekiel said, when the parents eat sour grapes, the children's teeth are not to be set on edge."},{"Title":"Trial & Death of Jesus","review":"This is a great book. The legal research to understand Jesus time is remarkable. His view about how the criminal process was handle and the details about all the main things against Jesus over the trial is outstanding. The exegetical points need to be review since there are a couple of historical moments some how misplaced. But still a great book to consider and analize the last days of Jesus.The only thing that I may not agree is to blame guilty against romans exclusively for the death of Jesus, declaring inocent the jews. When you study scholars like G. Vermes, J. Fitzmyer, R. Brown and read works like F. Josephus, J. Jeremias you may understand and believe that there were many reasons for the Jews to get against Jesus. No doubt that romans killed him, dealing with other manners, but the more affected with Jesus ministry were the Jews. Sorry for this point, with all the respect that it deserves. Besides it, I recomended because the bookis full of details and quotes that you may find them insteresting."},{"Title":"Trial & Death of Jesus","review":"I truly enjoyed reading this book.

Knowing that an office building code requires for each story to be at least 10 feet high, therefore 1,800 feet would represent a skyscraper much taller than the Empire State Building. A building so tall that one standing on the sidewalk at the entrance, would need to back away to no less than mile to be able to see the top of it.

While this book is dense and not an easy read, it is certainly worth the effort to get our \\"settled ideas\\" shaken up a bit. Though dense, I still couldn't put it down.As a highly erudite Jewish scholar, Cohn uses the Gospel versions to tease out the differences between them and analyze them.What struck me most was how we can read the Gospels and because we already \\"know\\" the story, we mentally gloss over some, if not all, of these differences. Cohn, however, uses these differences to paint an entirely new picture of the death of Jesus, referencing history, and his knowledge of Jewish and Roman law, and the Gospels themselves to reconcile them.It is hard to overcome the \\"certainties\\" of 2000 years of deeply held assumptions, but if you join Cohn in his sleuthing, you will find that his version of the trial and death of the Jewish Jesus is not only logical, but much truer to the real spirit and holiness of the Christian tradition than that which has been handed down to us.While you are keeping an open mind, and enjoying your sleuthing, I would recommend Leon Zitzer's book as well, which (independently) builds on Cohn's thesis, and offers some surprising conclusions of his own in \\"The Ghost in the Gospels: The True Story of How Jesus Died and How We All Missed It for 2,000 Years.\\"In the meantime, read Haim Cohn's book and enjoy your journey through new and unchartered mental terrain!"},{"Title":"Trial & Death of Jesus","review":"I am an attorney and after reading only a part of the book I stopped. Any judge in this author's position would have to recuse himself (decline to judge it).1) Cohn starts by basically saying that ALL the New Testament witnesses cannot be believed. He then concocts his own version of all the events rather than going by the available testimony. Luke begins his gospel by saying straight out that he compiled available information, CHECKED IT WITH THE EYEWITNESSES and then wrote his book. Cohn simply ignores things like that because it doesn't fit his premise.2) Cohn was CHIEF JUSTICE of the ISRAELI SUPREME COURT. If he found that the trial of Jesus occurred as reported, he would essentially be saying that the New Testament is true. If he did so, he would become a SOCIAL OUTCAST among Jews. AS A PRACTICAL MATTER he would lose his social standing, most of his business associates would shun him, he would lose virtually all his political connections, even a lot of his relatives would no longer have anything to do with him. He would be accused of having converted to Christianity, which many Jews consider equivalent to a Jew becoming a Nazi. I know American liberals don't like to hear things like that but that *is* still the attitude many Jews have.Any judge who would face those severe consequences if he made a particular finding would have to decline to hear the case and refer it to another judge who would not face the same consequences. If he failed to do so he could face charges of judicial misconduct. (Note--the issue is not \\"Will ANY judge face negative consequences?\\" The issue is \\"Does THIS judge have UNUSUAL circumstances that will subject HIM to negative consequences but MOST judges would not face such consequences?\\")3) Cohn's main premise is \\"The events described are not how Jewish law of that period SAID things were supposed to work.\\" He then rewrites virtually all the significant events and bases his book not on what THE EYEWITNESSES said, but rather on his wholly fictitious substitute scenarios that don't have ONE SHRED of supporting historical EVIDENCE.4) Cohn's main premise is simply ridiculous. Look at the Duke lacrosse rape prosecutions where the District Attorney wound up being disbarred. We can't say, \\"Yes, we have eyewitness testimony and partial transcripts, but that's not how things are SUPPOSED TO work, so we have to ignore all that, assume everything was handled properly, and make decisions based on our unsupported assumptions.\\"5) Anglo-American appeals courts publish written opinions examining the decisions made by trial courts. Literally tens of millions of such opinions have been published in the U.S. alone. Collectively those opinions demonstrate that trials FREQUENTLY are not conducted in detailed compliance with applicable laws--and that is in cases where there ARE lawyers representing both sides, both sides prepared IN DETAIL, and there is no particular hurry or political pressure.In Jesus' case things were thrown together in a hurry at a time when Jerusalem had FIVE TIMES its normal population because Passover was in progress. The Romans' primary concern was not having a mass rebellion. Jewish leaders were worried the Romans might attack. The defendant had no defense counsel. He didn't even TRY to defend."},{"Title":"Trial & Death of Jesus","review":"Obviously the person \\"A READER\\" did not read Judge Cohn's book. That book clearly explains that the Jewish leaders were the ones who had Jesus arrested \\"in secret at night\\" while everybody were sound asleep ... (which later prompted Jesus to ask them \\"Why didn't you arrest me during the daytime when I preached among you, every day at the temple??) ... and the Jewish leaders were in fact responsible for orchestrating Jesus's death.They did found Jesus guilty of blasphemy by stating that Jesus claimed to be \\"The Son of God.\\" But they did not dare stone Jesus to death ... as it was permitted under their biblical laws.Because of the sermons that Jesus gave and the good that \\"He\\" did, Jesus was regarded as an extraordinary teacher and had a very large following who had cheered him, when he entered between the walls of Jerusalem, on a donkey's back. They all simply loved and respected \\"Him.\\"...(Later the followers of Jesus's message of love and tolerance, would march into Rome arena singing, unafraid, to be devoured by hungry beasts, happy to lay down their lives for their love and faith in Jesus)...For the Jewish Leaders to have stoned Jesus, would have turned this large following against them. They therefore plotted to have Jesus put to death by the Romans instead. They had to show that Jesus broke one of the Roman laws. The previous charge accusing Jesus of \\"blasphemy\\" was therefore changed to a charge of \\"treason\\" against Rome's authority, which carried the death penalty.They stated to Pontius Pilatus, the Roman governor of this small province, that Jesus proclaimed himself to be the \\"King of the Jews\\" which undermined Caesar's authority.NOTE: Jesus was sent to King Herod by Pontius Pilatus and then quickly brought back. Herod wanted to see who that famous preacher was. Herod had previously put \\"John the Baptist\\" to death by decapitation, and he now wanted to make sure that John the Baptist had not miraculously returned. When Herod had satisfied his unfunded fear, he promptly sent Jesus back to Pontius Pilatus.Judge Cohn clearly substantiated that Pontius Pilatus's portrayal of a weak and indecisive man was erroneous. He described him as a severe, no-nonsense individual who governed with an iron fist and who strictly imposed the rules and laws of Rome over all the citizens of his small provincial jurisdiction. Judge Cohn rejected Pilatus washing of the fingers. A serious charge of treason had been levied against Jesus by the Jewish leaders, and he had to act on it.It was in deed Pontius Pilatus who ordered Jesus to be crucified for treason, not the Jewish leaders ... but it was in deed the Jewish leaders who had provided Pilatus with the false accusation.When a roman soldier nailed a wooden plaque on the cross that read \\"Here is Jesus, King of the Jews\\" these same leaders were outraged and demanded it to be removed. Pilatus told them, that Jesus had been put to death under such accusation and that the plaque would therefore remain.For anyone to claim that the entire Jewish nation was responsible for Jesus's death is false and ridiculous. Only the few Jewish leaders of that era, who took part of this plot, bore this sole responsibility."},{"Title":"Trial & Death of Jesus","review":"An intellectually honest look at something that was a myth to begin with.

Surely this is a classification that would have amused Thurber no end--are they now &quot;non-uncollected&quot; stories? In &quot;Help! Help! Another Classificationization&quot; Thurber sets himself against exactly this mindset. And frankly, at this late date in the late humorist's career, such a criteria for inclusion assures that the book will not bring us the best of his work.However, Thurber is almost always witty, and even though some of the pieces are dated and irrelevant, all of the writings evoke at least a smile. The cartoons don't fare as well, some of them being merely puzzling. The end notes tell us that some cartoons had different captions in their original stages. The most wildly different is a picture of a woman leaning forward and speaking intently to a man. The published caption is &quot;If I told you a dream I had about you, Mr. Price, would you promise not to do anyting about it unless you really want to?&quot;, but the earlier caption on Thurber's original drawing was &quot;If they never found the husband's body could they do anything to the wife?&quot;This is essentially a collection for the die-hard Thurber fan (who are rather few on the ground these days, it seems) only.

This, however, would all be a minor inconvenience if not for the fact that the information provided in Law School Companion is marginal at best. You can't help but feel as you turn the pages that The Princeton Review threw this together to make some extra money. Almost 40% of the book is devoted to sample course outlines. Sure, they call it Appendix I, but it's still part of the book. If you're looking for a book on law school preparation, this is not the one for you. The authors recommend that you read &quot;one or two&quot; books over the summer. That's great advice if you want to struggle to receive poor grades during your first year.

While this book is very effective about revealing the basic facts of law school, every future law school student must realize that there is no ONE set way to prepare for law school. If there were, there would be one book by one author and it would be the final word. But law school is not that way, life is not that way. Every person will have a unique experience in law school.

The authors of this book are dedicated to educating America's aspiring attorneys, and those who are &quot;just looking&quot; at the profession. As a successful law school graduate and second year associate at a great firm I can tell anyone considering law school that NILE is the single best preparatory experience you can find before actually going to law school.

Having read and been totally blown away by two of Amy Hempel's other short story collections, I found this a little bit disappointing. Stories are interesting enough, and pleasant enough to read but seem more generic than some of her earlier work. I felt like I could have read them and not recognized tht they were the work of this great author. Most disappointing of all was the novella. Long and rambling and if there was a point I didn't get it. For better books by Amy Hempel, I strongly suggest both Reasons To Live and At The Gates Of The Animal Kingdom."},{"Title":"TUMBLE HOME.","review":"Hempel's slim novella 'Tumble Home,' has a hypnotic prose that leaves the reader concentrating on every word. The short stories are so earthy you feel as if you're among family. Minimalism has never been used so effectively with Hempel's description of everyday americana."},{"Title":"TUMBLE HOME.","review":"Amy Hempel is a writer you don't want to read lazily. Even in her 70+ page title novella, you don't want to flash over a single syllable, for Hempel is an intensive writer of the unsaid, working with both what is on the page and what isn't to convey the complex emotions of her characters. Also, since many of her narrators or narratives are disjointed in some way (or, like in the title novella, unbalanced), their methods of storytelling are often indirect in form, but direct in emotion.Hempel's clearest strength has to do with the unmediated emotions she creates in her prose. Rather than thoughtful response, she tends to first engage emotionally, throwing us squarely into a character's head, however uncomfortable that may be. In \\"Sportsman,\\" for example, Jack has been turned out in an act of what he deems as betrayal, and so drives across the country to find solace. He is mistrusting, alone and heartbroken, and Hempel does not filter out what might be unpleasant about his situation for the sake of sentimentality. Instead, she engages it honestly (and wittily) to make Jack and his friends fleshed out and alive.Not to say that Hempel works only on an emotional level. Her writing clearly has a lot of intellectual appeal. She exhibits great play with language and a magnificent ear for the quirks of conversation (any party scene in this book will hit you with smart dialogue you'll want to emulate), and her writing is surgically prescise, though maybe too precise at times. Stories like \\"Sportsman\\" and \\"Church Cancels Cow\\" and the novella _Tumble Home_ run a tight wire of meshing their characters and their metaphors without seam, but other stories, like \\"The Children's Party,\\" end up with forced metaphor, like pieces whose endings feel a little more contrived than organic, but I will credit Hempel here with her successes in this book rather than disparage her for ithe book's faults. It's a short book, but well worth taking your time with, to wring every idea from."},{"Title":"TUMBLE HOME.","review":"Amy Hempel reminds me of the time I went to a new doctor...and waited and waited for her surrounded by horribly slick renderings of \\"great art,\\" sitting on the world's most uncomfortable chairs.

There is more detail in this book than just about any other Civil War battle monologue I own. (I have about 70 such books at the moment.)The book is well written, and packed with relevant information. There are a number of maps, including notes about original park map errors and the like. There are detailed reviews of each regimental/battalion commander and the units themselves, as well as extensive first hand accounts of the action. There are many photos of participants as well. Since it is a small scale (but hard fought) battle, casualties tabulations are given down to individual soldier's names in many instances.Those enjoying books about smaller battles like Cloyd's Mountain (by McManus), Piedmont (by Patchan), New Market (by Davis), Wilson's Creek (by Bearss), or Belmont (by Hughes) will likely enjoy this work as well.The best description I can give of the overall feel of the book is \\"immersive.\\" Reading the text, and looking at the maps, as well as period and present day photos one has the impression of having been of walking the field--more so than many other fine books I've read. It is easy to visualize the action, such is the \\"atmosphere\\" generated by the combination of graphics and accounts. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Last Sleep: The Battle of Droop Mountain November 6, 1863","review":"This is the definitive work on the Droop Mountain fight.

After Alleyn and Troy meet on a ship sailing back to England from the South Pacific (and they do not meet well, although he is interested in her), Alleyn is called to investigate a murder at Troy's home conveniently down the road from his mother's. An artist's model has been murdered, and there is literally a cast of suspects who had the motivation to \`do her in', including Troy herself. The plot is pretty procedural, although the identity of the murderer is kept hidden for quite awhile. The great thing is the language and style of the novel: slang terms, endearments, and descriptions of people are wonderfully appropriate to the time in which the novel first appeared. The relationship between Alleyn and his mother could not be written \`straight' today: the \`darlings' and \`mammas' would be a joke in the 21st century, especially since Alleyn is not a young man at this point. Troy and Alleyn's misunderstandings, and the rather melodramatic \`Epilogue in a Garden' is fun to read and would have played well to the original readers; it's full of dramatic tension and yet a little silly at the same time. Better than most modern mysteries."},{"Title":"Artists in Crime (Inspector Alleyn)","review":"As a long-standing Marsh fan, I don't rate this one as a favorite, but for those interested in the series, this is the book where Alleyn meets Agatha Troy for the first time. (In general, if you want to find the best Marshs, look at the copyright date -- the later the better. This is an early one, 1938; her last was published in 1982.) This is a solidly written, solidly plotted, murder mystery of the Golden Age and won't disappoint, but her best work was yet to come."},{"Title":"Artists in Crime (Inspector Alleyn)","review":"I generally don't read much narrative prose, but I do enjoy a good murder mystery, especially of the old &quot;who dunnit&quot; genre. This is certainly one of those. Marsh is a superb teller of tales, creating colorful characters with a greater sense of depth and motivation than does Christie, with whom she was contemporary. She shares with Christie that unfailable ability to devise an unusual end for the victim and a strict adherence to the &quot;rules&quot; of genre--they don't cheat by some manipulation of their plot to make it virtually impossible to find the solution--something about which the writers of the Ellery Queen series, for instance, were not always scrupulous. I find myself satisfied at the end that I was truely fooled, not simply bamboozled, when I read Marsh, and this book was no exception. I also find that I learn something from Marsh: information about social attitudes--some of those expressed in the 30's sounded very familiar--about the theater, about the world in general. This one was especially satisfying in that I had a small bit of arcane knowledge at my disposal that helped me solve the mystery. Instead of feeling the solution was too easy, I could congratulate myself on being aware of oddities and of having a broad background of experiences and knowledge. For the reader who enjoys a &quot;vacation&quot; and a &quot;trip abroad&quot; and into the past, this is certainly the book for you.

When he returns to the UK to stay with his widowed mother for a short time he is asked to investigate a murder at Troy's house a few miles away.Sonia - an artist's model - has been murdered in very ingenious way. All the artists studying with her are suspects - including Troy herself. Alleyn finds this very difficult to deal with as he is increasingly attracted to the prickly Troy and doesn't want to find out she has committed murder.This is a very well plotted mystery which will keep readers guessing for quite a while. I failed completely to work out what had happened and who was responsible. When you look back then it is easy to see that the clues were there. I thought the artists' colony atmosphere was well drawn as were the artists themselves with their various temperaments.This may be a crime novel without much graphic violence but the worst aspects of human nature are not glossed over. \`Artists in Crime' is an enjoyable well written mystery with some likeable police characters and an interesting insight into Alleyn's relationship with his mother."},{"Title":"Artists in Crime (Inspector Alleyn)","review":"First Sentence: Alleyn leant over the deck-rail, looking at the wet brown wharf and the upturned faces of the people.Inspector Roderick Alleyn, while traveling aboard ship from Australia meets well-known artist Agatha Troy.

It's an investigation about which he has mixed feelings as the murder happened at the art school of Ms. Troy, a short distance from his mother's home.I enjoy reading books set in the Golden Age between the Wars. To me, it's always interesting to see the difference in relationships, society, and vocabulary. Rather than viewing a book as being \\"dated,\\" I view it as a look at a not-so-distant past time. I also enjoyed this particular book as it is the beginning of the relationship between Alleyn and Troy, but enjoyed the relationships of all the characters and loved Alleyn's mother. The mystery is classic; a large cast of suspects, many with quite good motives for having committed the murder and then watching the police sort out the clues. Although the clues are there for the reader to solve the crime, I missed one for the solution to the twist.

Scales of justice and this book. I was very dissapointed. These books are very difficult to read because of a) use of old and pretenious language; who of you know what a tarradiddle is or doggo? Who is comfortable when a man of forty and his mother call each other darlings and the son grips the arm of his co-worker and calls him a courtier because he praises the mother for being a good host? The talk between the co-worker and Alleyn is almost as uncomfortable as the talk between Alleyn and his mother, why does he call a man whose name is Fox, Foxkin or Brer Foxkin? I looked this up in the dictionary and all I could find is that Foxkin might relate to lamkin (yugh) It is like calling a lover or a little boy a pet name. Finally there are sentences which are all but unforgiveable, such as: \\"when he looked at her tear stained little face he could hardly refrain from kissing her\\" or some such crap. No Ngaio is not an exciting read, language is stilted, affected and incomprehensible to anyone outside of Britain I would imagine. b) The second and more important reason for not reading Marsh is that the characters are so boring, stand-offish and childish that you hurry through the end, not to know \\"who done it\\" but to get away from their presence. And c) finally it becomes painfully obvious that Marsh would rather spoil the end than have the criminal be one of the gents. A \\"do not buy\\", unless you are British and remember when you had a governess. Marsh's time has come and gone, gone a long time ago.

I didn't think it could top Boughton Cobb's guide in the Peterson series. I was genuinely surprised by what I found. Mickel's book is superior in several ways. The drawings of fern anatomy are cleaner, letting the neophyte focus on the important features of fern identification. Range maps (missing from Cobb's book) let you eliminate species not in your area. And being a more recent publication, Mickel's taxonomic treatment is more up-to-date. However, I miss Boughton Cobb's outline drawings of fern blades, which are really neat for developing a general search image for species. That's why I keep both guides handy. You can never own enough field guides."},{"Title":"How to Know the Ferns and Fern Allies (The Pictured Key Nature Series)","review":"When a friend first introduced me to John Mickel's &quot;How to know the ferns and fern allies&quot; I was skeptical that Boughton Cobb's book (in the Peterson's series) could be bested.

This book is somewhat outdated but is certainly a must read for the language enthusiast."},{"Title":"The Miracle of Language","review":"This book is about the English language, it's nature, history & development (including urban legends of etymologies), & how it is taught. The author makes a good case that English, like Chinese, is a distributive language (word positioning determines meaning) vs. Latin et al which are inflective languages (word endings, such as cases, determine meaning). p. 152: \\"Any careful examination of the so-called parts of speech will reveal that they mean very little...They do not reveal the functioning of Modern English. The grammar of an inflected language, Latin, has been forced upon a distributed language, English, which has been wrenched in an attempt to make it fit the alien grammar.\\" Therefore, it is absurd to judge English by Latin standards & educators should modify their methods of teaching English to reflect this. Educators should admit that p. 219: \\"Words mean what they mean by common consent, so a given spelling, pronunciation, or construction is \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\" depending upon its currency\\" & p. 218: \\"Adjectives often cannot be distinguished from adverbs & that words like up, out, off & by are frequently not prepositions but some part of the verb or complement.\\" Furthermore, he argues that English has by far the most words, the greatest flexibility & precision, & virtually the only books of synonyms reflecting this-- p. 54: \\"Most speakers of other languages are not aware that such books exist.\\" Furthermore, p. 236: \\"A movement from inflection as a grammatical device toward distribution seems to be a movement toward a modern world\\" & p. 238: \\"English has by all odds the best prospect of becoming a world language.\\" He points out that historically, languages follow financial success vs. political success; daily usage (e.g. Anglo-Saxon) triumphs over political conquest (Norman French). As he perceptively notes: p. 17: \\"If language is intimately related to being human, then when we study language we are, to a remarkable degree, studying human nature. Similarly we may expect language to be what it is because human beings are what they are.\\" Overall, the book is easy to read, has many interesting anecdotes & stories, & has a valuable, practical, viable message.

But don't worry, she made him suffer just enough for love to still prevail in the end. Here's what it says in the back cover:Could love exist without trust?Kathryn had been joyously anticipating her ' wedding to Rex Kingersby... until she found him, one week before their wedding, in bed with his secretary!Horrified, she returned his ring. Kathryn couldn't have known then that Rex's injuries in an accident would prevent the truth from coming out--that she'd be accused of callously jilting Rex!Nate Kingersby, Rex's older brother, was another surprise. He regarded her action as an insult to his brother and family--for which Kathryn must suffer.MY THOUGHTS: Well the back cover kind of tells you the whole story already. I already knew that the hero was going to be cruel to her so I didn't hate him too much. I liked the story because it was not boring and the story just flowed. Even though the heroine was a virgin and later was callously used and \\"devirginized\\" by the hero, she was not some pansy who just moped about it. She definitely gave the hero hell and made him suffer before letting love prevail LOL. I don't like previous heroines who just easily forgave the hero despite his wrongdoings and all that. Although he was really a cruel son of a gun with a diabolical plan for the heroine he was redeemed later because he REALLY repented and showed the heroine that he really really loved her and will do anything for her forgiveness (awww!! just read the book and you'll know what I mean!) BUT he did not look weak at all and the hero still maintained his arrogant cool self machismo LOL. And the heroine gave him good. It was just the right timing when she decided to forgave him in the story and it didn't look forced because the author had to end the story already. The only thing I didn't like about the story was that I would have liked the heroine to have met her ex-fiance face to face at the end. I wasn't really satisfied with the letter that the ex-fiance gave as a \\"closure\\". The happy ending description at the end in regards to the wedding also was a little rushed but I do understand that Harlequin have a set number of pages. But other than those minor things, I loved it and I actually kept re-reading certain pages especially the \\"on the way of betrayal\\" and the \\"revelation\\" at the end because of the \\"awwww feeling\\" so I can say that there is re-read value for this book.

However, by reading the book, you will know with certainty when you need a lawyer and when you don't. Furthermore, by reading the book, you will know exactly what the lawyer should be doing and your prior knowledge will save fees, if in no other way than saving the lawyer from having to explain all the legalise to you.As an example of when you should consult a lawyer, Ms. Clement clearly states that if a couple has an estate valued over $1,350,000 (per couple), one should consult an estate planning lawyer so as to minimize Federal and State inheritance taxes. But for most estates, the forms provided in the book will work just fine.Where State laws vary, there is a list covering each variance so that one need not worry about any of the documents not being valid in the state in which he or she resides.At the beginning of each chapter there is a brief statement of what that chapter covers which tells you whether you even have to read that chapter or not. In addition, simplified questions and answers make it very easy for anyone to follow the suggestions and plan what to do.There is an excellent, easy, method of evaluating your estate so that you know what you are dealing with and whether you will have any estate tax problems. This should be done by everyone, whether using a lawyer or not (it, again, saves much time with the lawyer).Most of us put off this sad chore. Doing so can lead to very unpleasant consequences, including having children raised by strangers; inability to access what we think are liquid funds as well as other assets; and most important in today's world, being kept alive by artificial means when you may not want to be kept alive (without proper documents you will be and nothing can change it.)Reading this book and following the simple instructions can give one peace of mind about their final days, and the days after their death."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"A young Englishwoman's \\"coming of age\\", E.M.

Should she bow to society's \\"rules\\" of 'proper' women of her day, and marry the stuffy and priggish Cecil Vyse back in England, a wealthy and learned gentleman who embodies all things viewed with favour in England's high class society. Or should she follow her heart and marry the broad-minded and genuine, yet penniless, George Emerson?Forster's delicate and playful story-telling spirits us from an escapade through in the cobble-stoned alleyways of Florence and the lush fields of Tuscany, to the ceremonious rigidity of English lawn parties and drawing rooms. 'A Room With A View' is brought alive by the impetus of a perceptive and contemplative mind. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"At its core, \\"A Room with A View\\" is a simple, pleasant romantic comedy, no less predictable and sentimental than many books in the genre. But this is E. M. Forster, who suffuses his story with both droll dialogue and a satirical touch that somehow manages to be simultaneously lighthearted and acidic.Lucy Honeychurch is the young British heroine who visits Florence with her prim, proper, and priggish older cousin. (Even before I saw the Merchant-Ivory movie, I imagined Maggie Smith in the latter role.) Early in the book, two events shatter Lucy's oppressive Victorian facade: first, she witnesses a murder on the streets of Florence, and then George, a carefree, young man staying in the same pensione, spontaneously and forwardly kisses her in a meadow.Following her \\"embarrassment,\\" Lucy returns to England and becomes engaged to Cecil, an appropriately named cad whose stiffness and artificiality exceed even those of her cousin and who \\"should know no one intimately, least of all a woman.\\" Soon after the engagement, Lucy's newly respectable life is thrown into disarray once again when George and his father become neighbors. \\"It is Fate that I am here,\\" exclaims George to a minister friend with a rationalistic bent, \\"but you can call it Italy if it makes you less unhappy.\\"Into this formula, Forster blends both social satire and political themes. The novel's political views are far less developed and serve more to define the characters than to present the struggle between aristocratic affectations and democratic (even socialist) principles. Most comically, Cecil's overt professions in favor of egalitarianism are little more than a patronizing, haughty, and occasionally cruel pose.The social satire, however, is integral to the book: skewering the \\"mediaeval\\" pretensions of Victorian England, he portrays Cecil as \\"the type who's kept Europe back for a thousand years\\" and George as the progressive visionary who decries the brutish \\"desire to govern a woman\\" and argues for a world in which \\"men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden.\\" Lucy finds herself caught between their nineteenth- and twentieth-century views; it's an unfair struggle between those who long to remain mired in the past and those who march bravely into the future."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"A witty comedy with literature beauty which is expressed through the clever exchanges, personal thoughts and philosophic lines (but not causing your temple to creased). Lucy Honeychurch, a young girl from a bourgeois middle-up class, decided to look at the world by visiting Florence in spring time, chaperoned by her elder cousin, Miss Charlotte Bartlett. What was started by an argument about a room with a view developed into an impulsive kiss from George Emerson amid the violets thus ended the Florence period in a flight to Rome, away from the 'bold' suitor.Now, George Emerson was not a brackish bold person. He was just a passionate one, who had deep feelings about anything and was in a distress mood over 'everything doesn't fit' and there was no reason for him to enjoy life, though he didn't intend to commit suicide. While his father is an outright-spoken person which didn't fit nicely with English stiff etiquette style. Together, they were misfits among English tourists in Florence's Bertolini Pension. But a murder scene just took place right before Lucy's eyes and George, coincidentally, was able to help her away from the mass. From then on, his dour view of the world was changed and he discovered the wanting to live his life and Lucy found some extend of the deep emotion of a George Emerson.His impulse to kiss Lucy is understandable for a passionate guy, who was unprepared, caught the most beautiful sight of a lovely Lucy, who had revived him, among the violet blooming on the hill where you can have the best view of Florence. But unfortunately, the kiss was also seen by Miss Bartlett and that certainly put a chaos feeling to Lucy. Being forbidden to tell the accident to her mother or anyone else and fled to Rome the very next day, she did not have time to think her feeling over and quickly countered and proposed by Cecil Vyse, the son of her mother high society acquaintance in Rome.The uncertainty, self-denial and buried feeling masked all her actions. The frivolity and passionate spirit that loved the Beethoven music just went under beneath the hypocrisy of 'clever' society standard. Would she discover her true self and feeling at the right time? Or should George go back to his previous gloomy state? What would the so called clever society think?Find the funny but thoughtful lines in between and be invigorated by Beethoven!"},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"One of Forster's earliest novels, Room with a View generally lacks the depth and literary importance that his later works justifiably claim. Nonetheless, it is astute, enjoyable, concise, and incredibly funny. A first reading isn't enough, really; I've read through the novel several times, and each time I find a new level of meaning, a new, ever more subtle layer of humor or sadness or pathos. What seems on the surface to be merely a cute story of a delayed romance turns out to be, on further inspection, a witty and relevant critique of English society and latent Victorian values."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"We are spoiled by modern fiction. As great as the writing is, it is more straightforward and literal. Do you ever find yourself starting a classic and not finishing it??? You weren't getting into it immediately and lost interest. It can be the same with old movies. We watch through different eyes than the time when it was written or produced. My book club did this book this month. We all struggled. I chose this one because I wanted us to try a classic, but I wanted it to be short and pleasant. The \\"flow\\" started later, and it was more laboured to get there.It is so worth it to keep with it. It is not that we are not capable of understanding the language. We are so used to graphic, and explicit, and straightforward language. We need to train our brains, and it can take up to half the book to get to the point where you are really drawn in, forgetting to concentrate and just enjoying the ride.This is truly a lovely story. I love Florence. It is a timeless city that infects you body and soul. So will this book if you let it."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"It's hard to know which to praise more, E. M. Forester's witty comedy of manners, or Joanna David's nuanced and entertaining reading of the book. Clearly, the combination of the two is that rare marriage of great writing brought to life by a talented actress. If you only listen to one audio CD this year, you would do well to make it this one.Forester writes about an England that is long gone . . . but not forgotten. The middle class has its wits and its respectability to defend itself from the vagaries of a challenging world. Naturally, the middle class prefers its own company and so-called manners are merely an excuse to keep everyone else at bay. The absurdity of this way of living is highlighted when Forester takes a young Englishwoman, Lucy Honeychurch (don't you love that name?), off for a trip to Florence in the company of her maiden cousin, Charlotte, who also serves as chaperone.A variety of English tourists are gathered in a small Italian pensione in Florence when Lucy and Charlotte arrive. Both women had asked for and been promised rooms with a view. Upon arrival, they got just the opposite. Complaining over dinner about this, two men, a father and his son, immediately offer to exchange rooms. This offer breaks most rules of good manners at the time, and the women turn down the kind, well-intentioned offer. Thus far can manners cause one to go against one's best interests. During their time in Florence, the women find themselves confounded and redirected by the honest helpfulness of the Emerson men. But the familiarity raises dangerous challenges for Lucy, and she flees their company.The rest of the story looks at the consequences of the flight and focuses on Lucy's attempts to find a way of life that makes sense for her . . . rather than being a slave to social convention.Describing the story's plot doesn't do justice to the witty satires and ironic comments about the pompously respectable. It's a delicious romp, and Ms. David makes it all the more so.If you are like me, you'll find yourself racing to the end to find out what Lucy does with herself."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Forster's turn-of-the-century novel about British snobbery opens in the Renaissance mecca of Florence, Italy, where middle-class tourists clash with both passionate natives and judgmental expatriots. Chaperoned by her prim cousin Charlotte, young Lucy Honeychurch finds herself closely guarded and overprotected in what should be an Italian paradise. Struggling to be reborn--as a living and compassionate being--she is shocked at the rituals of propriety daily served before her naive eyes. Whom to cultivate, whom to snub, what is and is not appropriate behavior vie for dominance in her gentle soul, as she is obliged to surrender her neophyte will to please demanding elders.Much worse still Lucy is not permitted--nor does she permit herself--to explore the forbidden territories of her own heart. The examples of unrestrained natives and a bold kiss among the violet-covered hills of Fiesole result in their precipitous departure for Rome, but continue to haunt her memory for a year. The Emersons (father and son) prove new inpsiration in Lucy's circumscribed social milieu. Against her better judgment she is charmed by their disingenuous manners and the expression of frank feelings. Inspite of her inflexible upbringing, her mind is fascinated, even if her heart does not feel attached, by the father's unselfish kindness and the son's eager grasp of life. Their unusual philosophies and behavior throw fresh air into the drafty corridors of contstraint in which she has been reared.It all starts with the Emersons' courteous offer to exchange their own rooms in the pensione, so that the ladies might enjoy a room with a View of glorious Florence. It takes Lucy one year to realize that her own life has needed a clear view, which she can only obtain through George Emerson. Evenback in England the Emersons inadvertantly displace two elderly ladies as tenants when they rent a villa near Lucy's home. How did poor Lucy ever come to be engaged to a boor like Cecil, with his limited world view of masculine control and maternal domination? Lucy can not imagine him unless he is inside a room, without a view, while he rightly considers her a living view of the world. Lucy is dishonest in denying her growing attraction to George; both of them individually plan to flee the anguish of frustred, forbidden proximity. Then there is the ubiquitous poor relation, Charlotte, meddling, bungling, misunderstanding and misdirecting Lucy's little life--Despite the best intentions. Will Lucy realize her error before it is too late? A quiet, insightful read which will charm students of Edwardian England and the human heart."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"A short, pleasant read, which is also very satisfying - I read it as a palette cleanser, so to speak, between Great Expectations and Crime & Punishment, which is not to say it's by any means a frivolous piece of fiction.

The many references to Italian culture and British politics in the beginning confused me and made it hard to get into. However, after a little research, I understood the story better and really liked it. Get past the beginning, and you'll be fine. Forster presents very relatable characters in this story: characters trying to discover the meaning of life and feeling. He presents great ideas in this book about happiness and love. The text can be somewhat hard to understand at times; I would keep a dictionary handy.

Lucy and her cousin Charlotte are offered rooms with a view of Florence by a Mr. Emerson and his son, who are willing to exchange. The strict and pinched Miss Bartlett does not wish to have an obligation to the Emersons, who are deemed less than polite society will condone. Their rector, Mr. Beebe, tells them he believes the exchange is proper and the ladies get their view of Florence. It becomes clear that Lucy herself wants a view of LIFE and later confesses to her fiance, a priggy intellectual, that she imagines him always in a room with no windows, with no view.

The author himself over-egged the pudding somewhat by inserting far too many personal observations,which bordered at times on pomposity, seemingly to try to point the reader in the direction he/she is meant to think. But amongst it there was a nugget of truth, which shone above all else - \\"Though you...never see him again, or forget his very name, (he) will work in your thoughts till you die. It isn't possible to love and to part. You will wish that it was. You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you. I know by experience that the poets are right: love is eternal.\\" (p.223 Penguin Classics edition). For this alone, the trudge was worth it."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"In Forster's A Room with a View, sheltered young Lucy Honeychurch (what a name!), traveling abroad with her spinster aunt, happens to meet George Emerson and his doting father. Lucy is not quite sure what to make of the pair, as they seem kind enough but are unpolished in their manners and way of thinking. One morning, during a day trip to the mountains, George comes upon Lucy amidst a field of violets and impulsively kisses her.This indescretion is hurriedly hushed up, and Lucy returns to her home in England. There, she becomes engaged to a respectable young man, a good match by all social accounts, but with whom she has very little in common. Who should happen upon the scene but George Emerson? Lucy finds herself conflicted and confused, unsure of whether to make the socially advantageous match expected by her friends and family or to make a break with convention and think for herself a bit.While this novel starts out VERY slowly, it picks up speed as one goes along, providing a very satisfying ending. Lucy is so intolerable at the beginning of the book that it is difficult to keep reading, but, thankfully, as she becomes more in command of her own thoughts, she is much easier to relate to. (I find this often with female characters in \\"classic\\" literature. It is all one can do to keep from shaking them by the shoulders sometimes. I understand that women were more repressed - oppressed?- when these stories were written, but it can be awfully trying for a modern woman to read such characters. In that respect, reading contemporary novels is sometimes easier.)I also found the novel's debate about expatriates/natives versus tourists interesting, as the same arguments are traded around travel circles today - i.e. the \\"ugly American,\\" those who are inseparable from their guidebooks, etc. It's funny to see that people's views on such a subject have really changed very little in the past 100 years!Though some of this novel is set in Italy, do not expect much of the rich, atmospheric descriptive passages one would hope to find in a contemporary novel of this sort. During the primary character's time there, she is still very much mentally confined, and because we are seeing things through her vision, the novel is more concerned that she see the \\"right\\" paintings and statues so that she can say she's seen them. Eeesh.At any rate, this book is certainly worth reading. I found it to be a pointed social comment on the mores of of the time."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"\\"A Room with a View\\" is a novel that is thoroughly enjoyable from the first page to the last.

I thought that this book was great because the style of writing had it set up so that the scenery and the characters come to life. The author writes about England's pastime. The book kind of gives you a gut feeling to find out what happens at the very end. The story also has a bit of comedy in it, which is very enjoyable. Now in this story, there is a man named George Emerson. George Emerson is a really passionate guy, who fell in love with a girl named Lucy unprepared from the first site. Now the whole story basically revolves around Lucy and her family. The story portrays Lucy and her family's everyday life. The whole story has an easy to follow plot, and many symbolic views of the characters.

His story speaks of a young girl by the name of Lucy and her struggle to understand the people around her and her views of the world. She grew up in a family where looks, style, and behavior is what determined the person. People had to be sophisticated and seem almost perfect. When Lucy travels to Italy with her cousin, she meets a man by the name of Mr. Emerson. His ways seem strange to her. He is simple, indifferent of what people might say about him. Lucy tries to ignore his, but her feelings are even more confused when she encounters the young George Emerson, the son of Mr. Emerson, and falls in love with him, something she could not admit for very long. Lucy comes back home to Windy Corner in England and is engaged to Cecil Vyse, a sophisticated and well-bred young man. Everything seems calm, until the Emersons move into Windy Corner as well. Lucy is lost, scared, and embarrassed, but slowly she realizes what she must do. Finally understanding that Cecil, who is too bland and \\"perfect\\", is not right for her, she breaks off the engagement and finds true love and true life with the right person -- George, who is in love with her even since they meet in Italy.Besides the plot of the story, there is a deeper meaning to what Lucy went through. The book was written almost a century ago, so some concepts are lost to us, but the theme is still applied to us. Lucy wanted to know how to be and how others should be. She didn't know what was right and what was wrong. Isn't this something many people, especially teenagers, go through? It isn't exactly the same, but we all wonder how we should be and how others should act. Lucy felt that Cecil did not give her freedom and helped her do everything to make it the way he wants it--perfect. Many of us feel that too--in a relationship with someone, with friends, and with parents. Although it is written in a strange way, this book shows some struggles people of any time in history go through. Our appearance, our actions, our behavior... We question all of it and hopefully find right answers.The thing that really caught my attention about this book was the descriptions of various places the author used. Forster actually traveled to Italy before writing A Room with a View which is another addition to his vivid and somewhat poetic words. Lucy's first morning in Italy was in a room \\"with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini sport in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons.\\" As she opened the window, she leaned \\"out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees and marble churches opposite, and close below, the Arno, gurgling against the embankment of the road.\\" The autumn in the Windy Corner, Lucy's home, \\"approached, breaking up the monotony of summer, touching parks with the grey bloom of mist, the beech-trees with russet, the oak-trees with gold. Up on the heights, bettaliens of black pines witnessed the change, themselves unchangeable.\\" The author describes so well \\"the pine-woods, the deep lakes of bracken, the crimson leaves that spotted the hurt-bushes, the serviceable beauty of the turnpike road.\\" His words seem simple, but together they come to create a picture of a world that you can feel. If you carefully read the passages of the descriptions, you somewhat sink into them, thinking you're almost there. Forster also knew how to put someone's feelings onto the paper. When Lucy frowned, lost in her emotions, he described her as \\"a brave child\\" who \\"frowns when he is trying not to cry\\". The simplicity of these words is what paints the picture of Lucy, trying to be strong and fight her troubles. I believe that E. M. Forster is an extraordinary writer who's words are unique, simple, and yet mysterious poetic.As in almost any book, this one also has a down side. Since A Room with a View was written almost a century ago, its concepts might be somewhat strange to us. Also it is written in a way that is difficult to read, especially for younger people. Sometimes you can miss minor details as the text is unclear or too complicated. These might be the reasons why this book is hard to get into. When I started reading the first few chapters, I thought it would be a bore and a burden to finish this book. It went on better and easier to read though, especially as the plot of the story developed. The key is to have some patience with this book at the start.A Room with a View is a book that may seem different and boring at first, but overall it is an interesting piece of literature. The places described inside make the book very vivid and it nicely shows the way people looked at each other many years ago. Its concepts--the way people judge each other and treat each other is something we can all think about and relate to. Whether you're a teen or an adult, after finishing the book, you won't consider reading it a waste of time.

After reading it again recently, all the subtle humor and irony behind what seems to be just a simple love story was still there.This is one of English literature's lost work. The subtle love that George first expresses towards Lucy after holding her head in his lap after she faints was powerful. All he did was hold her, but the strong and foreign love he has for her can be felt.When they go out to the country with a few other friends, you can feel how nervous George was, not even talking to anyone and just fidgiting, avoiding Lucy's brillant eyes.The story then climaxes when he just strolls up to Lucy in a field of tall weeds and kisses her.

Forster's &quot;A Room with a View&quot; is a romantic comedy, and as such, it follows the typical formula of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy wins girl. This basic plot is, of course, embellished with a lot of comical characters, exotic settings, and convenient misunderstandings, but none of this mollifies my opinion that the novel, although well-written, is not very interesting.Two fussy English women, the nubile Lucy Honeychurch and her older cousin Charlotte Bartlett, are staying in a small hotel (a pension) in Florence, Italy. There they meet the Emersons, a father and son, who do not seem to have much money and are hinted to be &quot;Socialists,&quot; which reflects a prejudice on the part of the allegers and doesn't even really mean anything within the novel's scope. Lucy has a brief romance with the son, George, even though she knows he is not quite suitable for her social status. A few other characters also are introduced in Florence, including two clergymen, Mr. Beebe and Mr. Eager, and a romance novelist named Miss Lavish.The action shifts back to England, where we meet Lucy's doting mother and frivolous, immature brother Freddy, who could be a progenitor for P.G. Wodehouse's aristocratic loafers. Lucy is courted by a snobbish young man named Cecil Vyse whom she has known for a few years and accepts his proposal for marriage. Trouble arises when George Emerson and his father show up as tenants in a nearby cottage, and Lucy must decide whether she is going to submit to social convention and marry Cecil or follow her heart and go with George. Care to take a wild guess about the outcome?Forster obviously intended this novel to be a comedy, but his humor is stilted and contrived. There are subtle jokes about English class distinction, blatantly symbolic surnames that sound like they came from the board game &quot;Clue,&quot; juxtaposed sentences that purposely contradict each other for the sake of painfully overt irony, and satirical snippets that affect Oscar Wilde-style wittiness. The novel's humoristic tour de force is a scene in which Cecil remains oblivious to the fact that Lucy and George had a fling in Italy, even though he reads a direct account of it in a novel penned by Miss Lavish, who fortunately has disguised the names of her hero and heroine. Simply put, the book is as funny as burnt toast.Colorful but predictable and simplistic, &quot;A Room with a View&quot; may have been an important Edwardian novel, but it seems innocuous compared to the hard realism and bold sexuality of D.H. Lawrence's imminent works. Even the author himself acknowledges the novel's fabrications when he allows Mr. Beebe to state, &quot;It is odd how we of that Pension, who seemed such a fortuitous collection, have been working into one another's lives.&quot; Funny, I was thinking the same thing."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"A rich and scandalous story of a young woman who falls in love with a solemn, clumsy sort of man in his arms, literally.Oddly enough I don't see any hype in this book, which is the best thing, no hype."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Though a romantic story with good character development and scene painting, it can be difficult to enjoy if the main character is inconsistent throughout.

She is indecisive and is making everyone miserable, when finally some odd man with absurd philosophies pushes her to make a decision which, our author tries to convince us, was the correct one. Here is the message: It is perfectly fine to lie to everyone. After you have dodged them, hurt them, and confused them, \\"it will all come right in the end\\" and you will live happily ever after. The message appeals well to an age of utter selfishness. Our heroine shows some sign of repentance: He will never forgive us.

Throughout the book, we see Lucy start to develop a sense of independence and passion by following her heart. I think E.M. Forster does a great job of reflecting the 18th century in this book. Through Lucy he portrayed a woman's strength and a woman's changing role in society. This was also happening at the time in the 18th century to many other women. In this novel, social class is a huge factor in teaching us not to be judgmental or obey the unfair rules of society.This novel teaches us to think for ourselves just as Lucy did. Lucy meets a man of lower rank than she was. His name is George Emerson. He teaches her the things in life that are important such as her musical talents. He shows her the truth, and passion that she soon with discover. Nature is also conveyed widely in this book. Forster does a great job of connecting man and nature showing how they affect each other. Forster teaches us the lesson that man cannot be taken from his natural state. When the novel ends, we see how man and nature are all tied together. With the help of many people and by traveling to Italy, Lucy finally grows into a strong woman. She is now passionate, independent, and aware of what she wants. This book takes the reader through the adventure of a young woman's struggle with her heart, and with the society."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"A very chatty book with little description and almost all dialog. I found it difficult to maintain momentum through the rivers of Victorian mores on exhibit in this book. In sum, I found it dull and not enjoyable."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Do not buy this version. It is not formatted correctly for the Kindle. It has fixed line lengths which wrap awkwardly on the Kindle, making it very difficult to read."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"E.M.Forster is a semi-classical English writer, who produced numerous novels set in the early 20th century. Later, film director James Ivory (an American, strange as it may seem) made a career for himself by turning these books into movies. &quot;A Room with a View&quot; is what you could have called &quot;Proletarian literature&quot; in Soviet literary canon; only working-class setting is replaced by the British &quot;proper&quot; society, still unscathed by the Great War. I have a thing for this epoch, but Forster's book does not reflect its charm in the least. All because of its social message. No gripping plot, no character development, no psychological motivations. The only really enthralling thing is to observe to what degree did the English train their language to conceal feelings. It is what makes the books like Forster's or Ishiguro's &quot;Remains of the Day&quot; almost untranslatable. In Forster's case, though, no harm done."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I hate to be the one to write a bad review about this book, however I feel there is a lot of hype surrounding this classic that is not deserved. The plot is fairly simple, and very similar to that of Romeo and Juliet. The girl loves a rogue, but her parents want her to marry the spectacular man they like. Etc. Some scenes in this Edwardian book I agree or slightly amusing, but it is not worth the read."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"It is difficult to imagine a girl in the 21st century over-reacting to a rather innocent kiss, as is the case with the inciting event here. But this is exactly the situation a century ago with a girl from a respectable English family. And this is what makes the novel difficult to grasp for readers of our present day.Not all that much happens. There's the kiss and then a whole lot of agonizing over it, trying to hide news of it, pretending that it wasn't meaningful, to the point that the poor girl's life is in turmoil, her engagement to another is broken.The characters are wispy--we never quite see clear pictures of them. The dialogue is stilted by current standards. (Did people ever really talk that way?) The atmosphere of Florence, Italy, and semi-rural England is also a trifle wispy; the reader never quite feels as if he has benn taken along for the trip.There are great many annoying editorial intrusions in order to puff up this lame plot, and most of the actions are internal. I'm not saying that an explosion or a car chase would have been necessary, but something more might have happened. There is a murder, but it is of no consequence. All in all, I'd say the novel is just a tad over-rated. I believe it was Mark Twain who said that a classic was a book that people praised and no one read. Few people voluntarily, rather, in this case."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"A Room With a View is hardly what you could consider fine, classic literature. The plot runs off of a much more dramatic and insightful classic, Flaubert's Madame Bovary. The stories are the same: a woman, dissatisfied with her station in life, seeks happiness in an unorthodox way (namely a man) that entirely displeases her relatives and friends. The only difference is that Flaubert gives his heroine a realistically tragic end, while Forster opts for the happy, fairytale finale.It is this unoriginality, lack of plot depth, and dialogue reminiscent of a Hans Christian Anderson story that makes A Room With a View dissatisfying. Forster obviously felt the need to contribute a story that, with its tiresome protagonists and only somewhat interesting antagonists, would teach future writers one thing: change a famous writer's denouement around and you can gain all the fame and merit you could want off one piece of literature.Holly Burke, PhD.Georgetown U."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"If you like Dirty Harry, Terminator or Rocky, don't read this book!!!

Skip this one and go on to The Great Gatsby."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I LOVE this novel and the Merchant Ivory film of the same name, which I would give 10 stars! The film, by the way, is very faithful to the book. Anyway, I was extremely delighted by this story when I first read it long ago after seeing the film, and my impression of it has not changed with time. This is a parody of prim and proper English society, something the author E. M. Forster specialized in. For a novel written in 1907, this is an extremely easy read, nothing like a Henry James novel.The plot concerns a young woman named Lucy who goes to Italy on holiday chaperoned by her older spinster cousin, Charlotte. Lucy meets a handsome young guy named George, but he seems a bit odd and eccentric, and she doesn't quite know what to think of him. He takes her by surprise by walking up to her and kissing her in a secluded open field. Charlotte happens to see this and is determined not to let it go any further. You see, Lucy is already engaged to a snobby twit named Sistel back in England! But in the end, Lucy follows her heart.Ah man, I just love this story. See the movie and then read the book.David Rehakauthor of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;"},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"If you are the one who loves reading love story, this book is an interesting one. It gives a clear picture of middle-class life in England one hundred years ago. You will see the importance that was given to social position and appropriated behaviour. Moreover,its grammas are good. It appropriate for children who want to practise their gramma. This book is about the girl who struggle to make sense of her feelings towards the two very different men in her life.Let's find out what she is going to do with her life."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"A Room with a View revolves around a young woman, Lucy Honeychurch, who lives in England. The story is about the daily life of Lucy and her family and the few adventures Lucy partakes in, some with acquaintances which she meets on a few month excursion. She takes a trip to Florence, Italy to discover a cultural world outside of England, but instead, discovers a new side of her self that, when she returns home, she misses and finds herself wanting to revisit. Lucy encounters many new things and unorthodox people in Italy whom she tries to understand and finds she cannot. A startling romantic incident during her trip causes Lucy to become puzzled and contemplative. When she returns home, she is immediately engaged to a family friend, Cecil Vyse, who is a young man who disapproves of her family yet seems to think she is quite appealing. Soon, though, some individuals, out of complete chance, come to live on Summer Street, near her home, and soon the enigmatic emotions she experienced on her summer vacation are back to haunt her. Lucy has a choice to make which consumes her and makes her seem very troubled to her family. A Room with a View is considering a comedy because it's numerous satirical suggestions towards society and it's quirky, but well developed, characters. It is a short, refreshing read which has an easy-to-follow plot, and yet incorporates philosophical and symbolic views of the lives of the characters. Many people can enjoy this novella, and even might find the author's expansive and comedic vocabulary entertaining."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Wonderful book, wonderful movie, wonderful book-on-tape.This classic by E. M. Forster is full of wicked humor that punctures the 19th century English class system. Superb cameo pieces. The character development is subtle and sure, beginning with our heroine traveling to Italy with her maiden aunt as chaperone. There, in a pensione, she meets an iconoclastic father and son, honest, rough-hewn, plain-spoken, who insist upon trading rooms when they overhear the prim aunt complaining that she booked a room with a view. It, of course, becomes a metaphor for room to view life as a whole, without prejudice, in all its wonderful complexity.Don't miss this excellent book by this excellent author. Then read all his others, if you haven't already done so."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"This short novel by Forster exposes the confusion (or what some might term 'hypocrisy') of Victorian society in turn-of-the century England.The story displays countless instances of the oppressive strictures of Victorian society. Lucia's companion becomes flustered when offered the kindness of a better room (with a view)- as the offer comes from persons of a lower caste. This offer is met not with gratitude, but with befuddlement (what is one to do in this situation?), and Miss Bartlett (?) affects indignation, recognizing this to be the proper 'feeling' when put upon by the presumptuous lower bourgeoisie. Further offense is given by Mr. Vyse's practical joke: the letting of a property to a lower class of people amidst the elite. Adn the most tragic bewilderment is Lucia's refusal to recognize her love for George: this sentiment being improper, she laboriously attempts to come up with another name for this sentiment, or to identify and name a passion that a lower caste could properly induce in her. The roles that the charcters force themselves into are humorous at times; and the temper of the times induces more pity than outrage."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"A Room with a View is what a romantic novel should be: light and fun, entertaining and sweet- I thoroughly enjoyed reading it!

It's about love that can't be ignored or stopped and it has a happy ending. I think that one of the things the author tries to say with this book is that you sometimes should do what your feelings tell you to do. Just because a thing has been considered right or wrong for a long time, doesn't always mean that it actually is.The main character, a young English girl, has a hard time trying to figure out what she really feels inside. She loves but she is not sure if it is right of her to do so. The old English thoughts and beliefs influence her very much, but when she manages to get rid of a few of them, she shows her feelings more openly and is not ashamed of them.I think this book is just as good as the old English classics, a well-written, overwhelming love-story"},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I didn't like this book. Short, written as gorgeously as anything else Forster wrote, there just isn't anything worthwhile going on.A comedy only because you laugh at how annoying everyone is, the story verges on outrage because nobody seems to matter. Oh, sure, they care desperately about everyone and everything they're supposed to be involved with, but the characters are pompous, the resolutions are forced or indifferent, and I can't say I recall much of anything that actually happened shortly after completing the text.Another thing to draw it down is the fact that I tended to think of other things while still reading this book. Not while it was set aside, waiting to be vaguely experienced, but while it was in front of my eyes going on.In spite of all this, three stars is accurate because sometimes Forster comes up with an accute anatomization of why these people act this way. A stirring, psychological portrait of people I couldn't care less about."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Never has such a book been written that combines with such artistry the romance and charm of Florence with the passionate love of two idealised and idealistic yet incredibly indeering charcters.

But you unless you are interest in social studies or the antrophological development of romance, you will find most of the situations downright silly. Maybe what particularly bothered me was that the writter did not make any significant effort to provide clues of why the characters fall in love. Actually, their attraction seems to be a mere infatution of inmature personalities, presented to the reader as a great romance."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Britain's answer to Henry James here provides us with the tale of Lucy Honeychurch and her forbidden love for George Emerson, the unsuitable young man she meets in Italy. While social mores dictate that she make a match with the more proper gentleman, Cecil Vyse, who is courting her, Lucy is torn between passion and propriety. Ultimately, she chooses Emerson who reminds her of &quot;a room with a view&quot; offering her a new vista on life.This is a comedy of manners, as we can see from the subtlety of characters names: Vyse represents the constricted vice-like society, Emerson is &quot;nature&quot; a la Ralph Waldo &amp; Thoureau. And, of course, the lesson we learn is that the entrenched morals of society should be thrown away in favor of passion &amp; the natural. This common theme of the top 100--we've seen it in Edith Wharton, &amp; others--seems even more moronic as we close the century, the elevation of passion over morality has never looked worse than in the wake of the Clinton scandals. Further, as we now know, this admonition must be read in light of Forster's own homosexuality, adding an altogether different cast to the call for discarding social convention.If you feel compelled to read Forster, I advise sticking to A Passage to India.GRADE: D"},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"It is okay.

The story itself involves several generations and portrays the contrast between two main cultures and lifestyles; one in the West, that is Britain, the other one in the south laid-back Mediterranean Europe, namely, Italy. The protagonist, a young lady, searches new experiences and heads for an adventure, whereas her older companions strive to make her think before she leaps, speak wisely and counsel her. So far, it looks as if their life is as it should be. However, things are not always as they seem at firts. The narrative takes some twists and turns and eventually the so-called generation gap starts to diminish, while the moral values are more or less reevaluated.

The plot may be relatively basic, but it's a medium for Forster to convey his message about how important it is to seek real love and connection.Instead of a cast of heroes and villains, Forster gives us a bunch of realistically drawn people. It would have been easy to make Miss Bartlett the butt of every joke or Cecil completely without redeeming qualities - but he doesn't do that. The point of the book isn't to transport you to Italy (in fact, I think he makes the point very well that the social and mental strictures of the characters put them in a sort of bubble that prevented them from authentically experiencing much of anything, no matter where they traveled)."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I'm not sure how a voracious reader like me missed this classic novel, but luckily, my book club picked it and I promptly downloaded the audio (narrator: Wanda McCaddon). I found myself immediately transported to Florence, italy, and completely captivated by the travails of young Lucy Honeychurch. Everything about this book is perfect: the descriptions of Florence and the muddy Arno (where I visited long ago and toured with my then-future husband); the stinging digs at tourists who go abroad only to stay clumped together with others of their same nationality (in my experience, tourists have not improved at all since Forster's time); the characters with their personal foibles, dreams and fears. Even the titles of the chapters are wonderful: \\"In Santa Croce with no Baedeker,\\" \\"Lucy as a Work of Art,\\" \\"Lying to Mr. Beebe, Mrs. Honeychurch, Freddy, and The Servants.\\" Many times I laughed out loud, often caught my breath at the beauty of particularly beautifully written passages, and constantly ached with longing to be young and in love again.

Honestly, I've always loved this book because it's a quick read and it's such a delightful little costume drama. Locations and characters are carefully developed and doted upon because the story keeps such a tight focus on Lucy, and the narrative never goes to melodrama. Yes, Merchant and Ivory made an excellent and faithful adaptation of a movie, but what it misses is Forster's omniscient point of view.

The conflict between social norms and individual behavior is well illustrated. The characters develop through the chapters, becoming familiar and human, even if they are not all lovable or psychologically deep. The limitations of being too conformist, aspiring or rational are shown. The heroine, Lucy, seeks personal growth through travel, experiences and music. She is unsure of herself as she grows, unsure of where she wants to go or how to get there. Yet, through the simple act of showing up and having a small amount of self-confidence and self-awareness, she does grow and achieve some of her ends. Forster's writing style is appealing and approachable. Both the particular details and the eternal themes resonate a century later. As noted by the critics, the plot is a bit erratic at times and relies upon improbable coincidences to weave the ending. Nonetheless, this is an easy read with several layers of depth and meaning."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I teach literature at the university level. I read E.M. Forster decades ago, and saw many of the films based on his books. (A Room with a View and Howard's End were excellent adaptations.) For some reason, after listening to a panel discussion on the radio about a new Forster biography, I decided to pick up a copy of A Room with A View. I found Forster's writing, in certain places, stiff and archaic (even when taking into account the time period), more so than (a much earlier) Austen's writing, perhaps because he is not quite as witty as she. However, the beauty and passion of the Lucy-George love story, and Forster's powerful philosophy of undying, truthful love that undergirds the story (primarily delivered in short speeches by the elder Mr. Emerson)overrides any twisted or cement-like sentences. Unlike some other readers, I felt terribly sad for and empathized with Cecil Vyse. I do not think he is a bad man; he is simply a different kind of man than George, and Forster makes a point of contrasting the two. However, another type of woman, not Lucy, might have found him quite fine. If you are a hopeless romantic, no matter your age, you will love this novel."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I listened to this on the Communter Library audio version, read by Wanda McCaddon. I didn't find that listed here at Amazon so I'm posting my review here. I did, however, want to give special praise to Ms. McCaddon's reading. I've listened to quite a few audio books and I've found that performance of the reader can add or detract from the words. Ms. McCaddon's readings of the old, the young, male or female are wonderful. I completely forgot that an actress was reading the lines.I had just finished another audio book of Edith Wharton's Age of Innocence. The theme is the same: the choice the protagonist must make between his feelings and his obligation to the social standing of his family. However in my opinion Forster's work is far superior in the sense of its quiet, subtle, gentle tone and its wisdom. He doesn't hit you over the head with the details of the social inequalities that poor Ms. Wharton did. She was certainly justified, given her personal experience but she loads you with so much verbiage that I found it much less interesting than this book.These characters are well rounded, not just stock types, as Wharton's were. Lucy appears to be a rather ordinary young girl but we see, through the perceptive comments of Mr. Beebe, that there are depths in her of which she is unaware. I appreciated Forster's portrayal of the rector, Mr. Beebe, avoiding all of the stereotypes of the English clergy of the time that one would easily fall into. Her mother, her cousin, Charlotte, and the amazing Emersons are all real people, with their faults as well as their virtues.There is so much wisdom, inserted in quiet ways in this little story that at times I wanted to pull my car over and write down a sentence. One of the gems that I did remember was Forster's remark that although Lucy's dilemma seemed to be a choice between personal feelings and the dictates of society, that it was really between reality and illusion! I had just this thought when I was listening to Wharton's book and was so happy to hear Forster articulate it.There is a lot of light hearted humor in the book, too. I loved the scene of the three fellows bathing in the pond. And the scene where George Emerson finds Lucy in the field of violets is amazing! No wonder he was gripped with passion...who could resist all those violets on a hillside in Florence?I'm sure I'm missing some of the othere virtues of this unpretentious but wise little book. Read some of the other excellent reviews. Better yet, read the book!"},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"The book itself gets 5 stars from me.This Kindle edition is atrocious - it is missing entire passages.

In that case, actual narrative seemed to be missing."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"A ROOM WITH A VIEW depicts a young Englishwoman's adventure trying to come to grips with the conflict between her desires and society's expectations. Lucy Honeychurch is a well-bred young middle class girl on holiday in radiant Florence. She comes from a family overconcerned with respectability and is therefore overprotected by a dessicated spinster named Charlotte Bartlett. One wonders if Forster had in mind a more famous Charlotte B. when he drew Lucy's protector, a woman \\"much discomfited by [any] unpleasant scene[s].\\" Forster playfully tosses barbs at this don't-let-the-servants-hear-you world the English try to maintain on foreign soil. Less playful with sanctimonious Puritans or hypocritical clergymen, Forster lets them foil themselves.Under no circumstances will Miss Bartlett allow Lucy to pursue (or even examine) her affection for the handsome young George Emerson--his father is far too unconventional with his modern notions about honesty and freethinking. Duty must reign . . . mustn't it? Ah, that wild transitional phase between the late-Victorians and the early-Moderns!Forster writes gently and calmly, but with a passion for life and love welling up beneath the surface. A ROOM WITH A VIEW is a lovely book, vital with the force of a sensitive and empathetic mind. There's even more to this book than it seems--highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Concerning Lucy's passionate playing of Beethoven upon the piano, the Rev. Mr. Beebe once said, &quot;If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays, it will be very exciting--both for us and for her.&quot; At the time of the remark, Lucy is a very conventional young woman, with perhaps occasional rebellious thoughts. The Emersons, father and son, are somehow not quite acceptable in her social circle, and though George is so bold as to kiss her impulsively, she is determined to forget him. Instead she finally gives in to the repeated proposals of Cecil Vyse, a thoroughly fashionable young gentleman, if not very exciting. So the stage is set for this splendid satire on the English social strata of the early part of the 20th century, a time when the formal structure of the Victorian era was beginning to fray at the edges. Vyse is a delightfully drawn male chauvinist prig; nobody likes him, but everyone is willing to accept him, and Lucy convinces herself that she is in love with him. However, Vyse's own penchant for getting his way by playing rather cruel practical jokes brings the Emersons back into the picture. Confronted by the contrast between the not quite classy but intelligent, thoughtful (and bold) George Emerson and the arrogant, boorish, but elite Cecil Vyse, Lucy finally decides to live as she plays Beethoven, with exciting results. This early work of Forster's is a pure delight, with a light and well-controlled tone throughout. Although there would be a danger of stereotyping to illustrate the different social classes, Forster skillfully makes the characters well rounded and unpredictable, as in the scene when Lucy breaks her engagement to Vyse, expecting his feelings of masculine superiority to precipitate an argument, but instead being somewhat dismayed when he behaves as a perfect gentleman. Although HOWARDS END is usually rated above A ROOM WITH A VIEW, I prefer this slighter, but consummately well-done, novel."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"This charming little novel which has recently celebrated its centennary can be easily put down as a period piece. E M Forster foresaw it already in his note which he added to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first edition. Yet a prospective reader would be most wrong to disregard it. There is a lesson here which still needs to be learned by many.The title gives away some of the content - the main heroine, Lucy Honeychurch, needs to get away from the stuffy atmosphere of late Victorian England in which she was brought up - the symbol of which is for EMF the room. Her escape takes place in stages - the first of them is her trip to Italy where she finds landscapes and people most different from those she was accustomed to. It is also there that she meets the man she falls in love with, George Emerson. Yet these changes come too quickly for her. Lucy yields to the demands of her chaperone and escapes back to England, finding on the way a more appropriate suitor, Cecil Vyse.When the three young people meet again in England, a fight for Lucy's soul begins anew. Lucy has to decide whether she prefers Cecil who will keep her under his protection in his house as a work of art for others to admire, or George with whom she will have to face the challenges of the world but be free.What is the lesson for us today in a world where there are neither chaperones nor stage-coaches? We also must make similar decisions - choose freedom which always comes at a cost or safety for which we must pay with our soul. We choose between being true to ourselves or satisfying the demands of others. Lucy's adventures may serve as a perfect food for thought for those facing seemingly dissimilar but actually very similar decisions. It is the more valuable as Forster does not show easy decisions or easy solutions. The happy ending never comes free and yet still it is worth striving for."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Best of all, this is one of the very very few books to be made into a movie and come out unscathed, perhaps even improved in certain aspects. If you can't stand to take a chance and read it, see the film at least.Yes, the premise is somewhat similar to Madame Bovary. However, I found the difference between them to be that I hated Mme. Bovary and adored A Room With a View. To clarify, there is a part in the latter where Forster, discussing some sonatas of Bethoveen writes, &quot;they can triumph or despair as the player decides, and Lucy had decided that they should triumph.&quot; Flaubert plays on the side of despair, while Forster, like his character, &quot;loved to play on the side of Victory.&quot;All of the characters are vividly drawn. They speak as real people speak and act as real people act, or once did. The language and mores have changed since the Victorian era, but they are motivated by similar things to those that motivate people today and they are fully-developed.Forster has the knack of describing his characters in a few well-turned sentences that tell you all you need to know to picture them. They get themselves into situations you can believe, and they do not always act in their own best interests, just like real life.I have re-read this book several times over the past 10 years, and what strikes me is how much detail Forster managed to sneak in with out making the book feel weighted or heavy. It is a light read, and yet every time I pick it up to reread it I find some new passage I had overlooked previously, each lovlier than the one before. He also makes some very interesting philosophical statements, without bogging down plot or pacing. Forster was obviously influenced by the Transcendentalists (Emerson, Thoreau), one of the main characters is even named Emerson, so if they are of interest to you, this may be as well."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"While not approaching the magnitude of A Passage to India, or even Howard's End, A Room with a View offers an entertaining enough, if not rare, look at the middle class British (traveler's) life. Consumed with the self-discipline and propriety dictated by the national character and emulation of the upper classes, Lucy Honeychurch finds herself between her stodgy cousin's checks and George Emerson's unconventional, bold, and straightforward sincerity. In the backdrop, just as in Howard's End, is the burgeoning realization of female identity and the possibility of greater freedoms.Forster creates rather familiar characters in the oppressed but promising Lucy, stuffy and financially dependent Charlotte, and traditional, sarcastic snob Cecil, whom Lucy opts to marry after several rejections, in order to avoid confusion about her own future and the doubts the Emersons have introduced. George Emerson, of course, is the modern knight--uncouth and unsmooth--but dangerous and attractive on a visceral level.What makes Room with a View special is not the content--covered territory, or the dialogue--witticisms and comedy of manners, but Forster's special insight into the characters that lets us know eveything they are and everything they can be, without deeply probing the people. It is a respect and dignity he grants his creations that makes them real."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I'm embarrassed to say that I had avoided Forster's work because I had wrongly assumed that, given the time in which he was writing (early 20th century), his fiction would surely be stuffy, dry and dull. I was completely wrong. In fact, this short novel's charm stems from it's casual, leisurely pace and the surprisingly winning chances it takes in terms of style (the chapter titles, Forster's penchant to pause the action and speak directly to the reader).Others have noted disatisfaction with the ending. I partially agree. I think the conclusion does wrap up things a little too neatly. But since this is an early Forster effort, it's understandable that he hadn't quite discovered how to end a novel with a bit more complexity. On the other hand, I cannot help but read A Room With a View through the lens of the classical definition of Comedy (which is the antithesis of Tragedy) where we are given a situation that begins with harmony/order and slowly slips in to crisis/chaos, only to surface in again, in the end, in a state of general cheer. And if one compares A Room With a View to, say, the Comedies of Shakespeare (Much Ado About Nothing, for instance), I think that Forster was very much trying his hand at novelistic Comedy: the foreign setting, a quirky cast of loveable (yet somewhat typecast) characters, chapters that function as Acts, and a somewhat formulaic (yet Classical) plot structure. I heartily recommend this slim wonderful novel."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"What a relief! This was a short, simple, easy read that I truly enjoyed. The young and beautiful Miss Lucy Honeychurch, accompanied by her dear older friend Miss Bartlett, is first introduced to the reader in Florence, just arrived at the pension they will be staying at during the course of their holiday in Italy. The ladies are vexed to find that they have not received rooms with the views they wished for; overhearing them, an elderly man and his son offer to trade rooms with them, for they have rooms with perfect views; and hence the title of the book.This is when Lucy first meets George Emerson, an attractive, if not unconventional, young Englishman. Lucy encounters him again when she witnesses a public murder in the streets, and George attends to her after she faints. This is when his passion for her is first ignited. This inward flame is only stoked more when he and his father are accidentally invited on a daily outing with Lucy and her friends, and George sees Lucy alone in a field full of flowers, beautiful and surrounded by beauty. He cannot help but kiss her, which is entirely un-gentleman-like. Miss Bartlett witnesses George's display of affection, and decides that to keep her young companion's innocence safe from George's intentions, the two of them must leave immediately for Rome, without so much as a goodbye to George or his father, and stay with some family friends, the Vyses.The story opens up again in a quiet, small neighborhood in the country, with Miss Lucy Honeychurch engaged to Cecil Vyse, whom she became better acquainted with in Rome. Then, by mere coincidence--or is it fate?--George Emerson and his father, whom Lucy never expected to see again, reenter into her life, and complicate things. Should Lucy flout convention and follow her heart, which is leading her to George, or will she remain with Cecil, the safe and respectable choice, who she knows can never make her truly happy?Find out for yourself! Forster does a great job of painting with certain clarity and humor the scenes and characters of this story. This classic is a breath of fresh air, and I'm sure that even if you aren't a huge fan of British Literature, you will love it."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"This is one of those rare books made into a film, where the film actually does justice to the story. It is almost as good as the book.. almost. Which means it is a very very fine movie, in my opinion the finest thing that Merchant Ivory ever did.I first read A Room with a View ten years ago when I was hitch hiking across England for the first time. I spent a week there, on 100$, walking and hitching throughout the night, sleeping in parks and fields during the day, waking up periodically to read snatches of the book. It was the perfect traveling companion for that adventure.I fell in love with Lucy (the heroine of the story) - she is hard to describe, a sort of expressive cipher - on the surface she is a somewhat callow, bored teen aged girl.. But as Mr. Beebe the perceptive Parson immediately notices, there is something extraordinary about Miss Honeychurch... There's hidden passion there. And EM Forster is the master at presenting her to us, along with the rest of his subtly drawn cast of characters.Forster thought her intriguing, himself. Forster was a lifelong bachelor, and a closeted homosexual. He usually treats his female characters with a certain dispassionate distance. But Lucy was his favorite of them all, and she stayed with him. In fact, he wrote a short story detailing her later life after the end of the novel.**So, this story, like everything Forster wrote is a comedy of manners focusing on the mores of the early twentieth century English middle class, highlighted against a foreign background. It is witty, philosophically interesting, and rife with good companionship. These characters will inhabit your imagination.If you like Jane Austen, George Eliot, or even stuff like Evylyn Waugh or Oscar Wilde, you will probably enjoy this book.[**The four page sequel is titled \\"A View without a Room,\\" and it was published in 1958 in a private edition, which is now very hard to find. It was reprinted though, in the Penguin Modern Classics edition of a \\"Room with a View,\\" which is where I read it.The text can also apparently be found in the New York Times Book Review of 27th July 1958.]"},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"This elegant little novel totally swept me away. It is so perfect from any angle I look at it. I know that this will be one of those novels I will always keep in a prominent place on my bookshelf and return to my whole life.This exquisite novel primarily concerns Lucy Honeychurch. The novel begins with Lucy on a trip in Italy. She is accompanied there mainly by members of her own society, the upper class of England among which she has been raised. While in Italy, though, Lucy is confronted by the Italian society where she notices the classes seem to mix easily. She is also confronted with George Emerson. George is simple, direct, and of a lower class, and he is having existential worries. Despite themselves (or their pasts), the two begin to fall in love with one another, and their experiences eventually lead to their realizations of what their hearts really desire.As it is with all of my favorite novels, I really cannot do A Room With a View justice with this review. This is a truly lovely book. The prose and the pace is perfect. There are so many sentences which are just perfect little gems by themselves. The characterizations are complex. The plot is romantic and funny. The thought behind the novel is meaningful and life affirming. There's not much more that any novel can do. A Room With a View is perfection."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I found this book as a young pre-teen. My mother handed me a dog-eared copy she had owned since her teens so I would leave her alone during a very long sea-side summer holiday. As a summer novel, it is still one of my favourites.Despite what many of my fellow reviewers have said, I found the character development redeemed many of the characters you may not have liked too much in the beginning. Lucy's growth especially is quite real. Very much something we all end up having to go through in one respect or another as we try to survive our teens. Only her struggle is made all the more aggrivating by all the unwritten rules of Edwardian Society and the meddling relations and aquaintances Forster seems to find an evil glee in throwing in her path.Lucy is a girl caught midway between the tantrums of childhood and expected decorum of adulthood. Through the novel she stumbles her way through all the pit-falls her station and ever-so-proper upbringing keep throwing in her way as she tries to deal with falling in love with a middle-class Bohemian [good heavens]. She starts very much as a young girl still learning the \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\" way to do things and through the novel somehow find her way past all the expectations of her mother, her fiance, and society in general to become a woman who takes her fate into her own hands and dares to say \\"But I want THIS!\\"It's the pitfalls and meddlings of the other characters that makes this story a treat. Everyone has an opinion and everyone gets in the way. Forster many times seems to be making fun of his characters, pointing our their absuridites with the turn of a phrase, but in the end it leaves you only with a feeling of affection for the whole lot of them.The writing is many times very tongue in cheek and you can't help but smile at the way Forster turns a phase. The chapter names especially keep the tone of the novel light, even when things begin to look as though George and Lucy will never get together.The copy that I read as a child also happened to contain a short article that Forster wrote many year after the fact as an Epilogue called \\"A View Without A Room\\" that let you know what he saw his characters doing with their lives over the next twenty years after the book ends. Its apparently rather rare, but I would recommend it as I would recommend this book as a whole.

As a result, there are by now maybe four or five different editions scattered throughout the landfill that is my domicile.The Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics edition is by far the best one I know of. You're certainly on the right page. (The \\"Dover Thrift Edition\\" stinks.)It has an introduction by Malcolm Bradbury that is nothing short of marvelous (what would you expect?). He also did the footnotes, which are chocked with insight.This is one of those slightly oversized paperbacks, as I suspect all the offerings in Penguin's \\"Twentieth-Century Classics\\" line are. It's a thin volume, though."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I was greatly impressed by the grasp that this male author had on the sometimes vague nature of emotion - his understanding, especially of women and their emotions, may stem from the fact that his father died soon after he was born and he was raised by his mother and two other women. This book is amazing, not only for the statement that it makes about women and their changing role in society at the time, but for it's great insight into the important aspects of life. For example, (and this is a running theme throughout the book)in the words of a little old lady at the pension: &quot; ...have you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate, and yet at the same time - beautiful?&quot; This philosophy of life highlights Forster's obvious favor of Lucy's brother Freddy and George Emerson - the silly ones who go for a romping swim in a pond - and makes plain his disfavor for Cecil Vyce, Lucy's stiff and condescending intended. This philosophy of life comes to full fruition when George kisses Lucy and even dares to kiss her again. By the rules of society, he is an indecent cad, but Forster would encourage us to find the beauty in it instead. Furthermore, this is not merely a story of a brainless girl who is tossed from an unfeeling fiance to an affectionate suitor. Rather, it is a story of a girl's realization of herself and her will. She triumphs as a thinking and feeling girl at the end and that's what makes the finale a sure victory for the author - he has not fallen into the usual trap of creating a two dimensional heroine."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"What can I say that hasn't already been said by the other reviewers?

However, &quot;A Room with a View&quot; was one of the most wonderful non-Austen books I have ever read. I laughed out loud many times at the way Forster worded things, especially the chapter titles (eg. &quot;How Ms. Bartlett's Boiler was so Tiresome&quot;). At the beginning, he seemed to be making fun of his characters - at their simple-mindedness and lack of depth - but then he commenced to transform them (mainly Lucy) and make them into wonderfully admirable people. It seemed that justice was served to Cecil when he served as the means through which Lucy and George were finally united.

After reading it again recently, all the subtle humor and irony behind what seems to be just a simple love story was still there.This is one of English literature's lost work. The subtle love that George first expresses towards Lucy after holding her head in his lap after she faints was powerful. All he did was hold her, but the strong and foreign love he has for her can be felt.When they go out to the country with a few other friends, you can feel how nervous George was, not even talking to anyone and just fidgiting, avoiding Lucy's brillant eyes.The story then climaxes when he just strolls up to Lucy in a field of tall weeds and kisses her.

It has nicely observed things to say about class attitudes, but is not particularly profound or deep.

The chapter names especially keep the tone of the novel light, even when things begin to look as though George and Lucy will never get together.The copy that I read as a child also happened to contain a short article that Forster wrote many year after the fact as an Epilogue called \\"A View Without a Room\\" that let you know what he saw his characters doing with their lives over the next twenty years after the book ends. Its apparently rather rare, but I would recommend it as I would recommend this book as a whole. Still one of my favourite light summer reading novels despite having read it almost every summer for the last fifteen years."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"My grandfather bought me this book for Christmas a year ago. At first I was just going to put it on my bookshelf and forget about it. My cousin encouraged me to read it, so I did. I've fallen in love with this book.Lucy Honeychurch and Charlotte Bartlett are touring in Italy when they meet Mr. Emerson and George Emerson. Father and Son. The believe Mr. Emerson to be a bit un-orthodox and his son to be the same. After Lucy comes homes from Italy, she gets new neighbors.

M. Forster's &quot;A Room With a VIew&quot; is a 20th century masterpiece. The novel shares some of the conventions of works by Forster's contemporaries Galsworthy and Hardy, but with a lighter touch. I suspect that this is one of a small handful of British novels of the last century which will continue to be read and enjoyed a hundred years from now.."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Reading this book is a joy.

Forster has matered the subtlety of the English language and conveys his understanding of aural appeal in every sentence. A Room with a View goes much further than merely examining the structure of life and social class in old England. Forster probes into the nature of human existence and human love.

Its not often that the film is as good as the book, but in this it was, so faithfully adapted. When I got the book after seeing the film, I felt I was seeing the film again while reading, the film was sooo faithful to all the key plot and character points in the book and many of the minor ones too. Whether you've seen the film or not, definitely read the book as well. There are one or two typos but its very readable.

In this novel the main character, Lucy takes a trip to Italy with her cousin, and upon her arrival meets the Emerson's. Lucy belonging to the upper class of society thinks she could never have an attraction to someone of the lower class, like the Emerson's. Love was something Lucy was hoping to find in Italy, but as soon as she arrived back to her home in England she promptly became engaged to Cecil, a man of the same social class as her. Lucy soon realizes that she is not truly in love with Cecil, and discovers that she is in love with George Emerson. Everyone Lucy knows expects her to marry someone wealthy and proper, like Cecil, but instead of listening to what others expect of her, Lucy listens to her heart, and allows herself to be in love with George. Throughout Lucy's journey to find true love Forster conveys the message that others expectations cannot guide one to the path of love, only one's heart can. I recommend this book to anyone who struggles when faced with making the decision of following others expectations, or following their heart. This novel will teach its readers that what one truly desires is the only escape to genuine happiness."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Forster's social satire is both poignant and whimsical - a pleasure to read.

When I write 'reviews', I don't mean to give a traditional book review, but to note how the book affected my real life.This is how: One of the characters, Cecil, is a bit of a snob and looks down on the common homey interests of his betrothed's family. He is good with books,art, ideas and 'things', but when he interacts with real people, his personality 'kills' any chance of having an intimate relationship and thus, his life is one of ideas rather than people.How fiction unwraps itself and reveals itself to be true! This was looking into a mirror for me. What my friends won't tell me, a good novel will! Doing well with \\"books, ideas and things\\" is not the epicenter of living, says Forester, but the nitty gritty give and take of affectionate living is where life's eruption takes place. Art and ideas and books, although glorious, arise from this center, not vice versa. First comes the flesh, then the idea.Thus this 'old' book, written over 100 years ago, performs the magic of all good literature: it makes me act and think differently. I now, attempt to(!), treat the person who stands before me, not as an idea, but as another real, carbon-based life form!\\"A Room With A View\\" tells the often told story of a young person learning to stand in her own place rather than where society demands she stand, yet Forester's characters are so complete that this old story is like a skeleton that is dressed up in finery and begins to walk! I fell in love with the characters and recognized myself in all of them; yes, even in the old biddy Charlotte, who, as it turns out, wasn't so old fashioned and possibly was the master puppeteer."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I've often heard complaints about classic novel's transition into digital format, but in the case of A Room with a View, there should be no complaints. I've read this novel both in print and digital forms and can say that the reading experience was not lessened on my Kindle than my old print copy. For anyone interested in reading a truely classic piece of literature, I recommend trying this book. I find it to be a funny piece of fiction with realistic characters to the time period.

It is sweet and transcendental. Forster's generally upbeat take on propriety and class differences makes this probably his most loved and most approachable novel. His characters are symbols, but also very real and very transformative. heroine Lucy is often muddled, and her antithesis (and for for much of the novel her fiance) Cecil isn't just a static foil, but ends up being fairly dynamic.One of my favorite quotes from the novel is, spoken by George (I believe):\\"There is a certain amount of kindness, just as there is a certain amount of light,\\" he continued in measured tones. \\"We cast a shadow on something wherever we stand, and it is no good moving from place to place to save things; because the shadow always follows. Choose a place where you won't do harm--yes, choose a place where you won't do very much harm, and stand in it for all you are worth, facing the sunshine.\\"Reading the novel makes me appreciate the fine job done by theMerchant & Ivory adaption(from 15 years ago) even more."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"This has always been one of my favourite novels, simply a joy to read.

In this book, a young British Brahman woman, Lucy Honeychurch, must decide whether to marry wealthy Cecil Vyse or follow her heart after the young and buff, but socially crass (to them but not to us 21st century Americans), George Emerson.Cecil dislikes most everyone, because they are not as gifted or talented as he. And, George - as well as his father Mr. Emerson - ignore the innuendo and scofflaw-like attitudes thrown in their direction by Cecil and people with whom he associates. In fact, when discovering Lucy's engagement to Cecil, George flatly (and out of character) responds, \\"You cannot live with Vyse. . . He should know no one intimately, least of all a woman.\\" This sentence is so out of context with his character's dialogue throughout the remainder of the book. But, perhaps more true to the character, it describes his emotions about Lucy and his main competitor for her heart.Lucy is torn between two lovers. She is in what Mr. Emerson describes to be in a \\"muddle.\\" Much of the muddle has been exaggerated by her meddling spinster cousin, Charlotte, and Charlotte's poor choice of a friend, Eleanor Lavish. But, to her credit, she thinks the situation through, and makes a decision which she enjoys, but which most around her do not understand.Forster's dialogue reminds me greatly of Evelyn Waugh, Virginia Woolf, or either Austen. The prim respectability often reads constrained when emotions of anger or hatred are expressed. But, the richness of the dialogue and depth of insight for the main characters are masterfully done. That is why this novel still is read today and will be for years."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I really liked this book.

I found this book a fine mix of period portrayal and timeless observation (a characteristic, I suppose, of all good art), and after finishing it, one of my biggest reactions was to be grateful that I wasn't living in the choking society of Victorian England. The acuteness of the author's evaluation of human relationships reminded me his literary forebear, Jane Austen, yet with a keener, more biting edge.

However, most of this author's fiction was completed in the first 20 years of the 20th century. \\"A Room With a View\\" is a gently satirical view of the English abroad and at home in the late Edwardian Age. Perhaps we can view England as the cozy room of normality and routine while the sunny Italian landscape provides us a view of a wider world outside our usual gaze.The short novel is divided into two parts. In part one we are introduced to a group of English travelers in Italy. We meet Charlottean old maid aunt who is chaperoning the upper middle class young lady the fetching Lucy Honeychurch. (Charlotte reminds one of the governess types described with right on accuracy by Charlotte Bronte). The women want a good view of Florence so reluctantly switch rooms with Mr. Emerson (a dreamy transcendentalist like older man who reminds us of the philisophical musings of Concord sage Ralph Waldo Emerson) and his stra handsome son George. (George is to become a knight saving Lucy from the clutches of the effete snob aesthete Cyril Vise). On a sightseeing picnic Lucy and George kiss and then depart. Lucy goes to Rome meeting her future fiance the artistic and bookish Cyril.Part II is set in England. After several complications the course of true love is finally set on its right course. Lucy jilts Cyril and finds true bliss with George. The novel is cyclicalbeginning in spring and ending with Lucy Honeychurch's honeymoon with George. This occurs in the same Florentine hotel in which they met. A year has passed and it is spring again for these young lovers.Forster provides a gallery of colorful characters: Mr Beebe the clergyman who hopes Lucy dumps Cyril for George; Eleanor Lavish a comically drawn mystery writer; Lucy's brother Fred and a Cockney hotel owner in Florence.Forster wishes to open the stuffy door of Victorian fiction with a new frankness on sexuality and freedom of expression. His scene in which the major male characters bathe in a pond is an example of this theme. Forster favors physical and intimate love to the aesthetic passionless p love which Vise has for Lucy. George is athletic and earthy while Vise is a nerdy bookworm. Forster's book is good in the use of witty dialogue. His understanding of the British class system leads him to satirical comments on its rigidity.A quibble. The characters don't have much depth seeming to be actors in a stage presentation. Forster is worth reading for his advocacy of true love and emotion in a society of elaborate and often hypocritcal rules. He is a good author worthy of your time."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"A Room with a View is a delightful novel by E.M. Forster. Is is a bit of a romance and was probably realistic fiction in the time period in which it was written. The main character is a young lady named Lucy. Lucy and her cousin Charlotte have traveled to Italy, and they meet a lot of interesting characters in their hotel. The Emersons are a middle-class father and son who offer to give up their rooms to the ladies because the rooms have wonderful views. Lucy learns a lot in Italy about herself and upon returning home becomes engaged to Cecil Vyse. The Emersons and Cecil have dramatic effects upon Lucy's life after she returns home. She discovers conflicting love within her life, and she learns that home is a lot less perfect than she had always pictured it to be. Lucy observes that \\". . . even their church had lost its charm; and the thing one never talked about-religion-was fading like all other things.\\" Lucy struggles to find out who she is, what she wants, and if the rules of society are to be followed in all aspects of her own life. Lucy finally discovers her beliefs and decides whether or not to follow the trends and manners of society.I would rate this book relatively highly. It is only two hundred and thirty pages long, but the language is difficult. It is a good book because the reader can relate to the characters and because it is a romance, which most girls like to read. However, there is quite a bit of philosophy, which makes it hard to understand and it is written in the language style of the nineteenth century. I had to read some of the paragraphs multiple times to grasp their meaning. Wrestling with the language is a good vocabulary and thinking exercise, however.

Whoever did that deserves most of the credit. How this book would read if I hadn't already known the outcome, I am curious to know, but I never shall, of course. Still an enjoyable read, especially being able to visualize all the characters. You can see the beginnings of all the wisdom that comes forth in \\"Howard's End\\" and culminates in \\"A Passage to India\\".

I've reread it twice, and keep finding little gems of beauty hidden in the lines. George and Lucy's need to be with each other to keep them away from the darkness in themselves is extremely powerful. In their merging, at the end, only then did they feel a sense of completeness and wholeness. Their obstacles in getting there were amusing and cathartic all at the same time. From the moment that Lucy witnessed the death of the Italian, life wasn't the same; the death signified a death within herself, and only through a love as deep as she had for George would she be able to understand the concept that love and death are very close together in feeling - the type of love that comes but once in a lifetime.

Forster's &quot;A Room with a View&quot; can certainly be taken as little else than a charming and amusing Eduardian love story. But to do so is to belittle the true grace and beauty of this stunning piece of literature. Like so many of Forster's works (indeed, like so many of his contemporaries), &quot;A Room with a View&quot; is about grappling with the infinite in a world so seemingly, &quot;flat, stale and unprofitable.&quot; Through the medium of a story, Forster brings to light the heroine's own internal struggle from childishness, to mindless conformity (&quot;the ranks of the benighted&quot;), to a sort of &quot;awakening.&quot; In short, Lucy Honeychurch's own journey is parallel to the historical changes in mindset that have formed our modern restless society. The book is rife with meaning and symbol, found in action as well as chapter titles. The language is beautiful, the characters charmingly (and sometimes sardonically) drawn, and the sense of place outstanding. &quot;A Room with a View&quot; is an excellent starting place for those interested in reading the works of Forster, both because of its brevity and also because of its historical youthfulness (his first novel). Although I felt the ending lacked in explanatory action, and I was not wholly satisfied with its philosophical conclusion, &quot;A Room with a View&quot; is doubtless an excellent piece of literature that works on several levels. Lovers and scholars of the various liberal arts would do very well to read this, as well as lovers of Eduardian and modern British novels."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Forster has a knack for making the ordinary extraordinary.

Lucy and her cousin Charlotte are offered rooms with a view of Florence, Italy by Mr. Emerson and his son, who are willing to exchange for them. The strict and drained Miss Bartlett does not wish to have an obligation to the Emersons, who are deemed less than polite society will condone. Their rector, Mr. Beebe, tells them he believes the exchange is proper and the ladies get their view of Florence. It becomes clear that Lucy herself wants a view of life and later confesses to her fianc&eacute;, a priggish intellectual, that she imagines him always in a room with no windows, with no view. The novel's love story is compelling, but the secondary themes of class and society structures are equally strong, with the truly noble characters emerging in the end with great strength.A Room with a View has everything a reader could ask for. Not only does it contain a beautiful and romantic love story that will capture your heart, but it contains the most simplistic comic relief, that it forms the perfect balance. Just as the story starts to get involved in deep romance, Foster will roll in a statement that will lighten the whole picture, and leave the mind simply happy.Foster writes in a way so calm and gentle that you want to fall in love with the book itself. He makes every word seem like it has such a great importance, that without it, the story will fall apart. One can tell this novel was written with a passion for life and love and with the force of a sensitive and empathetic mind.However, this gentleness leads to an extremely slow moving plot that sometimes winds up dragging along the reader. At some points, I found myself getting swallowed by the words and not really fully digesting them the first time. The key to aptly appreciate this novel is to have patience, knowing that the conclusion is well worth pacing the plot.Foster also created such a basic and easy plot that some chapters seemed to drag on until the idea was pulled through. Nevertheless, since there was not a complicated plot scheme to follow, the reader was able to concentrate on the language and characters illustrated in the novel. This way, it was also so easy to make yourself a character in the book and put your feet right in the room or scene to get the full effect of the atmosphere.Another aspect that was interesting to follow along with is how the novel conveyed very differently each level of society was looked at and thought of. Even though these thoughts on society may not have been the primary theme, they were definitely prominent throughout the novel. The lesson that can be learned from this aspect of the novel is that the entrenched morals of society should be thrown away in favor of passion and the natural instinct.The greatest fallback would have to be the British language used by Foster. I am not a big reader of British literature and I found the wording at little times to be a slight bit clumsy and awkward to follow. Although this stood in the way of the greater aspects of Foster's novel, it was definitely not a reason I would give for not recommending this astounding novel.This would have to be one of the greatest novels I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Anyone who believes they have the patience to appreciate this accomplished writer's work, will be utterly satisfied. The book is at every facet entertaining, no matter what genre of novels you're partial to."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I guess I am not a fan of Forster. I didn't too much care for \\"Where Angels Fear to Tread\\" and this second try was no better. He shoots for social commentary and hits it, obliquely, but his characters are flat and so not elicit sympathy. Worse, his Italy, so much a part of the book, is generic and without character.It is not the sympathetic and even sappy story, or the stilted behavior of the English gentry I dislike. I am a fan of Austen and the Bronte's. I think that it is Forster's treatment of the material and characters."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"This book can be read on different levels; eg. simply as a love story, on a deeper level as a study of the &quot;muddle&quot; of life or the struggle in to maturity etc. I found it amusing (during the talks given by author to reader), well written with many descriptive images of Florence etc., and romantic. Forster manages to give the reader the feeling that they are looking in to these character's lives without their knowledge (perhaps even as if you are looking upon them from a &quot;room with a view&quot;) and you feel very involved in the story despite the third person perspective (lapsing in to occansions with the author speaking directly to readers). Forster originally wished to make this a tragedy; I feel we need some hope now and then, that life is not always tragic and this book might give you some. I recommend it to any romantics."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"British writer Forster writes a romantic love story which takes place in England at the turn of the century. Young Lucy, is engaged to Cecil, a man of her class and social level. However, her views of the world changes drastically when she takes a trip to Florence, Italy and meets George.George and his father are rumored to be socialists and free thinkers. They quickly prove they have a tongue. George and Lucy have many interactions. First, they exchange rooms on account that Lucy's view is not what she wanted. He also helps her home after Lucy sees a bloody fight in the town's square. They also take an excursion to see a beautiful valley, where George makes his intentions known that he appreciates Lucy.When Lucy returns to England, George once again is put in her midst. With George's influence, Lucy begins to see that Cecil is stifling her. Challenging her Victorian principles, she must decide between the free willed George or the controlling Cecil.I enjoyed the book a great deal. It reminded me of a British version of a Sinclair Lewis novel where Lucy must challenge her societal roles. There is also a hint of women's liberation in the book as well. The idea is similar to Lewis's &quot;Main Street&quot;. However, I did find the book challenging to read; I am not a big reader of British literature and I found the wording a little clumsy and hard to follow. None the less, it was a good read and the ideas that Forster conveyed make this one a classic piece of British literature."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Interesting, very interesting. But not on first read. Yep, like everyone else here, I read this book as part of an English literature course. And, the first time I read it, I felt like setting fire to the damn thing. But, like the Velvet Underground, if you force yourself to take this in repeatedly, you eventually fall in love with it. The story itself is so basic, so obvious, a standardised Romeo and Juliet fantasy, but the language, social commentary, and at times plain flippantry of Forster's writing just infiltrate your mind like a brain tumour. Call Forster Coupland in a chastity belt. Touching, life-affirming, and, in a twist for books you study at school, some characters you care about. The sexually frustrated Mr Beebe, the hateworthy Cecil, and the greatly underrated Miss Bartlett. If you've ever been in love, and something's gone wrong, then this book was written for you."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Old-as-time plot line (young woman growing up and going against convention) is livened somewhat by Forster's interesting heroine, Lucy.

Although I haven't seen the movie, it is extremely easy to visualize a Merchant-Ivory type production from reading the book."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"This book reminded me a lot of \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\" with a number of key differences:1. This one was written 20 years earlier.2. There is no sex - just two kisses on the cheek.3. It's just so much better - the psychology of the characters is much more realistic, the conventions of society are satirized much more aptly. Furthermore, this book is very funny at the right places while still being morally serious. It is also kind to the characters (including the \\"bad\\" ones) showing them as people with failings and not as straw demons to be skewered in service of the author's philosophy.So, if you like serious but enjoyable literature, go and read it."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Forster's novel takes aim at the British ideas of respectability and social class. Lucy wants to rebel against the many rules that govern her conduct, but she is torn. She loves her mother and brother, and wants the admiration of her social set, but she finds so many of these people tiresome and hypocritical. I was struck by how frequently the title phrase is mentioned. There are the obvious references to her room at the pension in Florence and to the view from the salon at her home in England. But Forster also explores the \\"view\\" of one's acquaintances vs the reality of their inner core. It's when this second way of looking at things (pun intended) comes into play that the novel really got interesting for me.I did find the middle section - from the time Lucy and Charlotte left for Rome to Lucy's epiphany regarding George and Cecil - somewhat slow going. In fact, I just about gave up on the book. But I'm glad I persevered; the last five chapters redeemed the work for me."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I just re-read this classic as part of a E.M.

In my mind, it will always be intertwined with images from the Merchant-Ivory film, probably because the movie version is so well done and true to the book. I think I am going to have to dust off the movie and watch it sometime in the near future.I did enjoy this quote from the book: \\"A rebel she was, but not of the kind he understood - a rebel who desired not a wider dwelling room, but equality beside the man she loved.

Some fiction achieves a status like Holy Writ. This novel might.The central characters in >A Room With a View&lt; are as follows.1) Lucy Honeychurch:a. \\"I can't think,\\" Lucy said gravely.b.

If you're not used to reading pieces from this period, you may need to warm up to the style, but once you do, you'll enjoy this."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"When A ROOM WITH A VIEW was first published in 1908, the sun had not yet set on the British Empire. The Victorian Age was coming to a creaking end, but for most English, life went on pretty much as it had been for the last half century. But under the priggishness that was the remnant of old-style prudery, cracks were appearing in the hidebound and stuffy proper British upper-class morality. Women were starting to clamor for rights. The lower classes wanted more of the economic pie that once belonged unquestionably to that of the upper. Amidst all these nascent changes, E. M. Forster wrote A ROOM WITH A VIEW to satirize gently the entire spectrum of proper British morality that was becoming increasingly clear was not so proper after all.Lucy Honeychurch is your typical Victorian young lady visiting Italy in the vain hopes that she can \\"broaden\\" her vistas, a process that Forster thinks clearly is so much rubbish. Accompanying her is Charlotte Bartlett, an equally stereotypical chaperone whose business it is to keep Lucy from having too good a time. In Italy, they rent a room that they do not like. In the room adjacent is the father and son Emerson family who graciously offer to swap rooms. The stern Miss Bartlett promptly exhibits her social snobbishness by thinking the Emersons are low class clods. The younger Emerson, George, likes Lucy but her higher standing on the social pecking order, discourages him from forming a liaison. Lucy and Ms. Bartlett return to England where Lucy becomes engaged to Cecil Vyse, a thoroughly dislikable sort but whose high social standing makes him a perfect choice for Lucy. George winds up in England and learns of Lucy's engagement, which he encourages her to break. After much soul searching, she sees that Cecil is a pompous buffoon and marries George.A ROOM WITH A VIEW is a lesser book in scope than A PASSAGE TO INDIA and a much lighter in tone work than HOWARD'S END, but in its gentle satire and in Forster's ability not to take anything too seriously, he has recreated a world of stuffiness that stands revealed in a comic manner that still manages to address such sobering issues as woman's rights and class snobbery. This is a fine book that sheds some much need perspective on an era that not many see as humorous."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"I have read \\"A Room with a View\\" about six times. It is a mystery to me why I enjoy it so much. I love the descriptions of Italy and the sense of humor that Forster imbues all his characters with. I feel that Lucy and Cecil represent the tendencies within each of us to escape intimacy and 'real feelings' under the guise of social suave.I also think I know about five Miss Barretts. Forster also captures the essense of the supremely annoying old spinster who 'doesn't want to trouble anyone' and her tragic beauty."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"E. M. Forster's novels just don't wear-out. Reading a classic such as A ROOM WITH A VIEW is the perfect book to prove the point. The form and story has been rewritten by many modern authors, but this original is still the best and on top of must reads before I/you die. The setting makes you want to escape to quickly book a wonderful view. Return to this classic, soon."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"A Room with a View is a wonderful, gossipy book that teaches more than one life essential moral. Lucy, a young woman who finds herself battling with society's expectations, teaches the reader many of these morals as she discovers them herself. Throughout the course of the book, Lucy strives to take a more independent path in which she can follow her heart with passion. The role of social classes is quite significant as it teaches one to not be judgmental or conformed to the rules of society. Forster does an excellent job developing his characters page by page. Miss Bartlett, Lucy's society-driven cousin, becomes Forster's most interesting and mysterious character by the end of the book. Both George and Mr. Emerson, a father and son first introduced in Italy who are of lower class, also become more deeply engaging characters as the book becomes more and more addicting. Part I of A Room with a View takes place in Italy where art, music, love, and society's expectations all emerge. After reaching Part II there was no putting down the book. I became enthralled in the gossip of love, truth, society, and morals. Lucy battles with the ideals she was brought up with and society's pressure as she strives for independence, passion, and true love. A Room with a View is the type of book that makes one feel good after reading it. This romantic book is full with gossip and morals that is sure to bring a smile to anyone's face and warm anyone's heart."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"A Room With A View is one of those light-hearted yet serious books that starts out slowly, begins to warm up, and becomes wonderful toward the end -- leaving one with a warm, happy glow. On the surface, it is a very simple book with a very simple plot and theme -- forbidden love. Indeed, it is not the plot that makes the book so enjoyable; it is the style and the characters. Outside of fiction, E. M. Forster is also well-known for essays on various aspects of literature; he also taught in the English university system. This becomes clear throughout the course of the book; he writes like a literature professor. This accounts for both the slow start and the eventual charm. Always a clever writer (though occasionally too self-consciously so), with tongue never too far from cheek, Forster can definitely turn a phrase -- the penultimate paragraph to one of the later chapters, on Lucy's \\"surrender,\\" is bone-chillingly good --, and the book is written in a generally light-hearted, jovial way. As another reviewer pointed out, he almost seems to be making fun of his characters at times. Clearly a social critic at heart, Forster shows how what seem like earth-shattering tragedies to Lucy -- the prim, upper-crust heroine -- are, at best, but ripples in the pool. Despite the recurring \\"tragedies,\\" the mood never gets too dark and heavy; light-hearted chapter titles help perpetuate this feeling. This raises the book above countless similarly-plotted novels. Forster after all created the concept of \\"flat\\" and \\"round\\" characters, and as anyone familiar with the terms knows, the former is not a pejorative. Forster stressed that a novel needs both to be balanced and true-to-life. This indeed has them: Lucy, the well-rounded, life-accurate heroine who lives, breathes, and grows; Cecil, the walking caricature. Forster's social criticism must also be remarked on once more. In this social comedy, he deflates Edwardian England's puffed-up, self-important upper-class values and leaves us both charmed and amused. The book's deeper element lies here, as he enlightens us about the hypocrisy and xenophobia. His point should not be missed. These elements come together to bring about a delightful, pleasant, and short read that is likely to please most anyone. This is a well-deserved classic."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"This was one of the few books I was able to import to my Kindle Fire when I first got it and was just a title I had heard of."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"With news that the British Government is closing its High Commission in Florence, this work is even more topical.

The author himself over-egged the pudding somewhat by inserting far too many personal observations,which bordered at times on pomposity, seemingly to try to point the reader in the direction he/she is meant to think. But amongst it there was a nugget of truth, which shone above all else, and really is the essence of the story - \\"Though you...never see him again, or forget his very name, (he) will work in your thoughts till you die. It isn't possible to love and to part. You will wish that it was. You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you.

For this alone, the trudge was worth it."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"E.M. Forster does a remarkable job of illustrating the constricting social values of Edwardian England with humor and acute insight. Our heroine must decide: go along and get along or shirk her \\"dutites\\" and chose a life of remarkable rebellion (for the time).You'll want your own trip to Italy when you're through reading! One of my absolute favorites."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"In A Room with a View, E.M. Forster infuses a formulaic plot with rich characters and social commentary to create an eloquent insight into the human condition. Forster's gift for detailed character description and subtle sarcasm are prominently displayed as he describes protagonist Lucy Honeychurch's transformation from virtuous, obedient girl to vivacious, independent woman.A Room with a View was first published in 1908, at a time when the British Empire was at its apex. The stereotypical images of high British society - proper tea parties, cultured conversation, and mild-mannered ladies- were still commonplace. However, a cultural revolution was taking shape. Women were beginning to challenge their role as symbols of modesty and decorum, while socialists and other freethinkers criticized the insular, intolerant views of the upper class.In the midst of this rising movement of innovation, young Lucy Honeychurch takes a sightseeing tour of Italy. Raised in sheltered comfort at her estate in Surrey, England, Lucy is dutiful, submissive, and subconsciously able to suppress her own feelings in order to please others. In Florence, Lucy meets George Emerson, a passionate, spontaneous man with radical ideas on life. After a brief romantic encounter, Lucy returns to England, feeling confused and strangely dejected. Her sense of propriety outweighs her emotions, however, and soon she is engaged to a well connected, self-important man named Cecil. Cecil exemplifies the haughtiness and superficiality of the upper class. Forster describes him as, \\"Well educated, well endowed, and not deficient physically, he remained in the grip of a certain devil whom the modern world knows as self-consciousness\\" (100).As Lucy and her snooty fianc&eacute;e prepare for their wedding, George moves into a nearby villa. His reappearance sparks both feelings of love and contempt in Lucy, who vows to ignore him and devote herself to Cecil. But confrontation is unavoidable, and in their few moments alone, George inspires Lucy to break off the engagement with Cecil. He tells her, \\"Every moment of his [Cecil's] life he's forming you, telling you what's charming or amusing or ladylike, telling you what a man thinks womanly; and you, you of all women, listen to his voice instead of your own\\" (191). Lucy realizes the truth in his statement, but is so distraught, that she rejects both Cecil and George. It takes a heartfelt speech by George's father and a great deal of soul searching before Lucy realizes that she needs George. After all, he is the catalyst that starts Lucy down her path of self-discovery.While the plot of A Room with a View is similar to other period romance novels, such as those by Jane Austen and the Bronte's, Forster's didactic style and witty sarcasm lift the book above the standard. Forster includes comments like, \\"But, as I say, this took a little thinking, and - so illogical are girls - the event remained rather greater and rather more dreadful than it should have done\\" (137). This quote highlights Forster's love of humor and cynicism, but it also brings up another issue that sets him apart from his peers. Forster is a man writing about a topic that is typically covered by women. While his views may be biased at times, his perspective adds a unique element to the genre.Even more amazing, is Forster's ability to portray a young woman's personal and emotional rebirth with such understanding and clarity. Lucy is a complex character who continually struggles with outside influences and her own beliefs. All of her emotional battles are internal, but Forster records them so beautifully that they are just as exciting to read as any external action. For example, he writes, \\"Some emotion - pity, terror, love, but the emotion was strong - seized her, and she was aware of autumn. Summer was ending, and the evening brought her odours of decay, the more pathetic because they were reminiscent of spring...The scales fell from Lucy's eyes\\" (193-94). Although Forster is a man, he captures the sprit of a woman in his words.E.M. Forster's story expressively highlights human nature, personal growth, and free will through the development of Lucy Honeychurch. Forster has the remarkable ability to be sarcastic one moment and poetic the next. Ultimately, it is his unique style and character development that make A Room with a View an incomparable novel."},{"Title":"A Room with a View (Penguin Readers, Level 6)","review":"Forster's indicment of Victorian England is not as enjoyable as Howard's End or A Passage to India. However his direct style and story telling ability is still preferrrable to some of his British contemporaries.The story centers around that of the ruling gentry and their contempt for anyone a little different from themslves. Interestingly enough Forster's most booring characters seem to be the Anglican clerics who are more interested in gossip and self importance that serving their constituents.The novel begins in Florence admidst the many treasures that adorn that City and concludes in the beautiful English countryside. The hero, Lucy, is embarrassed by her own attraction to the Emersons's, Father and Son, who are clearly not of her class. She is encouraged by her stuufy cousin and a couple of old maids who are staying at the same hotel to avoid the Emersons. Mr. Emerson is a true romantic and his style is much to direct for their comfort and his quiet son George is much too gloomy.Lucy is so taken off balance by young George Emerson that she cuts short her stay in Florence and flees to Rome and then home.

It is based on ideas and principles suggested by Bateson and Erickson. At times the book suggests that just about everything is a metaphor (Bateson's viewpoint), as opposite to a chair being just a chair - the only merit of this observation is that we assign meanings to objects and experiences in our lives and thus to a lesser or greater extent they are colored by our perception. The book also emphasizes Erickson's utilization principle, namely that the therapist should attempt to use client's metaphors to help the client solve the problem.The authors then guide you through methods and techniques of selecting appropriate symbols, constructing metaphoric stories and ceremonies.

One cannot help but wonder what kind of mindset would devise such an infamy. How could Germany, a nation that was noted for its richness of culture, have devised a plan of genocide that was so far reaching and so inherently evil?The author attempts to answer that question and succeeds in doing so brilliantly. This is a very well-written book that will appeal to those who are interested in the general human condition, as well as those interested in the holocaust itself. It is scholarly, yet, at the same time, immensely readable. This is because the author has put a very human face on the dreaded death camp of Auschwitz. The stories and experiences of more than a hundred people are integrated throughout the narrative, which delves into the historical backdrop of the Nazi political machinery and its leadership. Survivors of Auschwitz, as well as Nazi perpetrators, tell of their experiences in the hell that was known as Auschwitz, and they tell it from their own unique perspectives. The symbiosis that often existed between prisoner and prison guard is quite unsettling, as are the attendant moral and ethical issues.The author attempts to help the reader understand how it was that the \\"final solution\\" came about. It is an unsentimental, intellectually objective, critical analysis of one of the most infamous episodes in modern history and warfare. The author carefully delineates how the Nazis developed their reprehensible strategy for global genocide, and how it came about being implemented. The creation of Auschwitz was crucial to the Nazis' desire to rid itself of Europe's Jewish population but, however, that desire may not have been entirely ideologically driven. From his extensive research, the author postulates that there may have been a practical, more pragmatic component that dictated the actions of the Nazis in the final, waning days of World War II that was no less immoral than the ideological one.This is simply a stunning and authoritative book by an author whose expertise in this area is undeniable. It is a comprehensive and insightful look at one of the most notorious death camps in the history of Nazi Germany. The author carefully explains the rise and fall of Auschwitz within the context of the Nazi mentality and ideology, as well as within the broader context of historical and military pragmatism. It is a devastating portrait, indeed, and with its sixteen pages of vintage black and white photographs, it is a book that will keep the reader riveted to its pages until the very last one is turned. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Auschwitz: A New History","review":"I will be visiting the Auschwitz concentration camp ( actually death camp) in April so i wanted to read this book so it will help me understand what happened.

I also like very much Mr Rees way of telling the story because he is not afraid of pointing fingers and holding people and countries accountable for their actions. This book is a must for anyone who wants not only wants to understand the Nazis and the political machinery of WWII but also a must for people who want to understand human behavior in the worst conditions possible.Great book!!"},{"Title":"Auschwitz: A New History","review":"Laurence Rees is a fine scholar and a fine writer and has the courage to present an historical summary of the one of the most horror-laden atrocities of the twentieth century - the Nazi camp called Auschwitz. Even the name conjures up loathing and nausea and near disbelief that such unimaginable mass killings, human medical experimentation, torture, and genocide could have possibly been real. But without denying any of the truths well documented since the Nuremberg Trials, Rees explores the initial beginnings of the concepts for the camp and the events that lead the Third Reich to push this Polish town site into world memory.World War I laid the seeds for the rise of German resentment for the loss of a war they felt was turned against them. At the core, in search for a causative factor, the Jews were perceived as the evil reason for Germany's losses. Not that anti-Semitism was limited to Germany: Rees wisely shows that those feelings were fairly widespread throughout the world. Yet it took the early fanatics that included Adolph Hitler to strive to purify Germany, rid the fatherland of the useless consumers of food that robbed the Germans of their rightful needs, and repatriate lost Germans to the fatherland at any cost. Rees postulates (with excellent quotations from both Nazi perpetrators and concentration camp survivors throughout this book) that the primary goal of creating concentration camps such as Auschwitz was to provide way stations for gathering non-Germans for deportation to make room for the return of 'lebensraum' for those of pure German blood.The progress from these initial postulates to the eventual conversion of the concentration camps as places for extermination of not only Jews but also any 'outsiders' ending with the gassing and cremation of millions of human beings is the trail Rees outlines for the reader. He also uses his hundreds of interviews with camp survivors to explore the inner workings of the camps, from the hierarchy of the Capos, the survival techniques, the trading issues with the Poles outside the camps, the brothels within the camps that serviced not only the Guards but also the inmates, and the day to day mechanisms of progressive annihilation of the inmates.This book is not easy reading: the approach is scholarly yet fascinating and the subject matter can induce waves of nausea in even the most iron-willed reader. But the book is terribly important. If our response to the Nazi genocide camps is only one-sided horror without the information as to how such camps evolved from first idea to ultimate tragedy, then we stand to see history repeat itself. We need only to look at Abu Ghraib, Sudan, and other contemporary mini-counterparts to see how feasible this line of thought is. This is a very important book and recommended to everyone who cares about the human race. Grady Harp, December 09"},{"Title":"Zodiac P.I., Book 4","review":"Go Zodiac!! the last book... so sad.

She wrote a large number of relatively brief (often under 200 pages) modern romantic suspense novels. Her style is somewhat similar to that of the longer novels written during this same period by Barbara Michaels. A key difference is that while the Velda Johnston novels often hint at the inexplicable, they usual have rational human explanations.I don't think I am spoiling anything by mentioning The People From The Sea is one of the exceptions in her canon, as it is a true ghost story. Personally, I love ghost stories, but they are most often encountered in the short story format. That is because it is difficult to pull off a really good one at novel length. The People From The Sea succeeds admirably. Almost as well as my two favorite paranormal mystery novels, The Uninvited by Dorothy Macardle (1942) and The Red Lamp by Mary Roberts Rinehart (1925).Important to note that a ghost story is not a horror story. There are no gruesome or in-your-face disturbing scenes in The People from the Sea. Death is perhaps life's greatest unsolved mystery, and the best ghost stories are really mysteries at their heart - as is the case here.I've read nearly all of Velda Johnston's mystery novels, and enjoyed them all, but so far only The People from the Sea and The Underground Stream (her final published work) have truly supernatural elements. I recommend both to fans of novel length ghostly mysteries."},{"Title":"The people from the sea","review":"Diana was drawn instantly to the charmind old beach house in the Hamptons, even though it was David's former mistress who had found it for her.Alone one night, Diana was startled from her sleep by soft laughter, voices, eerie piano music - and the Woodhull ghosts: mother, teenage daughter and Derek, strikingly handsome in his army un iform.

Alive: A Prose and Poetry View of Life from the Inside Out . . .","review":"A beautiful story of how a woman can grow up through difficult and confusing times and find herself awake and alive because of it. Ms. Shannon is a model for us all.Here you have a woman who shares her story through heartfelt words that leave no one bitter or broken. The wisdom in the poetry speaks of wonder and detail through her challenging experiences and her upset in her family and the world. This is a wonderful example of our ability as humanbeings to transcend what appear to be insurmountable obstacles and overwhelming challenges. Shannons combination of poetry and prose gives us significant insights into her life experience without the need to dwell on every detail.It gives many of us insight into how life is too short to define our world by the often upsetting details of our past. There is another way to view the situation, the person, the times and who we are because of them.This is a book for everyone because it touches on the strength, beauty and resilience of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Total White Sox: The Definitive Encyclopedia of the World Champion Franchise","review":"I still have my copy of the original White Sox Encyclopedia and over the years I've enjoyed leafing through it and discovering countless facts, figures and items of interest regarding the history of the Chicago White Sox. This worthy update comes hot off the heels of their 2005 World Series championship, and even if you have the original you'll definitely want to have a copy of TOTAL WHITE SOX in your collection. Virtually everything from the original is here (the only items I've noticed that were not carried over are the color memorabilia photographs), and the season-by-season summaries, statistical information and player profiles have been brought up-to-date quite nicely, plus there are many more additional photographs encompassing the nine seasons since the original volume was published.One word of caution: as much as I love this book, I had to deduct one star from my overall rating. While reading the summary of the 2005 World Series I came across a glaring factual error regarding the final out of the decisive Game 4 (page 532): \\"Orlando Palmeiro then grounded out UNASSISTED to Paul Konerko, who, for the second time in the post-season, stuffed the souvenir ball into his pocket.\\" The final out was actually a softly hit ball chopped over the head of pitcher Bobby Jenks, shortstop Juan Uribe charged the ball and fired it to first baseman Paul Konerko, enabling the Sox to win their first World Series in 88 years. Considering the magnitude of that final out, I am somewhat surprised that this mistake made its way into print, but that error notwithstanding TOTAL WHITE SOX is a beautiful volume no White Sox fan should be without!"},{"Title":"Total White Sox: The Definitive Encyclopedia of the World Champion Franchise","review":"Awesome book for the Sox lover.

I like her settings of New Orleans and other areas of the South. I have just started buying and reading her books. I am really impressed, and I've read a bunch of historical romances. Her historical accuracy is exceptional, and the love scenes are frequent and fantastic. She has an understanding of the different cultural backgrounds of the Louisiana area--French, Spanish, American, and weaves this knowledge into great novels. I also enjoyed &quot;Perfume of Paradise,&quot; and &quot;Prisoner of Desire,&quot; both outstanding works."},{"Title":"Surrender In Moonlight","review":"I sneaked this book out of my mom's stash when I was 12 and read it over Summer vacation. Whew!.. by the time I finished this one, I was able to find all the good parts in Embrace & Conquer with a quick scan, but read the whole thing anyway. I am not a reader of romance novels, but I did enjoy this one and every book I read later by Jennifer Blake/Patricia Maxwell.. and on the strength of her writing, I would be eager to read anything she's had published."},{"Title":"Surrender In Moonlight","review":"If you enjoy historical novels where the author obviously put a lot of effort into researching the period, this is the author for you.I loved that this book was about much more than the romance, though that was not lacking in any way. The story was delightful in the various aspects of war it presented, but more than that, the characters are interesting just because they exist in that world. Regardless of whether or not love conquers all, you just want to see what happens next and who will come out on top.Really, the only downside was that it was a bit overlong. While I didn't mind, personally, I do think readers who bore easily would have a harder time getting past the middle. I felt that I couldn't quite give it five stars for that reason, but I'm sorry that I can't give it four and a half."},{"Title":"Surrender In Moonlight","review":"Lorna Forrester's uncle sells her off to Nathaniel (Nate) Bacon, who plans to wed her to his feeble-minded son Franklin. Prior to the wedding, Lorna's caught in a storm while out riding and takes shelter in an old abandoned house, but it turns out not quite so abandoned as she meets up with handsome blockade runner Ramon Cazenave. Ramon charms Lorna into a night of passion, but after the deed is done they're caught and Lorna is returned to the *cough* loving arms of Franklin and Ramon is locked up by the evil Nate. Frank is a bit too aggressive on the wedding night, and after a wee bit of a tussle let's just say that Lorna needs to get out of Dodge fast, she frees Ramon and the two lead their jailors on a merry chase. So as not to spoil I won't reveal how it happens, but the action eventually switches to Nassau in the Bahamas, a major hub for the blockade runners and their valuable cargos. What follows are your usual ups and downs of true love that neither party will confess to (although thank gawd there's no real big misunderstanding), lots of complications from the evil baddies, plus some nail-biting derring-do and rescues at sea at the finish.All in all a very engaging read, and a good choice when you're in the mood for something on the *lighter* side of fiction. Don't get me wrong though, Blake is not just an average every day romance writer - she takes the genre up a few notches and for that gets four stars from me. Her settings are real instead of wall-paper, and I very much appreciate effortless way that Blake brings in the Creole lifestyle, customs, clothes and food into her books. Her heroines have a brain and not only do they know their roles in society, they don't go around stamping their feet when they don't get their way and then go rushing off into danger after they've been told to stay put (well, Lorna did do it once, but I forgive her for that). I really did get a chuckle out of this snippet,\\"She lay reading for a time, a novel she had picked up in a stall of used books outside a shop. It held her attention only to a degree, for the heroine was insipid, the hero overbearing, and the story filled with unlikely events and coincidences.\\"I have yet to find a pair like that in a Jennifer Blake novel, although I've barely scratched the surface of her back-list. There is a lot of sex in this book, as Lorna and Ramon do a fairly good job of steaming up the pages (that was one sensual towel-down after the bath...), although once again Blake does it in a more tasteful manner with subtler language than you see in today's romances. Not recommended for younger readers because of that, but adult readers looking for a southern romance that won't insult your intelligence might want to give this one a whirl."},{"Title":"Surrender In Moonlight","review":"I really loved the book, I have to say. Very well written, lots of twists and turns ... and I also enjoyed the background. I didn't know much about the blockade during the Civil War so it was a very interesting reading. And the love scenes were quite elaborate :) All in all, I definitely recommend the book. The interaction of the heroes was full of passion and I have to say I loved them both- strong-willed and refreshingly honest in their feelings. I also recommend Jennifer Blake's other book called Royal Seduction."},{"Title":"Surrender In Moonlight","review":"Same old plots!

Often times, health professionals make a mistake of targeting only one causative aspect of the problem while either ignoring or not recognizing the other. Ignorance of many psychologists and psychiatrists about dual disorders is due to the rarity of this problem. This book is a must read for both mental health providers and their patients. I also believe that many others will benefit from this book even those who do not show underlying symptoms of this disorder.

It contains many cases to exemplify the disorder and its treatment success."},{"Title":"Puntos De Partida","review":"The book by itself would be lacking as another reviewer suggested. But it doesn't stand alone -- if you buy the package you get a lab manual, a workbook, audio CD's for vocabulary prep and for the lab work, and a software CD with more exercises. The lab manual works with audio CD's for listening &amp; speaking related exercises, and the workbook has reading &amp; writing exercises, plus if you do the software exercises and the additional exercises and quizzes on the website, you find you have learned the grammar and vocabulary of the chapter without having to resort to making your own flash cards or writing out sentences on your own. The volume of exercises is perfect. And the exercises in the workbook &amp; lab manual have explanations of the purpose of the exercise, with lots of repetition. (e.g. &quot;the purpose of this exercise is to listen for specific information.

It's simple, a 6th grader could teach themselves Spanish with this book. Open it, read it, and memorize it. I had a terrible time with French and was not looking foward to learning Spanish, but I picked it up immediately as I went along with this book. When the semester was over, I spent the summer reading the rest of it at my leisure. As far as the other reviews go, I'm not sure what the problem was. It couldn't be explained any more clearly, perhaps they are moving too fast? Take a day for each page or something, whatever works. If you're not picking it up, it may be your study techniques and not the book. If you want extra practice, get the workbook. Both the workbook and the textbook have the answers to every practice exercise (of which there are an adequate amount) in the back of the book. Maybe the previous reviewers were unaware?"},{"Title":"Puntos De Partida","review":"This book is touted as a beginners volume yet it fails to perform as specified. The contents are poorly written and few examples are given to help in the learning process. To further complicate the learning of a new language, Puntos de partida provides very little explanations and direction to ensure sufficient comprehension and understanding of the Spanish language. Unfortunantly, this review can speak for most Spanish text books on the market as my Universities Spanish program has realized. Puntos de partida will not help the beginner to learn Spanish. It will deter the beginner to seek further understanding and learning of the Spanish language. This is unfortunate."},{"Title":"Puntos De Partida","review":"Contrary to other reviews I find this textbook excellent.

The examples are not very helpful either.However, I took a private introductory class and then returned to this book.

At the High School level, this book can offer great reward for students doing the National Examination in my country.

That thought was quickly shot down in the introduction.I flipped through the chapters and was drawn to a few paragraphs.What a disappointment. The idea that time can pass quickly or slowly determined by the circumstances you face, whether it's enjoyable or not, is about as much as I got out of this book.The basic premise is that we should approach our daily lives in the present moment. Plan only for what is immediate and in front of you at that moment, give your all to that moment. Don't worry about the past and what you could or should have done at some other time.Great. But then he goes on to say we should have no thoughts of some \\"idealized future\\" and no lists or plans for the day.. allow inspiration to drive your work.In my eyes inspiration is only a starting point for something you want to achieve, after that it is necessary to have a plan. How can you run a business or even go about family duties.. washing clothes.. going grocery shopping and picking up the kids from the grandparents, driven only by inspiration?That's madness.. you need some sort of logical timetable to work with.And as for an \\"idealized future\\" isn't that like having a visionof where you want to be in life? You absolutely must know where you want to go in life, what you want to do, and must maintain a positive vision or you will get to nowhereland on the express tracks.The actual steps to achieving the vision are made in the present, by the actions you take today, but I didn't get that he meant it that way.I'm new to this time management thing.

It is self-paced, and appears to be very comprehensive. Within the first couple of lessons, I was able to use my new grammar and word skills in conversations with people who only speak spanish.

That being said what I have come to recognize from simply listening and repeating the phrases and words is that it's also nice to be able to look at how the word is spelled. So I'm glad I have both."},{"Title":"Latin American Spanish (Three Months Course)","review":"Hugo's does what many other self-study language programs don't. It builds up your basics with simple nouns before moving on to basic sentences and verbs, then verb conjugation. Instead of memorizing phrases, you're given the bits of speech so you learn the actual rules of the language, rather than parrot back simple phrases. This helps you to actually communicate, and your command of the language improves quickly. The cassettes are helpful in that you actually hear pronunciation by native speakers, but they are by no means necessary. I rarely use them except when I hit a lesson I need more help on, and aural study does help in this way. In the back is a Spanish-English/English-Spanish dictionary (my beef with this was it doesn't contain nearly enough words other than ones commonly used in this course). Therefore, I recommend buying a nice thick Spanish/English dictionary in addition.If you can't afford the time or money for a class, Hugo's is definitely one of the best alternatives I've found. In addition, however, I'd recommend \\"Cliffs QuickReview: Spanish 1\\". What bothered me about Hugo's is, while it does a great job of explaining the basics/intermediate things about Spanish, it glosses over little things that a newbie wouldn't understand (ex: \\"Why do I put an accent here but not here?\\"). Cliffs QuickReview is a great reference for every tiny bit that Hugo's sometimes forgets to mention (and all organized nicely for easy reference ... as Hugo's is organized in lesson plans, it's not easy to find that one thing you want to review i.e. irregular verbs or BOTH past tenses).In conclusion, Hugo's is the best I've found so far, and in two months' time I've definitely noticed an improvement in my Spanish. Just get Cliffs QuickReview and a Spanish dictionary to supplement Hugo's and you're set."},{"Title":"Latin American Spanish (Three Months Course)","review":"It really works!"},{"Title":"The Horse Is Dead: A Tasteless Novel","review":"I read \\"The Horse Is Dead\\" when I was a kid in the 70s, because the guy who did the cover illustration for the original hardback edition was an old friend of my dad's, and we happened to have a copy in the house. I had very little idea of why it was so funny, but it was; rereading it now, it seems like a hardcore band covering a novel by Philip Roth. It's all there: the self-hatred, the obsession with sex, the worries about being Jewish, but Klane is so much faster, louder and angrier, and in so much worse taste.It concerns one Nemiroff (we never learn his first name and he doesn't seem to think that he has one) who works as the only Jewish counsellor in a summer camp. (I learned of the existence of summer camps from this book.) He hates the kids he is in charge of, hates the camp, hates his fellow workers, and especially hates his luscious Gentile colleague Miss Booe (we never learn her first name either), because he knows she'll never go to bed with him. In the course of the book, he throws up in a girl's ear, has attempted coitus with a guitar (the girl who's wearing refuses to take it off, even in bed) and generally behaves like one of the most singularly repellent anti-heroes in contemporary American fiction. But it all changes when Miss Booe suddenly turns out to love Jewish guys...\\"The Horse Is Dead\\" has been long out of print, and first editions are now extremely valuable.

I can respect that, indeed I often find that the books the critics praise are rather poor, while the ones that the critics pan are sometimes excellent. As an example I genuinely enjoy R.E. Howard's books.When I decided to read Louis L'Amour I went to websites that discuss his work, and I read the forum threads there too. Sackett's Land came very highly recommended, and since I don't really like Westerns I decided I'd give this a go. One day when I had nothing else to do I sat down and hoped I was in for a treat.Was I ever wrong...The story begins well enough with the hero discovering a hidden cache of Roman coins, and searching out a potential buyer. After the sale he goes through a village, where he spots a beautiful maiden, and offers her a drink of water. This makes the ladies suitor come down on him as a ton of bricks, a fight breaks out, and he must flee for his life aided by the mysterious stranger Jublain.Now until this point the story seemed good, the coins gave this rather poor lad some money to work with, and the fight with the suitor (an important nobleman) gave him a reason to leave his home and look for adventure. In short I was willing to accept all the coincidences I'd seen so far.The problem is that the coincidences never stopped! When the hero is accosted in the Globe Theatre and has to flee he just happens to seek shelter in the home of an important sea captain! The first man he asks in a pub just happens to know where they can find a scribe that's good at looking up sea maps and unpublished accounts of English antiquities! He just happens to drift ashore, and climb over a sand dune, in time to spot the footsteps of the bad guys taking his love interest away! There's always a helpful stranger there to aid the hero, and for some inexplicable reason they're immediately completely loyal to him!In fact this novel doesn't have a plot as much as it has a series of action scenes strung together by highly unlikely coincidences!I could also add that the descriptions are so bare that I was often confused as to whether or not they were in the Americas, on the ship, or what not. If it happens once or twice I tell myself to pay more attention, but when it happens a dozen times or more I blame the writer, and it distracts from my enjoyment.There's also the fact that most of the characters sound almost exactly the same, there's no unique voice for each character, nor any sign of a personality beyond their place in the plot.It's not literature, fair enough, but it's not even a good story! If you lived thirty years ago, or twenty years ago, and books were your main source of entertainment on the go then sure this'll do. That's what it is though, dubious pulp fiction, and a great disappointment."},{"Title":"SACKETT'S LAND (Louis L'Amour Hardcover Collection)","review":"This was so boring I just could not bring myself to finish it.

Here is an ancestor that would make any family proud to own him. He is a hero not so much in what he accomplishes (which is quite a lot) but in his honor, integrity and the way he thinks. His loyalty to his family and friends make him exceptional. He is a leader where ever he goes and men not only follow him to the ends of the earth, but they do so as loyal friends and not as subjects or employees.

His first book of the series is one of the best. It tells the story of Barnabas and his increddible adventure after finding a bag of ancient gold. The story is very entertaining right from the begining and memorable long after you have finished.

Poor but full of encouragement about the future, young Barnabas Sackett takes an opportunity to travel to America. He makes some enemies along the way, however, and is in danger for most of the novel. L'amour uses every word to paint a vivid picture of England and the wilds of America at this time.

As a 30 yr. old female, I don't consider myself western book material, but L'Amour has managed to capture my interest and I hope to pass that interest to my son. I have been seriously considering starting him a collection of his own"},{"Title":"SACKETT'S LAND (Louis L'Amour Hardcover Collection)","review":"The nice sense of humour which I enjoyed in L'amour's books - or at least some of them, is apparent in this book. Set in 17th century when Barnabas Sackett was first driven out of England and makes a home in the new land. This is the first of the Sackett's who arrived in America.America of this early date was not the America of the push to the west, but it is nevertheless a good read, and the standard plot devices are there, the fights and so on. More than anything it is the humour and the great characters which really make this a great read.My favourite of the L'amour's I have read so far have been the Sackett books, but I also really like Fallon for the same reason. The easy humour which runs through some of them. The least favourite of the reads have been the ones where they are really just western without the wry good humour of the main character. Mojave crossing, a later Sackett book was another excellent good fun read - a bit confusing but funny too - so if you are looking for more good reading to follow this I hope that will give you some idea!"},{"Title":"SACKETT'S LAND (Louis L'Amour Hardcover Collection)","review":"Barnabas Sackett has grit and he has the ability to draw to him men of like mind and substance. He is a master of weapons and often has need of his talent. This tale spans both sides of the Atlantic and even places the hero in one situation at the Globe Theatre in England. But, alas, trouble finds him before he is allowed to see young Shakespeare's latest play!I especially love this and the following book in the Sackett series, &quot;To the Far Blue Mountains&quot;.For more historical fiction that spans the lands of Europe and Russia in the 12th Century, read &quot;The Walking Drum&quot;. It has much the same feel as this and other early Sackett novels."},{"Title":"SACKETT'S LAND (Louis L'Amour Hardcover Collection)","review":"I didn't like the book as much as I thought I would.

Unfortunately, it was previously owned by a library, so it had the library's name ink-stamped on the page ends and the books Dewey Decimal number glued and taped onto the spine. Since the cover and binding were simulated leather, removing these essentially ruined the cover. I felt like the rating was inappropriate for such a book.As far as the story itself was concerned, it is one of Louie Lamour's best books. It is the first of the Sackett family series, and a delightful tale. It tells of how Barnabas Sackett came to be one of the first to colonize America, and the challenges of life and travel at that time. The rest of the Sackett series expands on this story line with stories of the sons of Barnabas from the East coast to the frontier West, but that's in other books. But I recommend them all to you!

Sackett's Land is the story of Barnabas Sackett, a plucky fen-man (a man from the fascinating culture of the British swamps, long since drained) who journeys to America in the 1590s and explores the Chesapeake Bay. This book has one of the most exciting and well-written opening scenes that I've ever read in my life. I was immediately drawn in to the story of Barnabas and couldn't wait to see what happened to him.Unfortunately, the book really lost focus after the opening. Written much in the style of a summer movie like Pirates of the Caribbean, it's one action sequence after another, with very little character development and almost no real plot. Even though the book was only 178 pages, I had to flog myself to get through it.The best parts of Sackett's Land are when L'amour lets his own philosophy and knowledge of history shine through in brilliant little asides. I was amazed to learn about the different ethnic groups that existed in England back then. There's a great scene in which Barnabas and his friends loot an old Roman settlement, which L'amour slyly uses to comment on the ethics of digging up archeological treasures.At heart the book is all about self-reliance, and I wish L'amour had given himself a driving plot to bring home this point that Barnabas makes so well:I would not sit waiting for some vague tomorrow, nor for something to happen. One could wait a lifetime, and find nothing at the end of the waiting. I would begin here, I would make something happen."},{"Title":"SACKETT'S LAND (Louis L'Amour Hardcover Collection)","review":"To anybody who likes a great adventure.

Other than that, it was a good read."},{"Title":"SACKETT'S LAND (Louis L'Amour Hardcover Collection)","review":"Back in the mid 70s I was too young, hip and cool to read 'cowboy stories.' I was a book snob then until a scholarly friend of mind gave me Sackett's Land to read. 'Here,' he said, 'You'll like this. I did.' He was only half right. I loved it. Sackett's Land is a great historical adventure novel and great entertainment. It's the book that set the stage for the Sackett series that followed; the series that created millions of Louis L'Amour fans the world over and had me eating more than a little crow.These days I no longer pretend to be hip or cool and my book snobbery gave way to reading a lot of everything and everybody, westerns always included. I'm a fan of good writing and good entertainment; from mysteries to Whodunnits, historical fiction and fact, police accounts, military and just about whatever catches my interests on the bookshelves or what AMAZON suggest from time to time.And in between, when some of the newer novels or books get a little ho-hum, I go back to those books that kindled the fire which is why I'm re-reading the Sackett series and enjoying them all over again. This doesn't necessarily fall into the Western genre but because of L'Amour's reputation it is usually the section where you'll find it in the stores.Do yourself a favor, pick this one up when you have a moment and give it a try. You just might be surprised."},{"Title":"SACKETT'S LAND (Louis L'Amour Hardcover Collection)","review":"I first read the Sackett novels many years ago and I look forward to rereading them via Kindle.

Sackett sails over the ocean and lands in what will become America. His trials and struggles make for highly interesting reading and L'Amour's sense for detail gives one a true feeling for what it must have been like back then.The most compelling of the series, and fine introduction to the First Family of frontier fiction."},{"Title":"SACKETT'S LAND (Louis L'Amour Hardcover Collection)","review":"While I believe that I have read most of the Sackett novels, this first one was always my favorite. It is definately the most unusual of the series, indeed, of anything that I've read by Louis L'Amour.Set in 1599, it is the story of Barnabas Sackett, founder of the Sackett clan in the New World. The Sacketts were fenmen (swamp men) eeking out an existance farming the little good land available to them, fishing for eels, smuggling, or going off to fight in the wars. It was the combination of the chance finding of a cache of Roman gold, along with a fight with an arrogant aristocrat, that put young Barnabas on the road to &quot;adventure.&quot;Fleeing to London, he meets the contacts that he will need to set sail for a new world and a new life. The sword fights, pirates, and sea battles that follow are not what you expect in a &quot;western&quot;, but they are quite good never-the-less. Upon surviving to reach America (after Roanoke, but before Jamestown) Barnabas rapidly sizes up the territory and the inhabitants and resolves to start his family there- far from kings and aristocrats. When he hears of the &quot;far blue mountains&quot; from the Indians that he is trading with, he makes up his mind to one day travel to them- and beyond."},{"Title":"SACKETT'S LAND (Louis L'Amour Hardcover Collection)","review":"No matter where you started with the Sackett books, go ahead and read this one now. For fans of L'Amour's work, especially The Walking Drum, you will be pleased.Sackett's Land is a good and appropriate beginning for the entire saga. It may well stimulate you to read the whole history in order.The book is important for yet another reason. It's style and depth are a window to what The Walking Drum has in store for you. Sackett's Land hints at what L'Amour was capable of beyond the pulp western market.When we pick up a Louis L'Amour book of the standard pulp market size, we have a set of expectations. Good and evil will be clearly recognizable. Good will prevail. The story will be enjoyable and just instructive enough to make us feel that we grew from reading the book. Sackett's Land fulfills all these expectations.Sackett's Land also holds an interesting place in popular literature. It is representation of a specific family (along with fellow travelers through life) and that family's initial transcontinental encounters. As one reads it, one is reminded of Edgar Rice Burroughs's stories of Lord Greystoke. In fact, as I was mentally remarking that Sackett's Land reminded me of Tarzan (books 1 and 2), I turned the page to find our protagonist marooned on the new continent. In this case, the new continent was the North America, not Africa, but the similarity was fun to notice.Louis L'Amour was a man of his time, and while he could tap into Burrough's storytelling rhythms at times, L'Amour was ever more interested in depicting people as people, and a great respecter of human diversity. I believe descendants today of American Indians and Europeans can read Sackett's Land and enjoy thinking about their own American families."},{"Title":"SACKETT'S LAND (Louis L'Amour Hardcover Collection)","review":"This novel which introduced us to the intriguing saga of the Sackett family is by far the best of the series. Set in 17th century England and America, this book creates vivid images of life during a time when freedom was not a given right, but something you had to fight for. The courageous Barnabas Sackett flees to America to start a new life with nothing but the clothes on his back and a deep sense of pride. Struggling to survive in the wild untamed land of what is now the USA, Barnabas finds himself faced with escaping from vicious pirates, battling the elements of the weather, and often times being the first white man to come face to face with the American Indians of the region. L'Amour does a fine job at telling this adventurous tale which will keep you flipping the pages from start to finish."},{"Title":"SACKETT'S LAND (Louis L'Amour Hardcover Collection)","review":"The great-granddaddy of all the Sacketts, Barnabas, from the English fenlands, embarks on his first great adventure to America, in the process running into a variety of colorful allies and dastardly villains.It's a fun, fast-paced book, but a long way from L'Amour's best. Unlike in his superior swashbuckler, \\"Fair Blows the Wind,\\" the author never quite inhabits his hero's world; it always sounds like the commentary of an outsider rather than the words of somebody who really lived in England in 1599. In particular, large passages of dialogue are aimed at countering modern-day doubts of the rightness of frontier settlement; these passages are persuasive enough in themselves, but obviously anachronistic.As other reviewers have pointed out, Barnabas's ability to establish instant loyalty in every good guy he meets is preposterous, and his training from his father with the aristocratic sword, as opposed to the ordinary fen-man's bill-hook or pike, is highly questionable. Also, Barnabas's villainous opponents aren't his equals and don't inspire much dread.The real delight of the audio book, though, is John Curless's reading. His narrative accent is pitch-perfect, and he gives every character an easily recognizable voice of his own that adds a wallop of flavor to the bland stew of this book. Best of all is Curless's reading of the supercilious London merchant and the growling rasp of the pirate Captain Bardle.Don't read this book. Listen to it. It's worthwhile for Curless alone."},{"Title":"SACKETT'S LAND (Louis L'Amour Hardcover Collection)","review":"While I believe that I have read most of the Sackett novels, this first one was always my favorite.

His best-known series are a set of stories about the Sacketts, a family of tough men and women. Many of the books are about the men coming out west and their adventures. They have integrity and stand up for truth and justice. They don't go looking for trouble, but when it comes to them, they don't back down.&quot;Sackett's Land&quot; sets the stage for the rest of the stories. It doesn't take place in the west in the late 1800s, but starts in England as Barnabas Sackett has some troubles and heads for the New World in the 1600s. He has great adventures and does great things. There is lots of fighting, but instead of with guns it is more often with swords.The story starts off quickly with Barnabas finding some old coins and trying to sell them. He encounters the nephew of an earl. The nephew ends up looking foolish; the nephew doesn't like being made a fool of so he decides to kill Barnabas. Barnabas runs, and along the way we are introduced to old England, England in the early 1600s. We meet people of all walks of life. Then the story moves to America and back to England.This is a fun book. It is easy to read and entertaining. If you haven't read it, it is worth reading.

My husband is a Louis L'Amour admirer and owner of the whole collection, so when he wanted to listen to Sackett's Land, I knew we would enjoy it immensely. A half cowboy himself it is only natural that he would have picked this author for our camping trip. We listened to the whole story and truly enjoyed it. It was different from what I love but nonetheless very well done and entertaining. It was truly a piece of art. If you love the old cowboys stories, you will love this one... we did.Anna del C.Author of \\"The Elf and the Princess\\"The Elf and The Princess: The Silent Warrior Trilogy - Book One (The Silent Warrior Trilogy)"},{"Title":"SACKETT'S LAND (Louis L'Amour Hardcover Collection)","review":"Louis L'Amour wrote over a hundred westerns. His best-known series are a set of stories about the Sacketts, a family of tough men and women. Many of the books are about the men coming out west and their adventures. They have integrity and stand up for truth and justice. They don't go looking for trouble, but when it comes to them, they don't back down.&quot;Sackett's Land&quot; sets the stage for the rest of the stories. It doesn't take place in the west in the late 1800s, but starts in England as Barnabas Sackett has some troubles and heads for the New World in the 1600s. He has great adventures and does great things. There is lots of fighting, but instead of with guns it is more often with swords.The story starts off quickly with Barnabas finding some old coins and trying to sell them. He encounters the nephew of an earl. The nephew ends up looking foolish; the nephew doesn't like being made a fool of so he decides to kill Barnabas. Barnabas runs, and along the way we are introduced to old England, England in the early 1600s. We meet people of all walks of life. Then the story moves to America and back to England.This is a fun book. It is easy to read and entertaining. If you haven't read it, it is worth reading.

From the beginnings in the frontiers of the east coast, generations move west into the western frontier. Must start with the first book &quot;Sackett's Land&quot; to enjoy the complete story. Several movies have been made from the &quot;Sackett's&quot; series of books. I've enjoyed the Sackett's as the best western series I've ever read.

How to Survive presents him at his finest, discussing not how to teach (he almost never does this) but what teaching and learning are like. He does this with humor, honesty, and an edge. No teacher, reading this book, can come away without a more thoughtful consideration of his or her own teaching.

I'm not sure if my goal in life is to become James Herndon or maybe just to meet him, if he is still living in San Francisco (he's listed in the phone book there.) When I give this book to other teachers, they tend to react with love and astonishment; when I give it to non-teachers, they don't really get it, although they tend to love his other great book, the Way it Spozed to Be.

How to write a \\"proper\\" term-paper, a \\"proper\\" lab report, how make a presentation that will meet your boss's expectations? If so, our school system is doing an okay job, and would be even more efficient if the government started using vouchers.But Herndon would disagree. He understands that true education = creativity, and that true education only occurs when teachers act like humans instead of \\"Providers Of Things To Do\\" or \\"Entertainers\\" (pg. 44). That true education only occurs when student participation is voluntary, when they are not pressured or required to do anything, and when teachers are genuinely interested in what's being talked about (meaning they would think about in their free time) so that the creativeness the teacher has for the subject can then be freely spread to the students; just as interests spread between friends. Not that the System doesn't have its place! Just recognize that what usually occurs in schools today is training; preparation for the corporate economy. And not education.His advice?\\"resist every day all the apparatus of the school which was created in order to enable you to manage and evaluate a group, since it is just that management which destroyed the kids you have in your class.\\" - (pg. 156)\\"... but you can only live that kind of life in there if you are willing to realize that the dicta of the school are crazy but that at the same time the kid's life is connected to the school in complicated ways and you'd better offer him the chance to take any part of it he wants or has to.\\" - (pg. 75)Words for any teacher to live by."},{"Title":"How to survive in your native land","review":"When I first began teaching in the 1970s, this book was considered the mainstream classic of how to conduct yourself as a teacher. I left teaching for 14 years, and in 1987 picked the book up again when I re-entered the profession. I taught in San Francisco then, too, at a middle school entirely similar to the one Herndon was in 15 years earlier. How do I know that this is a relevant book? Although I read it just once, I can remember some of his insights almost verbatim.\\"Time to put my feet up on the desk. Time to ask a kid about his life and how he was doing...Time to do all those things I had never taken time to do before.\\" (paraphrase)Education is the process of creating equity, creating memories, creating a sense of belonging in children. We spend 6 hours a day together(teachers & kids) for 13 years (k-12) and that should count for something. And that something is a sense of worth and a sense of hope that we too have a place in a better world. The subjects, the grades, the college apps - all the stuff that creates so much noise - is just that. Something else. Not the real thing. Not why people teach.If you want to teach - and you find that this book \\"grabs\\" you - it's probably because you want to make more real, more actual, more tangible - the interactions you have with children in the classroom.

I throw my 5 stars on the pile too."},{"Title":"Kristin Lavransdatter III the Cross","review":"If you have read the first 2 parts of the trilogy, then surely you will want to see how Kristen's life story turns out. Through Undset's marvelous characterizations you will experience a huge range of human emotions: the worries of parents about their children (especially of course from the mother's perspective), the joy of seeing the future in and through your children,the melancholy waning of marital love (and its reawakening), the fragility of life in medieval times, the ecstasy of deep religious faith, the hysteria when the unknown approaches. Undset examines through Kristin the constants of human life with simplicity, but also with a realization that the mystery of existence remains mysterious. A reviewer of an earlier volume said he preferred the 1920's translation in a pseudo-Walter Scott style, claiming it shows more &quot;poetry&quot; than Tiina Nunnally's. &quot;De gustibus non est disputandum&quot;: each to his own taste. I suggest that you take a look at both translations before you buy and see which one you might prefer. (I will still call the earlier translation dreadful.) I hope that Tiina Nunnally will eventually translate all of Undset's works."},{"Title":"Kristin Lavransdatter III the Cross","review":"THE CROSS is the final shattering novel in Sigrid Undset's KRISTAN LAVRANSDATTER trilogy. In it, Kristin reaps both the rewards and sorrows of the choices she sowed in the first two volumes.In the first novel, Kristin's passion for Erlend Nikulausson led her to break her betrothal to Simon Andresson. In the second volume, Kristin sought to atone for her sin (she was already pregnant when she celebrated her wedding with Erlend), but had to struggle to forgive Erlend for leading her astray. In THE CROSS, the consequences of Kristin's choices all come to a head. The first section of the novel focuses on Simon, who has been a faithful friend to Kristin and Erlend, even as he continued to harbor feelings for Kristin. In the mid-section of the novel, Kristin and Erlend strive to find peace with one another. While their passion for one another never died, they were never fully able to overcome the mismatch in their marriage. And in the final section, we follow Kristin as she seeks acceptance from her seven sons, and most importantly from God.For while KRISTIN LAVRANSDATTER seems to be a novel about love, friendship, and marriage, its deepest message is about the struggle of deeply-flawed humans to reconcile themselves with God. The trilogy is set in medieval Norway and all of the characters order their lives (as best they can) around the Christian moral order. Even as they knowingly fail, the Faith is a part of the very air they breathe.The miracle of Sigrid Undset's trilogy is the clarity of her perception into the human condition. All of these characters live and breathe, and (more startling) we see clearly how they impact each other through the tangled webs of their lives. But Undset's literary talent is embedded in a sharp religious vision, which points to God's relationship with us as sinners. Undset never denies the good in Kristin's passion for Erlend. Nor does she hide the devastating consequences their passion had on each other and on all of the lives they touched. Often, to sin is not to choose that which is evil, but rather to choose a lesser good. Yet as the saying goes, God can write straight with crooked lines, and at the end of this extraordinary trilogy, Kristin comes to see how God has been with her through all of the light *and* through all of the dark. We walk away from the novel enthralled by the grandeur of the story we live out in this fallen world, and the enormous love God has for us.Rereading Sigrid Undset's classic trilogy has been one of my most rewarding projects this summer."},{"Title":"Kristin Lavransdatter III the Cross","review":"...this one brought me to tears in more than one place. If you're reading &quot;The Cross,&quot; or considering purchasing it, you've probably already read the first two books in the series and are caught up in the story. Is this book worth it? Yes. It's not an uplifting read by any means, but it brings the Kristin story to a logical -- though heartbreaking -- conclusion. I am in awe of Undset for her creation of such believable characters, and grateful to her for this glimpse into medieval life. Nunnally's translation is clear and reads smoothly. This, along with &quot;The Wreath&quot; and &quot;The Wife,&quot; is one of those books you hate to see end."},{"Title":"Kristin Lavransdatter III the Cross","review":"I have told you in my reviews of the 2 earlier books that you become Kristin. Well, in this book you wish you were her so you could recover from her mistakes and make life right again. How tragic Erlend's ending, how sad Kristin's. I ache to this day for her. Was life really like that in those days. We will never know. But feelings and emotions seem to be timeless and I can only imagine that somewhere in sometime in someone's life they experienced all that Kristin did and I ache for them too.

She seamlessly draws you into medieval Norway while captivating you with the depth and humanity of her characters. I read them breathlessly captivated.

Bravo, Sigrid Undset."},{"Title":"Kristin Lavransdatter III the Cross","review":"After having read all three books - Wow! She deserved the Nobel Prize. This last book is a great read - much exciting stuff. And how she understood what a mother feels about her sons - and their leaving her."},{"Title":"Kristin Lavransdatter III the Cross","review":"I'm still suffering withdrawal symptoms now that I've completed volume three. Where will I find another world like this one? For me the third volume was not of the astounding caliber of the first two, yet it was still very good, and eminently readable. More characters are introduced, and many minor characters that had barely been mentioned in the previous two books are frequently alluded to in the storyline: it can be a real challenge keeping track of them all. You really need to take notes while you're reading this novel. A character may be referred to in passing, and unless you have been making notes as you went along, you probably won't know exactly who this is and how she or he fits in or is related to the other characters.Based on its title, I was expecting The Cross to be a very sad and tragic story, yet overall the tone of the volume is mostly positive, until about the last thirty pages. If any one character emerges as victorious at the end it is Ulf, an enigmatic rough-hewn man who is very stoic and plain-spoken, sort of like a cowboy from the old west. The question is, why does Ulf emerge as this shadowy survivor at the novel's conclusion? Ulf is not a particularly religious man, but he is possessed with an undying sense of loyalty to Erlend and Kristin. Ulf indirectly alludes to his secret love for Kristin at the end of the novel. Ulf is doggedly devoted to her throughout the novel. Aside from Ulf, Simon emerges as the other individual equally lovingly devoted to Kristin. What is indeed not apparent, however, is why Kristin is considered so appealing to these men; she is never really presented as anything other than a hard-working simple woman with a massive guilt complex.Undset never meant to portray Kristin as a perfect individual. In fact, Undset refers to her in numerous places throughout the novel as a very flawed, weak woman. Readers who come to this novel expecting Kristin to be the paragon of virtue are bound to be disappointed. One of the biggest flaws in Kristin's character is her unwillingness to forgive Erlend for his moral lapses. The rift between Kristen and Erlend becomes the main theme of this novel, and it is apparent that Kristin is largely to blame for it. She is stubborn and unforgiving by nature. It is only at the end of the novel that she comes to recognize her own stubborn willfulness, and tries to make up for it in acts of charity.This is a great novel that will stand the test of time. I feel sorry for those who have not been able to enter into this amazing world."},{"Title":"Kristin Lavransdatter III the Cross","review":"This series was excellent.

The thought of adding yet one more pharmaceutical drug to the already large list propelled me to seek answers elsewhere...There are many approaches to alternative treatment/wellbeing and in my opinion there is no holy grail or a quick silver bullet, however if you make a commitment to get better and are willing to exercise some discipline then I think Timeless Secrets Of Health & Rejuvenation will not only pave the way for a full recovery but in the process will bring you closer to understanding yourself.The author's thesis is that the body - your physical state is designed to function and serve you well, it wants to continue to serve you well as per its design. Rather than assist our body to excel in its raison d'etre we often (through lack of knowledge) challenge it with use of harsh and harmful modern pharmaceutical drugs and our life style. Modern work ethic often insists on a quick fix of symptoms.The book is packed with tons and tons of very useful information at all levels about gaining insight and knowledge about your physical state. The author combines his great insights into Ayurvedic Medicine with modern medicine to come up with a comprehensive text on health and wellbeing.Whether you are a well individual looking for answers to health issues of your loved ones or an individual with a list of Chronic ailments such as Diabetes, Cystitis, Backache, Migraines, Constipation etc This book will not only set you on a path to recovery but also explains and enlighten you on the underlying causes of the ailment.You may want to know what is good water and how much of it to drink per day. Honey can be used to treat wounds, Broccoli has Anti-Cancer properties, Celery is better than Viagra and much more on the amazing food & herb cures.What is a splendid and healthy meal for one individual can be very upsetting for another equally healthy individually. The book explains why this is the case and goes much further - it shows you how to design a diet specific to you and your body needs.If you want to learn about \\"modern\\" methods of cleansing your intestines using Colema Boards or Colonic Irrigation or gain knowledge about your Body Type using the 6000 yr old Ayurvedic System or learn something about today's Medical practices it is all there in this one text.A common thread in all of Andreas's work is that Mind, Body and Spirit can not be viewed independently. They are all interrelated and one influences the other. Hence healing becomes a journey in which you get to understand your physical state through cleansing of vital organs such as Kidneys, Liver and Colon and simultaneously attending to your emotional and spiritual needs thro Meditation and Life Style changes & Diet. The book is a manual on how to achieve all this and more.I no longer suffer from any of the ailments mentioned in the first paragraph.

I do not mean to slam the medical community of the Western world, because it certainly has its place and has saved many lives. But strictly treating and suppressing symptoms and never diagnosing the cause is a \\"no win\\" situation that is only going to get worse. After conducting the flushes in this book (I've done two so far), I have already seen INCREDIBLE improvements in my health and digestion. I've put into practice some of the author's recommendations like drinking warm water upon rising, dietary changes and following Ayurvedic rhythms and can't believe what an impact these small changes have made on my overall health. Do yourself a favor and buy this book. It will improve your health and well-being and might even open your mind to a whole new way of thinking!"},{"Title":"Timeless Secrets of Health and Rejuvenation","review":"I originally found Moritz's material at Curezone.com, where he hosts a questions and answers forum. My first impression of his writings came from there - he seems sincere and provides a lot of clear answers, perhaps commonsense, to the people he counsels. This book is a collection of his personal knowledge about health, blended with a lot of the principals of Ayurvedic medicine.. focusing especially on diet, digestion, and broadening an individual's concept of health.He has a scathing view of modern healthcare industry (don't many of us?), and even goes as far as to offer alternative theories of AIDs, Diabetes, and Cancer.. but there are far better books out there to read about the misdeeds of big industry.. such as, \\"Trust Us, We're Experts!\\".Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book for two reasons. 1.) The best of this book (mainly, the liver flush and cleansing) can be found from other, more complete sources (such as Curezone.com). 2.) The book drags on in many parts, reading more like a personal monologue than a real conversation between reader and writer.. which can be irritating.

There doesn't appear to be any unifying theme or logic behind the films included in the book and the reader may suspect that the book is simply a list of every single foreign or cult film the author has seen. The whole project might be redeemed by some good writing, but even that is lacking, the capsule reviews mostly consisting of a synopsis and the author's opinions. The synopsis is redundant for those who have seen the movie and a spoiler for those who haven't. The author's opinions are occasionally provocative, but for the most part, uninspired. Without a distinct critical voice, the book is merely an exercise in self-indulgence. Having an opinion is not very hard."},{"Title":"Off-Hollywood Movies: A Film Lover's Guide","review":"I find the volume a useful guide to a well-selected collection of independent and foreign films of the era of the 1980's and before.

Dr. Cushing introduced the blood pressure sphygmomanometer to America, and was a pioneer in the use of X-rays.He even won a Pulitzer Prize. Not for medicine, but for writing the biography of another Doctor (Sir William Osler).Before his day, nearly all brain tumor patients died.

Thomas Kai Toteh's \\"African Child\\" transported me right into the life of Kailuo, a Liberian hunter and wizard.

This is a man who once lived as a powerful hunter in an African village and was tortured to death in the hands of his antagonists in the dense forest. He was reincarnated and wanted to modify the voodoo or African science for the benefit of the continent. But his dream was almost shattered by the decade and half of Liberian civil war which turned him into a refugee. Though the story is base on Kailuo's confession of his life experiences, it is an embodiment of the sufferings of all typical African children. It is the symbolic expression of the cries and yearnings for peace of millions of disadvantaged African children in the bushes, villages, and refugee camps. This is but one of the millions of stories that are yet untold about the sufferings inflicted on the children of Africa by warlords, politicians, merchants of death, and enemies of humanity.About the AuthorThomas Kai Toteh is a Liberian refugee in the United States. He is a journalism major at the Florida Community College at Jacksonville. Prior to the submission of his manuscript, he was seeking admission to the University of North Florida. He is a founder and editor for the African Refugee and Asylee Newsletter in Jacksonville, Florida. He was a student activist in Liberia before the civil war. He is a father of two children. He presently lives in Jacksonville, Florida, USA.Free PreviewThe fight between Kailuo and his attackers was intensifying. He struck six of the attackers dead, including his youngest wife with his specially made magical bow and arrows. Then lightning struck him and destroyed three of his beast heads. He was weakened when he saw his youngest wife's body in the pool of blood. Kailuo tried to escape the fight as he appeared multiplied in the eyes of his attackers. His real self was about to quit, but the attackers made a fake appearance of his only daughter, Martha. They asked Kailuo to surrender his power and submit to captivity or else his daughter would be killed along with him. Upon seeing his daughter, he surrendered to his enemies who disabled him of all telepathic abilities, had him tied to the teeth, and dragged him to the merger of streams that flowed into the Sanquin River. There they tortured him to death and buried him underneath one of the streams.As tension brewed in Kailuo's village and the entire clan worried about his well-being, his youngest wife fell off and dropped dead, a mysterious death that Kailuo's other wives and old folks believed was tied to Kailuo's disappearance. The news of Kailuo's mysterious disappearance traveled like a wildfire throughout the country. The clan chief had made a formal report to the county's officials about the development. The superintendent unleashed a batch of soldiers and police to the clan to help find the missing man. A county witch doctor was also sent to investigate and find out if the disappearance was the work of witchcraft or what might have caused the mystery.After the burial of Kailuo's youngest wife, the town chief evacuated everyone in Kailuo's household to a sanitary and evil-free location pending the search for Kailuo. The agony of Kailuo as he lay dead underneath the stream ravaged the clan with tempests and lightning, amid heavy downpours of rain that lasted for one day and one night. All the rivers were extremely full and villages were flooded. The search was delayed due to uneasy weather conditions. Before the search, the county's witch doctor had confirmed Kailuo's death and pointed out that his deceased youngest wife had a hand in his death. The witch doctor told the clan and county officials Kailuo was attacked by twelve persons, including his youngest wife and another woman; six of them were killed by Kailuo before he was subdued and tortured to death, but she failed to give a specific place where he was buried. The search for Kailuo incriminated others who were not involved in his murder due to the witch doctor's discrepancies in her soothsaying. Innocent people were taken to the county's prison on murder charges while all the main evildoers were still at large. A number of other witch doctors were called in from all over the county to help locate Kailuo's burial.United States"},{"Title":"American Social Welfare Policy: A Pluralist Approach","review":"I read this book (in conjunction with other texts) for a graduate section of a Social Policies class, and was impressed with the ease both authors transformed the abstract and dry into something exciting and inspiring.No, social policy is not the most glamorous field for college students to enter, and unarguably the American system's shrinkage is going to pose severe problems in the next couple of years, but emotional and moral rewards of doing what is right make this venture worth it. Alternately, the authors balance this view with pragmatic political approaches that equip the reader with introductory strategies to hold off or even staunch further erosion of American social policy.The book by itself is enjoyable, but advanced classes should use the American Welfare State as a supplementary text for historical background."},{"Title":"American Social Welfare Policy: A Pluralist Approach","review":"This is truly a great book, and you'll want to keep it for a reference even after your classes.

There is no better account than Flexner's of the dogged determination of US women to achieve their political aims, or of the genius of their political inventiveness in a time in which both law and custom were against women's full participation in civic life. The achievement of the vote for women was extraordinarily difficult, infinitely more so than most people realize. In her own preface to Century of Struggle, Eleanor Flexner quotes from Carrie Chapman Catt and Nettie Rogers Schuler: \\"Hundreds of women gave the accumulated possibilities of an entire lifetime, thousands gave years of their lives, hundreds of thousands gave constant interest and such aid as they could. It was a continuous, seemingly endless chain of activity. Young suffragists who helped forge the last links in that chain were not born when it began. Old suffragists who forged the first links were dead when it ended . . .

If one has the left brain traits necessary to grasp the transfinite logic and mathematics, then the mystical implications are ungraspable. And if you have the right brain intuition to understand the mystical implications, then you often struggle with the logic and mathematics. This book requires a reader with not only a first rate mind, but also a balanced one.To briefly abstract the primary thesis: time is really motion in extra dimensional space. This is profound, for Ouspensky was the first to actually point towards where an actual, physical fourth dimension can be found. Our brains confuse this dimension with time. It can be split off from time with an adjustment, or evolution, of consciousness. You see, this represents the next huge leap in understanding the nature of the universe and reality. Just as Newton's undefined quantity of \\"gravity\\" was shown to actually be curved space, so does Ouspensky show Einstein's undefined quantity of \\"time\\" to be motion through higher physical dimensions.If you want a book that will challenge you, this is it.

Ouspensky lucidly and along definite philosophical reasonings guides the reader from our 3-dimensional world to higher dimensional realities. As humans we perceive the &quot;World&quot; not as it is, but rather as our perceptive faculties communicate it to us. Therein lies the difficulty of comprehending higher orders (our own hard wiring). Ouspensky's greatness is his ability to elucidate higher truths by straightforward analogy and reasoning. The author marries the ideas and teachings of many great thinkers into one multifaceted format. Mystical teachings are explained from a scientific slant and revolutionary scientific Ideas lead to a mystical end. The ultimate aim is to lead the reader to the ultimate truth of &quot;THOU ART THAT&quot; or &quot;I AM&quot;."},{"Title":"Tertium organum;: The third canon of thought; a key to the enigmas of the world","review":"Ouspensky's philosophy may seem dated to some, but is interesting within its historical context. At the early part of the century, physics, psychology, technologies and arts such as cinema, etc. were coming into the public consciousness. Through the mediums of the phonograph, the photograph, and the film, time and space were fractured - one didn't need to be somewhere to experience something. Our understanding of the nature of the universe had been undermined by physicists and mathematicians such as Planck and Einstein. Moreover, theosophy had a large audience (a result of these factors, to an extent). Within this mileau Ouspensky penned his work describing, to a large degree, how our perception played into things. There is a fantastic section in the book where he describes (a very film-reel-like) rotating circle and how it would be perceived by someone in a one-, two-, three-, and four-dimensional world. Then he explains that these perceptions could exist side-by-side, that it isn't the physical world that changed, but merely the perception. Given how the world seemed to be changing radically due to an increasing understanding of it (or at least our models of it), such a conclusion, while elegant and genius in its own right, seems plausible.Ouspensky's interesting background helps explain his insight - he is an early \\"out-of-the-box\\" thinker. He was a mathematician (logic, models, etc.) who was influenced by/a follower of Gurdjieff the mystic (a bit of the opposite of math, I'm afraid). Moreover, Gurdjieff, or at least interest in him and his teachings, have a lot to do with Ouspensky sticking around to the extent he has. People have explored him via their interest in Gurdjieff or later followers. That is a shame, because I think that Ouspensky's ideas are worth consideration on their own. If some seem dated, ridiculous, or quaint, look at the work of some of his contemporaries that are held in high regard (Freud comes to mind here).Another reason to consider this book, however, is its influence on a small number of influential people. For example, the American poet Hart Crane was influenced by Ouspensky's Tertium Organum, and some references can be seen in his epic poem \\"The Bridge\\" (though they may be confused with some of the Blake references/influences).Overall, I recommend the book. I found it challenging at times, but worthwhile reading. I especially think that scholars of Modernism and/or Gurdjieff will find interesting material in it. At the very least, it may change your perception of what people were thinking and discussing in the early 20th century."},{"Title":"Tertium organum;: The third canon of thought; a key to the enigmas of the world","review":"This book is amazing.

The author is well educated and has a talent for expressing his opinion in lanuage easily understood. Yet, what he promises for the reader at the begining, is not what the conclusion resulted in.

Something about the human body being nourished by different types of \\"hydrogens.\\" I dismissed most of it as incoherent new age fluff.What I do remember are the parts about Gurdjieff. He is quoted as saying that there is no \\"secret knowledge;\\" there does not need to be since most people aren't interested in taking the necessary time to learn about these systems, so the knowledge is just as \\"safe\\" if it is freely available. This ties in to another story Ousepensky relates. Gurdjieff apparently owned a rug store. A customer insisted on haggling the price of a rug far beyond what was considered reasonable. Finally Gurdjieff lost patience and offered to sell the entire stock of the store for his asking price for the one rug. The customer paused briefly, considered, then continued haggling.Gurdjieff was a charlatan and a con man, but those glimpses of his life made more of an impression on me than the blather about \\"hydrogens\\" and how A can be A and not-A. I also learned about \\"Meetings With Remarkable Men\\" which was made into a very fine and remarkably beautiful film.\\"It is either raining or not raining.It is not raining.Therefore, it is raining.\\"\\"'Yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation' yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation.\\""},{"Title":"Tertium organum;: The third canon of thought; a key to the enigmas of the world","review":"Translated from the Russian by Nicholas Bessaraboff and Claude Bragdon with an introduction by Claude Bragdon."},{"Title":"Tertium organum;: The third canon of thought; a key to the enigmas of the world","review":"Although in a genre of the mystical rejected with vehemence by a scientific age, this, the best, of Ouspensky's works, before he got caught in the morass of the Gurdjieff system, outsmarted such charges by the cogent beginning of his consideration in the works of Kant. Any metaphysical startup needs a Kant bypass routine, Ouspensky's is clever (J.G. Bennett's at the beginning of Dramatic Universe is mostly hot air). The beginning is a tour de force in its perfect pitch for an age of positivism determined it seems to make men forget what man is, and what constitutes his real evolutionary psychology. From this gambit the work is suspect in so far as this invocation of metaphysical austerity is a moment's penitence for a renewed vision of the ghostseer, yet finally it asks the question that haunts the modern technological world, with its ideologically impoverished one-dimensional man. Like Schopenhauer and Hegel together in the shadow of Kant, Ouspensky nonetheless knows he must risk the venture beyond the finished critiques of metaphysics, and his journey carries an extraordinary resemblance to the forgotten steps of Hegel's journey into his own logic of the infinite. One often suspects these reactionaries of wishing to rewrite Hegel without his modernist vein. The comparison is useful, for it reminds us that Hegel, as so often, came here in his groping fashion, and did so alone with less polish what Ouspensky finds in derivative readings of ancient texts, and brought to it the idea of freedom, where Ouspensky still labors in the murky obscurities of political antiquity. The demand for a new logic is, in principle, a perfectly acceptable move, however premature its hope, and the imperfection of the result. At the end, we are left to wonder how a man who struck this note of such charm succumbed so readily to the suspect metaphysics of Gurdjieffian hucksterism."},{"Title":"Tertium organum;: The third canon of thought; a key to the enigmas of the world","review":"\\"Tertium Organum\\", by P.D. Ouspensky (Uspenskii), a Russian mathematician-turned-mystic who studied under another Russian mystic, G.I. Gurdjieff, is characterized by its regression into Platonism with an Eastern philosophy/psychology undertone. His conception of consciousness, \\"cosmic consciousness\\", as well as his interpretation of Einstein's Theory of Relativity and fourth dimension, is highly mystical and thus has little to do with reality qua reality. The following is a comparison chart that demonstrates the difference between Aristotle's Organum and Ouspensky's Tertium Organum:Organum: A is A.A is not not-A.Each existent is either A or not-A.Tertium Organum: A is both A and not-A.orAll is A and A is all.If A is both A and not-A, how can one identify A in the first place? If Tertium Organum is true, then everything loses its identity and nothing can be known -- even Tertium Organum itself cannot be known. Ouspensky recognizes that his logic is absurd and attempts to exculpate himself from this apparent contradiction by saying, \\"We must be prepared for the fact that it is impossible to express superlogical relations (\\"higher logic\\") in our language.\\" Ouspensky's philosophy is based upon a profound mistrust and contempt for man's \\"ordinary\\" cognitive process and the power of reason. His philosophy leads to a complete denial of conceptual knowledge and his \\"higher logic\\" is a total negation of reality in the name of a \\"higher reality\\". Only those individuals profoundly dissatisfied and unhappy with reality could aspire to such a philosophy. Although, P.D. Ouspensky was one of the most brilliant Platonists in history, integrating Eastern mysticism into Platonism with remarkable intellectual sophistication, this brand of mysticism like any other is a symtom of man's default in epistemological integrity and the cause of all human suffering."},{"Title":"Tertium organum;: The third canon of thought; a key to the enigmas of the world","review":"I wrote a longer review, but it got deleted. So I'm writing a short one and hope to post a longer one later. I believe Ouspensky should not be taken seriously, because there are parts in this book where he treats objective subjects like mathematics and makes grave errors in reasoning to support his ideas. This is more disturbing in light of the fact he is called a mathematician. He mentions Aristotle, Bacon, and Einstein, but this does not mean his thought is on par with theirs. The fallacies in his logic cannot be excused by saying that people in his time were naive. After all, Einstein must have understood his own theory of relativity. Ouspensky even makes a mistake to the effect of, \\"If a square has length x, then it has area x to the xth power.\\" (It should be x squared.) If his mathematics cannot be taken seriously, why should his philosophy?"},{"Title":"Tertium organum;: The third canon of thought; a key to the enigmas of the world","review":"I agree with the previous review. The math is faulty, the philosophy the same. Ouspensky is a hack. This book is a mere curiosity, nothing more!

Although I have a fairly large Biggles collection built up since I was about 10 years old, I don't own every single Biggles book myself and I've sourced some of the synopsisii from others so I don't take credit for much of the content. Hope this helps you decide whether you want this particular Biggles book or not. For myself, I classify pretty much all the WW1 Biggles stories as 5 star as these are by far the most authentic and well written, the WW2 stories as 4 star and the remaining non-WW1/WW2 Biggles adventures as either 4 star or 3 star depending on the story. Hope it helps.First Published in August 1947 - 188 pagesRe-published in 1994 as Biggles - Flying DetectiveAir Commodore Raymond approaches Biggles, Algy, Ginger and Bertie with an interesting proposition. Now that the Second World War had ended, he could use good pilots in a new force he is forming as Assistant Commissioner at Scotland Yard. This force would be used to combat flying crooks. The formation of a force would take some time, and there was a pressing matter to deal with and that is where our heroes come in. Biggles would be offered the rank of Detective-Sergeant. Raymond informs Biggles of a spate of air related robberies involving the taking of various jewels. Biggles and the gang agree to take the job.Biggles soon realises that in order to have carried out the crimes, the planes involved would have had to have had exceptional speed and range. Enquiries lead the team to a German Airfield at Augsburg where two prototype aircraft designed by a man called Renkell have disappeared. At Augsburg, a number of clues lead Biggles to a desert oasis at El Zufra. The villains are using this as a refuelling dump and have laid land mines around the actual oasis making it a treacherous location. Bertie follows the villains and soon further investigation discovers their main base in a Sanseviera jungle in Abyssinia. Landing nearby, Biggles and Co have to investigate on foot. This leads to disaster and a final air battle is fought between Biggles in his hi-tech \\"Spur\\" aeroplane and the prototypes.Like most of the \\"Post-WW2\\" Biggles books, it's not as good as the WW2 / WW1 air combat stories."},{"Title":"An historical account of two notable corruptions of scripture: In a letter to a friend","review":"This book for me as a unitarian was a great read. The two passages he considers are still not none by many to this day. The research that is done on 1 John 5:7 was very insightful. It shows the history and who was involved in changing the passage. He does not spend to much time on why. This is just another attempt by Trinitarians to change what the bible has to say about Yahoshua. It is alarming to see the number of passages that have been changed to make this doctrine work. As some of you may or may not know Newton was a monotheist. He was going to become a minister but after years of study turned it down because of the Trinitarian position.It is also interesting to note that he felt he had to hide this fact because of fear for his life.There may be many things to say about Newton. However when he studied a subject he did it with a fevor you will not find in this present day. I guess it's just something to add to the hat of facts. Every bible passge I have seen that is considered a fraud seems to be a Trinitarin peversion of the text. Newton say this as well and held to his guns to not teach this heretic belief. This is just a snap shot of some of the evidence that lead him to this conclusion."},{"Title":"An historical account of two notable corruptions of scripture: In a letter to a friend","review":"As a former electrical engineer with a master's degree in electrical engineering, and as someone who has become spiritually enlivened as I've aged, I found Sir Isaac Newton's book on the changing Bible one I wanted to read. Also, I felt it important to pay the extra price for the hardcover.And while I'm glad I bought and read it, it goes on and on and on in regards to minor changes in scriptural text... almost like nailing in a thumbtack with a sledgehammer. It's like, after a while, I was like, \\"Okay, okay, I get it. I get it.\\" Compounding the matter is the Olde English it's written in.Is this an important text? Absolutely.Do you want to spend over $25 to read 88 pages of archaic text debating 2 minor changes in Scripture? That's your call.I'm glad I did though, and I don't regret the time or money spent. Sir Isaac Newton is a hero of mine. That doesn't mean it was fun or easy reading.The fact that you can read one Scripture passage in a variety of Bibles and get a variety of different interpretations is something serious to consider... especially when literal interpretation have caused such caustic responses over time and throughout history.Honestly, I was reminded of the game of \\"telephone line\\" my kindergarten teacher had us play. Where the message gets changed and diluted as it's passed around the circle by whispering into each others' ears.

The book gives you an out by suggesting you work for a travel agent or get one to give you a contract to be an extension of that agency. As a result you have to pay them a setup (or franchise fee) and then you have to split your commissions with them.

It was, in fact, but not quite what I expected.This book moves from Ann Davison's experiences raising goats to retrofitting a boat for sailing around the world. As the title implies, Davison's attempt to sail turns out to be star-crossed.The author does an excellent job creating an atmosphere and detailing people, places and events. She also tends to get a bit lengthy in her descriptions, and sometimes makes ambiguous references to specific people or places that are difficult to follow - given that the events take place in post-war England and the people referred to lived in England at that time. Hard to follow if you are a 21st century American reader. I would have liked a bit more information from the author to give me some reference, and therefore have better comprehension of the context of her writing.All in all, I would recommend this book to the reader who enjoys adventure stories or tales of endurance. Davison's account of the last few days spent on the Reliance are especially riveting. I would also recommend it to anyone who is contemplating making a fundamental change in their life or lifestyle that will involve considerable financial outlays or change in circumstances. This book could help point out some pitfalls to keep in mind.To the reader who is willing to dedicate the time and (slight) effort towards reading this book, I think they will find it both enlightening and gripping."},{"Title":"Last voyage ( An autobiographical account of all that led up to an illicit voyage and the outcome thereof)","review":"This is a book about endurng and thriving.

If you can find a copy, snap it up."},{"Title":"Michael Hague's Favorite Hans Christian Andersen Fairy Tales","review":"Every now and then some well-meaning person decapitates the statue of the little mermaid in Denmark. There is no need for them to bother.What worries people about Hans Anderson's story of the little mermaid is the image of a woman who is so desperate for love that she'll give up the use of her voice and will walk on feet that hurt as if knives were going through them. Having found the man she loves, she'll step aside and evaporate rather than harm her beloved. Its' an image of self-sacrifice that many women find repugnant.However I don't think the story is really about women being self-sacrificing at all. Instead it's about how much Hans Anderson himself wanted to be loved.Anderson was ugly - comically ugly and clumsy. This, combined with his poverty, meant that for much of his early life, he was an outsider who, rather like another of his creations, the little matchgirl, was always looking in at the happy, comfortable scenes of the lives of others but feeling only the cold winds of his own solitude.Convinced that he was meant to do something great - he even considered being a ballet dancer! - he hung around famous people trying to find encouragement, direction and patronage. They amused themselves at his expense but failed to notice that he was almost starving and had clothes that were too small and in rags. Possibly the image of the knives in the feet of the mermaid arose from his experience of wearing ill-fitting shoes during the frozen Danish winters.Eventually, after returning to school to learn to read and write properly, he found his voice and wrote his stories. However, he didn't have the courage to pursue the woman that he loved and, though she may well have responded to him, he lost her to another. Tormented by loneliness, he lived without the love he craved.I believe that the image of the little mermaid represents his emotions. Perhaps he felt at times as if he would gladly trade in his own hard-won powers of self-expression (just as the mermaid traded in her voice) if only he could be loved. And perhaps, when Anderson's beloved married another, he felt as if his soul had drifted away into the ether, as the little mermaid's does at the end of the story.Each of us has a deep, secret yearning to see our own image reflected in the affectionate eyes of another. His story is not meant to be a prescription for how women should behave but is really a series of poetic images that express how strong within us all the desire for love can be.Children may enjoy a biography of Anderson written by Ruth Saunders but there are many others written for adults about this complex, courageous and sad man."},{"Title":"How to Love Yourself: When No One Else Does","review":"I constantly read self-help books.

Considering the tragedies of my own personal life, I guess even I need to learn to let go and to accept some unresolved emotions and thoughts that on the conscious level, I really don't want to accept and want to really hold on to. I liked some chapters more than I liked others, but overall, it was very entertaining."},{"Title":"How to Love Yourself: When No One Else Does","review":"I desperately needed help when I've read Ariana's book when it first came out. While one of the best books on the shelves about Self-Help, and a very easy to read and follow book, it's also a very practical one. It did a magic for me.Recently I was lucky enough to meet the author in person as she was doing book signing in the local Manhattan bookstore. She is a very well educated writer in the area of self-help and psychology.I was amazed to find the author's incredible understanding and passion towards people. All of this is reflected in her book. As I understood there're more books coming out by her, and I'll be definitely the first in line. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"How to Love Yourself: When No One Else Does","review":"This book was very helpful. It's a different tone than other self help books. It's not flowery but more street wise. Ariana tells you on how to believe in yourself, love yourself, trust your own feelings and inner guidance and how not to allow others to diminish you. I truly wish I had this kind of guidance as a young person. No one told me about boundaries and trusting myself and standing up for myself. Thank you Ariana for pointing out the obvious that so many of us are not aware of.I just have one caveat for the book, hence the four stars.Ms. Allias states in the beginning how we are all \\"beautiful\\" and \\"perfect\\" already. I am not sure what she meant by this, maybe on a spiritual on very esoteric level but in the world we live in, this is not the case. Most of us are very imperfect and there are some who cause real hurt to others and who ruin the peace for others. I am sure most would not say someone who is a gang member is \\"perfect\\" or \\"beautiful\\" if that person causes strife and violence and ill in this world. I would say a more accurate statement would be that all of us do have a shining jewel of goodness within but it is up to us to remove the dross for it to shine thru. We can definitely love ourselves, though, while on our path to perfection.I would suggest this: If you are an imperfect person who is seeking to strengthen your self-esteem...love yourself NOW, as you are, while working on letting go of negative behaviors. For example, if a person has the negative habit of being hostile...ignoring this will not lead to better feelings about oneself or better relationships. It's better to recognize the problem, lovingly so, and replacing it with something better. The patient will feel better about themselves for having grown in their character. This will also add to read peace in the world. The more we clear the negative and allow our inner light and good qualities come thru and develop the more peace there will be in the world and the more inner peace one will feel.Having said that, this book made me recognize my problem like no other. I see clearly my thoughts, my insecurity, my lack of belief in myself, my abdicating my opinion about myself to others has clearly not helped me and I need to change. Ariana's opinions on other books here on Amazon has inspired me to read more. I really have to thank her, and this book, because she clearly pointed out my problem like no other book has. Thank you Ariana for starting my healing process.If Ariana writes another...I am very interested!"},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"Researching translations is never an easy task, and in this case, where you'll have to search on Amazon for the title and the translator to find what you want, it's particularly difficult.Here's what I've found by comparing several editions:1. David Grene translation: Seems to be accurate, yet not unwieldy as such. My pick. Language is used precisely, but not to the point where it's barely in English.2. Fitts/Fitzgerald translation: Excellent as well, though a little less smooth than the Grene one. Certainly not a bad pick.3. Fagles translation: Beautiful. Not accurate. If you are looking for the smoothest English version, there's no doubt that this is it. That said, because he is looser with the translation, some ideas might be lost. For instance, in Antigone, in the beginning, Antigone discusses how law compels her to bury her brother despite Creon's edict. In Fagles, the \\"law\\" concept is lost in \\"military honors\\" when discussing the burial of Eteocles. This whole notion of obeying positive law or natural law is very important, but you wouldn't know it from Fagles. In Grene, for example, it is translated to \\"lawful rites.\\"4. Gibbons and Segal: Looks great, but right now the book has only Antigone (and not the rest of the trilogy) and costs almost 3x as much. I'll pass. But, from a cursory review, I'm impressed with their work.5. MacDonald: This edition received some good write-ups, but I wasn't able to do a direct passage-to-passage comparison.6. Woodruff: NO, NO, NO. Just NO. It's so colloquial it makes me gag. Very accessible, but the modernization of the language is just so extreme as to make it almost laughable. You don't get any sense of the power of language in the play. You just get the story. If you want this to be an easy read, then get Fagles, not this.7. Kitto: Looks good, though not particularly compelling over either Grene or Fitzgerald (or Gibbons if I wanted to pay so much more).8. Roche: Practically unreadable the English is so convoluted. Might be the most literal translation, but what's the point unless you are learning Greek and want such a direct translation.9. Taylor: Way too wordy. Might be more literal, but again, why?Hope this all helps. Translations can make or break the accessibility of literature. Pick wisely."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"American educators frequently treat &quot;Antigone&quot; as one of the more accessable classics that can be easily digested and understood by their students. Usually this is because those pedagogues reduce Antigone to a simple matter of conflict between the individual and the state. Debates are arranged between students, and most of them sympathize with the individual, while a few justify the exigencies of the state. Although the individual (represented by Antigone) is at odds with the state (personified by Creon), to focus on that specific conflict is to fundamentally misunderstand the play.Sophocles was not interested in who was in conflict with whom as much as he was interested in the nature of conflict itself. The showdown between Antigone and Creon is unavoidable because each is justified--even required--to perform the actions that ensue. In Ancient Greek society almost every facet of life fell under the domain of one or more of the gods. The gods of the family require Anigone to remove the body of her brother from its humiliating public exposure on the city walls. On the other hand, the gods of the state require Creon to punish traitors and to rigorously uphold the law. Each party is invested with a compelling moral duty and each is acting on behalf of a culturally sanctioned institution (family, state). In this sense, the conflict between Antigone and Creon isn't one between individual and state but between justifiable moral imperitives.I can understand why educators, particularly in the U.S., focus on issues of individual and state in &quot;Antigone&quot;. It's easy to grasp and it's as contemporary as arguments about abortion or the NRA. But I think students would gain a deeper understanding of the play and of their own lives if educators took it one step further and talked about the play's depiction of inevitable, mutually justifiable conflict. This is especially crucial in today's world where conflicts of the worse sort are perpetuated by each party's fundamental sense of legitimacy and justification."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"&quot;Antigone&quot; is that kind of literary work that invites opposing views. The state and the individual, the duties to family and country, the boundaries of legitimate government and the extent of personal choice, are all elements that find a voice in this play, an extraordinary gift of Western culture to the world. The young and stubborn Antigone finds herself breaking the law that her uncle, the old and stubborn Kreon, has enacted. This is Oedipus' family, so there must be bloodshed. The conflict develops out of the vengeful and, ultimately foolish law that Kreon has come up with, which denies burial rituals to one of Antigone's brothers (Polyneices) because he had sided with foreigners and made war against his city. Antigone claims that Justice (dik&eacute;) tells her to care for her brother's body in spite of his treason. This is what Kreon, blind with hatred, cannot see. Just as Oedipus, and even worse, Kreon imagines conspiracies where there are none, and is convinced that the entire city is seething with traitors waiting for a signal to bring him down. With such a state of mind, he charges against Antigone, and she is very much her father's daughter: she will not bow before her uncle although the consequences are grave. Kreon represents the state, but a state whose laws are capricious at best, and simply bad and hurtful at worst. Antigone is not easy to love or like: she is bent on following a path that will lead to her death, welcoming such a release from the terrible burden of being who she is: daughter of her brother Oedipus and granddaughter of her mother Jocasta. But Antigone's own prickly character makes her struggle all the more admirable, since it is so dificcult to like her. It would have been relatively easy to create a soft, misunderstood heroine who dies for her convictions. Antigone is a strong woman who knows perfectly well what she is doing, but feels she has a duty to do it. She is harsh toward the timid Ismene, and unsparing of Kreon, the ruler who seems to be a far better warrior than a governor. I know there are readings of this play that see Kreon as representing &quot;democracy&quot; (he asks the chorus to lead him when they go after Antigone, attempting to prevent her death), while Antigone would represent the corrupt values of the reactionary aristocracy that puts family before civic duty. I think this is a serious misreading of a very important play: Kreon is no more democratic than Antigone; they are both immersed in a power play: she from an apparent position of weakness, although she is strong, and he from an apparent position of strength which he tries to reinforce with harsh measures and words toward those who dare violate his laws. Antigone is no &quot;reactionary.&quot; Her father had been Tyranos (ruler without the negative connotations of tyrant) in Thebes, which is exactly the same position that Kreon holds now. If Antigone is an aristocrat, so is Kreon, Jocasta's brother. If Antigone only sees duty toward her family (she actually sees duty &quot;mostly&quot; towards her family), Kreon is deranged in power, believing that vast conspiracies are at work and that only he stands between order and utter chaos, a common feature of dictators great and petty. His law regarding the body of Polyneices violates the sphere of female duty (women were in charge of the rituals for the dead), and spills into the netherworld, ruling against a dead man who has paid with his life for his acts. This law also punishes Antigone and Ismene just for being family: they cannot even mourn Polyneices. Clearly this is not the working of &quot;democracy&quot; in our modern sense of the word, but neither it is the faulty, deeply troubled democracy of the Greek city-states. The chorus tells Kreon that he can enact such laws and condemn people to death because he is the ruler, but it does not tell him that he is right. To see Kreon as defender of democracy and Antigone as a reactionary woman who has no civic duty is to find obscure meanings where there are none. Sophocles is quite clear at the play's end regarding what was right and who was wrong. This is a political play, written and produced in a highly sophisticated and political society 2500 years ago. It is obvoius that &quot;Antigone&quot; has lost none of its power and ability to make us debate, ponder, and discuss laws, government, individuals, and those who rule over them."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"In preparing to read Antigone, I looked at several translations before making my decision. By far, the Greek Tragedy in New Translations' version of Sophocles' Antigone was the supreme. By offering an introduction, mythical background, appendix, and author's note, the reader is able to easily become aquainted with the background surrounding the play's storyline. The version captures the original spirit of the play in the spelling of the Greek names, and in the whole body of the translation itself. The perfect edition for those studying The Antigone!"},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"&quot;Antigone,&quot; the drama by Sophocles, has been published as part of the Dover Thrift Edition series. The Dover version is translated into English by George Young. An introductory note states that the play was first performed in the 440s BCE.The introductory note also includes a brief summary of events leading up to the events of this play. &quot;Antigone&quot; concerns the family of Oedipus, former ruler of the city-state of Thebes. As &quot;Antigone&quot; opens, Thebes is ruled by Creon, the brother-in-law of Oedipus. Creon is at odds with his niece, Antigone, because he denies a proper burial to Antigone's brother Polynices. Antigone's intention to defy her uncle sets this tragedy in motion.This is a powerful story about familial duty, social customs, gender roles, and the relationship between the individual and governmental authority. The issues in this play remain relevant today, and are powerfully argued by Sophocles' characters. At the heart of the play is this question: Is it right to disobey a law or edict that one feels is unjust?But &quot;Antigone&quot; is not just a philosophical meditation; it's also the story of a very personal clash between two strong-willed members of a very troubled extended family. A bonus in the play is the appearance of the seer Tiresias: it is a small but potent role. Overall, this play is a solid example of why ancient Greek drama has stood the test of time."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"Antigone is perhaps the first tragedy to elaborate directly on the subjects of personal, family moral imperatives, against the collective moral imperatives of the State. Although from a sentimental point of view it is easy to root for Antigone, we have to understand Creon's position: Polyninces has been a traitor to the State and deserves to be punished.The plot: After Oedipus's death, his twin sons fight in different factions. Etheocles defends Thebes while Polynices attacks it at the siege. Eventually they kill each other simultaneously. After the battle is over, Thebes's king Creon orders that Polynices must remain unsepulted (as was the custom in Greece) and that whoever tries to bury him must also die. This is a terrible order for Antigone, the younger sister of the clashing twins, who feels that it is her duty as a sister to bury both of her brothers and not just one. The personal, family morality requires her to do her duty; political responsibility requires Creon to impose an exemplary punishment on the one who betrayed his city (for whatever reason). Although the plot is very well known, I'll conclude by saying that the dramatic tension is extreme, and that the ending is terribly violent. This play's subtitle could be &quot;Political order vs. human dignity&quot;, or even better &quot;Sometimes, moral dilemmas just can't be resolved&quot;. Of course, it is one great source for Western literature and philosophy and it is a Classic all around."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"Having taught &quot;Antigone&quot; for years in various translations, I thought I'd try the Dover Thrift Edition. It's a disaster; it's unteachable. It's a Victorian translation that renders the play into contorted, archaic, unreadable fake Shakespeare. The Dover Thrift Editions have in many ways been a real boon for college students, but don't bother with this one. It makes me suspicious of the rest of Dover's Greek drama translations."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"Braun's translation does a good job of capturing the dramatic intensity of Sophocles' play, but his translation isn't as close to the original language as other translations available"},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"&quot;Antigone&quot; (probably first performed about 442 B. C.) is another tragedy centered on the flaw of stubborn pride. It also presents the conflict between secular law and divine law. A stubborn King Creon of Thebes refuses to allow the equally stubborn Antigone to bury the body of her brother Polynices despite the entreaties of Creon's wife and son. Creon orders her death but she commits suicide, as does Creon's wife and son. The play has excellent characterizations. It has a very tragic tone and the suspense is exceptionally effective. But, make sure you get a good translation!"},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"The moral of this play is simple. The question: is man (or in this case, woman) justified in breaking the laws of the state, supposing those laws are contrary to the higher system of laws the man (or woman) obeys? For example, should a man break a temporal law if it compromises his religious or moral beliefs? In this play, Sophocles addresses this issue, though he doesn't necessarily resolve it.The dilemma is posed in the form of Antigone, the daughter of the late Oedipus. Her brother, Polyneices, rebelled against the state, and was killed while attacking his homeland. Because of this treachery, Creon, the new king, declares that Polyneices will not have a proper burial, but will instead be left exposed to rot. Antigone decides that her first loyalty is familial, and provides her brother with a crude burial. As a result, she is condemned to death.This is a very difficult question, one which has been debated even until today. For example, Thomas Paine touched on it in Common Sense, and Thoreau focused on it in his famous essay &quot;Civil Disobedience,&quot; which in turn influenced Gandhi, Martin Luther King, and others. Clearly this is a question which has perplexed the ages, and this is one reason why this play is still so important today.This issue will continue to exist, and so will this remarkable play produced by one of the greatest playwrights in history."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"Sophocles' Antigone is the first Greek tragedy that I have ever studied and let alone read. Although the reading was difficult at times I managed to successfully find my way through it. I enjoyed the depth of the story and ultimatley it's message.In the Greek theatre often their stories struggled with the idea of fate and destiny and Antigone is no diffrent. The decisions and actions of every character unfolded a seperate consequence. Sophocles wrote with the purpose of showing an example of a family who suffered from the sins of the father. Sophocles main point in Antigone was to display the importance of how pride and lack of wisdom can have devastating consequences.The story of Antigone opens explaining to the reader that there had been a war in which Antigone's two brothers had killed eachother. The war began because of one brother's pride and desire for power. Their pride ultimatly lead to their death. Every descison that has been made before this has lead this family to great disaster. Antigone is now left with a choice to obey a ruling or as she feels dishonor her family. Antigone's bold attitude seems rare for a women of this time. I believe that this is what makes the actions she takes so much more daring. Women were not seen as significant in this time and culture.Towards the end of the play Creon has recognized his pride as the reason for some devastating events that have taken place. He says on page 50, \\"Woe is me! To none else can they lay it, this guilt,but to me! I,was,the slayer,I say it,unhappy,of thee!We all are faced with the consequences of our actions. The play closes with the chorus saying the lines, \\"Wisdom first for a man's well being maketh, of all things. Heaven's insistence nothing allows of a man's irreverance;and great blows great speeches avenging. Dealt on a boaster. Teach men wisdom in age, at last.\\"Another significant aspect of Antigone is the title. The fact that Sophocles was willing to use a women's name as the title made a statement in this culture.There are three things that I have personally taken away from this reading. The first thing is more on an external level. I have had the opportunity to read and understand a Greek tragedy. As a future theatre major I consider this significant. As a current theatre student I find this knowledge incredibly important. I also understand know where theatre originated and it's reasons for coming about.A second lesson that I have taken away from this reading is the significance of pride. I know that in my own heart pride is something that I struggle with in some areas. In Antigone Creon's pride destroyed him, his family, a place he loved, and a power he couldn't resist. Pride plays a major part in the play because of the consequences resulting from it. As a Christian pride can also have devastating effects on your heart and it must be dealt with and corrected before it effects your decisions.Antigone and Creon both had views that could be seen as right, but each person's pride destroyed them.The third thing that I have learned from this reading is the reality of choices. Sometimes we make choices on impulse or feeling and some may not be popular. Choices that have effects that leave lasting marks and have devastating realities. There are also the choices that can help and benefit us. These choices may be difficult when we are in the midst of them but they have amazing results after we go through with our decision.I truly enjoyed reading Antigone and highly recommend it for others. Whether your an avid theatre goer or just someone who loves to read, Antigone holds an important lesson we all can learn from."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"I think that the play was positive, in a sense. It taught a lot of life lessons that almost any person can learn. It also gave a good impression of the Greek plays and the Greek tragedies. Not only does Antigone teach us lots of important life lessons, it also shows the importance of all people, whether big or small or male or female. This specific play shows us the importance of our inner selves.I think that one of the main reasons that Sophocles wrote the play was to teach the Ancient Greeks and possibly us today, many significant things about roles of women. In the beginning of the play, Antigone and Ismene are arguing about whether to bury their brother, Polynices, or not. Ismene stands up for the law and says that they should submit and obey. But Antigone says that they, as women, should stand up for themselves and to stand up for what is right. This scene clearly shows this main point of Sophocles writing the play.Another main point of Sophocles writing the play is that he wants us, as humans, to look deeper into the souls of other human beings. In another scene of the play, Creon and Antigone are arguing over whether it was right or not to bury Polynices. Creon is sticking to his law, saying that Polynices was a traitor and didn't deserve a proper burial, yet Antigone is saying that no one should have to die without being honored afterward. Creon didn't even look at Antigone's point of view. He didn't even give a single person a chance to say their opinion. Creon's defiance shows this main point of Sophocles writing the play.I have learned that all human beings, especially women, have a very important role in society. We all work together in living in an environment that is suitable to work and grow in. Without each kind of human being, the whole fabric of society would unwind.I would recommend this play because anyone can learn at least one thing from it, whether it be the importance of women's role in society or looking deeper into others, besides what you see on the outside."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"Oedipus had two sons and two daughters. Oedipus died and his oldest son came to rein. When time came for the younger brother to have a turn, the older brother started a fight. Both brothers died leaving Creon to rein with their two sisters, Antigone and Iseme. Creon ordered the younger son tobe buried but the older son to stay unburied. He said anyone who burys him shall die, because they believed that a soul will wander the earth if not buried and the gods law said everyone shall be buried and Creon disobeyed. Antigone went and buried him and when she came back she got in an arguement with Iseme. The guards told Creon and they unburied the body again. Antigone came back and buried the body. Creon tried to change Antigones mind and keep it a secret but she refused. Iseme was brought before Creon and he asked if she helped and she said yes. Antigone quarrled with Iseme that Iseme chose life and she chose death but she didn't want to be the only decendent of Oedipus left. Heamen, Creons only son and was engaged to Antigone, pleaded with his father to save Antigone for him and th people. Creon ignored him and Antigone was sent into a cave with little food and water and it was sealed. Heamens voice cried out of the cave instead of Antigone. Creon ordered the guards to unseal it. Creon went in and saw Antigone hung herself and Heamens sword drawn. Creon backed into the corner as Heamen advanced foward. Just then he turned the sword on himself and fell next to Antigone dead. The news reached the queens ears and she killed herself. Creon, although alive and well, felt dead and continued to rule.Sophocles main purpose for writing this tragedy was even though God told you to obey your authority, if it goes against His word, you stand up for what you think is right. Antigone obeyed the gods and Creon didn't and so even though it disobeyed, she did the right thing in the gods eyes. I have learned to stand up for what you beleive. A life lesson example is the government thinks that christians should not talk about their religon because it might offend others so they started taking out the ten commandments in the supreum court and \\"under one God\\" out of the pledge of aligence in public schools and that the teachers and students should not have a bible or speak about their God in the schools.I didn't like the play that much because I couldn't understand it very well. Although it is a very confusing book for some people, I reccomend it to those who like to try and interrupet it."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"Antigone is a very powerful and positive play in the fact that it teaches many life lessons to be learned. When people read a book or play, they do not take the time to focus on what they can learn from that book or play. With Antigone, the story lays out positive, life lessons that would only take a few moments to think about.When Sophocles wrote his play Antigone, I think he had a very good point in holding an opposite position to his city's laws. In the time that Sophocles lived in, they looked down upon women. Women were not to be held high, they were not to speak against the law, and they were not to overcome a man. But, the main character in this play, a woman, did all these things. She defied the city's laws and overcame a man. In fact, by having a woman as the main character, the title of the play, and having the story revolve around her, Sophocles became famous. This could very well be a great reason why Sophocles wrote this play.In the beginning of this play we have Creon, as king, holding his position of keeping his law. He sees himself as right, he will not have a woman win over him. He is prideful. Throughout the whole play, we constantly see Creon making prideful statements, followed by the chorus stating that those who have pride will come to an end. Finally, at the end of the play, when all is lost, Creon gets a taste of what the chorus was talking about. May be Sophocles wanted us to learn this lesson as well.From these two examples we have two possible reasons why Sophocles has written Antigone. The main reason why Sophocles wrote Antigone, in my opinion, is the latter. When we use the example of women standing up for what is right and men holding their ground, it is good. But it really doesn't pertain to today's times. True, women still have restrictions on what they can do, but we really can't draw a lesson from the story. On the contrary, using Creon's example gives us a picturesque lesson of pride that we all can learn. It is often the last part of a story or book that is the hardest to end. I think Sophocles did an excellent job. The last line says, \\"Teach men wisdom is age, at last.\\" Creon throughout the whole play is very proud. But at the end, we see here that Creon's pride was finally torn down by the destruction that went on around him. That prideful people can be taught is what I think Sophocles wanted his readers to learn.Before I read Antigone, I had been learning an important lesson in my life. When I walked through the halls, and I thought to myself, \\"How can people act like that, do they really think that's cool?\\" I was judging them; I was putting myself above them. I was saying that I was better than them. From reading Antigone, I learned the lesson doubly that the proud and arrogant will be taught their ways are wrong. When Jesus came to earth, He hung out with every crowd. He did not exclude, judge, put himself higher, or possess arrogance towards anyone. If I am supposed to be like Christ, why am I so proud? Why am I putting myself above others when we are all exactly equal? It's because I'm human. And that's what humans want to do- is put themselves higher than others. But I am called to be not of this world, to not be how humans want to be. I am called to be like Christ, to conform to His Word. And His Word teaches to not be proud.Although Antigone is written a little hard to understand, and in a historical setting, I would highly recommend it. Americans these days do not take the time to read a historical book or play that could have a great impact on them. They see the \\"thy, and thou,\\" and they put it down and pick up a book they can understand. My challenge to you is to pick up Antigone, read it, and try to understand the lesson that Sophocles wanted you to learn. It could change your life."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"I think that Sophocles' Antigone was both a good story and a not so good story. I liked the story because it was an interesting plot with all the twists and turns and all the foreshadowing and parallels made between the gods and the characters. One reason that I did not like it was because it was hard to understand. The language was different from the modern language that I am used to and therefore it was a little confusing at times. Also I am not familiar with the Greek gods so at times, I did not catch all the comparisons between them and the characters.I believe that Sophocles' main point in writing this story was to teach a lesson. The point of Greek tragedies were to teach religious lessons to the characters and also to the audience. One of the main points of the story was about hubris. About the characters' pride. Creon was a very prideful man, and was not willing to admit his mistakes until the conclusion of the play when he had nothing left. When the consequences of his choices were irreversible. Sophocles' might have been trying to point out the damage that pride can do and expose it for the problem it really is. Not only does pride affect yourself, but the choices that you make also affect other people. Pride has a rippling effect.Creon's pride was very evident when he would not admit that he was in the wrong for not burying Pericles in the first place. When Antigone defied his order, his pride began to take its toll. He would now have to obey his own order and kill her for going against him. By killing Antigone, he was killing his son, Haemon, emotionally. Haemon was to be married to Antigone and now was destined to be without his love. When the guards began to entomb Antigone, they realized that she had hung herself and when Haemon saw that she was gone, he killed himself at her feet.Creon's pride once again ripples into someone else's life. His wife, Eurydice, hears of her son's suicide and quietly leaves. She goes into her room and then slits her throat. When hearing about Eurydice's death as well, he finally admits his mistake. \\"No one is guilty of the deed but I alone. Would that the last blessing might come to me, the day that ends my life. Lead me then forth a thing of naught, who slew his son and wife. All is lost and on my head is a doom too hard to bear.\\"From this book, I have learned that when I think that my decisions only affect me, I'm wrong. My decisions affect other people just as much and possibly more than they affect me. When I have a decision to make, whether big or small, I should consider others as well as myself when making these choices. I should not be selfish and do what's only best for me, but also what is best to the people that the results could affect.I would recommend this play despite some difficulties in comprehension because of the important lessons that Sophocles attempts to get across to the audience. They are life lessons that everyone should hear and learn. These lessons are essential for life. They teach people the social skills that they need in order to live in a world centered around other people and their lives."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"I had a positive response to the book Antigone because of the fact that some good life lessons were included in the story. I didn't really understand all the words of the story because it was one of those old stories written back in the olden days.Sophocles wrote a good story and added along a couple of life lessons in there that we teenagers would understand because Antigone was around our age and made the same mistakes that we do. The main thing with Antigone was that when she made a mistake, she wanted everyone to know that she did it, and no one else could take the blame for her. She was too prideful and she thought that she was the best when she had done wrong things. When she was about to meet her fate, the words she quoted were \\"I know I would die but pity me anyway.\\" She doesn't even care that she is going to die. While I was reading this book, I thought Antigone had the most pride I have ever read or seen being displayed.From this book I have personally learned that I will never try to show as much pride as Antigone. Actually the main downfall for every body in the book and in real life is pride. The second lesson is to get wisdom before we die. The last six lines in the chorus on page 52 say, \\"Teach men wisdom in age, at last.\\" That is saying that we need to gain or get wisdom before the end of life.I would recommend this book to others because even though the words are hard to understand, the book packs a lot of life lessons. I thought this book was going to be boring, but getting in our discussion groups and answering questions, hearing everyone's opinion kind of woke me up and got me interested in this book."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"I think that reading this book would be a positive experience for anyone who can understand it. It has a couple of good morals it communicates to the reader, and it has some hidden points that the reader is allowed to decipher.Sophocles was trying to get across several points in this play. Firstly, in the time of this play being written, women were subjugated and considered sub-class citizens. Throughout the play, though, the main character and the play's namesake, Antigone(An-tig-oh-nee), who is a woman, fights for her right to act out against the orders of Creon(Kree-on), the king of her home city of Thebes. Creon signifies the typical male ruler at that time. He is domineering, overbearing, and a power hungry chauvinist who cannot stand to be wrong under any circumstances. He clashes with Antigone over the burial of her brother Polynices, who fought her other brother for control of the city. In anger over having his orders defied, let alone by a woman, Creon has Antigone locked in a sort of makeshift dungeon, wherein she eventually hangs herself. It seems throughout the play that the gods are on the side of Antigone, such as when they send a dust storm to bury Polynices, but Creon doggedly pursues his own interests and desires through it all. Thus, the reader is led to side with Antigone from the very beginning, cheering for the heroine, an unusual choice for a play in Sophocles' time.However, there are some secondary points being communicated here. For one thing, the &quot;hubris&quot; or pride of Creon and Antigone eventually leads to the death of not only Antigone, but also Haemon, Creon's son, and Creon's wife. This illustrates the point that pride not only affects us, but those who we come into contact with and are around us. Also, Antigone chooses to go with not only her gut, but also with the gods, and go against the government. I believe that this is Sophocles' way of communicating to us that though the government can be flawed, especially when it's choices are fundamentally and morally wrong, taking a stand against it may be costly, as it is to Antigone in the play.While reading this play, I learned mostly about the effects of pride on a person's life. The Bible says that &quot;Pride goeth before a fall&quot;, but what is not said is that the fall will be just of the person who has pride. As an example, Haemon did not have a strong issue with pride, but he suffered because of the stubbornness of Antigone and his father, Creon. Creon's wife is hardly mentioned throughout the play, and never seems to come in contact with Antigone, but her life is ended by the squabble as well. Antigone's sister, Ismene(Iss-may-nee) also suffers, because she loses her last sibling due to the rivalry.I would recommend this reading to other readers, but I would warn that the poetry is extremely difficult to understand, and that if they have trouble with Shakespeare or other older poets, then they might not want to read this, or at least get the Cliff's Notes."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"AntigoneMatthew Newkirk10-15-03Drama, Mr. PadenAntigone is good story if you want a story that has a good plot but is semi-difficult to understand. It was a bad story because it was hard to follow because it was written in the play format. For someone that has not so good reading comprehension it will take a little bit more time for them to get the meaning of the story, and the message the author (Sophocles) was trying to get across.I believe that Sophocles' purpose in writing this play can be summarized into three main points. I believed that the first purpose was to shock the audience because for a woman to be the lead character in a play was truly controversial for that time period. The reason I know this is because if you look at any other play of his time period the main character was most often a man.Another reason for him writing this was to give women of the day a ray of hope that maybe these people will eventually admit that women can have good ideas. I know this because Antigone's belief that you should obey the gods also lines up with some world-views of today. For example Christians believe that you should not do anything that does not line up with God's word despite what the government says.The third and final reason I believe Sophocles wrote this was to relay to the audience that too much pride can kill a man. It may not kill him physically but it can kill him mentally and physically too. For example at the end of the play the gods would not let Creon (king of Thebes) die because that was their way of retribution for wrongs that people have committed.This play also has some very good life lessons that everyone can apply to their lives personally. The first life lesson that I personally could apply is not to let pride and fame and fortune get in the way of what really matters, like family and friends. Another lesson is to not be afraid to admit your mistakes and to take advice in the council of others. These are two life lessons I got out of this story.I would recommend this play because it is a good tool to use if you are trying to learn what will happen if you do not seek the council of others."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"Antigone is a well composed play with a deep and twisted plot. This reading was very enlightening with respects to the ancient Grecian culture in the time of Sophocles. It gave a clear insight into the way women were treated, how the government was guided in correlation to their gods and their people, and how important it is to take advice when it is given. Proverbs 11:14 says, \\"For lack of guidance a nation falls, but many advisers make victory sure.\\" In Sophocles' drama, Antigone, the king, Creon, had many wise counselors and advisors, but chose to act on his own will which led to utter despair in his life. This translation into English is a little difficult to understand, but provides a more precise view of the way life would have been conducted in 440 B.C.Dramas were written not only for entertainment, but also to teach moral lessons from good and evil. Sophocles posed, in this drama, a complex situation in which uncle turns against niece, because of apparent disobedience to his sound laws. Creon had ordered that the carcass of her brother be placed on display for his act of treason to his country. Antigone then risked everything to save the family name, only to be condemned to die a slow death of starvation in a cave. This blood that was being shed, was of course innocent and in no way deserving of death. Creon, knowing his way was best, sent her away anyhow to live out her last days friendless and starving. A series of terrible acts occur where his son and wife kill themselves out of grief and he is left with a heavy, dying heart. Creon mourns,\\"Alas, I faint for dread!Is there none will dealA thrust that shall lay me deadWith the two-edged steel?\\"~page 50~Sophocles' play defines two morals that intertwine all of life then and life now. This is: if you teach wisdom and discretion, pride will not overcome you. \\"Before his downfall a man's heart is proud, but humility comes before honor.\\" (Proverbs 18:12) The virtuous characters in Antigone die because of the lack of discretion displayed by an arrogant king and his disdainful young niece. Sophocles also produces a feeling of charity towards Creon in the very end when he discovers the error of his ways. He wails,\\"O sins of a mindThat is minded to stray!Mighty to bindAnd Almighty to slay...Ah yes, I have learnt,I know my wretchedness!\\"~page 48~Knowing that he had caused death to come upon those he cherished, Creon, the King of Thebes, felt as though he would rather die than live on with unbearable guilt. Once something has been done, no one has the power to recant it. In the ancient Greek culture, it was very important to learn from your mistakes, as is obvious when Sophocles writes,\\"Wisdom first for man's well-beingMaketh, of all things, Heaven's insistenceNothing allows of man's irreverence;And great blows speeches avenging,Death on a boalsterTeach men wisdom in age, at last.\\"~page 52~I am personally impressed with the way the ancient Greek's composed their tragedy and comedy acts, especially in Oedipus Rex and Antigone. Many lessons may be learned from their twisted plots and compelling emotion. I have learned three main morals from this dramatic play, Antigone. These are: 1) submit to God and His Will for your life, 2) love your family enough to want to risk everything to save them from harm and 3) when advice is given by those who fear God, apply it and do not ignore it. God certainly inspired Sophocles to know the precise words and perfect plot to animate the Biblical principles of \\"Pride cometh before a fall\\" and \\"love your neighbor as yourself\\".In conclusion, I would highly recommend this dramatic play to everyone! If you like Shakespeare, you'll love this! It draws you into its plots and entangles you in a web of anticipation and confusion. Though the family line of characters is a bit mangled, it is still easy to follow and understand."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"Great drama.

However, because it is such a short play, it would be easy to miss the depth and layers of meaning contained within it. This is what makes the contributing essays included in this volume invaluable, especially to those of us not well-versed already in classic Greek history, mythology and drama.The supplementary material consists of a 50-plus page general introduction by Walter James Miller, and a more specific 7 page analysis by David Grene of Sophocles' development of a particular idea in his Theban dramas.Miller's contribution gives us an overall view of the historical, political, and cultural background of Sophocles' life, and how those factors were pertinent to 'Antigone'. Since this book was published in 1970, his view on the relevance of 'Antigone' was influenced by the political and cultural upheavals of the 60's, particularly the rebellion of youth against the establishment. Therefore, he tends to focus on the idea of Antigone's 'civil disobedience' to an unjust dictator, and equates it to the events which were happening around him as he wrote.While Miller's commentary sometimes seemed so simplistic as to be aimed at high-school sophomores, at least it has the merit of not being overly abstruse. Most importantly, he supplies us with information about the mythological references contained in the play, as well as the legendary and historical background which provides a meaningful basis for the drama. Greek playgoers of the time would have already been as familiar with this background as we are today with our traditions of Thanksgiving or Christmas, so there is a lot of assumed common knowledge contained in the dialog we would miss without these commentaries.More interesting to me was the shorter analysis by David Grene of Sophocles' Theban plays. Grene expounds the point that while the conflict between Antigone and Creon is the most obvious feature of the play, there are other,more subtle ideas at play here, which give an even deeper, psychological, emphasis to the drama. 'Antigone' must be seen within the context of the development of a theme, the thread of which runs through not only that play, but also 'Oedipus the King', 'Philoctetes', and 'Oedipus at Colonus'.The theme development alluded to is that of the inseparability of good and evil within the same person, of which Creon was the first, and crudest, example within this group of plays. A man can be consciously innocent, yet objectively guilty. A hero's greatness is fatally alloyed with some disgusting weakness. For me, Grene's remarks added another dimension to what I already considered a great work.This book, commentaries as well as play, took only a few hours to read, and was well worth the expenditure of time. I felt it was valuable in itself, but also as a stimulus to explore further the work of the classical Greek dramatists."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"The condition of the book is good, the pages are like new, but the pages are out of order.

Or the obedience and shyness of Ismene, who happens to be Creon's niece, and how she will not help her own sister burry their brothers body, because of the fact that she doesn't want to displease Creon and the empire although she knows that she should. Finally, there is also Antigone, the strong a stubborn girl who defiles her uncle/guardian/king Creon, because he has order that her brother cannot be buried, and that it will be eaten by the beasts and wild animals, because of what he has done. However, the characters are not the only interesting part of the play, the themes are also amazing containing such things as betrayal, disobedience, murder, suicide, and much more. Leaving a positive reading without a doubt. Also, Sophocles (the writer of the play) did an excellent job of getting his main point across. The main purpose of the play Antigone, though uncertain at the very beginning is shown more and more through out the play, especially in the chorus. However, if you cannot catch on to what the chorus is saying all the time the very last few lines should help quite abit, \\" Wisdom first for a man's well-being maketh, of all things. Heavens insistence nothing allows of man's irreverence; And great speeches avenging, Dealt on a boaster, teach men wisdom in age, at last.\\" If nothing the last sentence should diffidently tell you that the whole purpose of this play is Sophocles trying to show us the importance of wisdom and how one bad mistake can lead to the death of many, as well as the fall of a kingdom. Which, is diffidently something that I learned reading this play. Just reading and showing how the anger of one man and how one choice that he made without thinking of the consequences of his choice lead to the death of his niece, his son, his wife, and even his whole kingdom, just kind of shows that you should be care full about some of the choices you make because you never know what will happen (it may not be as extreme but bad stuff can still happen). However when its all said and done I believe that this is a great play that anyone can enjoy. There is only one warning that I must also give though, the script can be very hard to read and may require you to have to look it over a few times or even get the scripts with the translation on the opposite side. Other then that the play is great and I diffidently suggest it to others."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"\\"Antigone\\" (441 BC), written by Sophocles, is a very old and well-known play. It is a tragedy, because in the end things go wrong for nearly every everyone. I say nearly for everybody because if you pay attention when you read this book, you will have enjoyed a good play, and appreciated the various themes the author tackles in it. So, in that case, things won't go wrong for you :)The plot is not complicated. Creon is a king, and Antigone is his niece. Creon orders that Antigone's brother, recently killed, must remain without sepulture, due to the fact that he was a traitor. The punishment for anybody who defies his orders will be death. Despite knowing that, Antigone cannot help but think her duty forces her to give sepulture to her brother, and in the end does exactly that. Alas, she is discovered, and of course everything goes downhill from that moment onwards.Several dichotomies are defined in the play, the main ones being \\"Individual versus State\\" (that is, Antigone versus Creon), \\"Conscience versus Law\\" (that is, Antigone following her conscience even though she know she doesn't respect the law) and \\"Divine Law versus Human Law\\". Antigone and Creon defend what each of them considers to be right, the first one justice, and the other one the law of the city. But which one has priority when they clash? And who should decide that?All in all, I enjoyed this play. I read it at university some years ago, for History of Political ideas, as an introduction to Greek thought. The above mentioned themes are considered repeatedly by different Greek philosophers, but also by many other thinkers of different nationalities throughout time. Why did (and does) that happen? Read this play, and find your answer, or pose more questions. You won't be alone...Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"In this part to the Oedipus trilogy; Antigone's brother dies and she has to fight to bury him. Her uncle disagrees with here and that's basically what this sequel is all about. This story is very easy reading. Recommended for ages 15 and olderThis is the second story in the trilogy, and in my opinion it is the best one out of the three. Although all of them are fairly easy to read this one was the easiest for me. For the most part it kept me occupied. Sophocles wrote this in such a way that I actually get into the story. How Sophocles writes this is what I like the most, it's not like a Shakespeare play where you have no clue what is going on because it's really old English. Although this is still an old play it pretty easy to figure out what is going on in it. I would highly recommend that you read the first one before you read this one because there is a lot of information that your need to know from the first one."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"Oedipus was the ruler of Thebes. Oedipus killed his father and married his mother. He had four kids by his wife (mother), two sons Eteocles and Polynices and two daughters Antogone and Ismene. In result Oedipus blinded himself and he put a curse on his sons. The curse was that his sons will kill each other fighting over their father's kingdom. This curse came true. Also his wife (mother) committed suicide. This is how Creon, the brother of Eurydice became king of Thebes. This play was hard to understand but as you read along, you understand it better.I think Sophocles' main idea for writing this play, is to express the importance of family values. Even though Antigone never had a close relationship with her brother, Polynices, and the fact that he defied his country, she still thought it was important that he have an appropriate burial. Also when Antigone told Ismene that she was going to bury her brother, Ismene told Antigone not to bury him for the sake of her life. This means that if she buried her brother, Polynices, she would be killed by Creon. Ismene still loved her sister and she wanted to take the blame for burying their brother so Antigone would not have to die. It was very brave that Antogone the disobeyed the government, Creon's law stating that she could not bury her brother. She was a woman and she disobeyed the law, this was unusual because women were not allowed to make decisions. Women were not very important. If you were a woman, you were expected to stay at home and care for the house.I think another idea Sophocles was trying to make to the reader, is that you should stand up for what you believe in. What you believe in could be anything. When you stand up for what you believe the results may not always be positive. The good part is that you stood up for your rights and did not go against your belief.While reading this play I understood that family is very important. Even when you have rough times your family will still be there just as Ismene was for Antogone when she was about to die. Isemene was willing to take the blame so that Antogone could live. You should love your family no matter what the situation. I also learned the importance of freedom of speech. I now know not to take it for granted. You should use your freedom of speech, but use it wisely. Antigone used her freedom of speech for her brother's appropriate burial.I would recommend that play to a person that is looking for a good family drama because it deals with hatred, love, happiness and passion all in one story. It teaches family values and togetherness. In conclusion it is a very good and uplifting story."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"In my opinion, the play Antigone by Sophocles was a good play. Surprisingly, it wasn't all that hard to read thanks to the translations and excellent cliff notes (although I wouldn't recommend it to a six year old). Overall, I thought that Antigone taught several good moral lessons. It also raised some very good questions about several topics.The main characters in Antigone are Antigone (obviously), her sister Ismene, and their uncle, Creon, who is the newly appointed ruler of the Greek city state of Thebes. Antigone's and Ismene's father, Oedipus (the original King of Thebes), also had two sons, Eteocles and Polynices. However, Oedipus killed himself and left the city to his two sons. Polynices had been branded a traitor to Thebes and had been killed in a battle along with his brother. With both sons dead, Creon became the new King of Thebes. He made a decree saying that no one shall bury Polynices because he was a traitor. Antigone ignored this and secretly buried her brother. This was because in Greek times, when a body was left unburied, the Greeks thought the soul would not go to heaven or some similar place they believed in. They believed that the body of the deceased had to at least be covered with some dirt. Of course Creon was extremely angry and upset and wanted to find out who had disobeyed his decree. A little later in the story Ismene decides that she wants to take the blame. In the end, a few characters die (it is a Greek tragedy after all), someone is taught a lesson by the Greek gods, and someone one ends up extremely sad but you will find this out if you read the book.The main point of Sophocles writing the book was probably for two reasons, other than the fact that it was a way of pleasing the gods at the time. The first was to teach a lesson to the people about the gods. This lesson was to respect the power of the gods or the ones in authority. In the book, Creon thought he was all powerful, all knowing, and always right (sort of like a communist state). He would latter find out that he was totally wrong. As fate would have it, he would lose both his son and his wife due to his ignorance. In my opinion, Creon was wrong! Creon was the reigning authority but he overstepped his boundaries. Antigone disobeyed the reining authority but obeyed the ultimate authority which was the beliefs of her society. The book taught me that no matter what your beliefs are you should still respect the ultimate authority in your life, may it be God in my case, the Greek gods in Antigone's case, or someone else altogether such as the government. If Creon had respected the gods like Antigone had things would be different for him. The second lesson Sophocles was trying to teach was about pride. As the chorus would say \\"wisdom first for a man's well being\\" (page 52 in Antigone). Basically this means it is better to be wise than to be right. Creon had to learn this lesson the hard way. It wasn't until he had lost both his son and his wife when he accepted that he was wrong. Thanks to the book I learned that pride is a deadly beast. It can ruin the strongest of men and the greatest of nations. Even though it was written many years ago, it can still teach us important lessons today.I thought this version of the play was well written (although it was sometimes hard to understand the first time reading) and I would recommend it. However, if you are not serious about the book, skimming over it, or just plain can't understand old English at all, this is not the book for you. If you don't mind that almost all the book is in old English, then I would say definitely buy it! It is a great book that teaches a many things and also raises some very interesting questions. I would have to give the book 8.5 out of 10 and is one of my top ten favorite books. Hey, why are still here reading the review? Go on and buy the book already!!!"},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"The famous play of Antigone, written by Sophocles, was very interesting. It kept me guessing throughout the book and totally surprised me with the death of Haemon. This story reminded me of Romeo and Juliet in a way because seeing the death of the person they loved resulted in killing themselves side by side.This play had a very positive impact on me. It reminded me to check my pride because it is very easy for pride and power to blind you of the things that are right. Creon was blinded and completely obsessed with power. He would not even let his own flesh and blood be offered mercy from his laws.I believe that Sophocles wrote this play for two main reasons. He wrote it for the competitions that the ancient Greeks held to honor their gods but also to send a lesson that pride comes before the fall. It reminds me of a line from Spiderman which states \\"with great power comes great responsibility\\". It is what we do with the power we are given that will make us who we are. Creon realized that he was at fault and learned his lesson at the end of the play. On page 50, section 4 he says, \\"Woe is me! To none else can they lay it, This guilt, but to me!\\". Sophocles wants us to learn from Creon's fall and not learn this mistake by firsthand experience.This play is a great for anyone from about high school and on. It was not too hard to understand even though it was in Old English but I recommend you to read about what took place before this play, in order to fully understand the characters.Sophocles had a great impact on Ancient Greece and has impacted drama in a tremendous way! He did this by using a woman as a main role. The reason that this was so unique was because woman, were being looked lowly upon in ancient times until the past couple hundred years."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"AntigoneAntigone was a very good play. I did enjoy reading it but there were positive and negative aspects of it. The play was extremely hard to read. I did not understand a lot of it. The wording was complicated and the story line was a little shaky to me. I enjoyed and could understand the movie more than the play.I think Sophocles main purpose in writing this play was to bring out positive and negative points in the society of his time. Some of the positive points he was writing about is that the gods are in control. I think he was saying that maybe women aren't as important as they should be. That is why he named the play Antigone. He was also making the people think what would they want to do more obeying the governing authority or doing what they thought was right.I think that he was making the people think because there was a lot of talk in the play about which one was right. I also think he named it after a woman and made her the main character to make people think about how important women can be in the society.I have learned to stand up for myself. A lot of time people may make comments about how they don't like my religion or my school or clothes or anything really. Now I can stand up for myself and say I don't think that's nice or right and then I can even argue my point. I don't know if I will ever be able to stand up for myself to the point of death.I also learned that women do play a pretty important role in society. Now I take offense when people tell me that women have no place in giving their opinion because we really do. God says we should submit to man but that does not mean we are their slaves.I would and would not recommend the play. To people who really enjoy having a challenge in reading and can understand ancient Greek wording then I would say go for it. They would really enjoy and understand the play. But for people like me who do not understand the wording I would say it would be best to not read it. I was pulling my hair out just trying to understand a ton of the words. I did not even understand what was happening until we saw the movie of it and I was like oh so that's what that meant.Overall I think that once you understand the language and can deal with that than this play is an excellent one to read because it really shows you about the world back then and the challenges they had to go throu"},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"The Greek tragedy of Antigone is a pivotal work of literature not only in today's society, but also in Sophocles' time period. Sophocles' bold action in not only placing a woman as the heroine in his play, but naming the play after her as well contradicted all traditional gender ideas of that period, and consequently made an unspoken statement to his society. The Greek playwright also addresses the traditional Greek views of hubris and the inescapable fate that haunts human lives, writing in such a way that his \\"sermon\\" does not overshadow the story itself. The play is used to communicate the issues, rather than the issues being used to create the play.Though Sophocles addressed many points within Antigone, his main purpose was to bring into focus the philosophical question regarding two contrasting authorities: Man's and God's. This contrast is first seen through Antigone and Ismene's argument over the burial of their brother, Polynices. Antigone defies the law prohibiting his burial and repeatedly states that her loyalty and honor will remain with the gods, and not with man's law (p.3). When charged by Creon with criminal offense, and questioned as to why she had so defied the king, Antigone exclaims that Zeus himself did not declare the law preventing the honor of Polynices; therefore she is not obligated to personally honor it. This angers Creon, who feels that, as king, he holds supreme authority, and no one, especially not a woman, should be allowed to show any form of defiance (p.17).Very accurate pictures of Antigone and Creon are portrayed by the Greek Chorus on page 35 and further show the struggle between the two authorities. The story of the mortal Danae is a clear representation of Antigone, telling of how the Greek heroine was shut up in a cave to die, and yet was looked upon with so much favor by Zeus that he conceived a child with her. This is a strong foreshadow of the gods' favor towards Antigone and her decision, for she herself would be buried alive because of her honor to the law of the gods and not to man. Creon is shown through the story of Lycurgus, a madman who was known for killing both his wife and son, and was severely punished by the Heavenly Beings for his excessive pride. This also is a use of foreshadow, for Creon's wife and son would also die, and his rigid pride would eventually cause his ruin. Both stories show which character gained, or lost, the gods' favor, while displaying the struggle of Man's law with the Divine (p.35-36).Sophocles also included what seems to remain the focal point throughout all Greek theatre: the folly of Man's constant pride. The Greeks believed that pride was a dangerous sin, and was always met with awful outcomes. This viewpoint is shown in the story of Lycurgus mentioned before (p.35-36). However, it is largely communicated by the way the gods choose to deal with Creon, which is shown in his lament on pages 47-52.Antigone includes a wide range of lessons throughout. One that I personally gathered was the immense effect that each individual's actions have on those surrounding him or her. Each part in the chain of events that occur within Antigone is created by the preceding links. Polynices' rebellion prompted Creon's decree, which led to Antigone's defiant decision. Her decision increased the rigidity of Creon's pride, leading to his declaration of punishment, the destruction of his family, the judgment from the gods, and ultimately Creon's failure as king. These few repercussions of decisions made are a small representation of the consequences, whether good or bad, that resulted from each person's action(s). In the same way, so my personal choices affect future events and those around me as well. It is important to remember that not only do my priorities and values impact my own life, but others' also, and this must be considered before action is taken. The slightest change in events may make an incredible difference in the future.I would absolutely recommend this play to be read by others. Not only does Sophocles' use of foreshadow and his constant historical and mythological references give a sense of intrigue and liveliness to the play, but his work also provides a deeper understanding of Greek values and the importance which religion held throughout their society. It is also interesting to note that the prominent issue that Sophocles discusses throughout the plot, the struggle of the supremacy between the law of Man and the law of God, is voiced largely in our own culture today. Consequently, this shows that societies may excel scientifically, socially, mentally, etc, and yet still be dealing with issues that have not been resolved for thousands of years. This fact alone grants relevance to the study of history and the lives of those before us, and gives strong reasoning that Antigone is not just another classic piece of literature, but one that is useful to read and applicable even today."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"Although the Dover Edition of Antigone is inexpensive, the translation is very archiac. I used this book last semester in the hopes of saving my students a few dollars, but we found the translation to be so difficult that the time spent in class &quot;translating the translation&quot; made the book less of a value than I had hoped. I recommend a more modern translation for those of you who are considering using this text in class."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"I found this edition (Dover Thrift) by following a link for paperback from the Braun translation. The publisher reviews on this page indicate it is the Braun.It isn't: it's the Young translation, which is not workable for my classroom because of it's difficult \\"KJV\\" English. Now I've wasted two weeks in planning my Greek unit, and any hope I had of using Antigone is shot.Teachers: avoid this translation unless your students are advanced. It's isn't worth the money you save."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"I'm sure that the readers of this review are not so much concerned with purchasing \\"Antigone\\" as they are with which version of \\"Antigone\\" to purchase. Let me recommend The Greek Tragedies in New Translations's version.Yes, it is a bit pricey (considering you only get the one play as opposed to getting the entire Theban cycle), but there are several factors in the GTNT's favor:1) the whole premise behind the GTNT is that \\"poets like Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripedes can only be properly rendered by translators who are themselves poets.\\" I'm sure many will not like Braun's stark, spare translation, thinking it somehow less eloquent, less florid than other translations, but I liked it. To form your own judgment, I include a sample passage from the Watling translation (\\"The Theban Plays\\", Penguin Classics):Wonders are many on earth, and the greatest of theseIs man, who rides the ocean and takes his wayThrough the deeps, through wide-swept valleys of perilous seasThat surge and sway.He is master of ageless Earth, to his own will bendingThe immortal mother of gods by the sweat of his brow,As year succeeds to year, with toil unendingOf mule and plough.And the same passage rendered in the GTNT:Many marvels walk through the world,terrible, wonderful,but none more than humanity,which makes a way under winter rain,over the gray deep of the sea,proceeds where it swells and swallows;that grinds at the Earth---undwindling, unwearied, first of the gods---to its own purpose,as the plow is driven, turning year into year,through generations as colt follows mare.2) I'm not a big fan of extraneous material, but the GTNT did contain some material that was helpful. There was a Foreword outlining the guidelines for translation of the plays in the series; this was followed by an Introduction that included material about Sophocles's life and an essay on interpreting the play. (Neither of these was terribly useful; besides, I like to reach my own conclusion about a literary work w/o some academic telling me what it's \\"supposed to mean\\"!) After the play are Notes (Again, I would skip these unless you are an expert in Greek and wanted to know why certain passages were translated a certain way), followed by the only extra material that I found helpful: a recounting of the Oedipus myth to set the story in context.3) I know there are problems inherent in reading ancient Greek drama (they tend to be rather sermonizing) that my Sophomore English class found difficult. I think having the GTNT available to students would have helped in their understanding/apprecitaion of the play. The updated language of the GTNT allows the Reader to focus on the characters' actions/motives more easily, more clearly, rather than seeing the play as some arcane, musty mid-century translation."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"Antigone, written by Sophocles, shows us how pride can get in the way in how we treat others.In Antigone, Sophocles has a couple main points that I think he tries to allow his readers to see in his play. One of the points is that in Greek times women did not have a very highly respected portrayal in society and by naming his play Antigone, after a woman this shows boldness and uniqueness. The play would not be as well remembered if it were to be named after another main character such as Creon. Also in and throughout the play the controversy of the law of man and the power of the gods is highlighted. In the play it is said that the power of the gods surpasses the will of man and no matter what man does the gods will get their way. Creon tries to almost defy the power of the gods by saying that you should not respect a person that has recently died by burying them. This is why Antigone's so distraught, It was not just the fact that she wanted to bury him, but also that she wanted to please the gods. The power of fate also is significant in the life of Antigone for she knows that her families fate was not of good nature and since her background with her dad, Edipus, was cursed then her life as well would be cursed.I reccommend Antigone because it's a great life lessons play and the fact that it has so many dramatic characters who make the storyline interesting."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"Antigone is a Greek tragedy in every since of the word from the moment you open the cover to the very last word on the last page you are totally amerced in a story that truly captivates and portrays the true image of the human sprit. There is not an emotion that is not roused to life by this powerful piece of literature. The plot of this masterpiece seems to rack the deep recesses and foundations of your soul. The unique piece of literature is the story of a free spirited young woman and her uncle the newly crowned kind of Thebes. In the begging all thing are well within this peaceful town but that is about to change. The hand of fate is again about to play devastating role in how the game of life is played. Creon the new king is a patriotic and devoted man who wants nothing more in life than the best for his own family and country men. But when his nephew, stabs him in the back by starting a revolt against his rule, he has no choice but to defend his kingdom and contently killed his own flesh and blood. The king takes it a step to far though, he then goes and refuses to bury the young boys body. In the culture of the Greeks this a true curse to the soul of a man. They believe that till the body of the dead is buried he is forced to wander the earth in search of peace. The young Antigone is the sister to this brave hero now is stuck in and endless battle between her own morals and the governmental law. One might think that Sophocles, the author of this truly revolutionary piece of literature was trying to get his audience to think about their own decisions in life. The choices we make for day to day even the small ones a directly tied in to the values we have in life whether we realize it or not. Antigone for example chose to go against the law and bury her brother showing her true values of loyalty to family and her god rather than the forces of this earth. This kind of loyalty really hit me in the bottom of my heart. I think if could live my life day to day with half as much conviction she had I would be a great leader in my time. This play caused me to evaluate the principles of my own life and I hope to be a better leader because of it. I think that this is one of the most powerful and moving plays i have ever read and that is saying a lot. Everyone should read this really unique and revolutionary piece of literature sometime in their life it may say you a lot of heartache down the road, and I mean that"},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"Though a Greek tragedy, Antigone gave off a positive message, portraying the loyalty and the forgiveness that exists in love. However, not excluding the importance of honoring doctrine and submitting to authority. As the story progresses, the reader is placed in a position where their opinion is continuously changing, forcing them into a state of mind-boggling curiosity.Sophocles' main point in writing Antigone was to make readers consider the consequences of their actions and to question whether or not a person's fate is preordained. You see, upon learning that he had married his mother, Oedipus blinded himself, and because of the bad behavior of his sons, he cursed them, saying that they would kill each other. Which eventually did occur when Polynices, Oedipus' son, attacked Thebes with six other men. Now, because of his betrayal of Thebes, Creon denied Polynices of a proper burial, damning him to eternal punishment in the underworld. Antigone, despite her brothers' betrayal, planned to bury him, though it had been forbidden. Now, because of one mistake made by Oedipus, an entire country was brought to their knees and suffered great loss. This was also written because by centering his play around a female character, Sophocles shocked the Greek culture, because they viewed woman as of no value and having no opinion. However, not only did Antigone have an opinion, she disobeyed the decree given and ultimately defied or belittled the power of a man. Then she did not deny the accusation, but instead said that she followed first the laws given by the gods, indirectly informing Creon that he was incorrect. This was unheard of because she was a woman and had no value, whereas a man, especially the king, was held in high regard and not disrespected by anyone.Personally, I was reminded of and learned a lot by reading this. It brought to my attention the importance of making wise decisions. As I get older, I gradually take on more and more responsibilities that require commitment and dedication. I need to carefully consider these responsibilities when I am making decisions and should explore all of my options, pray, and venture through each possible consequence, good or bad. By doing so, I could prevent myself from, what could have been avoidable difficulties, later on. Also, I was reminded what an awesome gift we have in America. All people, even woman, have the right to stand for what they believe in, whereas in some countries, even today, woman are considered worthless and without opinion. However, in America we are given rights and yet a lot of people here fail to recognize them because they have become prone to having them.In conclusion, I would recommend this play because it requires a lot of thought and understanding. You have to understand the convictions of each side in order to fully comprehend the fullness and purpose of the play. It not only made you think, it also made you feel. Because of the way the story is written, the reader can relate to the characters, making the story intriguing and worth reading. The grammatical structure of the play painted a vivid picture of each character and their unique personalities and their strong convictions. Also, the plethora of personality in the play was surprisingly refreshing and made the play warm and heartfelt."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"When I began reading Antigone, I thought of it was difficult to understandbecause of the older language and also I thought it was kind of boring. But as the playprogressed, I found myself getting deep into the plot and the character build up. I wascaptivated by Antigone and Ismenes characters after I fully understood what was goingon. The contrast between the two women was extraordinary. How Antigone is so ready totake on the king even if it means death, and how Ismene thinks she knows her place anddoesn't want to question it. I thought, for the most part that the play was positive in itselfand that the plot was so intriguing and dramatic, that I couldn't stop reading when Istarted.The purpose of the play, however, is not as simple as if it was enjoyable or not.Sophocles was very wise and sure in his decision on what the purpose or moral of thisplay would be. When he starts out the play, you dont really know exactly what is going tohappen. I think he likes it that way. It keeps you guessing. I think, at the end of the playthough, the purpose was kind of to teach a lesson. It was hard to interpret what themeaning of the play was. But after thinking about it, many parts of the play come togetherto form a common purpose. The fact that Antigone is a woman and defied the law, evenin a time when women weren't considered able to have a say and that she had her sisterwho loved her telling her it was a bad idea, the fact that there was really no strong familybond between Creon and Antigone, and the fact that everyone ends up dying all lead toCreons understanding of wisdom and how it always prevails over pride. I'm pretty surethat, that was Sophocles' main point of writing.At first, I was completely on Antigones side with what the outcome of the storyshould be. It may be because I am a female, but I was hardly even considering Creonsside. I was focused more on the fact that Antigone was just sticking up for what shebelieved in. But as the play went on, I started thinking about the time period. And to behonest, Creon was really just doing all he knew. He was the king and there was so wideman in the beginning saying, \\"Hey, Creon. She has a right to do this.\\" No, he was theauthority and men were higher than women. That is all everyone knew, including Creonand Antigone. Antigone was the one who broke the law and buried her brother. So whowas right? Antigone who broke the law but was just trying to stick up for her family? OrCreon who showed no mercy but was just following the law? This is what I have learned;It is very nice to stick up for what you believe in, and that's what I thought the moral wasgoing to be. But, you have to know how far you'll go and where to draw the line. I amstill not sure that if I was Antigone that I would have went ahead and buried my brother. Ireally dont think I would have had the courage to defy the kings law, even if it was myuncle. So, I thought I had learned to always stick up for what you believe. But now I thinkI have learned more about making sure your willing to deal with the consequences beforeyou go ahead and be a hero.I think I would definitely recommend this play to my friends. I would be sure torecommend it to someone who is old enough to understand the language for one thing,and someone who could understand the time period and how important it was that awomans name was the title of the play. I dont think you can fully understand and graspthe knowledge that you should from this, if you arent capable of understanding Creonsside as well as Antigones. I would also not recommend this play to someone who wouldbe offended by the fact that they worshipped many gods and women were consideredlesser than men, because the men and Ismene both put women down throughout the play.I would recommend this play to anyone who has an open mind a just really wants to reada good play."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"\\"Antigone\\" by Sophocles depicts a tragic story that embraces many of life's difficulties. It tells of family honor, inescapable curses, conflicting pride, and ironic happenings. \\"Antigone\\" was a beneficial play to read because it is a work from when Drama first began. It gives us a picture of how the Greeks lived their lives and what their views were. The story illustrates the controversy of the gods ruling over man, women in the society and many other poignant issues that the Greeks dealt with.I observed there are a few certain themes that Sophocles maintained throughout the play. They are prominent and relate to life in Greece. I find it interesting that Sophocles chose to title his play after a woman. In Greece, women were looked down upon and greatly belittled. Sophocles was making a point that the view of women in the society was harsh and perhaps unfair. To make the hero of the play a woman was very uncommon and mostly unheard of. In the play Sophocles writes lines that show how a man thinks of a woman and his regard to being as low as her would be unbearable. Such as when Creon states \\"No woman, while I live shall order me\\" It was the fight between the two. Creon, the King of Thebes, uncle to Antigone, was a man with pride in his heart. Antigone, a stubborn and spirited girl, thought the burial of her brother, Polynices, was her duty to him. The conflict arose when Creon announced to the city that whoever buried the body of the traitor (Polynices) would be killed. Regardless of this edict, Antigone resolves to honor her brother by burial, declaring the gods approved of her act, even though it was against the law.Pride was a characteristic in both Creon and Antigone. Creon was prideful from the beginning. He was arrogant to keep Polynices from being buried and then later on, he defied Antigone's reasoning, shrugging it off because he didn't want to admit his wrong. The Chorus sings of Creon and his pride, saying that he will suffer for it. \\"wrath, was bound for his words of mocking and pride.\\" After condemning Antigone, Creon was visited by a blind seer, Tiresias, who told Creon he was wrong to make the law and he shall suffer because of his pride. Antigone, not faultless to pride, was very confidant to the point of being arrogant as well. She had no meekness towards Creon and fearlessly gave her opinion of his wrong, and her choice to defy him. Sophocles displays these prideful characters and their consequences for being so. He shows that the gods despise the pride of a man.From reading the circumstances and choices that were made in this play have affected my perspective. Antigone's confidence in her choice, though not popular, is an inspiration to me personally. She never backed down from what she believed was right, but was confident that she needed to follow through in her beliefs to the point of death as the consequence. She is a good example to me because I should always be ready to stand up for what I believe in and do it with confidence. Putting my trust in God as my personal Savior is worth my defense. Antigone has reminded me, besides the pride, that my faith is what makes me the person I am. I am ready to stand with my choice and have full confidence in my dedication to Christ.I fully recommend this play as a positive reading and I enjoyed the deep thoughts and critical thinking that \\"Antigone\\" brought to me. It has been an enlightening experience to read of the Greek tragedy that Sophocles portrayed, truly a captivating play."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"\\"Antigone\\" is an epic tale of woe and heartache. Written by Sophocles more than 2000 years ago, it remains one of the most beloved of all ancient Greek tragedies. The third in a series of three plays, \\"Antigone\\" records the downfall of one royal family. The great playwright Sophocles who is second only to Shakespeare in his writing abilities turned heads with his controversial topics and unimaginable heroes and heroines.Most of his plays had morals to them, and \\"Antigone\\" is no exception. The foundational principal of \\"Antigone\\" is pride, and the effects that it has on those around it. According to Sophocles, the very presence of pride can bring down a dynasty. Because of the pride of two people, Antigone's world crumbles at her feet.Antigone comes from a family full of turmoil. Her father, Oedipus Rex, the king of Thebes, had been sent away from his family due to a prophecy that he would kill his father, and he did just what was prophesied. While traveling toward Thebes, he came across a band of men who attacked him, and he unknowingly killed his father. Then, when he arrived in Thebes, he married a newly widowed woman named Jocasta who is his mother and the mother of his children, Antigone and her brothers and sister.After many years, Oedipus Rex was informed of what he had done, and he is so completely devastated that he plucks his eyes out and retreats into the wilderness. Josasta upon hearing the news of husband's identity kills herself. In the midst of his grief, Oedipus Rex places a curse on the lives of his two sons, Polynices and Eteocles. The curse being that they will both die by the other brother's hand, which is exactly how they die. The brothers wage war against each other over who will be the next king of Thebes, and they are both slain during the rebellion lead by Polynices who is the second in line for the throne.With the death of both Eteocles and Polynices, Creon, the brother of Jocasta and the uncle of Antigone, seizes the throne and places an edict that no one can burry the body of the traitorous Polynices who lead the rebellion on Thebes. If anyone so much as touches his body, they will be killed. For this time period, not to be buried was a great offence to the person's soul, and considered the worst things ever to happen to a person. It is at this point in the trilogy that Antigone steps up to defend the honor of her family and her deceased bother.In the middle of the night, Antigone sneaks off to burry her brother despite her uncle's unretractable law. When Creon discovers the missing body, he is furious and demands that the criminal be found and put to death. After much searching, Antigone is found guilty. In order to save the life of her sister, Ismene claims that she was the true culprit, but Creon takes no heed. He sentences Antigone to be jailed in a cave out side of town where her life will be in the hands of the gods. If they wish her it live, than they will keep her alive. By punishing Antigone in such a way, Creon attempted to remove her death from his couscous.All of these proceedings and charges angered Creon's son, Haemon, who was betrothed to Antigone. Haemon along with other cancellers of Creon attempted to convince Creon to refrain from harsh judgment of Antigone. Haemon even proclaimed to Creon that he would be sorry if Antigone was harmed in any way for his love for her was sincerely deep, yet Creon heeded not his warning.Creon proceeded with his plans of for Antigone's punishment, and doing so, angered the gods. Shortly after placing Antigone in her eternal imprisonment, Creon encounters a blind prophet named Tiresias who warns Creon of the gods' anger. He tells Creon that because of his crimes everything he holds dear will be lost to him.In order to save both his kingdom and his loved ones, Creon buries Polynices' body with the honor that it deserves and attempted to release Antigone from her stone prison, but he is too late. Antigone full of misery hung herself from the ceiling of cavernous jail cell. Haemon who had come to her stone tomb with the hope of releasing his love from death found her death body hanging from the rafters. In his love-sickened grief, Haemon took his sword and ended his life at the feet of his lover.On hearing the news of the death of her son, Eurydice, the wife of Creon and the mother of Haemon, kills herself as well. Creon who is so distressed with the death of his family members wishes he could take his life as well, but he knows that he cannot. He is destined to live out the rest of his life in misery and anguish due to his harsh and unforgiving treatment of Antigone.I believe that Sophocles is clearly showing the downfalls of pride. He wants the reader to walk away with a humble spirit and a forgiving attitude. I personally felt humbled by this play. When I finished reading it, I felt a strong sense of gratefulness for loved ones that I hold dear. It made me want to tell them that I loved them, because you never know when death will come knocking at your door.I recommend \\"Antigone\\" only if the reader is willing read the play many times over. It is not an easy read full of many words and phrases that had no meaning to me. But over all, \\"Antigone\\" was an excellent play full of principals that everyone needs to learn during their lifetime. My hope is that when it is read that we will all learn the truths taught by Sophocles. If everyone learned the destructiveness of pride, the world that we live in would be a better place."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"The play Antigone is based on a young woman in Ancient Greece. It's about the trials and tribulations that Antigone faces as she decides to follow her heart and not the rules, it is also based on her uncle, Creon and his despotic, proud ways. This was a good play to read because it showed how to deal with pride and wisdom. There are some real-life lessons in this book, and it deals a lot with reality. Although you may never marry your cousin, your father may never marry his mother, or your uncle may never shut you in a cave to die, the main and underlying theme still applies with life today.I think that Sophacles main purpose in writing Antigone was to demonstrate pride and what it can do to you. Hubris, in Greek Tragedy, was defined as a transgression of the divine or moral law through ambition or one of the passions, ultimately causing the transgressor's doom. So, hubris was the ultimate from of pride, and led to destruction from the gods. In Antigone, we see how Creon's power gets to his head, and orders a law that goes against the gods decree. Antigone follows the gods and her heart, and goes against Creon's decree. She is punished for her disobedience by Creon, but he is punished by Fate. He showed insolence to the gods therefore must be punished. Ultimately Fate runs it's coarse and leaves Creon a broken man. He learns from his pride and everything he held dear was destroyed. Sophacles wrote this play to convey that pride is our downfall, and it clouds our visions and our judgments.There are many life lessons in this play. The biggest one is about letting our pride get the best of us. When we think that we are above God, then it is time for a reality check. We were created lower than God, in order to love, worship and serve Him. The same was true with the many Greek gods. Creon elevated himself to a divine position, and that was his down fall. Like it says in Proverbs, \\"Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall (Proverbs 16:18.)\\" Another life lesson is that there is wisdom in the counsel of many. Creon was counseled by his son Haemon, and a seer Tiberius, that he was doing the wrong thing in sending Antigone to her death, but he didn't listen until it was too late to change things. Overall this was a great book. The lessons were clear and dealt with reality. The language was a little hard to understand, and made it difficult to understand at times. I recommend this book, though, and would read it again"},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"I do believe I have become a true fan of the old Greek classics (and I am inspired to seek out classic Greek plays). \\"Antigone\\" is an excellent read, entertaining, and gives a detailed account into the lives and personalities of the daughters of Oedipus, expecially Antigone. Antigone, as portrayed in \\"Oedipus Rex\\" is a child who weeps for her parents, her brothers, and her country after the unfolding of tragic events. In \\"Antigone\\" she's up close and personal as a young woman brave and daring. She is willing to risk her life to defend what remains of family honor."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"Antigone takes place right after sophocles, Oedipus at Colonos. The play takes off right after a war in thebes where the two princes Eteokles and Poloneices have fought and killed each other over a war for the throne. For those who dont know any backround for this war, Poloneicies and Eteokles had struck up a deal that every year they would trade off the throne, one ruling than the other, but Eteokles dod not want to give up the throne agter his one year so Poloneices, gathered up an army and attacked to gain, what was actually rightfully his. To move on, Antigone is saddened from the fact that her uncle Kreon, refuses to bury Ploneices, which is an act against the gods; her agrument being that even the opposing forces of an emeny's armyies are giving burial rights, but not her brother. Antigone, the tragic hero in this play buried polonieces against the orders of Kreon an is caught. Never backing down that what she did was right, Antigone carries with her the respect of the people and her fiance Haimon, whom is Kreon's son. Not wanting a conflict between the people and him, kreon secretly has antigone sealed away in a tome, buried alive so to say. But after finally listenine to the prophet Teiresias' words, Kreon makes his final mistake by burying Polonieces first, then going to safe antigone whom had all ready hanged herslef and was only just in time to see his own son, Haimon, out of grief, stab himself.Antigone is one of the best greek tragdedian plays i have ever read. I bought this edition to read in a college class and found it to be one of the best translations i have ever come across. It is very easy to read and understand plus there are notes in the back to help you better understand what is going on in the pkay if you ever get confused. If you like antigone or have a hard time understanding it, buy this edition. I gaurantee you will not have any trouble understanding it."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"I read Sophocles' book, antigone. At first, I really hated it beacause i couldn't understand what was being said. But as I read it over and over and over again, I began to understand it a little better, and I actually liked the plot of the book. I would not recommend this book if you have a hard time understanding difficult translations.I think that there were many points that Sophocles was trying to get across in this play. One of them was that you should obey the gods over the king since they were a higher form of authority. What happened was that Antigone wanted to bury her brother, Polynices, out of respect no matter what wrong he did. But Creon differs in opinion. He says that since Polynices was a traitor, his body was to be left unburied and unmourned. But Antigone ended up still burying her brother because that was what she felt the gods wanted her to do.Another point that he was probably trying to make was that he felt women shouldn't have been treated as low as they were. He was even taking risks writing a play with a woman as the main character because back then, women were considered very low class. They were not even allowed to be in plays.I think that Sophocles was also trying to make the point that we should not be prideful. The Greek word for pride is &quot;hubris&quot;. Antigone and Creon had so much pride that it actually led to the death of most of their family, including Antigone.There were a couple of life lessons to be learned in this play. One of them is to obey your God over earthly authorities because all men are sinfuland their laws aren't always right. Another one of them was that you should not be prideful. As I said before, Antigone and Creon had so much pride that it led to the death of most of their family, including Antigone."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"Book in good condition as stated. Pleased with delivery time. Will use this seller again."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"Antigone was a good story to read, not the best I have ever read, but it was a good story nonetheless. It gives a look into the ancient beliefs of the Greeks, like the mythological heroes and the gods. It also shows many human emotions ranging from Creon's pride to Ismene's timidity. This is a classic story about one girl going up against a powerful king to give her dead brother his last rights. The main point that Sophocles was trying to get across in this play, I think, was that the gods were all powerful and what they said was law. An example from the story of the god's power would be the fates who were goddesses who controlled the destiny of every human. After everyone Creon cared for died, Creon cried out, \\"Come, thou most welcome Fate, Appear, O come; Bring my days' final date, Fill up their sum! Let me not look upon another day!\\" This anguished cry shows how in the minds of the ancient Greeks the fates controlled everything. It seems to say that he could not die unless the fates allowed him to die. A clear show of the powers the gods had over people would be Creon's outcome. The words of the messenger seem to explain, he says, \\"Of sorrows; one thou bearest in thine arms, And one at home thou seemest to be come merely to witness.\\" To me the messenger is saying that Creon's sorrow is just becoming greater and greater, and that he is helpless to stop it or slow it down. For his one decision against the god's laws Creon was destined to lose his son and wife and to live knowing that if he had not been as prideful they just might have been alive. Just as Tiresias foretold Creon was punished by the gods, it happened in such a horrible way that it gives a perfect example of the god's power over humans. Throughout the play many lessons can be learned, each lesson would be a benefit to any person; I have personally learned that you should base decisions upon wisdom. That because of one unwise decision a person's life can become completely messed up. The last ode, or song, the chorus sang in this play displays my thoughts well. Those words are, \\"Wisdom first for a man's well-being maketh, of all things. Heaven's insistence; And great blows great speeches avenging, Dealt on a boaster, Teach men wisdom in age, at last.\\" The first line of this ode points out that wisdom helps to keep people safe from themselves and others. Also to save them from making foolhardy decisions that might hurt them later or immediately. In truth this can still be applied to today's world, those who have wisdom and use it are probably the safest people. Many of the troubles in someone's life happen because of an unwise decision made by the person. To move on, the last few words in the ode are probably the most interesting to me. It says that wisdom does not come with age but with the experiences people have even when they are old. That people should not expect to gain wisdom just because they reach a certain age or point in life. But should learn from every experience that happens bad or good whether it happened to them, someone near to them, a complete stranger, or a fictional character like Antigone. In conclusion, I recommend this book to all who read this; it is a great story that people will probably enjoy for years to come. It teaches valuable things that people can and should use in their daily life. Aside from these priceless lessons, it is a good read and doubtlessly a great play back in the ancient times when Sophocles first unveiled it. It is a good story that people have, are, and will enjoy for as long as it has and will exist in this world. It is a classical story full of ancient culture and timeless emotions that people will remember for the rest of their lives."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"This year in my drama class we had the chance of reading Antigone. Last year we looked at the play Oedipus Rex and I wasn't to interested in Greek Theater actually, but this yearit was different it was so interesting learning about what they did back then and how its totally changed now...I found Antigone to be really interesting and good because itshowed that in life your going have to take risk and some of them may be deadly. Of course Greek tragedy wasn't going to be such a happy ending, but it will impact lives.Sophocles is main purpose for writing this was for readers to see that women should have the same rights as man. Back then women weren't seen as anything important so, forAntigone to speak out and disobey Creon for burying her brother she was in a lot of trouble and Creon didn't like the fact that she wasn't afraid of him and that he was beginning to look weak. Also Sophocles was saying that parents should teach their kids morals because if they didn't they would become as stubborn, narrow minded as Creon and make laws that soon they would realize they were foolish. Whatever job they mayhave. Sophocles really took at risk at making a women the heroine of the story because women weren't able to speak out and saying women have the same rights as men so whycant they be equal. Also he was saying if you think you have so much power and you think so highly of yourself you will end up with nothing.You can tell when Antigone gets in trouble and she is not intimidated at all by Creon thatshe so strong in her words, and you start noticing Creon getting more angry than he already was because he saw that his power was becoming a joke. The chorus talks aboutCreon's power becoming nothing and saying you had everything but now look you are left all alone, your power is gone and you don't know whom to turn to. His son killed himself when Antigone died, his wife killed herself and it doesn't say what happened to Ismene Antigone's sister. Now his power was useless and he soon realizing that he was foolish to make a law saying no one could bury Polyniecus are they would be executed.I learned from this book that sometimes you would have to take risks whether good or bad. That you have to stand up for what you believe in and are strong about. Don't letyour guard down with anything you don't want the person to win in saying I have morepower than you then don't let them. Be careful with the decisions you make because theymay lead you down the wrong path.I would recommend this book to those who love to read or those who like to read a littlebit because its a good learning to. For those who are afraid to speak out, I know it mayget tough sometimes but sooner are later you're going have to take a plunge. This bookreally shows that."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"I was assigned to read one of the remaining seven plays of the writer Sophocles, Antigone. When I first began to read it, I did not find it enjoyable. It was originally written in Greek and then translated to English as well as Sir George Young was able to convert. The story was amazing but the words of the play made it difficult to understand. If you have a hard time keeping your mind focused while reading a book, then I would not recommend this play for your reading material. However, if you enjoy Greek plays and such, then you would take pleasure in Antigone.As I said, I had a difficult time at the beginning enjoying what I was reading. It was not until I realized how strongly Antigone must have felt about her family that I looked up to her and wanted to continue reading to see what would happen. Although Creon had high power and was against Antigone's motives, she continued with what she felt was right. I also grew an unfavorable passion against Creon as the story went on. He seemed to only think of himself and want everyone to follow his rules. The world revolved around him. By the end of the play, I was disappointed and hoped there was a sequel. So although the play was difficult to comprehend at times I decided to give it a three star, because Sophocles was an amazing writer; and I'm sure many people would enjoy his work.My thoughts on what Sophocles' main point was for writing Antigone has changed quite a few times. My first thought was that it was to teach the reader life lessons. An example of this is how you need to stick with your family through thick and thin and not be ashamed of them. To not change your beliefs or thoughts because of someone else but to do what you feel is right from the beginning. I have not changed my opinion on that completely, but after a class discussion, someone brought up a good point that I also think could be Sophocles' reason. Back when Sophocles wrote the play Antigone, women were not thought of highly. When it came to plays not many women had lead roles, if they were in the play at all. I think he was also trying to get the audiences attention by having something unusual be apart of his work.Sophocles hit on a lot of situations that people struggle in, even though he may not have meant to. People in the world these days are ashamed of their families. Whether it is because of what they look like, or how they act, they don't take honor in their family. Antigone took such honor in her family that even though it was against the law, she gave respect back to her deceased brother. She faced the consequences, but not once did she say she was sorry for what she had done. Another thing that Sophocles made a point on was not thinking only of yourself. The character Creon was a self-centered person who wanted people to follow his way and no other. He even thought his laws and opinions higher than the gods.I would recommend this play to anyone who does not have a hard time concentrating on what you read. Even if you do have a hard time keeping your mind from wandering, this is still a good story to read. It just may take you a little longer to understand it all."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"For someone to learn and become wiser they must either learn from their mistakes, or others mistakes. By reading Antigone, I was able to learn from her mistakes without having to make them myself. That is why Antigone has a positive effect on the readers. As our class began to first read Antigone I didn't think that I would be able to relate to the characters at all, but as we read on I began to see the similarities between Antigone and myself. Antigone in a way is like me, and many of my peers, a teenager, who's lost loved ones, is looked down upon and judged because of her youth, is trying to find a place in the world and so she rebel's against her authorities.Antigone had no one to help guide her or share wisdom with her as she grew up; this gave her a sense of aloneness that invokes the reader's pity. Antigone's act of disobedience towards Creon through burying her brother was an act of desperation. Even though she was scared her since of loyalty to Polynices prompted her to do this rash and unwise act. Sophocles thought many lessons throughout Antigone but one of the major ideas that I'm going to focus on is wisdom.Wisdom is defined, as an understanding of what is true or right, having common sense and good judgment. Sophocles presents the question, who is right, Antigone or Creon? They both believed they were right according to their standards, Antigone's actions were directed by her beliefs that she was responding to a higher authority, that of the Gods. Even though, she understood that Creon was in authority she thought she was right in obeying the Gods over him. Creon on the other hand refused to acknowledge any authority other than his own and the law of the land. Pride and stubbornness clouded his judgment from listening to wise council from his son. Proverbs19: 20 says Listen to advice and accept instruction, and in the end you will be wise. Creon was unwise because he did not listen to Haemon merely because Creon believed that wisdom came with age. He tells this to Haemon when his decision on the fate of Antigone was challenged. The last line of the play, Teach men wisdom in age, at last shows Sophocles beliefs that wisdom is a virtue that is earned through experiences and personal maturity not thorough age alone.The play shows me personally that age and wisdom are not always synonymous. Spiritual maturity comes from God and I am directed to set an example not only for my peers but also for those older than me. Many adults think teenagers today are all the same, disrespectful, disobedient kids, who are young and hopeless without wisdom, morals or values. This is a bleak stereotype that we need to break away from. Paul writes to Timothy in 1Timothy 4:12 Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, In love, in faith, and in purity. It's easy for teens to use the world's misguided stereotype to lower their standards and conform to the expectations of today. As a believer God holds us accountable to his standards not the worlds, at any age. Proverbs 20: 11 Even a child is known by his actions, by whether his conduct is pure and right.I would recommend this play because it was interesting with a strong storyline. The characters were well developed and the reader becomes emotionally involved. The conflicts that arise are ambiguous and challenge your thinking and encourage personal introspection. The negative aspect of the play is it is difficult to understand. The prose used by Sopholes is unfamiliar and the format of the chorus is hard to follow. The play is best read in discussion groups or led by a teacher who is experience in this style of writing."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"I think that this story was a great story. Not only is it great, but it is a different kind of Literature than we are used to nowadays. Although this may be a great book, I have to admit that it was a little hard to understand and follow. This is the reason I didn't think it deserved and outstanding rating. When I am reading, I want to be able to understand all of the different ideas the author is trying to get across. I didn't understand it to the fullest extent, and therefore I didn't get the full idea of all the benefits of the historical insights, political insights, and the way people thought in the times of this particular play.I think that the point of this story is that Sophocles was trying to almost be rebellious and trying to shock the Greeks by even making a play like this. In Greek times, it was odd to have a woman to be the main character of the play. Women in ancient Greek times were not highly looked upon by the men. Creon you can tell is one of the people who believe in this way of life. I also think that Sophocles wanted to show really of how things happen back then. All the political views that Creon played and the role of a man in power back in those days is something that he might have felt that he needed to show.When Creon and Antigone are talking one time, when he they are deciding what they are going to do with Antigone, he says that no woman will order him. This is the way a lot of people thought in those days and Sophocles is showing how things were back then.I have learned so much from reading this book. I wouldn't say that I learned anything about Sophocles, because anything that I think he is saying, is of course pure speculation. Yet, I learned that things were definitely different back then. We think everything is so unfair and take a lot of things for granted, but we have it easy. When someone says something or has on opinion about something, they can go ahead and say it without being afraid of getting in trouble for it. When a woman wants to go get a job, nobody thinks anything about it, but if a woman back then did that it would be like \\"WOAH- what in the world is she thinking\\" and would be refused a job probably. We have it easy and I now realize that.I would recommend this play to anybody who likes ay Ancient Greek plays, or even someone that likes Shakespeare, because it is written in the same \\"language.\\" I would not however recommend this play to someone who doesn't like reading plays or anything of the sort. It will be hard to follow for someone that doesn't like plays, but for anyone who does, you will simply love it (that however, is not a guarantee)."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"This book is an excellent show of the determination of a girl who will do whatever it takes to bury her brother, even if it means to defy the king. I loved the ending and the story was just excellent."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"I thought that Antigone was a really great script and was really appealing to me and probably a lot of other readers too. It was a great story about after Oedipus Rex basically killed himself and his two sons, Eteocles and Polynices fought over who would be the next ruler of Thebes and eventually killed each other and that Oedipus' daughters, Antigone and Ismene are now fighting about the burial of Polynices.Sophocles wanted to have a woman who was the main character and a man who was the complete opposite of Antigone. Since the women were not allowed to participate in the plays and mostly anything, Sophocles wanted to change all that for the better. The people that you meet in the play are: Antigone, Creon, Ismene, Haemon, and Tiresias. The main reason for Sophocles writing this is for a woman to take the part as a headmaster of the main purpose of the play.I have read that you should respect your elders and submit to those in authority as it says in Romans 13:4-7. Those women in Antigone were greatly disrespected in that time and the men were looked up to. The ruler of Thebes in Antigone now is Oedipus' mother (and wife's) brother Creon, and Creon does not want his son Haemon to marry Antigone because she buried her brother and that was against Creon's law, but the non-burial was also a disrespect for the gods of Greece. Antigone, for her crime was sentenced by Creon to death and the disrespect of all the people and the charge not to marry his son Haemon. After Haemon heared about the sentencing of Antigone, he went away and killed himself. Creon was a really hard-headed, cold-blooded man who took orders from only one person, himself, there was a few people who tried to talk him out of it like the Senators or a blind man named Tiresias and even one of the Sentinels tried to talk to him, but he would not listen to any one of them at all, he simply dismissed that until Haemon killed himself and he would listen then after his own son died because of something he did to the one he loved the most.I would defiantly recommend this script to anyone who loves tragedy or one who likes the Ancient Greeks. The story is the greatest of all Sophocles plays in my mind and I think people out there would love it, I read it over and over again, I could not put it down it was so good. In conclusion, I would like to say that this script was excellent and I will still read this script twenty years from now and until I die, maybe."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"I think Antigone the play by Sophocles is important for people to read today. This play is beneficial to the modern day reader because it shows affection, love, and loyalty and what happens when these go wrong. These emotions and traits were very important to Sophocles. Antigone the title character of the story is only one of the main characters. The play centers around her and her extended family. Creon, the evil king, is also Antigone's uncle, (and Great Uncle, this is a very entangled family) he has ordered that one of Antigone's two brothers is not be buried because he betrayed his City State (ie Country) because he went to the neighboring city state and fought for the enemy. Ultimately being killed by his brother during a battle and by wounding the other brother sufficiently that they both ended up dead. These were just the first deaths in the family. The evil uncle ends up killing most of the family. The family members show how dysfunctional a family can be both in the ancient world and we can relate this to life today. In today's world having an appreciation for the affection, love and loyalty shown in the play \\"Antigone\\" by the sisters is a good lesson for reader's today. Finally, an understanding of the importance of having good family relationships to prevent dysfunctionality along with an understanding of duty to Country can a benefit to the modern reader."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"You probably already know the story of Antigone, I'm not going to go into reviewing the play. If you're looking for that, look elsewhere.You might, for an instant, think \\"Why would I pay $8 for the Marianne McDonald translation when Dover Thrift offers one for $1.50?\\"Because you can understand the Marianne McDonald version.Taking a class and need a copy? If you buy the Dover Thrift edition, as a (most likely) student-reader, you'll find the language difficult and mind-boggling and you'll hate the play (which would be a tragedy in and of itself). What you may not know is that the play is actually good, it's the translation that sucks and there are better translations out there that'll give you a better idea of why this work is so highly touted.The Marianne McDonald translation allows you to follow the characters, their wants and needs, with all the nuances you'd expect from a classic work without needing a professor hovering over your shoulder. You'll judge the work for the work itself, instead of struggling with such an archaic, unapproachable piece of crap that you might as well have been reading the original Ancient Greek.Marianne McDonald's translation is excellent, so shell out the extra few bucks and get a version you'll love, instead of one you might as well throw into the trash."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"ThoughtsI feel that Sophocles \\"Antigone\\" was rather enjoyable. I loved the irony throughout the whole story that Sophocles is so great at. I loved how the whole fight happened between a family. It resembles a modern day family. The brothers fighting, siblings fight non-stop. I look at Creon and Antigone's relationship to resemble at father daughter relationship. Creon being the father of a teenager, (Antigone), who is looking at things for herself and going against her father's (Creon) rules. Also the irony of how the people that Creon really cared about were the people who ended up dead in the end. His pride was too great; his emotions did not stand a chance against his pride. It was very easy to relate to the plot of the play.Personally I feel that Sophocles was trying to say that you have to be aware of what is really important in your life. You have to sit down and think about if what you are doing will bring you happiness in the end. Creon was not the greatest at this. He decided to put his pride in front of his family. In his mind there was no way a woman would go against what he said and get away with it. Even if it was his niece, and future daughter in law. But I can not put all of this on Creon. Antigone also was very prideful. But unlike Creon, she decided that family was more important then the laws of the land. While Antigone's decision making could be considered arguable, I would say it was safe to say that Creon did have his priorities mixed up.From reading the play I have been able to reevaluate my life. From seeing the way that Creon ended up in the end, I decided to take my pride and put it towards the back of the line. In my life my relationship with Jesus Christ should be first, but other things always seem to slip in there. Maybe it is not pride, maybe pride was just used as a substitute for something, maybe it is an addiction, or something else that interferes with what is really important. I have had the chance to look at my life and get my \\"pride\\" in order. Something like that can tear a man apart and his family. Sophocles wrote a great example of this.If you have not read Antigone yet, I would highly recommend it. I feel it is a great story. It has a strong plot. But I feel the most enjoyable part of reading it comes from when you take it off of paper and you put in your life. Now I'm not saying go and live your life by a play written more then 2000 years ago. But no one is perfect, except my savior, Jesus Christ, and until the day I am standing next to him, I would do mostly anything to strive for perfection. I being a Christian am called to be like Christ. So if taking something that I have read and try to make it apart of my life helps me along the road then I say why not. Read it, enjoy it, apply it."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"The book did not look like the one that is presented in the image, it has a completely different cover, which i didn't really like.however, the book was in great condition. shipped at a reasonable amount of time."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"Can't go wrong with Sophocles!

I honestly haven't used any other edition or version of this play, but this specific one is great."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"Sophocles finished the trilogy nicely with this. Part 3 basically revolves around the contrast between Creon's hatred and Antigone's compassion. Creon's son also plays an interesting role. He sways between his father and Antigone, and finally he chooses Antigone. The death of Antigone and Creon's son is a worthy followup to the horror of Oediuus blinding himself and the beauty of Oedipus &quot;seemingly sighted&quot; entering the Greek version of heaven. It is also interesting that when Creon beholds this horror, he too becomes human again. It is interesting that Sophocles creates both intense horror and beauty in each part of the trilogy. Also, the horror in his plays returns the characters to humanity."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"This is a great, tragic play. It's not too hard to read, and it's pretty short (!), so you could read it in a day probably. This play will have you questioning what you would do in both Antigone's and Creon's situations, so you know it's pretty good. And the important question: who's the tragic hero?!? I'm still deciding"},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"Antigone Critique:Reading Antigone had a positive approach for me because it has a lot of morals and principles in it. Which you can learn from and apply to you in everything you do. At first I thought that it was going to horrible, especially when you just start off because how they write it, is awkward at first. But when you start to examine and go deeper into what they may be trying to say then you can really learn and evaluate on what there point may be or what they may wanting to get across to you..I believe that Sophocles' main purpose to write this play was because in his day having a woman even as the name of his play was a big thing, so the play did emphasize on the role and leadership that a woman held. And part of the issue in the book was that Antigone was going against the customs and normal behavior of a woman, which did not please Creon. Also I believe that maybe Sophocles was trying to get a message across to evaluate your priorities and to stand up for what you believe in. He also may be trying to prove that \\"Hubris\\" -which is pride- can cause you to be blind. The fact that maybe the gods did want the brother to be buried or that Antigone's motive could have been right in what she did which was to honor her brother.I personally have learned that when you are disagreeing that you should try to put aside your pride and think of the reason or situation that the other person is in. To put your pride away and give it up to God, to totally surrender your will to Him and not rely on yourself to get the things YOU want done but to act in His will.I would definitely recommend this book. I think that it has an awesome point to it and values in it, but you just have to try and look for them. It is a little hard to follow sometimes, but keep it up and maybe you'll enjoy it too."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"The script of Antigone was not a story I favored. The character Creon, was the only one who lived at the end and Sophocles did not say what had happened to Ismene. It also didn't help that I didn't understand some of the lines because the way they talked so different from the way we talk now. I did not like the character Creon, because he had a really big issue about women teaching him or women being taught because they were supposedly a lower species. He had absolutely no respect for women and I think that really bugged me because man and women were made equal.I think Sophocles main point in writing this script was to entertain the gods,because he would get a bunch of people together and act it out for the gods the best they could,because they had very high respect for the gods in those times.Though I did not understand all of the script, I've learned a life lesson while reading this, and that is, that you should always put family first and their opinions because, they are the people that matter the most in you life. I've also learned that if you do not listen to your counsel, the nation will over come you. Another thing is that the women now are treated so much better than the ancient greek times and we should be grateful for that.I would recommend this scriptto mature teens and adults, because i think that they would understand it and be able to enjoy it the most. I would not recommend this script to someone who may have a hard time reading ancient greek talk because it would of couse be difficult to understand and they will not be able to enjoy the script."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"I think that the over all reading of Antigone was not positive and i really did not comprehend it. What i did understand was not possitive.The story was verry tragic and seemed to loose its edge at times. Now maybe because i am a young reader i did not find it intresting but it did have some good scenes.Sophocles's main Purpose in Writeing was to entertain the greek Gods. The Gods were a Verry big Obsession back then.One thing i did learn however was that i must never take my rights in this country as a woman for granted. Back then women did not have the same rights we have today. I can say watever i want and voice my opinion without being persecuted. Back then women were killed for less then that and shown little respect.I think that being greatful for my country, freedom, and rights is deffinatly sometihng i learned to do from the reading.I would not reccomend this book to anyone through the ages of 6-16 because i thought it was verry boreing and it wasnt intresting to the young reader. The dialog beated around the bush and it wasnt entertaining to me let alone a Greek God.Now if they made a modern day version of &quot;Antigone&quot; i think that the book would attract more young readers and have a much more powerful impact. so if you are a fan of Sophocles or are just plan bored then pick up this book. if not put it back on the shelf!"},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"Antigone is a terrific play.

Stephenson's books are sadly out of print; lucky is the person to find a copy, usually thanks to Amazon.com. \\"Rochester's Wife\\" is no sequel to \\"Jane Eyre,\\" as might be suspected at first glance to the title. As with Stephenson's other books, it is an engrossing saga of people at a time when one man becomes the catalyst for action in others' lives.Dr. Kit Stone, jaded world traveler, returns to England seeking steady employment, which his sister-in-law is able to obtain through mutual friends. He becomes junior partner to the elderly Dr. Peabody, living in the doctor's home along with the doctor's unmarried adult daughter and the doctor's precocious nephew.Kit is made aware that his job is due to a recommendation given by Mrs. Rochester and eventually visits the Rochester home to thank her. This leads to a friendship that progresses, especially after Dolly, a married daughter of Dr. Peabody and close friend of Mrs. Rochester, returns to the Peabody home.Mr. Rochester suffers from a mental illness which is exacerbated by the stresses of his job in a partnership with Kit's brother. As he reaches a crisis in the manifestation of this illness, Kit seeks to help Mrs. Rochester, even as he realizes he has fallen in love with her. Rochester runs away and is gone an extended time, presumed dead when all inquiries prove fruitless. Mrs. Rochester returns to her Scottish home, leaving Kit to deal with his feelings and the simmering personality conflicts within the Peabody home, as well as his developing clientele.The story builds around the growing awareness of Dr. Stone and Mrs. Rochester that they love each other but have greater responsibilities to those around them. Hovering above everything is the fate of Mr. Rochester, even as they develop their new lives in their separate communities, apart from each other.D. E. Stephenson offers us characters who are well-developed and so real as to have the reader wish s/he could meet and make friends of these people, for all their good points and even their flaws. There are no clear-cut villains, but many are heroes in their own ways, finding a means to survive the varied traumas of their individual lives while seeking to do no harm to others and as much good as possible, within their own perception of what is best. It is a microcosm of life caught between the covers of an engaging book.If you enjoyed \\"God is an Englishman\\" and others by Delderfield, or the novels of Mary Stewart, you should enjoy this book and any others written by D. E. Stephenson as you (and Amazon.com) can locate."},{"Title":"Rochester's Wife","review":"If you're tired of the immorality in the majority of today's books, this author is just what you've been looking for. D.E. Stevenson is a great storyteller. She makes you want to keep reading about these people forever. You care about what happens to them. Yet her books have an underlying philosophy that is optimistic and uplifting. I highly recommend all of her books. You can't find this kind of quality storytelling in today's bestsellers."},{"Title":"The Martial Arts Book","review":"The best thing about this book is that it doesn't talk down to children. The author is careful to point out when she is telling a popular story and when she is telling history, and for this reason I feel her writing simultainiously gives children an acurate and traditional understanding of the roots of the major Asian martial arts traditions.Younger children will get much from the illistrations and will love to have it read to them. I teach Northern Shaolin (Kungfu)and this is the first book I've seen that makes the important connections between fighting, performing, Chinese Opera, and the Movies. It is sad that so many other books think they have to tell children that martial arts isn't about fighting. As if children would believe that anyway. Teaching children the true roots of Asian martial arts leaves plenty of room to communicate all the other important values we cherish, like appreciating great art, and reading good books."},{"Title":"The Martial Arts Book","review":"This book is the best children's book on martial arts that I have seen, (and I work in a library and study martial arts, so I look at a lot of martial arts books!). The Martial Arts Book surveys the major styles of martial arts and their history, covering a lot of ground in a very short, but wonderful volume. The subject matter is so well treated that you get all the important facts about the major styles of martial arts in a very quick read.Frequently martial arts books (especially those for children) have little information, are too sugar-coated, are too commercial, or are clearly biased towards one art over another. This book, however, presents all the different styles of martial arts in a fair and equal manner. The maps, pictures, and asides do an excellent job of untangling the often confusing history of martial arts. The authors do not make light of martial arts myths, either - they realize that martial arts history is as much legend as fact and that to ignore the legends is to ignore a rich history. The legends told in the book are some of the classic tales of martial arts.Kids interested in martial arts will eat this book up. They will love seeing how how ninjas, monks, samurai, pirates and farmers gave rise to the martial arts of today. They will also love the colorful pictures and engaging layout. Parents will appreciate the emphasis on peace, compassion, and on growing internally as well as externally. Teachers will appreciate the accuracy of the information, the historical context it will give to their students, and the frank treatment of the \\"westernization\\" of martial arts.I, personally, am impressed with how much information was packed into such a short volume in such an engaging manner."},{"Title":"The Martial Arts Book","review":"Well written for children but should be read with a parent to get the most out of this wonderfully written and illustrated book."},{"Title":"The Martial Arts Book","review":"For aspiring martial arts students, parents, children and anyone who is curious about martial arts, this book provides a simple overview of the martial world. This book has beautiful illustrations that compliment the discussions perfectly and the text is quick, easy and fun to read! Beginning with the (legendary) origins of Asian martial arts, this book follows the spread of martial arts since their alleged origin and describes how geographical, cultural and practical factors caused the martial arts to diverge into the multitude of styles that we know today. Also included in this book:Philosophies, origins and general intentions of some of the more common martial arts such as aikido, judo, karate, kendo, kung fu, tae kwon do and tai chi.The roles of philosophies such as Buddhism, Taoism and Zen in the origins and subsequent divergence of various martial arts styles.How various groups such as Shaolin monks, Samurai and Ninja used and contributed to our martial arts legacy and how modern expectations are transforming the way we practice and perceive martial arts.What to expect when enrolling in a martial arts program.A glossary of some introductory martial arts vocabulary.While this book does provide an overview of the previously stated, I do think that it could have gone into more detail about the differences between the martial arts and what makes each one unique and distinctive. However, most arts get one or two pages, which is actually not very much considering the somewhat large font size and large (but beautiful) illustrations. I was somewhat disappointed that, as an aikido practitioner, while the statements about aikido's intentions are accurate, the description of the actual martial art is incredibly vague and every other martial art is treated in much the same way. It basically just states that one martial art has more empty handed striking techniques, one martial art has more improvised weapons and one martial art focuses on diverting an opponent's energy. Also, although this book does a pretty good job of explaining why these differences exist, I think that someone who lacks a basis for comparison will still be left scratching their head wondernig how some of the arts mentioned are different IN PRACTICE.Another thing that bothered me was that it doesn't make much of an effort to satisfy any reader skepticism of its historical accuracy. While many of the stories told are indeed great stories, no sources are cited and there is virtually no distinction made between martial arts legend and martial arts history. I only took off one star though, because I understand that this is primarily a children's book and going into too much detail might alienate the younger audience.I think a great book to read after this one isThe Peaceful Way: A Children's Guide to the Traditions of the Martial Arts, which has fewer illustrations, more text and is geared toward slightly older kids. It does reiterate some of the martial arts legends from this book, but its main focus is what to expect as a beginning martial artist and how practice, dedication and responsibility can help you to grow, not just as a martial artist, but as a person.If you want to learn more about the different kinds of martial arts and how to choose the \\"right\\" martial art for you, but without having to buy a separate book for each style, my recommendation isThe Complete Idiot's Guide to Martial Arts."},{"Title":"The Martial Arts Book","review":"I bought this book because I have students who love Kung Fu and other martial arts.

Why? The book, as noted on the front cover, is \\"A Reference Guide.\\" Although Rollin does a fantastic job documenting the sources of her information, the book lacks personal input. However, it does cover a unique and somewhat uncommon topic: teenagers. Arranged chronologically, the book documents statistics and facts relating to the life of the American teenager from 1900 to the 1990's. Each chapter, which usually covers a decade, includes topics such as teens at home, teens at school, teens at work, money, fashion, slang, leisure, entertainment, movies, music, dancing, dating, sex, drugs, violence, reading, radio, comic strips, magazines, and family dynamics. Lucy Rollin deserves high marks for her dilligent, precise documentation following each chapter. Her references are clearly and correctly documented, which would make the book very ideal for research. She also includes a chapter at the end of the book called \\"A Note on Sources,\\" which highlights what she felt were her most valuble resources in writing the book. She also includes an appendix of web sites relating to teen culture. Overall, I feel that 20th Century Teen Culture was well-written for what it was, but could have been improved even further. For example, quotations from people or teens themselves would surely have elaborated upon the content. Also, more pictures of substantial size would contribute to the book's visual appeal. Despite being strictly informative, 20th Century Teen Culture is an eye-opening book with countless connections to other works and references, that can surely be appreciated by both teenagers and adults alike."},{"Title":"Twentieth-Century Teen Culture by the Decades: A Reference Guide","review":"Though this work is an excellent, one-of-a-kind compendium of U.S. teen culture in 20th Century, it is also a good bedside read.

Where else can you read American history from the perspective of how it was shaping, and shaped by, a kid growing up in it?

Mankind had been reduced to a fraction of its population when the polar ice caps melted (the greenhouse effect bore fruit). The technological world was wiped out and became a legend that only a few believed (the magic mirrors - TV; the self-propelled carriages and flying machines - cars and airplanes). But part of the legend is that at every new millennium, mankind gets another chance, and there are rumors of the Forthcoming of the White Bird of Dawning that will conquer the Blackbird of Fear. The Church Militant, however, is bent on keeping the Blackbirds (the Falcons) in power. Hope arrives in the form of a young boy, Tom, who has the power to stir the human mind with his magical music. &quot;It was as though all the promise of life was twinkling inside him like sunshine in a waterdrop...&quot; says a witness. Asked what it is that he does when he plays his pipes, Tom says, &quot;I join myself to them. I build a bridge and walk to them over it. I take their thoughts and give them back my own.&quot; He makes people see the White Bird - until he is martyred at York and there is nothing left but a lost testament telling of the mysterious Bride of Time, the Bird of Dawning and the Creed of Kinship.Now segue 1,000 years into the PAST (before the great &quot;Drowning&quot;) into a world of cathode ray encephalographs, sine wave frequency, and O.O.B.E.'s (out of body experiences). Seems some British scientists have made contact with Thomas of Norwitch, who is floating in the Somersea (which used to be Somerset) thrown overboard and left for dead because he's a kinsman. The scientist Carver finds himself in Thomas' consciousness. Carver wouldn't be detected at all if not for Jane, the Kinfolk girl with e.s.p. powers who knows he is there and reaches back 1,000 years to contact the Bride of Time in his reality.At first you might get the impression that this is sword and sorcery at worst or fantasy at best until you get to the second book and you know it's true science fiction. I know of few writers who can pull this off - Ursula LeGuin comes to mind. This novel, because of the &quot;Church Militant&quot;, has been compared to *A Canticle for Libowitz*, but for sheer lyricism and philosophical depth, it reminds me most of *Engine Summer* by John Crowley. Cowper made this into a trilogy - the kinship novels - all well worth reading, but this first one, with its sense of wonder and delight, is, in my opinion, his best.pamhan99@aol.com"},{"Title":"The Road to Corlay","review":"Richard Cowper is well known for... well, nothing really. I happened to pick up his novel Profundis one year ago. I found his writing to be witty, charming and well-educated. I took a shot at reading The Road to Corlay because of these characteristics of Cowper's writing. Taking one look at the cover of my edition (Pocket, 1979), it looks like a fantasy novel through-and-through -- my expectations remained aloft even though fantasy isn't my forte.The 239-page book begins with a 62-page prologue called \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" which is actually a short story by itself and is included in SOME editions of The Road to Corlay. A quarter of the book brings the reader up to speed about the history of the region where the novel is set- around the Bristol, Southampton, Exeter region of south England. However, the time of the plot is set around the year 3000 after the earth had been flooded, so the bucolic landlocked English setting is actually a bucolic seaside setting. The prologue/short story is a mini-saga of a man who is a minstrel of sorts and a boy with a lute (ah, but no ordinary lute, you see). With this lute, the boy is able to charm animals (salmon jump to him and dogs cower in obedience) but can also be made to sooth the minds of humans. This special trait becomes known to the wider Kingdom and his following is called heresy by Falconry Church. Their death is demanded.After the prologue ends, the reader witness the aftermath of the decree one decade later, where the boy's lute-fingering has become legendary and now a following called the Kinship of the White Bird is wide-spread but still secret. From this point on, two stories emerge: one involving a man found at sea and his recuperation at a family's cottage where a young woman possesses the gift of mind-reading and clairvoyance. The second story takes place around 1970 during an experiment in which Michael falls into coma but still exhibits mental patterns of social interaction. This observation infers that he has made contact with another mind in the future. Like Connie Willis' Doomsday Book where a physical person travels BACK in time, in The Road to Corlay a mentality of a person is transposed into someone in the FUTURE... both highlighting the quaint English countryside.So yes, for the most part this novel contains very un-SF-like elements. For a seasoned SF reader like myself, the inclusion of mind-reading, Middle English language and kinships are irking. Cowper keeps in lively with a grand search for the heretics, quests for artifacts and the appearance of new characters always adding extra dimension to the plot. The climax and conclusion of both storylines were somewhat solemn but still radiated a sense of completion.Little did I know that there are two sequels to The Road to Corlay: A Dream of Kinship and A Tapestry of Time. Hopefully, if I'm able to get my paws on these, a link between the two plot lines would become clearer and a more resolute conclusion could be made. For something different and intelligent, The Road to Corlay is notable even for an astute SF connoisseur such as myself."},{"Title":"Theories of the Chakras: Bridge to Higher Consciousness (Quest Books)","review":"Knowing about the chakras is essential for spiritual development. The chakras are energy centres within the three human bodies: the etheric physical, astral and mental. We ought to learn about these centres as their awakening and unfoldment will be part of every person's growth. (ie. There'll be a lifetime when the disciple or initiate is unable to ignore the chakras.) Chakras are doors to the higher realms, and keys to spiritual powers.There are ancient texts from Eastern religions on this subject. Among the more modern accounts of this are three classical 20th century books: \\"The Serpent Power\\" (1918) by Arthur Avalon, \\"The Chakras\\" (1926) by CW Leadbeater and \\"Theories of the Chakras: Bridge to Higher Consciousness\\" (1981) by Hiroshi Motoyama. Motoyama's book covers the other two and presents yogic exercises as taught by Swami Satyananda. The exercises are postures (Asanas) designed to gradually and safely prepare the physical body for opening of the seven main chakras.The chakras are all linked by energy flow lines throughout the body known as nadis. The nadis are also related to the so-called meridians, which were well known to acupuncturists for thousands of years in China. The meridians are also utilised in Shiatsu, or \\"Touch for Health\\" where pressure-points on the body are massaged or pressed. The study by Motoyama discusses the chakras':-1. Locations in the body(or inner bodies),2. Appearance, descriptions and symbolisms,3. Qualities when opened or awakened.In addition Motoyama devised electrical instruments to measure the comparative \\"charge\\" around chakras and through the nadis. This part of the book is a bit dry, however the overall text is significant.The interesting part about the books on chakras is that each says the unfoldment of these centres is a precise science for the initiate. Understandably then, the books can only at best imply the techniques for awakening the chakras by leaving many gaps in the descriptions for the disciple to fill. Furthermore, there is always the sensible warning that wrong or premature awakening of chakras can lead to physical, emotional or mental illness or even death. Despite there being now a lot of chakra books around, I think Motoyama's account is the best starting point."},{"Title":"Theories of the Chakras: Bridge to Higher Consciousness (Quest Books)","review":"To me the chakras have always been one of the mystical aspects of Yoga; even after more than 20 years of Yoga practise. This book explains and effectively de-mystifies it. Why? Because the author not only shares the theories of the Chakras but also tries to substantiate it with emperical evidence - both his own as well as experimental.Apart from explaining the different energy centers (Chakras) in the body, a series of asanas and techniques are outlined to awaken each of them. The best part of the book is the personal experience of the author. In this he explains how each of his chakras were awakened and what impact it had in his life. This (and my own experience of awakening of 2 of the centres) helped me believe in the existence of the chakras."},{"Title":"Theories of the Chakras: Bridge to Higher Consciousness (Quest Books)","review":"I found this book in a Rishikesh (India) bookstore in 2001. I have since lost it and had to get another copy online.In chapter 4 of the book Motoyama outlines practices for raising the Kundalini, mostly based on Swami Satyananda Saraswati, Shivananda's most important student. For this chapter the book easily earns 5 stars and the title of the *** BEST KUNDALINI BOOK AROUND ***. It is a must for anyone looking at Yoga as more than gymnastics. The book shows that the amount of Yoga you have to do to get enlightened is less than it takes to become a Yoga teacher: perhaps 6 months of serious practice can cover it.Since the bulk of the chakra awakening practices is comprised of meditation procedures, it is advised to get serious in meditation before approaching it. Going all the way to Samadhi, the deepest \\"no-mind\\" meditative state, now takes only a few months based on a 3-week course teaching the SSY technique: www.ssy.org[Side note:Swami Satyananda established the famous Bihar School of Yoga, and authored the recommended \\"Asana Pranayama Mudra Bandha\\", the second most popular Yoga reference manual after Iyengar's \\"Light on Yoga\\".The Bihar School of Yoga also teaches Vedic massage, probably the best massage technique in the world today. Seek it out if you come upon it, one treatment can solve major health problems.]Outstanding and important. IT MIGHT BE THE ONLY YOGA BOOK YOU NEED."},{"Title":"Theories of the Chakras: Bridge to Higher Consciousness (Quest Books)","review":"This book attempts to reconcile the two major eastern approaches to non-western medicine, the chakra system of Indian and the meridian system of China and Japan. The author, a research in the area of TCM and a yogi, reviews different ways the chakras are described of the chakras and develops relationships between these system. He presents his own approach to opening the chakras based his observations.Overall, this is an interesting but dry book. Anyone interested in the possiblity of the chakras and nadis existing will find it informative. It's best read in small sections."},{"Title":"Theories of the Chakras: Bridge to Higher Consciousness (Quest Books)","review":"If you read this book cover to cover, you may be disappointed. When reading this book, it is imperative to keep in mind that this book best functions as a reference manual for all things Chakra related. A glance at the table of contents reveals that the book bounces about quite eclectically. It begins as a technical manual of yogic cultivation as per the Yoga Sutra. Here Motoyama presents which Asanas, Pranayama, Bandhas and Mudras are appropriate for awakening which Chakra. This very much reads like an exercise book. It then changes tone quite a bit and looks into Vedic reference to the Chakras along with detailed depictions of the location and function of the Nadis. This is followed by a summarized explanation of two modern insightful practitioners; Swami Satyananda and C. W. Leadbeater. This is concluded with the personal experiences of Motoyama concerning when and how he opened his various Chakras.So, if you think you'll be able to read this beginning to end and obtain one concise view of the Chakras, you'll be sadly disappointed. However, if you're looking for an inclusive manual for general understanding, advice for yogic practice and a general reference, this book delivers!"},{"Title":"Theories of the Chakras: Bridge to Higher Consciousness (Quest Books)","review":"The book is well written and is a good reference book.

I stayed up late to finish The Living End last night and it was time well spent. Quirky, yet real-life characters (reminiscent of Anne Tyler) inhabit and leave their mark on Pearl's crumbling world. And no trite or easy answers here as Pearl struggles to find meaning and purpose in a broken world.Samson's command of language is enviable - sometimes fierce, sometimes tender, but always exquisite. A great book, and if you're smart...you'll read it.Also recommended: Anything by Richard Russo, Anne Tyler, Tom Wolfe, Brad Whittington, Leif Enger"},{"Title":"The Living End","review":"Lisa Samson continues to amaze with her ability to surprise and move us through real, flawed yet somehow dignified and hopeful characters. This is my favorite of her books so far, and I can't wait for the next!"},{"Title":"The Living End","review":"The book was about a women whose husband/soulmate dies unexpectantly after a stroke. She is quite devastated and doesn't know how to move on. She decides to fulfill her husband's &quot;to-do&quot; list and then end her life. But she meets so interesting people along her quest to fulfill her husband's to-do list, people who help her to find her faith in God and to make her realize that her life is worth living after all.I love books by Lisa Samson. Her sense of humor and unique voice comes through so good. I love her flawed, yet lovable characters. I love the names Pearly, Cheeta, and Peta.The author did a really good job in showing how much pain Pearly was in when she lost her husband. It was clear that she loved her husband very much.Pearly comes up with a unique way to commit suicide. I won't go into the details as I don't want to spoil the book for you, but things are resolved beautifully at the end and Pearly decides that life is worth living and that she has so many people who love her. I loved how all the things happened at the end of the book where Pearly's life is spared at the last minute and how God really makes things happen for a reason and that He really is in controlLisa Samson has a subtle way of presenting God's truth without sounding preachy and without making you feel like she is shoving the Bible down your throat.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Living End","review":"This is the first of Samson I have ever read, and I really enjoyed it a lot.Pearly, quite an eccentric character, loses her husband to a massive stroke. In the beginning of the book is when Joey dies, and Pearly is totally grief-stricken. So much so that she is really in deep denial and can't attend the funeral or anything. She has a friend arrange the whole thing as she just can't face it.In going through Joey's keepsakes, she finds his journal that he has kept up for years. He was always such a strong believer in God, and had a lot of faith, whereas Pearly never did any of it. As Pearly goes through the journal, she finds her husband worried a lot about Pearly's lack of concern for God and prayer.She also finds a list of what Joey intended to do while he was alive, and Pearly, needing fulfillment somewhere in her life know, decides to fulfill her husband's wishes. But after she does this, she wants to die and be with her husband, and she has plans for suicide after accomplishing this.Well, as the story moves right along events happen to Pearly that will change circumstances. And it takes a long time, but eventually she'll come to believe, and finally fulfilled seeing that life has a purpose for her; in fact many purposes."},{"Title":"The Living End","review":"Lisa Samson draws such vivid, real characters that I feel like I know them. Or want to. Their quirkiness is always endearing and their actions authentic.The Living End is no different.Pearly Laurel could be me. Or my best friend. Maybe you. Written with incredible skill, and amazing attention to the truth of her character, I found it a difficult story to read but compelling nonetheless. A story, and people, that make you care.Can it get any better?"},{"Title":"The Living End","review":"It would be hard to come away from this book without your outlook in life being forever changed. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Living End","review":"I admit that I am a diehard Lisa Samson fan, but this is her best book yet. Pearly Laurel made me cry and made me laugh. I suffered with her when she lost her husband, and I rejoiced with her as she found both healing and a unique family. I was definitely surprised by the ending. This was an I-can't-put-the-book-down read that made me stay up way too late, into the wee hours of morning, just so I could see what happened next."},{"Title":"The Living End","review":"This was not an easy book for me to read because there was little chance of remaining detached from Pearly. Using superb skills, Lisa Samson pulled me into the very thoughts of a freshly widowed woman. The details were incredible: I could see the dust settle in the empty house, taste the bitter shaving cream on the mirror, and feel the comfort of Joe's shirt. To be a bystander was impossible.Pearly develops from a woman focused solely on her husband to an individual, a friend, and a mother. As always, Samson's characters make the story come alive. There is nothing better than a fresh perspective on life. Find it within the pages of The Living End."},{"Title":"The Living End","review":"Lisa Samson is an excellent writer. I have loved her other books, but The Living End was difficult to read. I had to force myself to continue reading the first one-third of the book. Granted the main character was going through an excruciatingly difficult time, but it was so depressing that I felt depressed just from reading it. Is that perhaps part of a writer's goal, to transfer her characters' emotions to the reader? If so then, Ms. Samson did an excellent job. The last one-third of the book was much better, and the story ended up having some redeeming qualities. However, I'm not sure I'd recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Living End","review":"Lisa Samson's most recent novels have been about modern women in hard situations and how they deal with them. This is the story of how one childless, unbelieving woman struggles when her believing husband dies unexpectedly. Mrs Samson's books are always emotional, always deeply thoughtful, and always have some kind of quirky fun to be found somewhere within. Very real life, in a way that makes you think with your head and heart, they also offer a refreshing and different perspective on God. Lisa Samson's stories are never predictable, and The Living End is no exception, with a breathtaking ending. Great for yourself or as a gift for a friend, Mrs Samson is one of the best authors you could choose to read."},{"Title":"The Living End","review":"This was a really touching book, one I should have saved for a vacation because I stayed up way too late on a work night finishing it. Lisa Samson knows how to approach real life and death issues with such gut-wrenching honesty, humor(the zany, quirky, off-beat kind that I enjoy,) and hope. Lisa Samson always gets to the heart of the matter and makes me examine my own life. This is one great book, all about this journey we call life!"},{"Title":"The Living End","review":"I am a big Lisa Samson fan, and enjoyed this book. I do think though, that the plot was a little more far fetched than her usual work. I would recommend some of her other writings before this one."},{"Title":"The Living End","review":"I read the other reviews for this book and eagerly anticipated reading it. However, half way through I was so mad I had to stop reading it. How could Pearly leave her husband at the hospital and then run away leaving others to care for his funeral? I found Pearly very selfish. A friend of mine told me what happened in the rest of the book and I am very thankful I didn't finish it. I hope that I would never act this way if I was in her situation."},{"Title":"Teaching Portfolios: Presenting your Professional Best","review":"Towards the last year or semester of a teaching candidate's collegiate career (whether it be early childhood, elementary, or secondary) everyone has to collect, organize, and put together a personal PORTFOLIO. This Portfolio is supposed to be a binder full of items that represent an education student's work as a student teacher and also displays the potential the student has when they become a regular teacher. The Portfolio is supposed to be the thing that candidates bring with them to job interviews to help answer questions during interviews. The Portfolio is supposed to be a really big deal. In reality, the portfolio is a bigger deal in teacher education programs on campuses than it is during job interviews. The majority of principals and evaluators don't have the time to even glance through a portfolio, let alone read it in depth and many of the ones that do examine them can only look at bits and pieces.Nevertheless, throughout a teaching candidates collegiate experience they will be bombarded over the head about \\"your portfolio.\\" Freshman through junior years candidates hear about the portfolio over and over and over again, but no one ever explains what the portfolio really is until the semester when it is first due. By that time students are so freaking out about it that they drive themselves crazy. Usually, there is little explanation about what is supposed to be contained in the portfolio and why each item is necessary.For those students who are putting together their portfolio for the first time, TEACHING PORTFOLIOS is a book that could come in handy. The book is geared more towards elementary students, but has some useful ideas and suggestions for all education students. The first chapter gives a brief definition of a portfolio and reasons for why they exist. The rest of the chapters cover things that should probably be in a teaching portfolio (though these will very from state to state, school to school, and age level to age level). I had already put together a portfolio after my observing semester was over, but I read this book at the beginning of my student teaching and it provided a few handy ideas.The text itself is rather boring to read, except for the example sections. However, it is useful and could be a valuable tool for someone trying to put together their teaching portfolio for the first time."},{"Title":"Teaching Portfolios: Presenting your Professional Best","review":"...I would use this book in my undergraduates because it keeps it simple (just like Gober's Six Ways To Assess Young Children keeps assessment simple).Chapter 7 is a wonderful chapter because it makes sure that teaches know the essential idea of continually reflecting on previous experiences.Wonderful."},{"Title":"The Actuarial use of the MMPI with adolescents and adults","review":"This is an excellent book of MMPI profiles.

Stahl's guide went far beyond a standard nursing drug reference, including sections on \\"how to dose\\", \\"best augmenting combos for partial response or treatment resistance\\" and a section for considerations in special populations (renal impairment, geriatric, children, pregnancy). The format and layout is easy on the eye, and it doesn't read like a heavy pharmacology text. Of the hundreds of manuals I have on my shelf at home--this is the one I carry to work everyday.

Side effects are listed, the anticipated time before they fade away, and suggestions for mitigating their unpleasantness when available. The language is easy reading and translates well for client/patient teaching about side effects, both common and serious, drug-drug interactions, and use in special populations, children, pregnant, elderly, and those with impaired kidney and hepatic functions. The text is pleasant on the eye with sections color coded for easy search and it possess a readable font, something often lacking in pharmacological texts.

It very helpfully cross-references the pharmacological name with the current brand names. A small problem for me is that it does not have all the Australian brand names so when this happens I check the web, then add these into the book, but this is only rarely needed.The book gives me confidence in greater awareness of what might be medication-induced side-effects when I am seeing a client and also how to provide more information to them about meds as it appears that they often don't have this.

And, owing to unfortunate realities of the health care system and medical training, a quick reference is often all there is time for. There are other reference books for psych drugs, most of which are smaller and more portable. However, the other guides tend to lump drugs into categories, with a chapter on the atypicals, for example, in which they discuss the drugs as a class and bounce around between drugs within the class for specific details. This may be helpful for learning purposes, but when you want information on a specific medication, Stahl and Stahl's presentation is much more helpful. I refer back to this book often, and particularly find it helpful when a patient comes in on a medication, from another prescriber, with which I am not too familiar. The information is presented in a very clear, well-ordered way, including standard graphic representations of receptor types and mechanisms involved and side effect profiles. Also helpful are tips on the art of prescribing, which are collected bits of practical wisdom from those more experienced.This book won't fit in a white coat pocket, but it's worth it. 5 stars, I highly recommend it, buy it now.

It is poorly written, poorly researched, and poorly executed. Most photography books fall into or contain elements from three categories: technical information, personal experience, and creative inspiration. This book fails to deliver in any meaningful way in any of those categories.The use of technical language is sloppy and at times misleading.The lessons presented are meant to be followed precisely, but the example photographs are imprecise creative interpretations - giving no technical, accurate means to compare one's work to what is expected.The content of the book is artificially padded by frequent repetition of definitions and descriptions used in previous chapters.The suggested exercises tend to resemble busy work and leave the task of actually interpreting concepts and results to the student with little guidance or reference.The text claims to be presenting general concepts which the student photographer can use to apply to a variety of equipment and situations. What it actually does is describe the specific use of specific equipment in specific ways to reproduce an example scenario.This book, which claims to be a textbook for studio lighting, fails to ever define, describe, mention the importance of, or even provide practical information for the handling of the following CRITICAL principles of studio photography:The distinction between direct, diffused, and specular highlights.The principle of the family of angles of reflectance.The principle of how surface material and color impact the nature of reflection.The principle of how reflector material impacts its efficiency, color, and the nature of its reflected light.Grids. Seriously. Grids are never mentioned even once in this book. Neither are snoots. No means of increasing directionality of a light is covered in this book other than casual mention of barn doors (and presumption that the student has access to the use of barn doors) and the use of a spotlight with an adjustable lens.Spill.Feathering.The nature of metal, glass, and plastic. There is one practical example of managing specular reflection in metal but it is never explained - the student is simply directed to follow particular steps and is never told why. Managing the process of photographing glass is never covered in any meaningful way, despite it being a hugely popular subject.Bloom. The student is frequently encouraged to \\"overexpose\\" surfaces to achieve the color white, but the subject of bloom and flare are never mentioned as a concern in this technique.Gobos/Flags. A few assignments describe the use of these tools as part of following the specific instructions for that lesson, but throughout the book the student is simply told to \\"check for flare\\" or \\"move the light\\".Negative fill is never mentioned and never utilized.These are all just the things I found missing from the book off the top of my head. An exhaustive, critical analysis of what is wrong with this book would have to be nearly as long as the book itself. There is something either incorrect, misleading, poorly executed, or missing on nearly every page. The small section devoted to the concept of high key portraiture may as well have suggested the student shine a flashlight into the camera just to get more overexposed regions.The actual, useful technical information in this book - the actual impact this book would have on improving a student photographer's grasp of light or studio techniques - would probably be equivalent to tearing five pages at random out of the book Light, Science & Magic, and telling the student photographer to just figure the rest out through practice."},{"Title":"Studio Photography: Essential Skills","review":"I found this book to be basic.

The students from this course have gone on to be some of Australia's (and the World's) best commercial photographers. And guess what? They've all been learning from this book. All the \\"show-case\\" images used throughout the book (including the cover) are created by students studying this course and following this book.John is an award winning photographer and advertising film maker. His approach to teaching is simple yet engaging and encourages the reader to think.In summary, there are no quick-fix-ready-mix approaches to lighting.

In 1784, it became part of the Northwest Territories, but remained under British control until 1813. By 1819, the Thumb was opened to settlement along the shores of Lake Huron and the Saginaw Bay. Populated by forests of hardwoods and evergreens, lumber camps and mills began clearing the forests. By the dry, hot summer of 1881, acre after acre of deadwood littered the landscape and forest fires raged everywhere, small, controlled fires turning into a blazing inferno, as much as 1,500 square miles, from Saginaw to Lake Huron decimated in a few days, hundreds of people dead in its wake. The Red Cross stepped in, offering relief to its first disaster.Without photographs, it would be impossible to imagine the evolution of this magnificent terrain. In this slim volume, the Huron County Historical Society offers a pictorial history of the regions communities: Bad Axe, Bay Port and Ora Labora, Pigeon, Port Austin, Caseville, Elkton, Harbor Beach and Port Hope, Sebewaing, Ubly and White Rock.The rapid redevelopment was aided by the railroads in 1882, encouraging new settlers from Canada, New York and the southern states, building rural schools, post offices, general stores and other amenities for a booming economy, Huron County a leading agricultural center in the state after the fire. Today Huron County is supported by agriculture, commercial fishing and manufacturing, Bad Axe and Harbor Beach the two largest cities of nine villages and numerous communities with no organized local government, ninety miles of shoreline enjoyed by summer visitors, museums dotting the landscape that embodies the American spirit of rebuilding in the face of natural disaster.Over two hundred vintage photographs celebrate the indomitable spirit of people who braved hardship to create homes and opportunity in an era of booming industrialization. This untamed land is bountiful, demanding respect from those who seek to dwell there, page after page of turn-of-the-century determination, merchants posing before their wood-framed mercantiles, motor cars on Huron Ave., long-skirted matrons herding their children through mulling crowds, well-to-do tourists at a Bay Port train station, the other-worldly elegance of the Bay Port Hotel. These photographs are remarkable, a vivid reminder of the early 1900s, from the unpaved streets of horse and buggy days to the modern motor cars and railroads that delivered saleable goods to businesses. There are striking beaches, timbered forests, wooden steamers at the docks now replaced by other attractions, loading docks left to the ravages of time, men in overalls on the waterfronts. This visual history is a reminder of the not so distant past when America was defined by the hard work of those in intimate communication with the land that yielded such bounty, a rich and valuable heritage.

The volume is printed on high-quality gloss paper, with one photo per page, with a tastefully limited text per image. Truly a joy for everyone from the casual historian to the dedicated collector.I believe that some preface is needed before one purchases this (and soon to be other!) volume. Photo coverage of Waffen-SS activities in WWII is VERY limited. Most negatives were destroyed at the end of the war by German authorities. All the images in the book were extracted from photo contact sheets (each roll of film is printed on a small sheet of photo paper for proof purposes), scanned, and painstakingly digitally edited (this is a difficult process having done this myself).Compared to most Waffen-SS sources, this is a leap forward in quality (and quantity). Thanks to RZM (rzm.com) and Remy Spezzano for this rare gift to the WWII enthusiast as well as the casual reader.

Unlike other books on the subject there are a lot of original photos and some quite unusual sences (not just tanks and prisoners of war). If you don't like the fact that there is not enough text, there is very little, then you are missing the point entirely.

You have to go to the end of the book to read a more detailed description. I understand that this was necessary to preserve the format of the book but it took some getting used to.

The source material comes from six war correspondentswho were assigned to Waffen SS divisions participating in the conflict. The book is on the expensive side but I did not object because of the quality of the reproduction, and what is probably a small press run for a limited market. I assume succeeding volumes will continue with the progress of the battle. The reader is almost put into the scene with the soldiers as the correspondents took pains to combine the details and personal aspect of the Eastern front as well as the broad context of fighting in a figureless landscape.This book and those that follow should be well received by those interested in the Kursk battle or the fighting on the Eastern front in WWII. It is intented to bring the human element into the conflict and the photo selections have accomplished this well. As a student of the Eastern front conflict I found thebook a welcome addition to my library."},{"Title":"Waffen-SS KURSK 1943 Volume 1 (Archive Series)","review":"Volume 1 of this series contains photos taken by three photo-journalists with the Waffen-SS Propaganda Company. Two of these wartime photographers (\\"Kriegsberichte\\") were assigned to the 1st SS Division, Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler. The other was on assignment with the 3rd SS Division, Totenkopf. Thus, this first volume basically contains photos pertaining only to those two divisions. (The same is likely to be true of the other five volumes because of the six photographers who took the photos displayed in all six volumes, three were assigned to the Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler Division and the other three were assigned to the Totenkopf Division. As the war ended, an order came down to destroy all photos and negatives in the Waffen-SS propaganda archives. These six volumes are comprised of photos painstakingly reproduced from some contact sheets, depicting 28 rolls of film of action in and around the Kursk tank battle, that somehow survived.)Volume 1 contains 89 photos in all. About a third or more are reproduced in amazing clarity. The rest are of average to above average quality. The pictures ranges from depictions of the SSLAH attending an outdoor concert to the troops being emplaced or moving out to battle.Many of the photos are simply stunning. There are photos, for example, of Nebelwerfer rockets being fired and streaking across the sky and a machine gun emplacement showing the machine gun crew wearing their camouflage masks. In many photos you can actually read the cuffbands and clearly see the SS runes and death's head symbol on the soldier's uniforms.There are a few drawbacks to the book.First, the publisher crows that the photos in the book are of \\"unparalled photographic reproduction\\" and are on high-quality paper to improve the reproduction. Yet this does not appear to be the case. The photos on the front and back covers of the book are also in the book itself, but in both instances the cover photos are much, much sharper and clearer than the same photos in the book.Second, about one out of seven photos bridges the pages (i.e., runs across two pages) in the book so that you do not get a clear picture of everything in the photo. (There is no excuse for this since the photos only extend an inch or two onto the second page and the publisher could have just made the book a little bigger.)Third, the captions for each photo are quite sparse, just a short sentence. The back of the book contains additional background information on each picture, if you want to keep flipping back and forth.Overall, given its rarity well worth the money if you don't mind its flaws and can get it at a substantial discount off the cover price."},{"Title":"Waffen-SS KURSK 1943 Volume 1 (Archive Series)","review":"I purchased all 6 books in the series, the photos are all in black and white none of which I had seen before, quality is good with a basic caption under each photo and a more detail information regarding the photo and what stage of the battle is at the rear."},{"Title":"Waffen-SS KURSK 1943 Volume 1 (Archive Series)","review":"After seeing the clarity of the photos online at the publishers site I was very impressed.

This book, sadly, seems to continue the trend that has marred his sportscasting in the last few years. It does indeed contain a wealth of information about the game, and no one can deny that McCarver certainly knows his stuff, but the material is just not presented in a particularly useful way. McCarver seems more interested in showing off than in showing the reader, and while I did learn some things from reading this book, I often found it difficult to follow what he was talking about, and I frequently had to force myself to pay attention to keep from drifting off. Not something I want in my baseball books.All of this is a big disappointment since a book about baseball for baseball fans is a mighty fine idea, and I don't know that there are a lot of guys out there as knowledgeable as McCarver. But I've watched baseball my entire life, and if I couldn't follow what he was talking about, I don't know who could."},{"Title":"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans : Understanding and Interpreting the Game so You Can Watch It Like a Pro","review":"...just like a typical Tim McCarver broadcast. Never one to not let his endless explanation get in the way of your enjoyment of the game, this one picks up where his others leave off. Don't get me wrong -- McCarver's knowledge of baseball is obviously exhaustive -- but his titanic ego comes roaring through here in spectacularly dull fashion. Folks, this is the guy who hinted in the also horrible \\"Oh Baby, I Love It\\" that he helped mold Bob Gibson into a HOF pitcher (Gibson, as the story goes, once told McCarver during an unwelcome trip to the mound that the only thing McCarver knew about pitching was that he couldn't hit it).

I will admit that I find McCarver a little full of himself, and overly verbose when he broadcasts games. There are points in the book where this comes out as well. That doesn't mean that he doesn't know baseball, or that he can't explain it, which is something he does exhaustively in this book. It's a great book for understanding all that goes on in the game. I've found that reading it aloud helps to untangle some of the denser portions. So that's it: If you want a dense book that covers ever aspect of the game, I think this book is worth working through. If you're an idiot who just has it in for Mccarver and chooses to let your biases cloud your judgment, then don't get the book. And Don't review it either. See the one star reviews on this site for examples of such idiots."},{"Title":"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans : Understanding and Interpreting the Game so You Can Watch It Like a Pro","review":"Tim McCarver brings his wealth of baseball knowledge to nearly every facet of the national pastime. Readers learn about pitching and working the count, catching, hitting, baserunning, defense, the batting order, etc. By far the strongest sections (from this ex-catcher) dealt with the battery, including pitch selection, how-to-throw various pitches, and working the hitters. Students of the game should enjoy these pages, and, of course, learn quite a bit as well. Not that you will always agree with him - he suggests runners only slide feet first (Rickey Henderson showed headfirst can be better), usually favors fastballs over breaking pitches, and practically disdains pitch counts for judging a tired starter's arm. But McCarver usually makes sense, while admitting some of his views may be open to debate. McCarver also inserts interesting anecdotes about players and various situations, usually from his playing days (1959-1980) before he started broadcasting.I gave just four stars because the book's style is a bit thick and occasionally repetitive. Also, the book arrived shortly before the steroid scandals and other matters. Still, this is a solid guide for professional and amateur coaches, players, and serious fans."},{"Title":"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans : Understanding and Interpreting the Game so You Can Watch It Like a Pro","review":"This is a unique and wonderfull look at baseball at the end of the century. It's funny, on the mark and the most educational sports book I've ever read. The book truly teaches the fan (experienced or novice) so much about the inner game - not talking stats here - that one feels that you've earned a Phd in baseball when you complete the book. Tim McCarver is not only baseball's best brain, he's its best teacher as well. If you think you know baseball - read this book - you'll learn a hell of a lot more. And most of all - it's fun!"},{"Title":"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans : Understanding and Interpreting the Game so You Can Watch It Like a Pro","review":"When I first bought this book I thought the title was just a gimmick and that this would just be another half hearted attempt to explain baseball to wives and girlfriends everywhere. Well I was wrong. The info in this book even I at times find hard to follow. The only problem I have is that Mccarver spends 3/4 of the book explaining pitches and hitting counts. Balls are good for hitter, strikes good for pitcher. Its not that hard to figure out. I thought he would explain baserunning and outfielding the same way he explained the battery. He did not so I gave 3 stars."},{"Title":"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans : Understanding and Interpreting the Game so You Can Watch It Like a Pro","review":"It takes an expert - maybe even a brain surgeon - to make such an interesting topic so monumentally, colossally boring.McCarver does what many former players do when writing about baseball - they assume that their years of experience are the last word, and that no other approach is of any value. After all, he played for 21 years, didn't he? (And that's about how long it seems to take to read this thing.) This failing, on its own, is not so bad - after all, we read books by veteran players because we value their experience and insight - but coupled with some others, it is a disaster.First off, this book has precious little to do with being able to &quot;watch&quot; the game. It has a lot to do with critiquing training styles, different conventions and techniques. It has a lot to do with what pitch to throw on what count under what circumstance - but it's all for coaches and managers, not for those who want to watch and understand the game.Then, McCarver's hubris is compounded by his egocentrism. Naturally, any fan understands the unique position of the catcher and the catcher-pitcher dynamic in the game of baseball. However, McCarver isn't content to point this out once. He has a chapter on The Catcher. Then a chapter on the Battery. Then a chapter on Working the Count. I wish I was making this up. The next chapter is about &quot;Working the Lineup&quot; but by that stage if you haven't hurled the book across the room in a fit of frustrated boredom then you have the patience of a saint: every single chapter is the same! It's all about calling pitches! Even his chapters about how to bat are about how the catcher behind you is calling pitches!By the time you've got to the 700th description of what pitch you might call in a 3-0 count only this time with a man on 3rd but a left-handed pitcher whose birth sign is Taurus, the eyes have long since glazed over. All the fun, passion and intellect of the game is drained and replaced with dull rambling and repetition interspersed with the most unfunny - or just incomprehensible - anecdotes imaginable. There comes a point when the reader turns a page and the eye quails before the sight of two new pages of tedium, and looks for relief to the little cut-out box that should contain a morsel of interest to tide one through.The box will contain a story about the one time that McCarver and some guy you've never heard of were arguing about what pitch to call under what circumstance and how McCarver wanted a fastball or something. It's positively Kafkaesque in its torture of the reader.If you want a fun, well-edited, well-written guide to how to watch the game like an expert, look no further than Nick Bakalar's &quot;The Baseball Fan's Companion: How to Master the Subtleties of the World's Most Complex Team Sport and Learn to Watch the Game Like an Expert&quot;. Leave this one to a morose brain surgeon."},{"Title":"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans : Understanding and Interpreting the Game so You Can Watch It Like a Pro","review":"McCarver having been a catcher, this book contains a treasure trove of knowledge concerning what goes on in the showdown between the batter vs. the pitcher and catcher at every single pitch (and that showdown accounts for 90% of the action in any given baseball game). I have never watched a baseball game the same way since then; thanks to McCarver I understand the game and love watching it more than I ever have. I re-read this book often... it's the definitive field-guide to my favorite sport."},{"Title":"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans : Understanding and Interpreting the Game so You Can Watch It Like a Pro","review":"Forget the petty criticisms of people who are biased against the author's personality (such as the person who admitted up front not having read the book but felt compelled to write a review anyway, or the person who tries to argue that after 20+ seasons as a professional player, the author \\"knows nothing about baseball\\"). Tim McCarver has an exhaustive knowledge gleaned from over two decades of playing experience and presents information in a logical, practical manner broken down by the various categories of play. If you already have a rudimentary understanding of the game and are willing to study (as opposed to passively read) this book, you will learn a tremendous amount in just a few hundred pages. For those with a better understanding of the game, there is still much to be gained from the insights into strategy and technique. And for both types of fans, there are interesting and amusing anecdotes and observations about plays and players from games past. Those who are new to baseball will have difficulty following some of the terminology and concepts; those people would be best served watching games and reading a more basic guide before beginning McCarver's book.This book is not perfect but it's an excellent overall primer on the sport of baseball and will enhance the reader's understanding and enjoyment of the game."},{"Title":"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans : Understanding and Interpreting the Game so You Can Watch It Like a Pro","review":"When I started reading this book I thought I knew everything there is to know about the game of baseball, and maybe I would learn a few ptching tips.But after baing finished I feel that if I show George Steinbrener that I read this book, he would sign me on the spot and fire Joe Torre.

Just the way McCarver intelligently covers the game on TV, his views especially on the strategic aspect of the game are well founded and explained very logically in this piece. If you were familiar with and liked his broadcasting style (especially with the Mets), you will be pleased to find all his knowledge brewed into a single book like this one. A downside, however, is that the book reads much like a boring textbook. Throughout the book, McCarver scatters anecdotes coming from his experience both as a player and as a TV analyst to illuminate his points, yet not to the extent that they make the book engaging for its historical interest (lots of stuff about Bob Gibson, Steve Carlton, and other players from the late 60's through 70's). It might even get annoying for some readers when McCarver gets fancy and makes parallels by citing famous literary people and their work. Nevertheless, the baseball knowledge provided in this book will definitely raise the level of your capacity to enjoy baseball, and there lies its value. You wish to keep this book handy for occasional reference and as a company for watching baseball, but you will be somewhat disappointed if you hope for an exciting baseball reading."},{"Title":"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans : Understanding and Interpreting the Game so You Can Watch It Like a Pro","review":"The book gets off on the wrong foot talking too much about TV broadcasts (which camera does what, etc) - skip those chapters.Tim McCarver is a fountain of information.

The best baseball books are frequently the newest ones - a book on baseball strategy written in 1975 will not be as meaningful as a book that names Clemens, Maddux, Mac, Griffey, etc, to point out which players do things well."},{"Title":"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans : Understanding and Interpreting the Game so You Can Watch It Like a Pro","review":"This is a unique and wonderful look at baseball at the end of the century. The book is funny, on the mark and the most educational sports book I've ever read. McCarver truly teaches the fan, both experienced as well as the novice, so much about the inner game - not talking stats here - that one feels that you have earned a P.H.d in baseball when you complete the book. Timmy McCarver is not only baseball's best brain, but he's its best teacher as well. If you think you know baseball - read this book - you'll learn a heck of a lot more. And most of all, it's fun!"},{"Title":"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans : Understanding and Interpreting the Game so You Can Watch It Like a Pro","review":"There have been quite a few reviews posted already, and strangely enough, I agree with almost all of them.A few years ago, I found this book at a library sale and purchased it for about $2. It's definitely worth $2. I question whether it's worth $20.STRENGTHS- To my knowledge, no other single baseball book has ever tackled this many topics at once. Most tactical situations that could ever arise in MLB are covered.- Fans of Bob Gibson and Steve Carlton will not be disappointed.- The book is organized in such a way that you can casually read individual sections during a game, on the bus, or...well, you know.- From a technical standpoint, virtually all of the \\"skills\\" information is excellent. (There is only one correct way to throw a knuckler, after all.)- Anyone will learn at least one new fact from this book. For example, I did not know that LH batters tended to curl the bat, being a righty myself. Subsequent observation has confirmed this.WEAKNESSES- Here's the rub. Most of the strengths are also weaknesses. The book is too long and repetitive. For example, if you put it down, you can't remember if you were just reading the chapter on \\"Pitchers vs. Batters\\" or \\"Batters vs. Pitchers.\\"- Given recent developments in baseball, the book really isn't that \\"current\\" anymore. More importantly, McCarver tends to explain the games in the term of how it was played in the 1980s, throwing in more recent players as examples.- The style is very uneven, alternating between breezy anecdotes and almost textbook-like passages. Tim McCarver: Broadcaster rears his head at times.- McCarver gives excellent advice on how baseball should be broadcasted, which he now largely ignores himself. Oh, the irony...- Just four to six pages of b&w; photographs (even line drawings, for that matter) would have garnered at least another half star in my review. One of the reasons that the book seems long is that pages of ink are often spilled on something that could have been conveyed with \\"See Figure 1-3.\\"Overall, you could do a lot worse. That said, you would eventually glean most of this information from reading a few George Will books, as another reviewer mentioned."},{"Title":"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans : Understanding and Interpreting the Game so You Can Watch It Like a Pro","review":"Tim McCarver knows baseball. He knows how to play it, how to announce it, and, as the title indicates, how to watch it. He shares his knowledge in this book, which in both interesting and well written. I recommend it to any baseball fan."},{"Title":"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans : Understanding and Interpreting the Game so You Can Watch It Like a Pro","review":"I have read this book. Twice. I plan on reading it again before spring training draws to a close. Why? Because every time I pick it up, I learn something new. But. Be warned. You need basic knowledge of the game before delving into this book.But the real joy of this book is that you can pick out any chapter to read, and you wont be lost from not having read the previous one. This makes it a perfect read when you just want more insight on one particular aspect of the game, but also, makes it an easy, light read for those with less than several hours to spare to consume a whole book.Tim is truely an entertaining and very knowledgable author on the subject of America's Pastime. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans : Understanding and Interpreting the Game so You Can Watch It Like a Pro","review":"This book needs an editor. Did they just let McCarver ramble on and type what he said word for word? You literally drown in McCarver's stream of consciousness. There is no organization of thought. Ideas do not flow from one topic to the next. I gave it two stars because I feel there is information to be found in this book if you are willing to wade through the rest of the mess. It's not McCarver's fault, he's a baseball guy, not a writer or publisher. Check it out from your local library and save yourself the money. I'm returning my copy."},{"Title":"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans : Understanding and Interpreting the Game so You Can Watch It Like a Pro","review":"Wish that I could buy this bird for what I think he is worth and sell him for he thinks he is worth,Total drivel."},{"Title":"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans : Understanding and Interpreting the Game so You Can Watch It Like a Pro","review":"Anyone who has listened to his broadcasts, or read Durwood Merril's book realizes that Brain Surgery is way out of Tim's league.

There are much better ways to spend your hard earned cash!!"},{"Title":"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans : Understanding and Interpreting the Game so You Can Watch It Like a Pro","review":"I'm not a big fan of Tim McCarver, the TV analyst. So when I've seen this book I didn't give it much of a glance until just recently. I leafed through a few pages and became intrigued. I read a few more and was hooked. He does a wonderful job explaining the &quot;intricacies&quot; of the game. McCarver takes a kind of 'scientific' approach in explaining the various parts of the game, from the preparation he goes through before a televised game, to the pre-game meetings, to the actual game itself, &quot;working a lineup,&quot; what is involved in playing the various positions, pitcher-batter duels, and so on. He also talks about what is going on with each pitch and how everyone, batter, pitcher, catcher and all the other players react to various pitch counts.Since I've read the book, I've tried to be more conscious of what goes on during a game, checking to see if I can tell what signals a first or third base coach is giving, what kind of signs a catcher is giving a pitcher, or the other various strategies going on within a game. These &quot;games within the game&quot; have made watching baseball more fun. I may still at times get aggravated with McCarver's analysis during a game, but this book has made me a more knowledgeable fan."},{"Title":"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans : Understanding and Interpreting the Game so You Can Watch It Like a Pro","review":"I picked up this book thinking I knew everything there is to know about the game of baseball, boy was I wrong! I have learned so much from this book, I feel that if I told George Steinbrenner that I read Tim McCarvers Baseball For Brain Surgeans and Other Fans, that he would hire me on the spot as manager and fire Torre. This book is that good. This book is also fun to read. You would't be able to enjoy this book if you do not know about baseball already, because it gets a little complex sometimes. So go out and get this book if you like baseball and want to learn more about how the game is played"},{"Title":"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans : Understanding and Interpreting the Game so You Can Watch It Like a Pro","review":"Let me begin by saying that I like so many baseball fans have two thoughts regarding McCarver. 1) I appreciate this former Major League catcher's immense understanding of the game and 2) I get tired during broadcasts of listening to his endless (and seemingly self-serving and self-inflating) ramblings about what is going on in the heads of players and coaches. That said, the only problem I really had when reading this book was getting McCarver's voice out of my head.Once I did that I found the material within its pages useful (even in coaching youth baseball) and interesting. It is not however, for the faint hearted or simply casual fan. I think to fully appreciate McCarver's insights, one has to have a little more that rudimentary knowledge of the game. Having been involved in baseball for youth through college I found an easy grasp of his theories and thoughts...I'm not sure the simple newcomer to the game will (but they may).All-in-all I found the book very enjoyable and it is actually one of the few books that I have actually read TWICE!"},{"Title":"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans : Understanding and Interpreting the Game so You Can Watch It Like a Pro","review":"I always thought I was a baseball &quot;FAN&quot; .[ I followed the Mets since I was a kid in little league.] After reading this book I can watch a baseball game on TV intelligently. McCarver has transformed me into a TRUE FAN. The book includes WHAT to look for when watching a game on TV and how the manager will/should react. I began to notice the pitch locations, catcher's role, the batting stances, lineups, pitch count and fielding positions. I sit back and try to guess what pitch will be thrown or how a manger will react in a given situation. Baseball is a game of strategy not just hit the ball and run. In the past I always loved going to the baseball park [Shea] and watching a game. I found watching a baseball game on TV to be very boring- NOT ANY MORE! I truly enjoy watching ANY baseball game on TV. In addition, I enjoyed the short vignettes located thoughout the book. They were informative and humorous."},{"Title":"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans : Understanding and Interpreting the Game so You Can Watch It Like a Pro","review":"Baseball for Brain Surgeons gave me a penetrating look behind the surface of baseball. This is a very challenging book, so challenging that those who don't love the game might find it intimidating or boring. If you're an intelligent baseball fan, however, McCarver will &quot;raise your game&quot; at least a notch, and probably more. He'll answer a number of possibly nagging questions along the way--Why didn't the runner tag in that situation?...What IS the difference between a two-seam and a four seam fastball? My own enjoyment of the game has increased tremendously because I invested some time in this book. I notice that some reviewers were put off by the level of analyis. Please don't blame the writer (so what if he is showing off). Baseball, as they say, is as boring as the person who is watching it. So is Baseball for Brain Surgeons."},{"Title":"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans : Understanding and Interpreting the Game so You Can Watch It Like a Pro","review":"Lots of baseball fans think they know everything there is to know about the game. Not me. While I've been a fan for 30 years, the game's intricate strategies and nuances sometimes go unnoticed until an astute announcer clues me in. McCarver does a great job of explaining everything there is to know about the strategies and the subtleties alike. However, if you are a casual fan, this book may drive you insane. Sometimes we don't need to know everything. The material here is nice to know, not need to know. Make sure you really want to know every aspect of the game before you pick up a copy."},{"Title":"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans : Understanding and Interpreting the Game so You Can Watch It Like a Pro","review":"I learned a lot from this book. McCarver is at his best when describing the little things that go into making strategic decisions, like when to steal, when to hit and run, when to try for an extra base and so on. His insights into baserunning are particularly good. I found some of his descriptions of different types of pitches to be perplexing - what does it mean that a certain pitch &quot;topples&quot; (a tree can topple, but how does a round object flying through the air do that?). Overall, this is a very good book, and even long-time fans can get a lot out of it."},{"Title":"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans : Understanding and Interpreting the Game so You Can Watch It Like a Pro","review":"&quot;Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans&quot; opened up my eyes to many sides of baseball I never even knew about. The strategy potentials of this game are mind boggling. It's amazing that games even get completed with the amount of thinking that has to go on. (And it's amazing that more managers don't get ulcers!)McCarver's book should be read and understood by every baseball player in every league on every level. I know I would if I was blessed with the talents to play professional ball.My only quibble is that he spends too much time talking about the different TV cameras and what they do during a broadcast. (That may be interesting to him, but it certainly doesn't affect the outcome of the game!) Other than that, this book reminds me of books about Quantum Physics. There is so much information there, it could take years to absorb and understand it all. But you're going to have fun doing it."},{"Title":"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans : Understanding and Interpreting the Game so You Can Watch It Like a Pro","review":"I'm a huge baseball fan and I've read my share of baseball books. However, I've never read one that was this insightful and informative.McCarver does an excellent job analyzing baseball strategy. I didn't agree with everything he said, but he made me think more about baseball strategy than I ever have.As an aspiring broadcaster, I also appreciated his discussion on broadcasting. I was at a Mets game recently and I found myself keying in on the cameras and guessing which camera was in use at a given moment.This book isn't for the newcomer trying to pick up the game. It is for the hardcore baseball fan, the fan that already thinks about the game on a higher level."},{"Title":"Tim McCarver's Baseball for Brain Surgeons and Other Fans : Understanding and Interpreting the Game so You Can Watch It Like a Pro","review":"I bought this book based on the other, glowing reviews posted here at amazon.com, and a quick look at the book in a real bookstore. McCarver's own comments on his book are your best guide to its charms and problems. He says that he started out to write a book about broadcasting baseball games on Fox, then got off into other elements of baseball strategy. That statement is correct: McCarver starts off on stuff that probably doesn't interest 90% of his readers (for example, where the cameras are located in most ballparks and what they're used for on Fox) and then discusses the defense from position to position, the types of pitches, base-runners and what they should do, etc., throwing in lots of stories about Carlton and Gibson along the way. The book moves through everything in an excess of detail, providing often insufficient information about some things (like exactly what a &quot;two-seam&quot; vs. a &quot;four-seam&quot; fastball looks and moves like) and restating other things too many times, like how competitive Bob Gibson was. The book ends abruptly, leaving the reader wondering if McCarver just got tired of writing and refused to &quot;wrap it up&quot; by writing a conclusion. Overall, the material herein is interesting but excessively complete, as it were. A good editor could have taken what is here, cut about 10%, reorganized the rest, and had a real gem. As it is, I'll call it an uncut diamond, and give it three stars, barely. A better choice for almost everyone would be Hernandez's _Pure Baseball,_ if you haven't read that yet."},{"Title":"The Little, Brown handbook","review":"For anyone writing papers this is a must have.

However, the current product's functionality and most of all its technical support service are sufficiently flawed to cause students to drop the course or to perform poorly, below their actual writing ability and motivation level.Pearson's registration process and its printed directions are complex, requiring needless information from students in order to register in the instructor's correct online course. In some cases, students were still waiting for help from Pearson tech support two weeks into the semester -- just to get registered at the site. Further, the registration process is complicated enough so that students who make an error are unable to back out to repair the error; they remain locked in a dead zone, registered at MCL but not in the instructor's course. I have not received confirmation that Pearson is revising this procedure in its December 2008 upgrade.I have had to call Pearson's tech support repeatedly, often several times a week. In almost every case, the technician is unable to answer my question and must \\"send it up to a specialist.\\" The technicians are always professional, but they do not have the answers I need to be able to continue with instruction in my course. Support for students is as bad or worse, they report.This past weekened, Pearson decided to do an upgrade -- in the middle of the academic semester. For my purposes, the key strength of MCL is its support of the instructor's revewing process of student writing. I am able to embed comments directly in student work and return that work for student revision. During the upgrade, Pearson changed the functionality of MCL's buttons, in effect hiding my comments from students. Of course the upgrade was done when there was no tech support available to anyone -- in spite of their 24/7 logo, so the course again ground to a halt. It turned out that in some cases the comments survived (if they could be found), and in other cases students needed to resubmit their papers, and I needed to recorrect them in order to trigger the \\"new and improved\\" model. Hours and hours of work were wasted.Because Pearson has decided to develop MCL unattached to its course-management sytem, CourseCompass, the course-management tools in MCL are extraordinarily weak. One example: If students do exercises to remediate errors in writing, the instructor must open every single exercise to find the student's score. Amazingly, Pearson has developed a roster that is not organized around the student name but rather the Pearson exercise. The function becomes useless to the instructor.Font size, wasted screen space, unnecessary scrolling and clicks: all contribute to an inelegant screen and a clumsy experience.I have worked with Pearson's CourseConmpass for years. I was involved in the Beta for MCL. I have taught blended and online courses for years using various platforms. I can adapt and can find end runs around dead ends. But this product, while good in concept -- is flawed. It was sent to market too soon, and tech support was never brought fully into the loop. If you adopt this product now, be prepared for great frustration. Be prepared too for emails and phone calls from your students. The complaint are endless.To Pearson's credit, they have provided me with the email addresses and phone numbers of some key MCL players. They are mostly good listeners and are certainly well intentioned. They tell me they are working day and night to improve their product. I tell that that my students and I are working day and night to be able to use their product. My students should be working hard at learning course material, not at figuring out dinged-up web sites. Not so good.Wait a year. Then try what might have become a wonderful product. There is great potential here."},{"Title":"The Little, Brown handbook","review":"The book is in an excellent condition.

I spent so many hours and hours pouring over this book that I'm reviewing right now, which is the Little Brown Handbook and I'm the better for it in that my grammar is so improved that even my teachers have told me that my grammar has improved. They say &quot;Hey. Your grammar improved&quot; and I say yes, I know it done has and I owe it all to the little brown handbook which I done brought and it was worth just about every penny and I mean that sincerely because it's a book that you will find the same way and you too will be able to write real good.

We barely used this book, and class is almost over.I don't understand why a book called brown is actually blue, but ok. I loved the price here at Amazon for this book, Amazon's NEW price was only $5 higher than buying it used at any of my local used book stores.The size (dimensions) of the book is convenient. Not too big to haul around all the time, but the print is small and I think with all the textbooks we have to put up with all the time, our eyes start bugging out. Do they really need to cram all the material in such a small space? I appreciate the lighter load, but upping the font one point can make a world of difference. All in all, the book is sturdy, and it's laid out fairly well, making it not too difficult to find what you are looking for, so that is a plus. The paper is slightly slick, without too much glare, for anyone who ever studies outside between classes, you will appreciate this.The kinds of questions the book has are really stupid, and with no way to evaluate your own work, you have no clue before you turn in your assignment if you are on the right track or not. I consider that a huge minus. Another huge negative if your teacher is like mine and gives all the assignments and doesn't grade them or even look at them until the end of the term.I do not think I am really qualified to evaluate the contents of the book, regarding grammar, english rules, etc, since that lack of knowledge is why I am taking the class in the first place, however, it seems to cover a huge range of rules that I never learned before and I will not be reselling it to the used book store.

Virtually every nuance of English grammar is discussed at length, including the subjunctive mood (yes, English has one), and the Passive voice (yes, the one your English teacher always asked you not to use!). The book has 883 pages. I will value this even more when I go to graduate school next year.Why is this book useful? Have you ever wanted to know how to correctly use question marks, commas, and quotation marks? Well, virtually every punctuation mark in existence is explained in the book. Typically rules of usage are given first, and then the explanation is followed by an example sentence. This format makes learning the concepts very easy.There are also extremely helpful chapters on the use reasoning skills, reading and thinking critically, revising, editing, finding sources, and many, many more helpful topics. The book has sections on MLA, APA, CBE, and Chicago Styles of citing works. So whether you need to write a paper for a Psychology class or an English class, you can find help here. There are also tips included on how to do work in various fields, such as the humanities and social sciences. Another informative section is Glossary of Usage chapter. Included here are commonly misused words, and an explanation of their correct usage (and examples of such usage). For instance, did you know that \\"lay\\" is transitive and \\"lie\\" intransitive? Or did you know that the past participle form of \\"lie\\" is \\"I have lain?\\"I could go on and on about what is included, but there is just so much, it would take more than a few pages! You will have to trust me that this book offers grammar tips, writing hints, citation methods, and other helpful tools.

It was in between using two Diana Hacker books Rules for Writers and the Bedford Handbook.For myself, this book is very comprehensive. If I could, I could have taught the entire course using this text, although our college requires an additional \\"reader.\\" There are enough sample essays and other pieces in here that the reader portion could be done with this book. Its approach is encyclopedic to grammar, punctuation, usage, and spelling problems.I also found its section on composition essentials very well done, particularly chapter 4 on paragraphs. I found their explanation of how to do MLA papers and research papers in general quite useful.Before we used this textbook, I would usually download supplementary information from net websites on paragraphing and MLA papers to fill in the gap between what students wanted to know and what the textbooks said on these and other subject. However, the Little,Brown Handbook was so full of information, that I did not have to do that during the years I used this book.This is a good book if one is embarking on a serious campaign as a writer. When I was more active as a writer, I found that other writers and copy editors on publications I worked on continually stocked up on such books. These are the best places to look for clarification on problems of grammar, mechanicws, and usage. Surprisingly, even for the experienced degreed writer, what such books say about improving rhetoric or diction is often useful, the basics we can forget easily.As such, even though our college has moved back to Hacker, I will keep it out as a reference for my own writing and editing.Yet, as a text book for an individual composition course, its sixty dollar price, makes the book an outrageous drag on already emptied student pockets. The scandal of the price of university texts needs to be exposed and investigated."},{"Title":"The Little, Brown handbook","review":"Although intended primarily for students, The Little Brown Handbook is an excellent reference for all nonfiction writers. While writing my own recent book on option pricing, I consulted it often regarding the use of colons, semicolons, dashes, and other fine points of punctuation. It even served as an arbiter of correct grammar and usage in the occasional dispute with my copy editor! Almost everything critical to good writing is covered--from organization, paragraph coherence, and sentence structure, to punctuation, word choice, and issues of style--and in sufficient detail to be useful to the working wordsmith. Guidelines for academic writers, a discussion of the American Psychological Association (APA) style employed in the social sciences, and suggestions for use of the internet in research, also appear in The Little Brown Handbook. All in all, this book should be found near the Strunk and White classic, The Elements of Style, on any writer's bookshelf. I would unhesitatingly recommend it to anyone who writes, either for pleasure or for a living.Jeffrey Owen Katz, Ph.D.Author (With Donna L.

I might suggest that method -- read some old Sam Spade shorts (contemporary with Stein's writing of this little gem), then read this book, then go back.Where Hammett and company's tales are sharp, grittily realistic, and driven by swarthy melodramatic plots, Stein's one mysterious foray into the Murder Mystery genre has little discernible plot, is distinctly un-swarthy, lacks melodrama, and for these reasons is perhaps far more realistic than Hammett et al. are held to be; _Blood_ clearly reflects the confusion we (I) feel in the face of traumatic events... the mind reels before the reality (which always lacks cliche and melodrama) of violence and leaves one (me) with nothing but an almost incoherent froth of language in one's (my) head, out of which occasionally bubble moments of &quot;clarity&quot;: bits of facts and/or memories of incidents and characters which may or may not be accurate. Sometimes, too, the froth dissolves into moments of almost ritual invocation: &quot;Lizzie do you understand do you understand lizzie&quot;: the mind reaching out to (hi)stries of past violence (the fall river axe murders, lizzie borden) to unsuccesfully but compulsively try to order and give meaning to the violence at hand.Dazzling. The full effect of this book (the composition of &quot;my take&quot; on it which appears above) came only after weeks of letting the book sit in the back of my mind, as I moved back to pulp detective stories and on to other things.It is classic Stein, a pure uncut jewelled antidote to the false-feeling closures of the usual mystery novel and the journalistic, faux-objective treatments of the violent throughout fiction, film, and (dare I mention) TV.

Shore is one of the first to jump in the post-EMU debate: now that Europe has almost completed Economic Union, what are the expectations, challenges, and impossibilities with regard to further integration? Shore offers a systematic discussion of the role of 'culture' in the European Union. How has a European identity been created, or not!, among both citizens and civil servants in Brussels? Shore turns out to be quite critical in the end. Europeanism is not strongly rooted among the peoples of Europe. And the elites in Brussels are far from what a perfect European bureaucrat must be like. He concludes that the goal of European federalism, which so strongly depends on some form of common European identity, may be one bridge too far. To conclude, Shore's informed and refreshing perspective on the actual challenges to European integration forms an important contribution to the debate.

This plan was to be the beginning of a federal structure of Europe.\\"Later, Chancellor Kohl said, \\"In Maastricht we laid the foundation stone for the completion of the European Union. The European Union Treaty introduces a new and decisive stage in the process of European Union which within a few years will lead to the creation of what the founding fathers of modern Europe dreamed after the last war: the United States of Europe.\\"In practice, the EU has already gone far towards creating a new state, although it has signally failed to create one that is honest and democratic. As Shore writes, \\"To most critical observers it seems quite evident that the European Community has acquired most of the characteristics of a state, however much some might wish to deny this.\\" And, \\"with its single currency, its Central Bank and treaty control over money supply and borrowing, the EU takes on the powers of a sovereign state, albeit a transnational state without a democratic government.\\" As Pascal Lamy, Delors' chef de cabinet, admitted, \\"The people weren't ready to agree to integration, so you had to get on without telling them too much about what was happening.\\"The Committee of Independent Experts reported in 1999 that fraud, cronyism, mismanagement and cover-ups were rife in the European Commission, summarising, \\"It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility.\\" Shore concludes that the Report \\"exposed ... the extraordinary degree to which patronage, fraud and corruption ... had become established, even institutionalised, within the Commission.\\""},{"Title":"Building Europe: The Cultural Politics of European Integration","review":"Chris Shore's &quot;Building Europe&quot; is an innovative study of the European Union, and should be taken seriously.

This is an actual story with a plot--not some mindless minimalist's idea of a self-expression. Regeane has a horrible secret that she must learn to live with; she lives in a society where marriage and alliance are one and the same. What will her new husband do when he finds out that Regeane is a shape-changer? Will she have to kill him to survive?

Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"Moved by a fascinating premise and characters that are not clearly evil or good, 'The Silver Wolf' is a fascinating book. Fast-paced, intriguing, thrilling and with a plot full of unpredictable twists and turns. Perhaps the only reason that I did not give this book five stars is that the central romance of the book is made possible by a quaint coincidence and all the built up tension dissipates usatisfyingly as a deus-ex-machina ending is offered to the romantic element of the story. But this is only on small facet of the novel and its fascinating historical background, adept usage of language and the dual-nature of its protagonist make it a book well worth reading. By far the best treatment of the were-wolf I have read ...AND BELIEVE ME I'VE READ A LOT."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"Regeane, distantly related to Charlemagne, is the central character in this book, which takes place in the early Middle Ages. The action lies in Rome, which is no longer the center of the Empire, but fast becoming a political hotbed: who will rule Rome: the princes or the Church? This question subtly circles around the real story: Regeane is a shape-shifter and becomes a wolf at night.The problem is, we never find out why or how. Regeane is not alone, her father was a shape-shifter as well, and so are her future husband and his people. The why and how are tantalizing questions. One of the characters, Madrona, tells us she's existed since the time before time was recorded. Another character tells us that he knew Julius Caesar. So, where did this fascinating existence start?The book reminded me a little of the Cheysuli series by Jennifer Roberson, where her characters changed into various types of animals and whose personalities were like their &quot;animal spirits.&quot; But Roberson tells us the how and why, tying it up nicely, although it took seven or eight volumes to do it. Certainly the theme that the natural creatures, or animals, really understand the things important to life is similar in both books. Unfortunately, Borchardt's characters don't seem to learn the lesson.There are some problems with chronology, too. A great deal happens over the course of a few days, and the plot development doesn't flow smoothly. Continuity is also a problem, but is probably more due to inattentive editing than the author's imaginative story-telling abilities.I liked the book and plan to give a copy to a friend as a birthday gift, and I'd read a sequel. But I'd also hope that some of the problems in The Silver Wolf are cured."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"The Silver Wolf was not as good as I thought it was going to be. The beginning seemed to be very dragged out, and because of this the end appeared to be somewhat rushed. None of Alice Borchardt's characters were very well developed at all, and the some of the grammar was very poor. I would not recommend this book;although it was interesting and had a great story line, it was poorly developed. However this is just my opinion."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I have to admit that I picked up this book because the author is the sister of one of my fave authors, Anne Rice. And, although their stories can feel similar at times (both work with historical ficiton mixed in with dark fantasy and/or horror), it often feels like Borchardt tries too hard to imitate her sister's unique, poetic style of writing.The Silver Wolf is a very frustrating read. Every time I felt the book was getting somewhere, every time the story started getting interesting, then the rug would be pulled from under my feet as the story would stall into place for twenty or thirty pages. The book is more than 450 pages long, but this story could have easily been told in less than 300 pages.Regeane is a woman/wolf who is promised for marriage to a warrior she does not know. She has a fear of men and her marriage, she is told, is the one thing which has the potential power of saving a crumbling Rome. Sure, that sounds like great stuff, but when Borchardt goes into historical detailing, she fails to remember that she is writing a story here. Too often, she forgets about the plot to tell us unnecessary stuff about Rome, stuff that she could have hinted at instead of blantantly displaying in her prose (on the other hand, Anne Rice is able to tell us a lot about a historical time through her prose and characters instead of through long, harduous and unnecessary paragraphs).Overall, I cannot recommend Silver Wolf. I found the book hihghly disappointing and not very interesting. Too bad, because I had a lot of hopes for this book. This just wasn't my cup of tea!"},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"This was the first book of Alice Borchardt that I read, and I had such a good time reading it I went and brought her other books after I finished The Silver Wolf.I recommened this book to people who enjoyed fanatacy, and had a open mind about looking at things on a different angle. However I didn't recommen this book to people who had set their minds on reading a werewolf book or a very romantic story; as this story was less focus on the supernature strenth of the werewolf and love, but more about how Regeane's struggle finding her freedom and happiness when the world was against her. I loved that Brochardt had made each character strong yet very human, she didn't make them simply black or white, or flawless. While Lucila being tough, smart and loyal, she was also devious and cruel. And while Regeane being beautiful and supernatual, she was still torment by her memories of her mother, and unsure about herself.The story was fast paced and had the power of not letting you put it down. Being Anne's sister doesn't mean Alice should write the same way. I didn't read Anne Rice's books until after reading The Silver Wolf, and had still loved Brochardt's other book- The Night of the Wolf. I reckon if you have a open mind about the book before you read it, you will have a good time."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I read this book beside only the moonlight and some candles to light my way. (I kid you not, for all ambient purposes; some books should be read that way.)This is a fine example of storytelling at its most fantastic. Regeane, like some of us, is a fluke of nature, a singular being. Day by day in the world, set here in the last years of the Roman Empire, she is a blossoming, intelligent young woman. Yet whenever the moon shines in the night sky, she transforms into her other self, her alter ego: the wolf that bursts forth from the recesses of her soul.Regeane lives with her sinister uncle, Gundabald, who despises her as much as he fears her. He imprisons her as he schemes to marry her off to and later murder a wealthy barbarian lord whom she has never met. She occasionally manages escape - a savoring of days spent meeting interesting people caught up in the backdrop of political intrigue in Rome, and of nights basking beneath the allure of the moon, her ageless spirit haunted by the sense of a mysterious wolf whose soul seems preternaturally kindred with her own.True, Alice Borchardt is the sister of Anne Rice. And though they each possess a magic manner of weaving a tale, their styles are distinctly different. I am attuned to the charms of both. This is a wonderful story to read upon an evening by fire or candlelight, or any which way your heart desires ~"},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I remember picking The Silver Wolf up in the bookstore and reading it in one evening. I have a passion for historical fiction, but of all of the author's I have read none have created a time, a world like this. I am still lost in it. Alice Borchardt's impeccable details and settings are alive to me. I can walk through the villas and streets of the decaying but vibrant Rome in my mind. One can almost imagine that the wolves live on and might be the striking person you pass on the street. Her characters are unforgettable. But truly it is the supporting characters who make these books. Of the three Wolf books, The Silver Wolf and Night of the Wolf are perfect, but The Wolf King still rates numerous stars. Regeane as the heroine is more present to me in the Silver Wolf than the Wolf King. I highly recommend reading this trio and then finding her Devoted and Beguiled pair (out of print), another fascinating, slightly dark, enlightening historically rich world. I am very sorry that we have lost Alice Borchardt and her vision."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I have read this book before and loved it to no end. This time when I read it I was a little bored with all the setting throughout. My taste in books has changed over the years I guess. I still love the storyline and the romance, but there was just too much setting and description for my taste. Less description more action that's what I like, but it is still a very good book. I recommend it to anyone who likes paranormal romances with a historical touch. Also if you are a person who likes a lot of description in your books give it a read. :)"},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I read this book first a long time ago when I was a teenager. I gobbled it up, every word of it from start to finish. I'd never really read any thing with this sort of theme but it hooked me the moment I made it half way through the first chapter. It has Action, romance, intrigue, and an element of historical fitction that was addicting. I read all three books in this series and would read it again."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I just finished this book and I thought it was good for the most part and I couldn't wait for Regeane to find out about Maeniel. But I had two problems with it. First, I there was simply too much detailed description of blood and gore for my personal taste. Second,every twenty or so pages I would run into words I had never seen before. I am a teacher and a hopeful writer. I pride myself on a large vocabulary. But in this case I felt like Ms. Borchardt must have had a very large thesauras at hand and every so often decided to use the most obscure words she could find. That may be OK for many, but when I sit down to read a novel, I want to get lost in the story and not be distracted by meeting totally new words. It didn't do much for my ego either. I do own &quot;Night of the Wolf&quot; and will read it at some point and I will probably read the Guinevere series sometime. But to anyone contemplating reading this book, I suggest that you have a good dictionary nearby."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"Of the three werewolf novels Alice Borchardt has written so far, &quot;The Silver Wolf&quot; was the best. It was paced well, it was descriptive, and it was intriguing. But the first couple of pages were hard to get into. After getting past them, you pretty much get hooked on the book. The historical slash political part of the book was a little too involved, but the more personal part was definitely sufficient."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"Alice Borchardt has a great imagination and uses it to create an excellent unique storyline. This novel takes place in ancient Rome and Borchardt does a superb job in creating an ancient setting. This book also had great action! Great read!"},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"&quot;The Silver Wolf&quot; is the first novel that I had read of Alice Borchardt's, and I am wonderfully amused that I picked it up. I thought 'well, let's see how the infamous Anne Rice's sister holds up...'At any rate, this story is beautifully written with descriptions so thorough that you can close your eyes and perhaps see yourself in Rome. Regeane, a daughter of royalty having to deal with poverty and family who are so dispicable they beat her and treat her cruely besides. In the mind of Gundubald, Regeane's uncle, and his son Hugo... the treatment of Regeane is justified... for they know a secret of hers.By night Regeane becomes the silver wolf, straining to be free, longing for the freedom of long ago. Throught this novel, the reader is taken through Rome, in its sewers, on the Compagna, etc. all with intensity. Throughout, Regeane learns of family secrets, marriage, and begins to learn the game of politics/religion.Thuroughly enjoyable, can't wait to begin &quot;Night of the Wolf&quot;..."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I've never read anything by Anne Rice and so the hype about Alice Borchardt being Rice's sister was lost on me. An avid fantasy reader all my life, I read this book less as a &quot;werewolf&quot; book and more as a fantasy novel. I thought the characters were very well-developed, though Regeane's uncle Gundabald having such high connections to the nobility of Rome was kind of unbeliveable for me, especially as unappealing and poor as the author made him. I thought the best character in the book was Lucilla's son Antonius and indeed I'd have liked the book to have focused on him more. One of the things that bothered me was that Ms. Borchardt introduced Regeane to us saying that she was about to marry Maenial, then turned the subplot to Antonius and left Maenial except for a few scenes, then married Regeane to him in the end. If she had focused more on Maenial rather than Antonius or left out the husband-to-be all together and let Regeane marry Antonius, I thought it would have made a lot more sense. But overall I thought the plot was excellent, the characters well developed, and the action was good."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"Having read the books by Sysan Kriniard, I thought that I would get a story line in a similar vein. The main character of this story was very unsure of herself and at constant war with her other self. In addition to that was the overwhelming violence of the uncle and nephew, especially as it related to women. This did not endear me to the author at all. When you add these items to the story taking place in ancient Roman times, this did not make it a great read for me."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"DREADFUL, DREADFUL, DREADFUL. I have never seen such a badly-written load of pap in my entire life. This reads like the worst of amateur fiction. The author has no regard or talent for the art of writing whatsoever. If I had not been on holiday in a non-English-speaking country, and unable to find a single other book at all, I would not even have bothered to finish. I do not recommend this &quot;story&quot; to anyone with any regard at all for quality literature. Anne Rice's gushing comments on the cover can be, I think, disregarded."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"The Silver Wolf cleverly intertwines an excellent view of a little known historical period with a romantic fantastic magical character. The heroine is appealing and sympathetic and the setting, Rome in the 8th century, is unusual and reasonably accurate. The book is well written and compelling reading."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"Although I must admit the book started out a little slow, the premise itself was quite intriguing, and that kept me reading. Thank goodness--because the book turned about a lot more interesting and elaborate than I had expected. I love Alice Borchardt's descriptions and the low-key but hilarious humor. I liked how the book kept you guessing (I thought Maeniel was a total wimp at first, but he turned out to be quite the catch,'eh? ;-) and wondering what would happen next. The characters were well-portrayed and had such a real vibrance about them; stereotypes were not played upon. I look forward to reading Ms. Borchardt's next book. One last thing--what's with that Kirkus Review about the book? It says &quot;Lucilla, who has eyes for the virgin, also has some secrets of her own: She, too, is a werewolf--and the mother of Maeniel.&quot; I had three words for that--&quot;WHAT THE HECK?!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I found this book to be fresh and new. I have never met a character such as Regeane and almost instantly fell in love with her. My heart went out to her for her troubles and constant concerns over her impending marriage.The setting detail was wonderful without being too long-winded and wordy, and the time period Ms. Borchardt used was vastly different from the norm, which is always good. The characters were enchanting. I, too, believed the ending was a bit too abrupt and was terribly disappointed when it was over.I have already recommended it to a friend who found the ideas, characters, and plot of the story absolutely intriguing when I told her about it. She is currently reading it. And I would recommend it to many more of my friends.I hope to see more in the future about Regeane and Maeniel, and their friends. I look forward to reading more of Ms. Borchardt's work."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I very much enjoyed the book. It was somewhat slow at times but the last two-thirds of the book held my attention quite well. Ms. Borchardt picked a very interesting and not well know part of history that made you look at things from a different perspective. I definitely enjoyed the shape-shifting angle. The main charater, Regeane, was a true heroine willing to give up her freedom to help her closest friends. A very admiral trait. The ending could have been a bit more detailed like the rest of the book. I hope to read more of Ms. Borchardt's novels in the future."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"This book drew me in quickly with it's Roman setting, werewolf protagonist, and political intrigue. The romance fell flat, however. Some of the characters were more developed than others (I particularly liked the Madame Lucilla). After reading it, I still don't understand the relationship between the leper Antonius and Pope Hadrian. Not to mention the fact that the ending was rushed. With that in mind, I'd still recommend it."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"As anyone that's searched for good werewolf novel knows, they are not easy to come by. This book has all the elements I was looking for in a werewolf story. The conflict of having to decide whether to live in the confinement of human society or free as a wolf is well-defined. Alice Borchardt has a decent start at doing for the werewolf, what her sister, Anne Rice, did for the vampire."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"This book really got my attention from the back. Historical fiction in ancient Rome, werewolf, sounds great. I only made it to page 90 before I gave up.I felt like I just read something conjured up by a 13 yr old boy hitting puberty. This tale has all of the elements of a Beavis and Butthead adventure.VD ? Got that. Whores, drunks, pointless violence? Got that. Hetero, gay, pedophile, lesbian sex? Got that. In fact, most supporting characters seem to have the sole purpose of being there for unpleasant sexual foils, jokes, or violence. I really don't mind these things in a story, but where the hell is the plot?Then there were all of the puke, piss, and crap jokes. Or the innocent kid who is talking about sexual topics, but doesn't realize it. What is this, a South Park ren festival or something ?Ok, I actually like the main character, because she seems aloof from all of these things. Until around page 90. That's when I gave up. She was my only bulwark against the uselessness of the supporting characters, and as soon as she began acting like one of them, I just gave up on this book.When I'm reading a historical fantasy, it really kills the story for me when the characters are using all of these modern day language choices and idioms. What a great setting, to have it squandered in such a manner.It seemed as if I waded through page after page of this non-important garbage to get just a nugget or two of interesting story.It's really sad, because the concept that I read on the back of the book sounds awesome :(Granted, I thought I was getting a fantasy story, so maybe this book was in the wrong section."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"This could have been a great book. Alas, it was not. The overuse of flowery prose killed the story and the superfluous adjectives caused me to laugh out loud when I am sure I wasn't supposed to. Ms. Borchardt tried so hard to be poetic and lyrical in the telling, and it is glaringly obvious that she is copying her sister's style. The result is pitiful. The gratuitous, graphic rape and molestation of a young boy early on in the novel should have been grounds for a toss in the trash, but I kept reading, glutton for punishment that I am. I also found the seduction of Regeane by her female mentor to be gratuitous. Overall, this book is insulting and an affront to werewolves everywhere, who should band together and prevent Ms. Borchardt from ever picking up a pen again. Somehow she has been published again and again, though. This is one of the worst books I've ever read, undeserving of all the 5 star reviews and copious praise it has received."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I loved this story. The whole trilogy was fabulous. The way the author wove in the colorful, grandeur, and beautifully detailed history of Rome in the dark ages with the ancient folklore of shapeshifters was enchanting and mesmerizing. A complete story filled with full action, drama, suspense,(warning***some sexual content and obscene language), and of course a beautiful love story. Alice Borchardt's writing is captivating and prose-like at times, and yet, at others very true to the times and crass when appropriate. I felt like I was there witnessing the events in person. Borchardt took me to another people, place and time and I love it when a book can accomplish that. A very great read!"},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I was Sooo disappointed with this book. It got rave reviews. One reviewer was Johanna Lindsey - so I was led to expect something from that genre. Another reviewer was Anne Rice - who made it sound like it was something she would have written.First of all, I would NOT call this a paranormal romance, of the sort written by Kresley Cole, or Sherrilyn Kenyon, Susan Krinard, or J.R. Ward.What this IS is a literary-esq, fantasy about werewolves at the time of the fall of the Roman Empire. It is a fascinating period in Human history. Brabarism meets Civilization. Witchcraft meets Christianity. The main characters are werewolves who unite their tribes to support Charlemagne as he consolidates his hold on the territory that would become France.The closest thing I can compare it to is the great classic, Ivanhoe. Complete with the opening with the clown characters who you wonder how they relate to the story at all. Unlike Ivanhoe, however, which is a GREAT romance as well as GREAT adventure, as well as literary in the sense of a GREAT vehicle to show you the times, the cultural clashes at the center of political conflict of the times, with GREAT sympathetic characters that are the stuff of legend, Silver Wolf is not a great romance, neither is it a great adventure - just luke warm. It does a fairly good job of conveying a sense of the times, and for that it is worth reading, because the lyrical way the times are handled is very good. However I did not find the characters to be sympathetic - unlike with Ivanhoe, where you have Rebecca (one of my favorite heroines of all time), Rowena, Sir Wilfred, Cedric, and of course, the great Locksely, and the Black Knight! In fact I was quite disappointed in Regeane. The first time she opens her mouth to actually talk as opposed to having inner dialog, she snaps 'shut up' to someone. And it just got worse from there.That doesn't mean it is all bad. This story is one that unfolds over 3-4 books, and there is a large cast of characters. So the author has to spend a lot of time developing these secondary characters, and the plot suffers (as well as the characterization, in my view).If you make an adjustment to your expectations, then you might be able to enjoy this work for what it does have to offer. Just don't be fooled by what the reviews on the cover have to say. Pay attention to readers in these pages who say that the opening is slow, the romance between Regeane and Maeniel isn't handled very well, but it does present an interesting picure of 8th century society."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I had a difficult time getting &quot;into&quot; this story by Borchardt. I must admit, I bought it because it was recommended by Anne Rice, not knowing Rice was Borchardt's sister. Silly me. But, as I muddled through the first chapters, overlooked some problems in writing style and story line, I actually started to care about the characters and grew intrigued about the storyline. Borchardt tells a beautifully descriptive tale and it did get better as pages turned. I recommend this first segment in the series if only as an introduction to the second book, which is really much better. Probably 3 1/2 stars would be more accurate but this book is definitely better than 3 stars so I gave it 4."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"Im almost sorry to give this book a rating of three. It is dazzling and unique and very creative. I am glad i read it. The only fault i have with it is the plot. It really runs an irregular length with no real ending. The ending is an illusion, like borchard had to meet a deadline. She made up for the missing plot with fillings of detail and fasinations of all kinds. There also will be other books im sure to make up for what this one was missing. It is still an interesting read and Im glad to have had the expirience. This book is not for shallow people and in parts can be distastful to a more sheltered reader. Keep in mind that not all books paint pretty pictures, and if that is all you are looking for in life you will be very disapointed."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"In my search for interesting werewolf books, I came across The Silver Wolf. I tried very hard to continue reading this book, but it became arduous and seemed more like a task than something that I was doing for enjoyment. The lead character of Regeane was so boring and weak in human form that it became impossible to believe that she was a werewolf. I'm sure it was written that way on purpose. This is the first werewolf book I read that NEVER described the form change. It was written as if it just happened, like changing clothes. I had to throw it away about half way through to move onto something else that didn't put me to sleep."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"not my usual cup of tea but I really enjoyed this book. I too wish there were more about Maniel and Regeanne . The characters were wonderful and unlike one of the reviews,I am glad there was less of Silve.Recommended this book to anyone who wants to take a chance and read something very different"},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"This is a truly excellant book."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"Anyone with even a shred of romanticism and true loyalty to Anne Rice's magical literary style simply MUST share in her very talented sister's work. Alice Borchardt has made a solid name for her own with this outstanding trilogy of shapeshifters. This first of the three opens our hearts to Regeane and introduces Maeniel...this duo can be embraced by loyal Rice literary hearts just as much as Lestat and Louis. Different yet just as captivatingly enigmatic with the same supernatural magic that transcends reality but yet explores it at the same time, questioning humanity and opening our minds to the most basic realms that surround us. Alice Borchardt, you have certainly earned a special spot on my most treasured novels shelves!"},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"All I can say about this book was that it was stunning and a 'must' read. I couldn't put it down as the story line is so rich and unpredictable. I absolutely loved it!"},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"Great book. had latin terms in it, great setting. I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"Borchardt has clearly written a book intended for a female audience. Her novel left me constantly hungering for more. The female protagonist, with her duel psyches of the wolf and the human, is a power figure both figuratively and literally, as she transforms into a creature of the wild. Borchardt's exploration of the sensuality of the protagonist, as both wolf and woman, is delicious.Yet there is description merely for description's sake. It is as if Borchardt is showing off her knowledge of the period. The heroine's antagonists are typecast as cunning, and possessing a power over the heroine far exceeding what they really have. This left me wondering whether it was their immoral power, or the heroine's own stupid, that causes her to wind up every night in chains.A comparable text set in the Middle Ages is Lady Hawk. While Silver Wolf is a lot more romantic and sentimental, Lady Hawk possesses strong central characters that we like and laugh with, and secondary characters created for our benefit not just for the central character's development."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"So she's Ann Rice's sisters, but that doesn't mean she's a good writter as well. I have been looking for a good werewolf book, and I am still looking. The book doesn't even get interesting until the end, where she finally runs into other werewolves. This is where the book actually gets started and the events described on the back cover begin. The whole begging and middle of the book is just of bunch of jibberish. Many details described in the book don't make sense, have nothing to do with the story, and just rambel on forever. And as for romance? Ha! There was none. The aurther needed to write more about the werewolves, and less about leepers, Lucia, and cruel relatives. And as for the story taking place in Rome, that was another unimportant detail. This story could of took place anywhere. DO NOT waste your time reading this horrible and predictable book."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"After reading an Anne Rice novel I discovered a recommendation of this book. I was glad I decided to read it and found it quite fascinating. It usually takes me a while to finish a book if it doesn't hold my attention and to my surprise I read it in only a few days. The writer just takes you back in history and captures you with the story and you can just picture all the characters in your imagination. I actually did not want the story to end that's how much I was enjoying it. I highly recommend it and I will be reading her other books."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"Anne Rice's sister has created her own unforgettable characters in the savvy werewoman Regeane and company. Set in post-Empire Rome, this first novel not only beguiles with infinite intrigues and marvelous characters such as Lucilla, courtesan to Pope Hadrian, and Antonius, the Pope's leper brother, but also is lavish in its rich depictions of this all-too-little known era. Borchardt, like her sister, wordpaints in broad strokes across a silken canvas with vivid and seductive colors. The amalgam which is Regeane, woman and werewolf, is handled deftly and what, in a lesser writer's pen, could be distractingly confusing, is lush and richly readable prose. Thank goodness this is just the first book!"},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I would like to strongly recommend 'The Silver Wolf.' I read this book about 4-5 months ago; I have not been able to stop thinking about it since then. Only when I bought the book for myself was my longing appeased. Besides the dealing with the supernatural, the scheming and plotting around the fall of the Roman Empire, the encounters with the dead, and the fight against evil, this novel is also a great romance. I am eagerly awaiting the third book of the series! More, please!"},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I absolutely loved Silver Wolf. It is the first book I've read by Alice Borchardt. It was captivating. I was held spellbound by the story of Regeane from beginning to end. I literally couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I really LOVED this book! It's worth buying it in hardback if you can. I guess it really depends on the kind of person you are when it comes to deciding whether you like it or not. Alice Borchardt combines some of my favorite subjects: the ancient world and fantasy. Not only that, but the characters are great and they really got to me from the start (except for ths villains, of course). At least some people should think about all that action in it -- there was not one boring moment in it for me, and close to the end, your heart starts pounding like crazy. I found myself shrieking at any people who interrupted me during the time I was reading this book. I liked it so much that I read it again. I read pretty fast, and I skip parts all the time. : ) I hope Ms. Borchardt plans to write another book (possibly a sequel or prequel that can happen in another time period?) because if she did, I wouldn't hesitate to by it in hardback...again."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"\\"Captain Exposition!!!\\" works overtime in this historical romance/fantasy from Anne Rice's older sister, with characters endlessly rattling on about the back story and history of the characters. Honestly, I've never seen back story so ineptly handled. That Borchardt's editor let it slip past only shows how helpful it is to have a powerful relative in the publishing world.But once the establishing chapters end, the books winds up as a pretty fair piece of historical fantasy. The premise drew my attention to it in the first place: a female werewolf in eighth century Rome caught in the political struggle between the Pope, Charlemagne, and the Lombards. Borchardt writes the werewolf action and expeditions into the spirit world with flair, but often dwells on historical digressions for too long, losing the plot momentum. The story moves in fitful spurts of action and historical scene setting, and would have been a far better work at half the length."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"This is a wonderful novel, full of vivid characters and a well researched historical era. Although this is, in all respects, a werewolf novel, anyone who is expecting all-out horror as found in traditional werewolf stories, will not find this here. This is more of a historical novel, with some supernatural fantasy added. It is about a young girl who is a &quot;shapeshifter&quot;, who by night is able to turn herself into a wolf. She is not, by nature, a killer, and uses her 'talent' to escape from the cruelty of her evil uncle and cousin. This is a novel with heart. The characters are well developed, and the story is engrossing. I am just starting the 2nd novel in this series, which goes back 800 years into the life of Maeniel, so does not pick up where this one leaves off. But I am sure it will be just as good. This is a book that should appeal to fans of historical fiction as well as fantasy/horror."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I bought this book with very high hopes, since the author is not afraid to tout the benefits of being sister to Anne Rice, one of my favorite writers. I have not read Alice Borchardt's other books, and have to say that after reading The Silver Wolf, would hesitate to do so.Although the book is set in ancient Rome, I found myself unable to get lost in the time period as I do with Anne Rice, as many of the thoughts and ideals, as well as dialogue, seemed far too contemporary to appear realistic. The vague connection to Charlemagne seemed more like name-dropping than a point of interest, and the villains of the story seemed more like characatures than characters.The story is interesting, about a female werewolf, a shape-shifter, and the struggle she faces with her human and wolf co-existence. However, it would probably have fared better set in modern times, as the detail of ancient Rome seemed half-realized at best.Since reading this book, there has been a sequel released, Night of the Wolf, centering on the love interest of Regeane, the main character of Silver Wolf, that apparently goes farther back in the history of Rome for its story. I sincerely hope Ms. Borchardt was better able to capture this lush and picturesque historical period with her second foray into it.For anyone more interested in a good wolf story than in authenticity of time period, this would make a good read. But for myself, a true lover of world history and ancient civilizations, this left me a bit flat."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I recently came across the third book in this series and decided to start with this one, the first. It's a great read for those who enjoy history, romance, and intrigue. I especially enjoyed the strong female characters and the supernatural twists. The herione of the novel becomes more and more interesting with each turn of the page. And, the ultimate hero has some surprises of his own! I can hardly wait to start the second book and pick up where I left off."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"It actually wasn't until I finished \\"The Silver Wolf\\" that I learnt author Alice Borchardt was the sister of vampire novelist Anne Rice (that explains why her endorsement is on the title page) but I doubt that this knowledge would have affected my reading experience. In hindsight, Borchardt follows her sister's footsteps by writing about a supernatural creature in an historical context, but that's where the similarities end.Set in the Roman Empire during its waning years, \\"The Silver Wolf\\" is the story of Regeane, a young woman with a dark secret. In the dubious care of her uncle and cousin, Regeane struggles to keep her inner-wolf hidden from the rest of the world, knowing that it would mean death if she was ever discovered. Her remaining family has their own plans for her - as the last remaining daughter of an influential family, they have organized her marriage to a barbarian lord that holds a strategically placed stronghold in the mountains. Regeane views this match with trepidation: on the one hand, it means some measure of freedom from her repulsive uncle, on the other it poses a whole new set of problems for maintaining her secret.The plot itself is rather hard to describe, mainly because it is so meandering in nature. I wouldn't go so far to call it \\"slow\\", but it's rather difficult to keep track of what's going on at any particular point - Regeane herself just seems to drift from one situation to the next with very little agency of her own. More than anything, Borchardt seems to struggle with the political wrangling that makes up the backbone of the book and which is the impetus for nearly every single character in the story. Charlemagne, the Pope and Lombards are mentioned, but are never given any real context, leaving me struggling to work out what any of it meant and how it affected the actions of the main characters. Basically, the political context is there throughout the narrative, but remains entirely vague.Instead, the book's distinctive attribute is its prose, which is quite poetic and descriptive, but which also has the tendency to keep the reader at arm's length from the characters and their situations. Regeane's transformations into a wolf for example, are so lyrically described that a lot of the time I wasn't sure whether an actual transformation was taking place, or whether it was all just some sort of metaphor. Likewise, though the story is by no means incoherent, it glides along at a leisurely pace and often veers off into tangents. Though this is not necessarily a bad thing, and a lot of the time I found that the secondary characters became more interesting than the leads. In particular, Regeane's brief stint in a convent was a highlight, in which we are introduced to a nun nursing a broken heart and a thwarted lover still sending her roses years after she enters seclusion. It does nothing whatsoever to advance the plot, but their little story was my favourite part of the novel.Throughout the course of the novel there are run-ins with violent Lombards, with an aging courtesan, with a community of lepers, with other werewolves, with ghosts and with nuns, and finally with Regeane's intended husband. Though we get glimpses of Maeniel before Regeane meets him, it is not until the end of the story that they come face-to-face. Borchardt certainly whets one's appetite for their meeting, but when it finally does happen it feels a little shortchanged, not helped by the fact that at this point the story begins to bear a very close resemblance the climax ofIvanhoe. It would have been nice to have seen more between these two before the close of the book, but Brochardt certainly ends with enough incentive for the reader to seek out the following novels.For the most part, I enjoyed \\"The Silver Wolf\\" though I can't say that I ever felt fully invested. As said, the prose is lovely and there are several really interesting scenes and ideas, but I remained unsure of what exactly was at stake or what Regeane was trying to achieve at any given time. It's a meandering, \\"floaty\\" sort of book that doesn't offer much in the way of explanations, but which somehow balances plenty of intrigue with smooth pacing."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I read this book before I realized that Alice was Anne Rice's sister. Therefore, I developed a much less biased opinion than I might have. I think The Silver Wolf's style shares a lot in common with Rice's vampire novels, but this only became obvious to me after I made the connection. However, there's enough difference between these two authors that I think the constant comparisons going on are really unfair to them both. The Silver Wolf explores the werewolf legend from a fresh angle. There is no hint of any compulsive murdering on the part of the werewolves, or bloodlust for human flesh. Indeed, they are portrayed as more human and humane than anyone else in the plot. The imagery is rich and takes on the quality of a dream from time to time. The romantic subplot between Regeanne and Maniel (werewolf main characters)is convincing but I felt that it came too late and was hastily explored.Overall, this was one of my favorite werewolf novels. The criticisms I've heard about it, such as the plot dragging in the first half and being a bit fragmented, are true enough in my opinion, which is why I rated only four stars.PS-the official book review states that Lucilla was Maniel's mother--I don't know where that came from, unless that particular reviewer was just confused by the fragmented storyline and numerous flashback scenes."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"Regeane is a beautiful young woman with werewolf blood. Because of this, her nasty uncle has kept her captive and beaten and starved her. When she discovers that he plans to sell her to a wealthy barbarian she risks her life and escapes. The remainder of the book concentrates on Regeane's self-discovery and the other, often odd, sometimes depraved people she encounters. She's known she can shapeshift but she also learns that she has visions and can speak to the dead. Eventually she becomes embroiled in a dangerous political situation and meets her soul mate and all ends pretty happily ever after.This book, set in Rome during the Dark Ages, is rough, meaty and often very dark. It's not a book for everyone because the author gets really graphic and vividly describes numerous vile acts including torture and assorted bodily functions. The book also goes off into tangents when the numerous secondary characters take center stage but their stories were interesting even though they rarely advanced the plot. My mind only started to wander during the times when the book got into heavy political details - which aren't my thing.If you can get past all that, and don't mind a highly descriptive book you'll find a very interesting story that is often (at the most unexpected times) very hilarious in a morbid kind of way. I found this story, for the most part, very difficult to put down and am looking forward to the sequel which I hope ties up some loose ends."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"Wolfs normally aren't my thing, and I surprised myself by picking up this book, mostly because she's Anne's sister and I wanted to know if she was as good or bad. Not surprisingly I was cringing through Regeane's first change, thinking &quot;Oh my, how am I ever going to make it through this thing?&quot;Like her sister, Borchardt has a love for bringing to life the surroundings in her novel, getting sometimes carried away and filling the page with very descriptive detail. So much that at points I found myself banging my head against the wall, screaming, &quot;I don't care about how the darn wine sauce tastes or how this stupid ruin is lying in ruins, I want some story development between Regeane and Maeniel!Right from the beginning the story was set-up that Regeane was to be married to Maeniel. So right from the start you are already waiting for this to happen and the two of them to finally meet. But instead you are left with 300+ pages to read through instead, all building up to the marriage. I can't say most of it wasn't enjoyable, but you are so set-up for them finally getting together that the rest becomes annoying.In my opinion Borchardt should have based her story around Regeane living in the pass with Maeniel, partly not knowing of the families secret. In other words, taken 200 pages out of the beginning and added 200 to the end. I was left unsatisfied with all this build-up of 400+ pages and only 5 to resolve it. I also got the feeling that Borchardt was avoiding story development between the two, as if she didn't know what to do with them once she got them together.But in the end though the good outweighs the bad, and Borchardt certainly has talent. Some scenes were simply perfect, and some left me rolling on the floor laughing, such as the wedding feast. Bravo. Now if she could roll that talent into something more satisfying, Rice would have something to look out for."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"Awhile ago I read The Silver Wolf by Alice Borchardt. Sister to Anne Rice. Of all the many \\"truths\\" I felt in this incredible book... I wanted to share this one. As it is not within a woman's faceted heart to deny continued creation... we may one day lose our mothers instinct and with it, our compassion.\\"And never learn to glory in death as some men do. Women have the power of life and death. We, after all, give birth and the fate of humanity is in our hands. That's why men try so hard to rule us, my dear. They know if we once looked well on what they have made of human existence, we might close our legs and within our barren wombs bring the comedy to an end.\\"Quote from an incredible character/lady, Lucilla... may all women have the strength to love with the ferocity, the single mindedness that woman was capable of. She knew that in the world of man, a woman had to harden with courage and learn to embrace the viciousness that is in a woman's soul. For if ever the nature of man were cruel... a woman can be more so but with the sweetest smile and the most loving touch concealing the dagger in her hand.That was not an explanation on the book... btw. It was but a moment I took from it. The story is magic. It's human nature and mans conspiracy in politics during \\"the\\" post roman era. It's an extraordinary girl, Regeane... trapped in the world of mans goals... maturing to womanhood and acceptance of who she is.. hmm.. more importantly... what she is. I thoroughly enjoyed this book... and the above referenced moment was, to me, a thought worth sharing."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I am an avid fan of the supernatural/horror genre of books and have read countless numbers of them, including those pertaining to werewolves. Although I think Borchardt's premise is fabulous (a young girl shapeshifter at the center of a web of intrigue in Rome of the Dark Ages)--indeed, it is what made me buy the book in the first place--I found that the book did not deliver. The romance that the description on the back hints at never fully materializes and the characters' dialogue and values seem as if they belong in the 1950s.A more serious concern is the portrayal of the &quot;good guys&quot; and &quot;bad guys&quot; in a starkly black and white manner. The creation of morally ambiguous characters is the lifeblood of this genre, and Borchardt's novel seems sadly lacking in this respect.I picked up this book with great enthusiasm, especially since I knew the author was the sister of Anne Rice. I finally gave up on it on page 278, which is over halfway. My disappointment in the book has prompted this review. If you are expecting complex characters, snappy dialogue, an engaging romance and an unpredictable plot, I would advise you to stick with Rice or Laurell K. Hamilton, or other similar authors."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"This book seems like it would be a great read. It's got all the elements for great fiction, a shapchanging heroine, an intriguing historical context, and a handsome enthralling hero. It all sounds great in theory, but the reality is considerably disappointing.The beginning of the book consists of detailed and unnecessarily graphic descriptions of the depraved actions of Regeane's Uncle and cousin. Perpetual, slovenly, drunkenness, promiscuous, vermin ridden sex, and gluttonous eating. It wouldn&#65533;t be such a big deal if there was anything more to this book, but there isn&#65533;t. After Regeane escapes the foul clutches of her relatives she spends her time in the amorous grip of Lucilla, an aging Roman courtesan. Lucilla introduces Regeane to the delights of sexual relations as she pleasures her in her rich Roman estate. Though Regeane does not love, or even feel attracted to Lucilla, they continue to sleep in the same bed until Maeniel comes to claim her.I found the plot, what there was of it, to be confusing and unsatisfying, merely a subtext for as much lysencious and immoral activities as could be described. The only thing that could keep me reading was the anticipation of Maeniel and Regeane&#65533;s union and even this misguided hope was dashed, as the two never consummate their marriage.Let me conclude by saying that this was the first book I have EVER returned to the store, if all my criticisms have not made the slightest impact on your decision to buy this book, well then, I wish you the joy of it.

That blood managed to get her betrothed to a man of Charlamagne's choice. But Regeane's blood also gives her another problem. By night,thanks to her father's blood, she's wolf, and if anyone finds out, she's dead.With her mother's death, young Regeane is left in the care of her cruel uncle Gunabald and her witless(or just plain terrified)cousin Hugo. Gunabald is a very cruel, greedy man, who sees Regeane's betrothal as a path to the life they think they deserve. However, Regeane, as well as several friends she makes in the course of the book, have different ideas. With their help, Regeane hopes to survive, and at least, if she can't escape her marriage, at least to escape Gunabald and the plans he has for her. See, he wants her to kill her new husband, or help them do it. What Gunabald doesn't realize are the political ramifactions involved in that. But, going on.This is the story of a girl fighting to be what and who she is, in a world that would declare her a witch. The friends who help her are very intriguing people, and i wish there were whole books about some of them.It's definetly a great story."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"This is a book for those who read strictly for pleasure, who can relax and allow the author to tell her story her way. Those who prefer to read critically and who consider themselves superior to those of us who are more relaxed and uncritical in our reading will find little technical details to grouse about.Alice Borchardt's werewolves have a distinct difference from those in other books. Her books portray the human personality and the wolf personality as two separate personalities in the same body, personalities who are compatable and able to communicate with each other. I liked this idea myself and felt it quite enhanced the tale.Basically, this is the story of the heroine who's being used by her uncle and cousin to make them rich by marrying a barbarian noble and then in time killing him. But this is a gal who strives to be a liberated woman even in ancient Rome, and as such goes through several adventures both as a woman and as a wolf. The details are richly painted, and the action is fairly sustained throughout. It's a romance, but not too syrupy for us guys to appreciate. There are predictable elements here, but like I say, just relax and let the author tell her story and I think you'll enjoy it. (Unless you'd rather be a nitpicker)."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I enjoyed the book so much I could hardly wait to get home to finish it. It is indeed writen by Ane Rice\`s sister, but her style is different and in my opinion, better. Everyone has his own taste, so read the book and decide for yourself, but I think it is not really fer to compare them, as somebody already said.The time of this book is defined, and the fact that it is not recognisable at once doesn\`t make it undetermined, as some readers said. It is in the time of Charlemagne, after the fall of the great Roman empire, when Europe was in a sort of permanent struggle for power. The problem is that not many people are interested in this era and so not many recognise it.The main charachter is a shapeshifting woman. She is promised to a man, she hes never seen and could be dangerous to her, but he too has a mistery about him.She lives with an uncle, that doesn\`t treat her very well and only keeps her around, becuse she could be useful to him (to get money).It is a great book (if a little predictable) with some erotic elements that are wowen in the plot beautifuly. It has a lovely dark atmosphere. I recomend you read it. It won\`t let you down."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I didn't buy this book because of the author or who she was related to, but because I resently bought another werewolf book, Moon Dance, and it was a bummer.

I was on summer vacation and at the time was in junior high. I began reading this book at 6 p.m on a tuesday and read it till the final page...which was 10 a.m the next morning.

I found the wonderful descriptions of ancient Rome so vivid that I could almost see and taste the atmosphere. I love historical novels and would have enjoyed this book even without my second favorite component-the supernatural. The blending of political maneuvering in Roman society with the dark and mysterious world of Regeane and her wolf are fascinating.Regaene is a victim of her birth. She is the daughter of a wealthy and powerful family without the benefit of their protection. Her guardian Gundabald is a cruel and boorish man who uses his knowledge of her \\"full moon secret\\" to hold her in line even though she is mentally and physically his superior. She would surely be burned as a witch if anyone found out and he makes sure she is reminded of this at every opportunity. She is being married, despite her wishes, to a man she has never met to help strengthen political allegiances and of course add some weight to Gundabald's purse.In her attempt to get away from the crushing grip of Gundabald, Regeane begins to discover more about her true nature and the incredible abilities she inherited from a father she never met. She makes both strong allies and even more powerful enemies in her quest for personal freedom. In a flight that includes a high class Roman brothel, a leper community and even the world of the dead Regeane finds herself running right into what she though she was trying to escape.I truly enjoyed this book, but was disappointed by the others in the series. If you have read any of the others and were turned off by them don't let that dissuade you from picking up this far superior novel."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"Anne Rice's sister, Alice Borchardt, has surpassed her. This book is excellently written. Set in dark ages Rome, the story is about a young woman that has the strange quirk of turning wolf. She is treated poorly and kept nearly-captive by her stepfather and brothers. They live in squalor despite the fact that they have some small claim to nobility. The story then focuses on her escape from her family, her reunion with her true father, and Roman politics.This is a riveting start to a great series, and is the best of the three. The author capably makes the reader sympathetic with Regeane. This story is exciting and romantic. Despite its focus on werewolves, it is not a horror story. This is a very sympathetic series to wolves and werewolves. These days, most schoolchildren know that wolves are not inherently dangerous and evil creatures, and Borchardt's werewolves reflect this century's enlightened point of view. She surely must have watched many hours of The Nature Channel, because her descriptions of wolves are right-on.I bought this off the shelf at a bookstore, and it did not disappoint me as so many other whim book purchases have. In fact, I have become a fan of Alice's writing and intend to read everything she puts out."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"The book Silver Wolf is the first book i have ever read that Alice Borchdart has written.

Living in the once great Eternal City is Regeane, a woman with royal blood flowing through her veins. Regeane is a special person because she has also inherited from her deceased sire the ability to physically change her human shape to that of a wolf. In other words, Regeane is a werewolf.Even possessing special powers beyond that of a normal mortal does not stop Regeane from being used by everyone in her circle. Charlemagne plans to have her wed to some barbarian as a political bride. Her uncle and cousin are abusive and blackmail her by threatening to reveal her lycanthropic secret to the Church, who would kill her as witch. Finally, a strange but pleasant scent is activating her sexual needs. With her world crumbling faster than Rome's, it appears that Regeane has an uphill fight just to survive.THE SILVER WOLF is one of the all time great werewolf novels. The story line is fast paced and readers need to be prepared to set aside several hours for this one sitting read. The characters are all wonderful as they bring to life ancient Rome on the threshold between antiquity and the modern ages. Blended within all that is a beautifully told romantic fantasy that in of itself makes for a great novel. Alice Borchardt beguiles her devoted audiences with one of the years best fantasy stories.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"This book is a wonderful read especially if you like the werewolf/fantasy and history side of books.

But, with the introduction of a few key players and an unknown wolf, she's beginning to take back control. The Silver Wolf is bombastic, artless, and overdrawn. Its grimdark setting never jives with its idealized protagonist or intrusive off-color humor, yet the book is full of good intentions: an unusual historical setting, realized in loving and disgusting detail; a blatant though often problematic arc of female empowerment. But all that could be good is drowned out by bad writing; rather than ponderous (and it easily could be), The Silver Wolf is simply pulpy. It has a Rician flair for the dramatic but not the gothic, the werewolves are run of the mill--which is to say that it's not even fun, indulgent pulp; it's just pulp, consumable but artless and empty. I don't recommend it."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I don't know if it's due to the fact that I read the Kindle edition or if the author is at fault, but it was difficult to get involved at the onset and for some duration due to the clumsiness of the writing.

I did not view it so much a novel about a werewolf as a unique hybrid: two creatures, human and wolf, cohabitating the same physical space.

Truly an unusual romp through history and fantasy."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"&quot;The Silver Wolf&quot; is a highly enjoyable novel. It gives us special insight into the Rite of Passage for one young woman. Being a werewolf is no easy thing, especially in an age where anything remotely supernatural or unusual is considered taboo. Imagine trying to control your werewolf self, living with an unloving uncle who beats and starves you while wishing to marry you off to the highest bidder, and imagine being a woman in a time when men held the reins of power. It is a time of war and a time of chaos. And then imagine meeting someone like yourself, a werewolf, a creature of the night. Imagine not being alone anymore. All this and more must a brave soul go through in order to understand who and what she is. Alice Borchardt is a talented writer who pays close attention to detail. She can weave a web as well as any spider, a web of words which take you back in time to the Roman Empire. A time of danger and of secrecy. I reccomend this story to history buffs, fantasy freaks, and anyone else who enjoys curling up with a good book and sending yourself to a time of long ago.And just wait for the sequel!"},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I enjoyed the story; the descriptions are thick and rich, the plot amuses me, and it's just a good view of werewolves.

This book was different and I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"The Silver Wolf by Alice Bochardt is a stunning, surreal paranormal novel. It centers around Reagane, human and wolf, woman and girl, poor and royal blooded with the fate of a city on her shoulders.Set in Rome at the beginning of Charlemagne's rule Reagane is a girl quickly becoming a woman after the death of her mother. Reagane is trapped in poverty, terrorized by her cruel uncle, Gundabald, and cousin, Hugo. Her only weapon against them is her distant royal blood, which promises a life of riches, should she bow to Gundabald's command.Even the wolf, Reagane's dark-borne counter part, is potentially more harm than help with the Roman people caught between ancient paganism and superstitious Christianity.The Silver Wolf is full of tension; Reagane's drive to be free of her abusive uncle, her need to help the people who keep her secret, the desire to be free to be what she is and the dedication to play her role in the struggle between kings, between pope and Roman people, a future of hope and a sickening slide back into hopeless darkness. Of all the writing rules Borchardt breaks (Point of view changes, tense shifts, exposition) conflict is one she keeps, using both the broken rules and the iron-clad ones to draw the reader in and get a vice grip on their throat.Overwhelmingly dark, yet full of strong characters, magic only half understood and the feeling of the fate of the entire world balancing precariously on Reagane's will, The Silver Wolf is quite possibly my favorite book."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I acknowledge two types of writing. One is writing with value, the other is writing just for fun. While this is definantly not a wonderfully written book, i still think it's one of my favorite \\"trasy\\" novels.

The historical and political setting was very interesting, so much so that I had to look up Pope Hadrian on the internet. I was bothered by the author's tendency to roam off into some seemingly instinctual wolf memories that the main character didn't actually live. But the story and transformations from wolf to girl and back were very good. I was hoping for more interaction between the main character and her fiance, but perhaps that happens in the next book.

Enough historical information was intertwined in the storyline to make this very enjoyable.. I can't wait for the next book, Night of the Wolf.."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"When I finished reading Anne Rice's Pandora, I noticed that there was an ad in the back for The Silver Wolf. I was a little surprised, since rarely does Rice/Rice's publisher plug any books but her own in the back/front/etc. I was intrigued, and when I next went shopping, I bought a copy. The mystery was solved when I saw the author's photo -- with her sister, Anne Rice. I think Alice Borchardt relied too heavily on her more-famous sibling for book promotions. She needn't have -- it speaks for itself. I am not the type to pick up books by authors whom I have never heard of before, but I did, and my decision had nothing to do with Rice and everything to do with an intriguing character and plot. Borchardt brings an obscure age to life, and while the book is filled with violence (well, it is the Dark Ages), it also has humor and pathos. The mystery of Regeane and her kind is very engrossing, and a refreshing change from B-rated movie-type portrayals of wolves and werewolves. Overall, I was absolutely enchanted, and I cannot wait for the next one."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"A tour-de-force. What a talent. Why haven't I discovered this author before? A skillful writer with an intriguing tale. I've never before read a novel from Charlemagne's time (A.D. 800s)--shown as a depressing world of constant urban strife with no peace in the emptied countryside. This is a convincing tale of desperate changlings (Roma mater?) told as from the inside. A remarkably gritty tale with intensely palpable scenes and emotions, a cross between a Roman orgy and cynical Medieval piety. I didn't feel it was a &quot;fantasy&quot; novel but realistic, sensual but not erotic. Remarkably, the word &quot;werewolf&quot; is never used, and its absence makes the story so much better, less trite, more empathetic. Strangely, the next book in this new &quot;series&quot; will be set a thousand years earlier."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I really liked this book. Since everyone seems to be comparing her with her sister, I would like to say that having read both authors, I like Borchardt better. Anne Rice is to long winded. If I wanted a history lesson, I would buy a history book. This book is a good read. I thought that there should have been more interaction between Regeane and Maniel, and was really disapointed that there wasn't. I like the fact that Regeane never hated the wolf part of her, just accepted it. This author stands on her own."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I have read all 3 of Alice Borchardt's books and found them to be refreshing. I really enjoy her writing style. I am a big fan of Anne McCaffery, Marion Zimmer Bradley. I read mostly fantasy and sci-fi and I find Ms. Borchardt's books ones I wish to revisit. I can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I loved the blend of accurate historical information and fantasy. I could not put the book down. It flowed well, kept me interested, and was good all the way through. Very good character development, very good intrigue, and a great story line. If you read her sister's (Anne Rice) novel, Pandora, and enjoyed it, you will like The Silver Wolf. It has a similar blend of history and fantasy - yet in a style all her own and intriguing. I can't wait for her second novel in this series."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"The Silver Wolf tells the story of Regeane, a pale and beautiful woman by day and a delicate silver wolf by night, of her odyssey seeking self-recognition and true love. Regeane&iexcl;s late mother was a distant kin to Charleman the Great, by then only one of many feudal lords rising to power, but had unrivaled potential. Her father was another man-wolf, rich and powerful but had fallen prey to human&iexcl;s evil conspiracy. Her uncle, Gundabald, a wicked and mean scum, had used her mother as a pawn of splendid future, and had killed her father with a crossbow bolt directly through his heart. At the beginning of the story, Gundabald, being Regeane&iexcl;s only relative alive, had arranged a political marriage for her in order to gain court favor, and the bridegroom-to-be was the barbarian lord Maeniel, who had occupied a mountain fortress overlooking the pass of Alps. Because of Maeniel&iexcl;s future usefulness in conquering Rome, Regeane&iexcl;s marriage had become extremely important for both the Roman pope, Hadrian, who had been suffering from neighboring kingdom of Lombard and had hoped to gain aid from Charleman, and herself.Being Anne Rice&iexcl;s elder sister, author Alice Borchardt wrote with poetic delicacy and stunning beauty. The story unfolded with fast pace but lacked in Anne&iexcl;s detailed descriptions at the same time. Some sentences were among the most beautiful I had ever seen. Alice wrote about a water pool in the evening as &iexcl;The reflecting pool was beginning to fill with stars,&iexcl; and rising moonlight as &iexcl;Soon, very soon, its journey across the sky would bring it to her window where it would throw a pool of silver light on the floor.&iexcl;Since this was a story both historical and supernatural, there were fantastic elements such as a woman shifting into the shape of a wolf, walking into the land of the dead and meeting the ghost of her lost father, and sharing the Spring of Youth in the garden of eternity with Daedalus, the famous Greek architect, as well as historical events, such as Julius Caesar&iexcl;s life and death, the origin of ides of March, and Roman poets&iexcl; works. Alice mixed fantasy with history in a never-seen-before style, using fantastic aspects to explain historical figures and adding mysterious flavor with bits of ancient mythology. Readers familiar with Western legends and folklore would find delightful surprises, like the Authurian Romance and Greek mythology, constantly during their process of page-turning.Under the disguise of Dark Ages history and wild imagination, The Silver Wolf was actually a novel of feminism, of feminine self-awareness. Regeane was a typical woman who had lived under men&iexcl;s threats, and to strike a balance between her humanity and the wolf&iexcl;s wild nature, she must struggle for her own freedom and happiness. The author&iexcl;s feminism intention was obvious, since the beginning most characters were female and kind, good in nature, and most male were symbols of violence and lust. Regeane received help from Lucilla, the pope&iexcl;s courtesan and a very powerful woman in Rome, Elfgifa, a Saxon little girl of a brave and intelligent heart, among the others. On the contrary, Gundabald and his son Hugo were bad to the bone, two helpless scums, knowing nothing but sleeping with low-price prostitutes and eating. There were some exceptions, though, Antonius, Lucilla&iexcl;s bastard son, was a benevolent young man stricken by leper, though still kept a good heart. Maeniel, the barbarian lord, was actually an immortal wolf-man, and all his followers had the same shapeshifting ability just as Regeane.I had expected Regeane in The Silver Wolf to be independent, brave and graceful, and in the end found her salvation and freedom. And when reading through the story, seeing Alice mocking the traditional value system built by men (&iexcl;I can&iexcl;t think why God created them. I suppose for the same reason he created mosquitos, and fleas.&iexcl; 231), and at the same time praise the female&iexcl;s greatness, (&iexcl;The female is respected. She gives life, she is life. Her body is a temple.&iexcl; 359) I had been glad to find a woman&iexcl;s awakening and independence. But in the end, the story still fell into the typical prince-and-princess-live-happily-ever-after archetype, with Regeane being accused witch, Lucilla being tortured almost to death, and Hadrian and Antonius having no power to save her. The male (Maeniel) still played the role of ultimate hero and savior. He fought as Regeane&iexcl;s champion and defeated the challenger, and together they lived happily ever after. The ending really disappoint me, since I had had enough prince and princess fairy tale, I had wanted some real characters. Regeane was a successfully built character, but the author failed her job in the end.Over all, The Silver Wolf was an easy-to-read, light and interesting book. Alice masterfully mixed historical facts, mythology, fantastic elements and humor, in the end creating a believable and unique story, although we can see images from other famous works, such as Jack London&iexcl;s The Call of the Wild, and traditional supernatural stories like vampire and werewolf. As a popular novel, The Silver Wolf shined with silver glow. But as a true literary work or a feminism story, it had a long way to go."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"Slow to start, race for the end. Excellent read. Hope there will be a sequel in the making. Rich in detail and history."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in a while. There is a lot of realistic detail in it and the characters are great. But the person who reviewed this book for Kirkus Reviews must have been asleep or something! Lucilla being Maenial's mother! How the heck did they get that? Weird. I agree that the ending was abrupt, but other than that it was great."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I thought The Silver Wolf was a great book. At first it seems like everything is bunched together and you would never think that it all comes together in the end. I think Alice Borchart did a wonderful job describing and listing the details of how the people looked and how the landscape looked. I liked her perspective on ancient Rome very much and I would recomend this book to anyone and everyone who likes books with love, hate, mystery, and intruge"},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I've never read much Anne Rice since I don't care much for vampires. But I love werewolves, so I was happy to give this book by Anne's sister a chance. I was a little concerned that Ms. Borchardt may have gotten her work published due solely to being Anne's sister, but I needn't have worried. The writing style is excellent and transports us back to a fastinating but seldom explored time period. I enjoyed all the characters and especially the portrayal of werewolves -- beautiful, mysterious and powerful. If you're into werewolves, this book is a treat. I can't wait for a sequel."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"It's a shame that you can't pick zero stars from the menu -- one was the lowest I could give. This book was terrible -- the plot was weak, the history shoddily researched, and the characters were cardboard and completely unappealing. Even the author's attempt at homo-erotica in the book fell flat -- apparently she was trying to cash in on her sister's writing style. Not a very good book -- and it's a little sleazy to have Anne Rice give a wonderful review of the book (she's the author's sister!) -- apparently Anne never actually read Silver Wolf. Just terrible!!"},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"really uneven. basically a bodice-ripper romance novel trying to pass itself off as fine literature (I guess being pretentious runs in the family) -- sorry to be so harsh, the author must havwe put a lot of work into it, because the book weighs like 5 pounds.There were a couple of things I liked about Silver Wolf, but they were pretty well outweighed by the author going on ad nauseum about the heroine's pert breasts and magical silver hair.It is just not my cup of tea, personally. Give me Marion Zimmer Bradley or even Stephen King over this."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"This book is tied with another for the all-time worst book I have read. The character development is trite: characters are either very good or very bad. The character's actions are not consistent with their personality and there is a serious lack of continuity. I found myself very hard-pressed to be at all interested in what was going to happen to these characters."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I'm not going to totally trash this book only because I did finish it. I'm giving it two stars because it is something only remotely close to readable and engaging. Cold comfort, but that's the truth. It matters very little, though, because Alice Borchardt only manages to pull you through the story to frustrate you at every turn.Borchardt knows how to keep the action going and she doesn't beat you over the head with her historical research nearly as badly as some other gothic novelists are wont to do - specifically, her little sister, Anne Rice, springs to mind. But this still isn't a very good book if you read critically and have a low tolerance for gaping holes in a story.I would challenge anyone who would rave about _The Silver Wolf_ to think about the character, Silve.Silve is established as a solid secondary character (and probably the most believable of all the characters), but Borchardt simply forgot about her or just couldn't find anything for her to do for most of the book, so we lost her until the Borchardt realized that she needed her again to progress her weak plot. That's shoddy storytelling and it's only one - just one- example of it in _The Silver Wolf_.Additionally, each character in the book - primary and secondary alike - is a two-dimensional, cliched, romance novel archetype. Granted, this book is marked on the back cover to be shelved in the Romance section of the bookstore (although Borchardt is found in the Literature section at my local Borders -- how generous of them!), so maybe I expected too much. But writing is writing, as far as I'm concerned. Even a romance novel shouldn't have all the loose ends you'll find in here.I'll admit that Borchardt paints a pretty picture. I loved her descriptions of ancient Rome. But scenery doesn't get you through the long dark night of this book and she never manages to write anything even resembling seamless story to keep you company while you ride by the aqueducts. Maybe Borchardt should have collaborated with someone who could have helped her with the story - no, not Rice. Or maybe she should have gotten a better editor - again, not Rice's.If you demand more of what you read, then don't bother with this book.Oh, P.S. --- Borchardt should be chastised for her wanton overuse of one particular type of punctuation. Take a quick flip through the pages of _The Silver Wolf_. I challenge you to find ten consecutive pages without at least one ellipse on at least one page! For those who don't know, an ellipse is the dot-dot-dot (...) (usually used to indicate a pause, etc.) that a good novelist knows to use very sparingly. ..."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I bought The Silver Wolf on a whim thinking that I had not yet read a good werewolf story. I still haven't. The concept is interesting enough; ancient Roman backdrop, Romulus and Remus, werewolves. I has all the components for a tightly woven, intricate story. It fails on all points. The main character is a young woman, Regeane, with lycanthropy. She is abused and held in captivity by her boorish uncle and insipid cousin. She is to be married off to a wealthy lord at which time she is to kill him so that the uncle can claim his fortune. She gains her freedom several times only to stupidly return to the uncle and endure more harsh treatment. The beating scenes are some of the most vivid and disturbing and one wonders why author Alice Borchardt seems to only be able to evoke feeling with these horrific accounts. They are the signature theme to the book: young girl (all women) are abused in an unfair world dominated by men. She finally attains some measure of freedom by falling in with an elite prostitute who is friends with Rome's Pope. One wonders how much better the story would have been if the woman had been a common prostitute with all the problems associated with it in Ancient Rome. Not a perfumed madam living in a mansion.The story is told mainly from Regeane's point of view, but the author has to slip into an omnipotent POV to show sketchy character development of the main male character. The male character is introduced early and quickly and does not show up again until the second half of the story. These switches are abrupt and force the reader out of the 'suspension of disbelief' needed for a fantasy story. The author also fails to define and bring to life an actual Villain except for the abusive uncle who, if the story were done correctly, would have been killed in the third chapter. There are several clumsy love scenes that seem to have been written by a teenager, including one out-of-place lesbian scene that is there apparently because lesbianism is chic right now. She also meets several secondary female characters that have sad life stories as well. And the reader is again clubbed over the head with the \\"women good, men bad\\" message.Along the way Regeane communes with the dead, visits the afterlife, cures leprosy, has other people's past life flash-backs, meets her own kind, and lives happily ever-after. Alice Borchardt does not define a limited magical realm, a common failing among some fantasy writers to include all manner of the fantastic simply because they are enamored with everything. She should have stuck to mostly werewolf myth. She also stops the story flow to have main characters engage in private conversations. These conversations are used to \\"explain\\" things to the young Regeane, but only serve to lay out huge expository lumps. And finally she adds hooks into Arthurian characters that add nothing to the story, but are there to set up her next book. Pretty arrogant."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I thought it was a beautiful story and the writer did a wonderful job creating a diverse group of characters that were both likable and hatable - in other words very real and well developed. Regeane is such a complex character, and Alice B. showed her every side of her personality superbly. She was very feminine and gentle at times, and a true wolf at other. Her uncle was unable to transform her into a weeping husk of a woman that her mother became, which was truly amazing based on her upbringing. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about the two different personalities (the human and the wolf) that sometimes clashed but most of the time were very in tune with one another. Even though Regeane was taught her whole life that she was tainted, in her heart she truly loved the wolf and that love helped her to become the strong woman she was during those difficult times. Also I liked the fact that the writer stayed true to the period and didn't shy away from the gruesome parts and overall made the story believable.The only criticism I might add is it was a little too descriptive. It could be just my personal taste for a fast paced action, but I must admit that I speed-read through a number of passages. Other then that, I loved the story and the action. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"The Silver Wolf is a delightful story that in some places borders on erotica, in other fiction, in some fantasy. The description is beautiful, however, the plot moves slowly. It's more of a political piece. So people who don't like politics may find the book boring.However, there are exciting times when Regeane, the main character, changes into a wolf. These are just enough to keep you going. The writer, also, has a poor grip on grammar. The Silver Wolf is oozing with sentence fragments and even a few contradictions.I must say, though, I was impressed by the character development. Regeane was a little flat, but she was believable. Everyone was believable. Though the concept of the wolf in Regeane wasn't well- developed, it was still attractive and interesting. The way Alice developed her characters is something that can and should be emulated by writers. In fact, it was this impressive bit that made me give this book four stars instead of three."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"This book focuses on Regeane, a misunderstood and orphaned noblewoman, mistreated by her relatives, who happens to be a werewolf. She has fought the wolf part of herself and has not really come into her power. She is a pawn in a huge powerplay which could effect the entire Empire or at least what's left of it. She meets Maeniel from Night of the Wolf. In human form, neither knows at first that the other is a wolf. The book goes from there and sees justice for Regeane as well as happiness."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"The Silver Wolf wasn't at all what I had hoped. While I give it 3-stars, that's only because it was a good read. If I had it to do over I wouldn't have read it at all. Nothing in the story really *grips* you and, though the description is wonderful. I suppose there's a plot under there somewhere, but it's never really brought to light and the whole book seems to roll along, slowly and dragging in many places, then the end isn't really worth the read. If you happen to see it at the library and have nothing better to do then I'd say pick it up for something to pass time, but I wouldn't go out and spend money on this book, it's simply not worth it."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I love to read. I am a huge fan of supernatural fiction. I have read all of Anne Rice's novels, I have read many werewolf and vampire novels. Based on the majority of good reviews I thought I would enjoy this book. Instead I found myself loathing to open the book. I gave up many times and it took me 20 times longer than I normally take to read a book.I could care less about the main character or any other character. The story jumps all over is confusing and doesn't make any sense. The book is mainly a vehicle to write about violence and sex and isn't even very good at that. Romance what romance? Borchardt tries to cover up the bad plot, the meandering story line, and ridiculous characters with the subtext of history. The problem is the book is so out there that the history doesn't even seem realistic. These characters and their actions do not seem like ones you would expect in ancient rome.Nothing was remotely satisfying about this book except for when I finished it.If you are remotely hesitant to pick up this book then DON'T. It is horrible. You are not missing anything if you don't read it. If you like werewolves try Kelley Armstrong, or Laurell K Hamilton."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I chanced upon this book years ago at the library when I was looking for a different author. This is the first Alice Borchardt book I ever read, and it was a very good read. It's so rare to find books set in Dark Age Europe, since it was so... well, for lack of a better word, dark. Rome has fallen, and the glory of the Middle Ages is a long way off, but the people living in the remnants of Rome certainly made do.The book starts off really well - always a good sign for a book - and left me intrigued as I read on to learn more of Regeane and what had happened to her, and just how she had ended up with her uncle. Overall it was a good book with a interesting array of characters like Lucilla and Antonius, but I especially liked Maeniel. Personally, this is my favorite book out of the Silver Wolf trilogy."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"Alice Borchardt shared a childhood of storytelling with her sister, the best selling novelist Anne Rice, in New Orleans. A professional nurse, she has also nurtured a profound interest in little-known periods of history. She published her debut novel, 'Devoted', in 1995.Regeane is an unwilling pawn in the plotting that is going on in Rome, at the time of Charlemagne. She is betrothed by an uncle she loathes and despises to an unknown barbarian lord. There is little or nothing Regeane can do about it. She is unable to refuse as she knows that her uncle will betray her as a shape-shifting wolf woman. She is strangely drawn to a dark wolf prowling outside the city gates.This is the first in the legend of the Wolf series. There are two more book in the series: Night of the Wolf and the Wolf King. I found this book thoroughly enjoyable"},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"During Charlamagne's rule, the once powerful and gorgeous city of Rome is now in ruin. Corruption and political ambition drive its citizens above all else. Regeane is a distant kin to Charlemagne, but that's the least of her incredible assets. She's also inherited her father's ability to shape shift into a wolf.But her talents and abilities are exploited at every turn by just about everyone she encounters. Her cousin and uncle have kept her captive and living in poverty for years. Now that she's reached the proper age, they have decided to marry her off to a Barbarian she's never even laid eyes on. Their plan is to eventually dispose of the man, and live off his wealth. Can Regeane take control of her destiny and survive in such a ruthless world? With the wolf urging her own, the woman embarks upon the most dangerous fight of all: the fight for freedom, and survival.Ms. Borchardt has written a superb werewolf novel in THE SILVER WOLF. The writing is lyrical and engrossing, and she has a wonderful knack for depicting a lush and imaginative fantasy world. Though the pacing may lag a little at times, the superb writing style more than makes up for it. The characters are beautifully developed, and each is individually intriguing and mysterious. The rich background she's developed for all her characters truly makes this story come to life.If you're looking for a fabulous blend of intrigue, mystery, adventure, sprinkled with just the right touch of romance, don't hesitate to pick up THE SILVER WOLF."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"The Silver Wolf is absolutely fabulous, and I don't say that about many books. It is the first in a series (but the first two stand alone) and it is IMHO the best of the three written so far.The characterization is wonderful. Regeane, Antonius, and Lucilla are all very well-fleshed out and consistent. The other supporting characters, from the villains to the kid Elfgifa to the gaggle of nuns, are also very interesting, different from each other, and not cardboard stereotypes.The plot of the story keeps you on your toes as it twists and turns. You are sort of waiting the whole time for the anticipated meeting of the prospective groom, but it doesn't become predictable or dull.Borchardt's sense of humour is one of the best parts of this novel. Her descriptions of characters and situations are off-beat and amusing. She also does a good job of recreating medieval Rome, although the characters use to much modern jargon and phrasing.All in all a wonderful book - more than the combination of its adventure, mystery, and romance."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"One of the first things that will strike a reader of this book is the beautiful and sensually detailed descriptions Alice gives of the main character's world. The feeling is heightened when described through her eyes, nose, and ears when transformed into a wolf.However, there are times when the pacing almost grinds to a halt. The plot is decent enough and all the characters aside from Regeane and Maeniel tend to be formulaic and lack complexity. Surprisingly Maeniel doesn't get the explosition he deserves in this book. He is mentioned in the beginning and is later reintroduced after more than halfway through the book. It's good that the sequel talks about him more.All in all, a good read, but not nearly as exciting as it could have been. However, the book has some truly memorable moments (visit to the land of the dead, ending battle, Regeane's encounter with the pack) that give good testament to the imagination of Alice Borchardt."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"First off, a note to those who have not read this book yet. This is the first in the series. &quot;The Wolf King&quot; is the second, but is actually a prequel. &quot;Night of the Wolf&quot; is the third, but picks up where &quot;The Silver Wolf&quot; leaves off.What attracted me to the book in the first place was the cover and title. Both are lovely. What kept me reading the series by this author, was the fact that Borchardt has a wonderful command and sense of this time period. Her discriptions of the characters, the government, and the place itself is astonishing. I agree with a couple of others that it did cause the story line to drag a bit at some points, but it also helped the reader to understand what prompts the characters to react the way they do to each other and their enviroment. I liked her well rounded characters, none where perfect. Lucilla, who was portrayed as a strong, powerful woman--was also vunerable to hardships just like anyone else in the book.I enjoyed Borchardt's descriptions. I could easily picture events and places and even place myself in the story. I could find myself standing on the street in the doorway of a tavern or out in the field watching Regeane (as a wolf) learning to stalk and capture field mice. I like the way she easily described the personality of everyone in the book and kept them as individuals. They were sexy, strong, silly, dumb, adventurous, or even funny. (The wolf looking up women's skirts!) I so thoroughly enjoyed reading this first novel that I wanted to know more about the author--something I rarely do unless I plan to read more by them. That was when I discovered to my surprise she is the sister of Anne Rice. Being from Louisiana myself, I automatically read everything by Anne Rice. Not that she deserves to be read, just because she is from here and lives here also, and I believe in supporting my natives. At this point I have read all of the novels by both authors and can tell you that, yes, there is a little similarity between the authors. Being they are both heavy in the discription area. That is where the similarities end. Borchardt is much better able to develop her characters into believable and approchable people or beings, for that matter. The reader can feel what they feel and understand why they do or decide to do the things they do. She can draw the reader into her books. I've never found Anne Rice to do any of these things.I hope my opinion was helpful."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"We both read this book and enjoyed it, yet found it confusing she touched things and flashed back without any warning to the reader. I wouldn't suggest it for an oral bookreport-no one understands what on earth you're talking about.

Thankfully so. Where Anne Rice's novel seem to slowly devolved in strength, imagery and plot, The Silver Wolf did not. Admittedly, there was the sensation of plunging halfway into a Harlequin Romance. However, the strength of the heroine was worth while. Even though the vision of history the book presents is skewed and at times less than accurate, the presentation causes that vision to be of an alternate world. I reccomend the book highly, over Anne Rice's later works."},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"BRYAN READ THIS BOOK IT IS SO AWESOME YOU'LL LOVE IT I LOVE IT , YOU'LL LOVE IT. really tho, werewolves, some medieval brothels, whats better than that?"},{"Title":"The Silver Wolf","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I was excited to start reading it because it looked really interesting. I was very disappointed. The story felt very one dimensional. None of the characters to me seemed to have any depth. I never felt I knew any reason why the characters acted one way or another. The plot was absolutely predictable, there were gaps, and the narrative seemed to jump around all the time. In all honestly I got to frustrated a little over half way in and skipped ahead to the end. The end was exactly what I expected. I very rarely skip ahead in a book, I will struggle through bad book in hopes it will get better, but this one was just not good enough for that.

Hit of miss, I pick her titles up in hard cover, as more often than not, they are enjoyable reads. When I found out her sister wrote a series of books, I thought I would give them a try. I did not expect them to be the same, I was just hoping for a good told tale.I was able to get 104 pages into the paperback version of this title before I gave up. I could not care about &quot;our heroine.\\" I kept hoping I would get some sense of a plot. I never did. I never got the direction the book was going in. It read to me as if the writer had an idea, but was allowed to go with a first draft.I don't usually give up on a book, but there were too many switchbacks in those 100 pages and I simply stopped caring about Regeane.

I am sorry I purchased this particular book by Andrew Kaufman. Very disappointed."},{"Title":"All My Friends Are Superheroes","review":"A whimsical little story about an ordinary guy who is rendered invisible to his fiance, the Perfectionist (a Superhero), by her jealous ex-boyfriend, Hypno, at their wedding reception. with a premise like that, the reader is introduced to a myriad of other Superheroes, though not the kind with enviable superpowers. Some of them include the Terrycloth, who is able to make every day feel like a Sunday, Sloth, who discovers with liberating finality that just rejecting all the things he is unable to muster up energy to accomplish, gives him his superpowers.At times, Kaufman seems a little too pleased with himself for inventing these less-than-spectacular superpowers he intersperses his narrative with, expecting the reader to chuckle knowingly with self-identification. On their own, they are interesting nuggets illustrating the universe he has created, but not necessarily of any import to the plot at hand, which is pencil-thin.Still, there are some delightful passages, like the vacuum-slash-love salesman who tries to interest the Perfectionist with his samples in this exchange:\\"I've got the love you want, the love you think you want, the love you think you want but don't when you finally get it...\\"'That must be very popular.\\"\\"It is.\\"Charming, but not nearly enough."},{"Title":"All My Friends Are Superheroes","review":"The concept is really smart but the book fell short!

This book is funny (laugh out loud) and fresh. It is a charming and suave love story with a most original wrench thrown in the machinery of love. No one needs to die or mistakenly break up or fall in with evil in this love story; a mere disappearance will do. Our hero (normal, not super) becomes invisible on his wedding day but only to his wife. He has to reinstate her vision of him or he will lose her forever. How's that for a premise? Actually, it sounds almost Shakespearean but given all the superheroes floating and flying and slinking around, dipping in and out, this is not Elizabethan England.In fact we are in Canada and superheroes abound (of course: we all know about the low crime rates and fantastically cheap health care). The powers of these superheroes, at times listed in encyclopedic fashion, are indeed super and quite urbane. Their unique powers make perfect sense in the crazy world that we live in. My favorite (and I will only give away one but trust me, these superheroes are brilliantly imagined) is Mistress Cleanasyougo: \\"At the end of every day she folds her clothes. She never leaves scissors on the table, pens with no ink are thrown in the trash, wet towels are always hung up, dishes are washed directly after dinner and nothing is left unsaid.\\" You go, girl.Even with such fantastic powers, just because \\"you're special really doesn't mean anything. You still have to get dressed in the morning. Your shoelaces still break. Your lover will still leave you if you don't treat her right.\\"And so our normalhero Tom must figure out how to save his superhero wife and himself and thier marriage, but using only the good old standby powers of love and faith and ingenuity.

As many others have already said it is a simple, cleverly-written sweet little story. The crispness and freshness of both the language and the premise make it charming and so very hard to resist. I loved the descriptions of the superheroes and how Mr. Kaufman was able to cast this world of everyday superheroes without making it ridiculous or absurd or weird but completely relatable and engaging.My one criticism is that I think it lacked a level of depth that would have made this a perfect reading experience for me - particularly in regards to the two main characters and their relationship. I think the novella would have benefitted from a little more development. Similarly, I think the scenes on the plane on the way to Vancouver could have been utilized better to create more tension and anxiety - a greater sense of peril. Tom spends the first few hours of the trip just watching her sleep and thinking back rather than doing more. And while a simple ending generally suits a simple story - I was left a little let down with the end - wishing it had given me more to relish.That being said, with a simple and clever story like this, the slightest overreach might have thrown it all off and I commend Mr. Kaufman for staying true to the story throughout - even if I might wish for a little more."},{"Title":"All My Friends Are Superheroes","review":"A friend who gave me this book called it &quot;a cute little book,&quot; and while he wasn't trying to stop me from reading it, he almost did.

Therefore it should be a good, solid, work of history. However, from my own research into those same War Crimes files, I can say that Ward's main conclusions have been miscarried, due to his subjectivity...Although this book contains some insightful eyewitness statements and enlightening photographs of General Nishimura, it has also been publicly criticised by author Lynette Silver (\\"The Bridge at Parit Sulong\\") for suppressing some key Archival evidence. While Silver's own book has many problems, and her criticism comes across as overly shrill, Ward does indeed appear to have disregarded some vital evidence held in the official files.The reason for his behaviour was probably because Ward already possessed conflicting texts implying that the key investigator of Nishimura's case, Captain James Godwin, had been an embittered and biased person who had tampered with the official documents. Sadly though, Ian Ward has been seriously misled in this belief.The damning \\"evidence\\" about Godwin's character was created by a forger named James MacKay in the mid-1990s. I am quite confident in stating this, as I am the co-author of an analysis of MacKay's historical forgeries, published in the \\"Journal of Military History\\" in 2007. (On Page 3 of Ward's book, there's even an effusive acknowledgement to James MacKay - which Ward probably now regrets!)The following sections of \\"Snaring the Other Tiger\\" should *not* be accepted as accurate history:Page 114-115.Most of the text on these pages is derived from MacKay's \\"Betrayal in High Places\\" (hereafter: \\"BIHP\\") and is not historical. The half-page \\"Godwin diary\\" quote - which Ward uses to condemn Godwin's character - is copied from BIHP p101 and is completely fictitious.However, one area where Ward did not accept MacKay's word is where Ward mentions Godwin's \\"smattering of Japanese\\". After interviewing Godwin's relatives, Ward must have developed doubts about MacKay's repeated assertion that Godwin had acquired a very high proficiency in spoken and written Japanese language during his time as a POW in Japan.p129-131.The purported Godwin diary entries, and the reports on Godwin's state of mind, are all fictitious and straight out of BIHP. Ward's extensive analysis is therefore baseless.p132-133.Ward's careful comparison of the differences between MacKay's fakes (originally BIHP p237-241) and the genuine Court documents should have convinced him that Mackay was a forger. Instead, amazingly, Ward assumes the opposite, that the Court documents had been manipulated by a vindictive Godwin! Ward even accepted purported copies of the \\"original\\" documents from MacKay without question, and published photographs of them on p330-333. The obvious format and typeface discrepancies of the fakes, not to mention MacKay's purple prose, should have warned Ward that he was being conned.p134-135:The American \\"censure\\" of Godwin that Ward repeats is complete fiction, from BIHP p208 and p215, as are the \\"Godwin diary\\" entries that Ward discusses in these two pages.p136-138,The accusation by Ward that Godwin flouted the Official Secrets Act, by deciding to smuggle out documents, is again wholly founded on MacKay's fake storyline from BIHP p217, p219 and p221. (In fact, the small file of documents which Godwin did keep as a souvenir, after his Tokyo War Crimes office was closed down, merely contained Godwin's own - completely unclassified - carbon copies of his Weekly Reports. The file containing these papers was only a few centimetres thick in its entirety - certainly not a tea chest full, and Godwin never attempted to publish them - contrary to MacKay's story. The signed originals of all of these documents can be seen today, undisturbed, in the National Archives of Australia.)p139.Ward's discussion that Godwin had stolen a valuable document, \\"clearing Nishimura of the stigma of guilt over the Chinese Massacre,\\" is probably the most risible conclusion in this book. (See the note about p334-339 below.)p140-142.Ward performs further extensive but doomed analysis of discrepancies between MacKay's fakes and Court documents, and repeats MacKay's assertions that Godwin made off with an enormous file of stolen papers, weighing \\"200 pounds\\". None of this has any basis in truth.Page 246.Ward's own doubts about Godwin are echoed here, but his evidence - about the American \\"complaints\\", Godwin's \\"clandestine cache\\" and the purported vindictive Godwin diary \\"quotes\\" - is entirely MacKay fiction.p330-333.Photographs of two obvious typewritten MacKay fakes.p334-339.Ward gets excited over another MacKay fake \\"confirming\\" the Colonel Tsuji cover-up. (Tsuji was the subject of Ward's own 1992 book, \\"The Killer They Called a God\\".) Ironically, MacKay probably used TKTCAG as his source in creating this faked report! (Originally p122-125 of BIHP.) It is a sobering illustration of the blindness of human nature that Ward could not even recognise his own work being fed back to him by the forger MacKay.(And Ward was obviously keen to trumpet this \\"discovery\\", since this Appendix is entirely irrelevant to the subject matter of the rest of this book, namely General Nishimura and the massacre at Parit Sulong.)"},{"Title":"Snaring the Other Tiger","review":"The behavior of the Japanese was so appalling during the war that there was immense pressure for them to be punished for what had happened. The desire for retribution created questionable decisions in a number of cases. General Tomoyuki Yamahsita had conquered Malaya and was one of Japans more successful military leaders. Late in the war he was responsible for the defense of the Philippines. The reason he was put on trial and executed related to the treatment of Phillipino civilians prior to the siege of Manilla. Detachment of Marines under his command raped and killed large numbers of innocent civilians before fighting a bloody Defence of the city. The incident was a horrendous one but the reality was complex. Yamahsita had decided that the best way to resist the American forces which had superiority in tanks and aircraft was to retreat to the hills in North Luzon and to fight a guerilla war. He ordered his units to carry out those orders but the marine units in Manilla rebelled and declared that they wanted to fight for the capital. In there view a retreat would lead to a loss of honor.At his trial these facts were not in dispute. Yamahsita however was convicted and sentenced to death. The rational was that as the commander of the Philippines he had a responsibility for all of the units nominally under his command. This extended to rebellious units who were defying his command. His execution has been viewed by Japan as a miscarriage of justice and an example of judicial murder.Ian Ward has written a book about the trial of General Takuma Nishimura the most highly ranked Japanese officer tried by Australia. It suggests that again justice may have miscarried.The background to the incident is that of the Parit Sulong Massacre. On January 22 1942 units of the Australian 8th Division retreated from Parit Sulong leaving in a hospital some 150 badly injured men. What happened was that Japanese soldiers dragged these 150 men from their hospital. They were then shot some who survived the bullets were bound with fencing had petrol poured on them and set them alight. One man Lt Ben Hackney escaped as he had not been tied to the others but was later recapturec. During his captivity Hackney decided that the perpetuators of this act should be brought to justice. Other prisoners suggested that he write down what had happened so that he would be able to give evidence after the war. His memory of the incident was that a high ranking Japanese General had spoken to the men who carried out the massacre directly prior to the incident and he assumed that he was responsible for giving the order. That man was identified as General Nishumura.The trial came down to a simple question. Had General Nishumura ordered the death of the captives or had it been an un-authorized act carried out by some of his subordinates. The prosecuting authority did not call witnesses but relied on depositions. The Defence simply called Nishumura who gave evidence that he had not made any orders for the prisoners deaths. The case was finished within a day and was something of a record for a capital case. As the subordinate officers were not called they could not be cross examined.In a case such as this there would normally would have been considerable cross examination. It was the practice in these sorts of trials to give a considerable sentencing discount to such witnesses for instance in this case they would avoided the death penalty. Witnesses have a lot of reasons to lie and to implicate others.The author of the book however raises further material of relevance. The investigation of this case was Captain Godwin. Godwin had been a prisoner of war and during his confinement had been tortured and starved. He lost 75% of his body weight when a prisoner. It seemed that he developed considerable hatred for his captors as a result.He prepared the case against Nishumura. During his investigation he came across Lt Seizaburo Fujita. Fujita freely admitted to being the officer who ordered the deaths of the Australian prisoners. He was not arrested and it would seem clear that the interrogation of Fujita was poor and carried out in such a way to ensure finding material that implicated Nishumura rather than looked at the case objectively. The statement taken from him appeared short and coached. Other material he gathered appeared to have been summarized and edited to remove important discrepancies between witness statements. Further stole a document from the Japanese archive to stop it going into evidence. It was a Japanese report by the officer who carried out the massacre that to some extent assisted the Defence case.The Defence in Australian war crimes trials was provided by Japanese Civil Lawyers who had limited experience in criminal trials no knowledge of Australian Law and whose living arrangements made it difficult for them to consult with other lawyers. (They were detained as prisoners)After Nishumura was was found guilty he was sentenced to death. His lawyers then returned to Japan and interviewed the witnesses who had given the depositions which had resulted in conviction. All of them said that Godwin in taking the depositions had told them what he wanted them to say and made threats that they would be arrested if they did not say the right thing. Affidavits from these witnesses were not successful in getting a retrial. Clearly if the lawyers representing Nishumura had been able to prepare the trial properly by obtaining this evidence prior to the trial the outcome would have been different.Ironically one of the Tribunal members who heard Nishumura's case was hospitalized immediately after the hearing. It would seem that he was probably insane during the proceedings.All in all if the author is correct this trial is one that brings no credit on Australia."},{"Title":"marco and the Tiger","review":"Remember those huge books you used to have to read in Reading Class during grade school? You know, the ones which were filled with short stories and had the questionarres and/or matching assignments in the textbook's accompanying workbook which you had to answer after completing each story segment?Well, I had first encountered \\"Marco and The Tiger\\" as a \\"short story\\" in one of those things during the fourth grade. As I had taught myself to read before starting any school and regularly devoured books while the rest of my classmates still stumbled over words, I really ate this one up: it started with Marco collecting for his paper route at the weird huge door with the fist-shaped knocker and only got more and more strange and wonderous from there. I was fascinated with the whole setup, and I couldn't help but wonder what, if anything, had happened afterwards. The memory of it ended up both haunting and delighting my childhood memories for the rest of my life.WARNING: Spoilers ahead.Just the other day, I saw a copy of this sitting in my local thrift store and snatched it up.Now that I've read through the whole thing, it turns out that the \\"short story\\" was in reality just the first two chapters condensed to create one. And I'm happy to say that the rest of the book is just as charming as the portion I had originally read all those years ago. John Foster has quite a way with words throughout this quaint little tale, and he gives it real personality that is both unique and touching. This is the sort of book that I would have read in one setting way back then, and would later proceed to re-read again and again on a regular basis. Here is a book which is naturally cute and appealing without ACTING cute and appealing, a story so well-told that it was obviously second nature to its creator.The story is simple but actually quite unique when you compare it to others similar to it: a boy named Marco discovers a tiger living in the middle of a battered courtyard in the middle of New Orleans (!!!), befriends him and later wonders what on earth to do with him.Now I have to state something right off the bat: this is the type of story which will appeal only to those who love animals and have the natural ability to suspend disbelief and accept what's going on here. For example, the boy and the tiger work out a method of communication in which the tiger understands English, and in return Marco learns that the tiger uses his own form of sign language to communicate (a cocked eyebrow means \\"yes\\", stretching the neck means \\"no\\", thrashing the tail means \\"I don't know\\", etc... sort of makes the tiger sound like a typical Andy Warhol interview, doesn't it? ;) ). But Foster makes it work because he presents everything from Marco's point of view so well and effectively that you immediately get the impression the author himself (a) still has the natural ability to communicate with children as equals to be taken seriously, and (b) might have based this on a story he himself dreamed up as a boy. Every single detail is described with loving care, ringing true to Marco's personality and resulting point of view.For example, one passage describes Marco's fear of some kind of mustached gamekeeper hunting down and killing his tiger, and adds as an extra thought, \\"Marco had no idea why the man would have a mustache, he just knew that the man would.\\" A lesser author would never have bothered to have put in such details, but Foster is obviously a natural storyteller, and he's enjoying himself here with every page. I don't know how to describe his writing style except to say that it's appropriate to the story, gives it added believability and works wonderfully in presenting us with Marco's thoughts and perspective.I actually got hooked on this little story and got concerned about what was going to happen, especially since Foster also shows a GREAT natural flair for hooking your suspense... right down to the very last scene that closes the book in which he simply doesn't allow the reader to relax in relief until the last minute.I'm not sure whether later additions of this book ever had different illustrations or not, but the one I found--a first edition from 1967, I believe--has beautiful illustrations, particularly of Marco rowing his tiger across the water on the title page. In fact, the whole book brought back teary-eyed memories of what books for young people used to be like back during the time when this one came out, the time I grew up in.And after you finish this one, which I know both children AND their parents will enjoy, you just might find yourself as the grown-up-who-never-grew-up wondering to yourself: why can't more modern children's books be as naturally crafted and entertaining as this one?"},{"Title":"marco and the Tiger","review":"This is a surprisingly good Children's book about a decent kid (Marco) from New Orleans who hasn't many friends and who accidentally befriends a tiger. Marco is also a kid with a non-attentive father, no mother, and a brutish housekeeper who gripes at him and only feeds him oatmeal. The tiger becomes more than a pet; it becomes Marco's surrogate friend and companion. Of course, Marco realizes this friendship cannot last, and he knows he must save the tiger from being shot or captured. The end result is a readable book that contains a combination of alienation, friendship, trust, challenge and problem solving. I read this book as a kid and I'm surprised it never became a hit among young readers - it's a pretty good story."},{"Title":"Speaking of Sadness: Depression, Disconnection, and the Meanings of Illness","review":"I borrowed this book from my local library before purchasing it to be sure it wasn't just another one of those preachy books encouraging those of us who struggle with depression to just get over it, that it will eventually subside. David Karp is honest about depression as an illness, which is totally on-point considering he suffers from it himself. The words he has written echo through my head each day, and have helped me in a tremendous way. He analogizes depression as a sort of mental arthritis, something we will just have to learn to live with. He doesn't make false promises of overcoming the problems associated with the illness. He is honest, and describes his own experience in ways that I related to immediately. One of the hardest things about depression is a feeling of isolation because not everyone in our immediate circle of friends can understand it if they've never experienced it. The narratives in this book have helped me more than I can put into words here in the mere fact of knowing I am not the only person to feel this way. I highly recommend this book to anyone who suffers with depression."},{"Title":"Speaking of Sadness: Depression, Disconnection, and the Meanings of Illness","review":"While not offering neat/sappy cures for depression (a do this, do that approach), Karp does provide relief merely in his description of experiences someone suffering with depression has...profound insights that ring true for the commonality in dealing with this illness/condition.As an individual suffering from periodic bouts of major depression, I found his insights mindblowing as I had never attributed these &quot;traits&quot; as part of the depression itself, but as part of my &quot;unusual history.&quot; While hard to explain to the &quot;average&quot; and &quot;normal&quot;, someone who has undergone the misery of depression would surely find resonance and comfort in Karp's remarkable work.Lastly, I would recommend not digesting this book DURING a visit to the abyss as it is a bit heady (and usually concentration is a HUGE ISSUE at those times), but definitely read it after the bright lights turn on again."},{"Title":"Speaking of Sadness: Depression, Disconnection, and the Meanings of Illness","review":"Karp is a sociologist who examines depression from a cultural point of view. Folks looking for a &quot;quick cure&quot; are not likely to be satisfied with this particular outing. However, folks looking to understand how society views those with depression, how folks with depression view society, and how the illness can also impact family members ... this is the place to go. I read this book as part of a medical anthropology curriculum ... an ethnography of an illness ... and found it to be quite enlightening. I have been in and out of treatment for depression myself over the years, and finding that so many people had similar experiences of reconstructing their self-view as a result of the illness was quite useful. Again, this book is definitely not a &quot;quick fix&quot; or &quot;feel good&quot; kind of book ... it's one that looks at the nitty-gritty of one of the country's most prevalent illnesses and examines the minutiae therein."},{"Title":"Speaking of Sadness: Depression, Disconnection, and the Meanings of Illness","review":"I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE NOT ONLY REFRESHING IN THAT IT DOESN'T MAKE EMPTY PROMISES, BUT ALSO UNUSUALLY SENSITIVE IN THAT IT CONVEYS TO BOTH THE DEPRESSED AND THEIR LOVED ONES THE SENTIMENTS OF AN &quot;ALTERED REALITY&quot; THAT ONLY A DEPRESSION SUFFERER CAN KNOW. THIS BOOK WAS EXTRAORDINARILY HUMANISTIC, WHICH UNFORTUNATELY SEEMS TO BE THE EXCEPTION IN AN ALL-TOO CARELESS SOCIETY. (KARP UNDERSTANDS THIS TO BE THE CASE AS HE SO SKILLFULLY DEMONSTRATES THROUGH HIS WRITING.) I AM GRATEFUL TO SUCH AN AUTHOR THAT RE-ESTABLISHES A PERSON'S HUMANITY AS A PRIORITY, REGARDLESS OF OVERSIMPLIFIED LABELING THAT OFTEN EVEN FURTHER DIMISHES A DEPRESSED PERSON'S GENERAL CREDIBILITY (NOT TO MENTION THE VALIDITY OF THEIR ANGUISH) WITH FAMILY, FRIENDS, AND EVEN MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. I ESPECIALLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE WHO IS SICK TO DEATH OF CASUALLY BEING ASKED THE CLUELESS QUESTION &quot;SO, WHY ARE YOU DEPRESSED?&quot; HAND THEM THIS BOOK SO THEY CAN BE FURTHER EDUCATED NOT JUST ABOUT THE COMPLEXITY OF DEPRESSION AND ITS &quot;CAUSES&quot;, BUT OF THE HUMAN CONDITION IN ITS ENTIRITY."},{"Title":"Speaking of Sadness: Depression, Disconnection, and the Meanings of Illness","review":"The best book I've read on depression. Makes you realise that there's no magic medicine and that the illness will always be there - a fact I've found it difficult to come to terms with. Still he goes further and says how you have to live with this. No magic solutions, which, in my opinion, made it much more helpful than any book that promises to help you instantly overcome depression by simply being more cheerful."},{"Title":"Speaking of Sadness: Depression, Disconnection, and the Meanings of Illness","review":"As other reviewers mention, this book is a refreshing change from many self-help books on depression. The perspective is totally different, as the author is a sociologist instead of a health care professional. It reads more like a scholarly study than a self-help book.The book's realistic approach can be a little harsh for the unsuspecting reader. The author helped me to come to terms with the fact that depression is a long term condition, however, he did not give me much hope for living a better life. This book may help you find self-acceptance but it definitely won't cheer you up."},{"Title":"Speaking of Sadness: Depression, Disconnection, and the Meanings of Illness","review":"David Karp's book on depression is written in beautifully simple prose. His own battle with depression is interwoven throughout the stories of others, and the humanity and gentleness with which he portrays both speaks of a generosity of vision which preserves the sanctity of each person's story. There's no sociological-ese to distract from the stories, which is a delight for someone who- though an academic- tires of its exclusionary language. The courage it took to write this book-- as it is a &quot;coming out&quot; book of sorts-- is extraordinary, and that thought rests in the back of your mind as you read it, gathering inspirational power. As someone who has struggled with depression throughout my life, I felt a &quot;resonance&quot; with the souls represented in this book which at times had me in tears. Highly recommended-- both for those suffering from depression as well as academics."},{"Title":"Speaking of Sadness: Depression, Disconnection, and the Meanings of Illness","review":"I found the descriptions of depression by other sufferers to be extremely helpful. To hear them echo the same feelings that I have felt makes me realize the emotions that have been churning inside of me are symptoms of an illness, not the reality of my situation. However, I couldn't help but feel that the overall tone of the book is skewed by the author's own chronic battle with depression. There is a hopelessness to the book that I have not found in other books, and I found that frankly, depressing. The experiences of the author and those interviewed in the book are quite different than my experience with depression, and those of my many friends who have suffered from it. My friends and I got better, and most of them have lived for years, even decades, without depression. I therefore don't view depression as something that cripples one for life, rather as an illness that strikes for a while, and in most cases goes away. Furthermore, medications DID work on my friends and I, unlike those in the book.I found Kathy Cronkite's book On The Edge of Darkness to be a much more balanced presentation of depression. No, depression is not something that is easily conquered, even by medication. But it can indeed be conquered, and that is something that it is essential for all sufferers to know."},{"Title":"Speaking of Sadness: Depression, Disconnection, and the Meanings of Illness","review":"This is a scholarly but very readable study of the meanings we attach to the term &quot;depression,&quot; written by a sociologist who has struggled with depression himself. Karp emphasizes that as bad as the disease itself is the stigma that society attaches to it, and the shame that we sufferers feel. There is also a very thoughtful and balanced examination of the issues involved in &quot;medicalizing&quot; a condition like depression which has its medical aspects but cannot ultimately be explained as an imbalance of neurotransmitters."},{"Title":"Speaking of Sadness: Depression, Disconnection, and the Meanings of Illness","review":"After reading many, many books dealing with the subject of depression, it was heartening to find &quot;Speaking of Sadness&quot;. I had never before read anything that described so accurately how it actually feels to suffer from depression. It's not only worth reading if you are the sufferer, but it's the only book I've recommended to my family in order that they might understand -- just a little bit -- what depression has felt like to me"},{"Title":"Speaking of Sadness: Depression, Disconnection, and the Meanings of Illness","review":"Thid book was great. After several years of suffering from depression I have finally found a book that relates to me. It was as if the author knew me so well. I would recommend this book to anyone in search of beginning a new life. As well as finding something to relate to this book was so interesting a real turn pager I couldn't put the book down."},{"Title":"Speaking of Sadness: Depression, Disconnection, and the Meanings of Illness","review":"I have read so many books on this topic, and this book is, hands down, the best I've read. It isn't overly-clinical, and lets the reader see what this illness is all about through the experiences of fifty depressed people from all walks of life, how they cope, experience with medications, therapists, and how this devastating illness has affected their lives. The author also has an edge in writing this material, as he suffers from depression as well, and shares his own experiences in coping. Insightful, thoughtfully written, it is a must read for depressives, and the people who love them."},{"Title":"Speaking of Sadness: Depression, Disconnection, and the Meanings of Illness","review":"Professor Karp combines the art of a sociologist with the wisdom of a man who has been there. His book offers riveting stories that will captivate the reader, as well as a brilliant analysis of how depressed people come to understand and make sense of their condition. Whether you have known depression or not, you will come away from this book with profound new insight about the meaning of the human condition and how to live in a world of suffering."},{"Title":"Speaking of Sadness: Depression, Disconnection, and the Meanings of Illness","review":"Karp's case studies will help the reader understand the stages of depression, how friends and family are affected by depression, how depressives interact with therapists/psychiatrists/medicine, how depression can be incorporated into life therefore adapting to it (since his stance throughout the book is that depression does not go away no matter how hard it is fought), why depression is so hard to talk about (i.e. inchoate feelings), why support groups are so important, and how keeping depression hidden can cause nervous breakdowns (impression management). He repeats himself somewhat, has fairly stilted prose and is too thorough with his introduction and conclusion style in every chapter. Overall, however, if you suffer from depression, and don't have a support group as a resource (or even if you do have a support group) this book will help you understand that you are not alone in your illness and what your options in dealing with it are (yes, there are options). 50 people cannot all be wrong, and the synergy of their experience is to the reader's benefit."},{"Title":"Speaking of Sadness: Depression, Disconnection, and the Meanings of Illness","review":"Professor Karp combines the art of a sociologist and the wisdom and compassion of a man who has been there. Anyone who has experienced depression or been close to someone depressed will be riveted by the stories told in this work. Karp not only allows depressed people to tell their own stories but offers a brilliantly illuminating analysis of how people come to understand themselves and their condition. Karp does not peddle any easy solutions, but the reader will come away with profound new insights about how to make sense of mental illness and live in a world full of suffering."},{"Title":"Speaking of Sadness: Depression, Disconnection, and the Meanings of Illness","review":"I am reading this book after a bout of severe depression and it is wonderful to help process the experience.

Mr. Kapphas written a self help book whether intentional or not. To seethe stages of depression from first occurrence to adaptation laidout is something I had not seen or heard in the ten years I havebattled this disorder. However I have lived it. To be able to say\\"this is me\\" to a book is an incredible \\"self help\\". We are notalone. Thank You"},{"Title":"Speaking of Sadness: Depression, Disconnection, and the Meanings of Illness","review":"This book lays out the (in my opinion, correct) case that only those who have personally suffered from depression can thoroughly understand or put into words its prolonged, life-consuming grip on the victim. Some might complain it offers little hope, but that's not what someone who has suffered from it most of their life needs to hear anyway. They need to hear that this state of being isn't their fault and that others endure the same mental anguish. Possibly ways to mitigate the symptoms can be explored...but a complete cure is elusive for whatever reason and it's best to not hold out for or put others through false hope for one. I particularly recommend this book to the \\"intelligent depressed\\" who have because of the illness struggled to get by, or had aspirations dashed entirely. It can offer closure and self-acceptance. I'd even suggest lending it to relatives who give you a hard time cause they just don't get why someone can't get out of bed, or never shows improved moods.Unlike short-term or cyclical depression brought on by specific events, for example death of a loved one, most of the 50 subjects are clearly in it for the long haul. Their improvement is negligible, and after countless therapists and prescriptions and even hospitalization, they often evoke nothing but contempt for the medical establishment. Who can blame them? Really though, it's quite difficult for others including therapists to relate, which is why I've found the personal testimonies and the author's insights far more useful than anyone else has been. It can be inspiring at times, such as the few interviewees who found ways to turn their morbid existence into creative outlets, or discovered some greater appreciation for the human struggle. In the end it's hard to not root for all of them to somehow emerge from this malaise."},{"Title":"Speaking of Sadness: Depression, Disconnection, and the Meanings of Illness","review":"This book contains a clinical look at depression. This book defines depression, symptoms, medications, etc. During the author's research, clinical trials were performed and the subject's responses are included in the reading. This book was a slow read and it was hard to identify with it."},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"When you're in the training, read this. Otherwise you just won't get it.

Kudos to those of you who have the 2nd generation Meisner teachers (those who ACTUALLY studied with Sandy, and aren't just making the stuff up). This is a great tool"},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"Unlike Stanislavsky's &quot;emotional recall,&quot; Meisner's approach is much more effective. Having been trained under Mr. Meisner's method, my confidence and emotional accessibility has increased 100%. In short, I've accepted his creed, &quot;to live truthfully under the imaginary circumstances of the theater,&quot; as my own."},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"This is different from other acting books in that the reader learns the technique through following the process of students in thier first year with Meisner. He never gives any direct, step-by-step, this-is-how-we-learn-to-act instruction. You have to be patient enough to follow the story and mine the diamonds for yourself. I found a few useful tidbits to add to my technique, but many of Meisner's tools don't work for me, for I'm an Adler girl at heart; however, I have also found it useful to understand the process of my colleagues who use Meisner's technique."},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"I read this book in anticipation, hoping that he would inspire his actors. I found Meisner to be condescending and quite negative. Like another reader's review, I just couldn't finish the book. The impression I got from the book, is that Meisner is an emotionally, psychologically unstable person. He seemed to be a person who had serious problems and taking it out on his students. His technique may work for some. Personally, I have found \\"other techniques\\" more useful and helpful. I suggest \\"The Chubbuck Technique\\" by Ivana Chubbuck or \\"How to Stop Acting\\" by Harold Guskin."},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"Thank God that I bought this book at a very low price through one of the retailers. Because it was horrible. I only read about half-way through the book because it was very painful. I felt a lot of the infomation he taught was very repetitive. It all depends on what you want, I just didn't like his whole process and learning techniques, they were driving me nuts. But I never took a meisner-technique class. But I wonder, the only way this technique works if you have a partner. What if you're doing a one-man show, or practicing a monologue. I just know that I never got an emotional connection with this book.

This book can benefit someone new to acting as well as a individuals with acting experience. The book goes through each lesson from the beginning of his course and gives instructions for exercises to guide the actor toward a progression of more and more complex acting problems. Ultimately the goal here is to have his students understand how a sound technique can help them to experience a deeper level of expression. His method also guides the student work toward a more truthful and meaningful development of character ."},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"I couldn't even finish this book. Meisner makes acting (acting school in this case) sound like an absolute nightmare!The book's setting is an acting school, where he is (supposedly) training students to be actors. Instead, he keeps letting students go despite their dedication to their craft, and deciding for them they just \\"aren't cut out to be actors\\".While I thought some of his insight on acting was helpful (living truthfully under given imaginary circumstances); I found the book negative, condescending, and discouraging. Awful, actually. There are much better books about acting."},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"Of course, no single acting technique can be right for every aspiring performer, but I must say that I personally found Meisner's book to be condescending and ineffective. The author seems to subtract the most essential aspects of art from the process of creating a character: imagination, creativity, and humanity. These are the trademarks of my &quot;technique.&quot; Like any art, performing is 2% inspiration and 98% perspiration. I am a good actor, but not because of this book. Hard work, dedication, practice, and sheer will power make an actor believable."},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"i couldn't finish this book. meisner's negative energy just got to me. now, i'll grant you, he's probably a great acting teacher, perhaps the best, but what is he really teaching people how to do? he says it's how to become deeply vulnerable, to really get to their core emotional stuff...but for what purpose? i just got a really bad feeling about this guy's energy, the feeling that he's a disturbed person acting out his own childhood traumas on his pupils, over whom he wields a huge amount of power through his authority.i thought to myself while reading this that if meisner is the best (and i wouldn't doubt that he is), i never want to become an actor.i'd rather just live my life...and when i do get to my emotional core issues, it's not to exploit them for better acting, but for my own personal growth...as a person."},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"The fact that this book consists of nothing but dialogue between Sanford Meisner and his students is what makes Meisner's theory come through loud and clear, and makes the book a pleasure to read. Some may find it hard to follow because it's not in the form of traditional textbooks or books on acting - I find that the dialogue form makes it EASIER to understand what Meisner is trying to convey.You can't learn acting by reading a book. You have to learn it by DOING it or at least observing it. As you read this book, you feel like you're sitting in on Meisner's class at the Neighborhood Playhouse. You feel like you're observing the students as they go through Meisner's exercises. You find that questions pop into your head as you read, and those same questions are asked on the next page by the students and answered clearly by Meisner. You get a feel for how he interacted with his students. No doubt, Meisner was tough on his students. He didn't take anyone's BS or excuses. He wanted to turn his students into good actors - and you can't get better without a teacher who's hard on you and sees through the fascades and barriers you put up. You need to be broken down and rebuilt. Meisner wanted his students to let go of their inhibitions and let it all out; let themselves out. You can't accomplish that with a teacher who babies you.As far as Meisner's theory and technique goes - as an aspiring actress, I think it really hits home. The basis of his theory is that you should focus on what your fellow actor in the scene is doing, and react truthfully and spontaneously based on what you sense - as opposed to being in your head and trying to force emotions inside yourself as you're playing the scene. Meisner aims to get you out of your head, and into what's happening around you moment by moment. It's the most accurate, practical, and learnable theory on acting I have ever come across. As you learn it, you get that eerie feeling that you've hit upon the truth.Overall, I think this book is the best way to understand Meisner's theory short of actually taking a class based on his technique."},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"I love this book is very unique in that it makes one feel like he/she is in the classroom, so it's very stimulating, highly reccommended."},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"I would recommend reading this book, although not before reading Stanislavski's trilogy.This book contains much useful advice, but is confusing in places. Meisner is much easier to learn with a teacher, and some of the techniques and exercises described in the book are difficult or impossible to practice on your own.In spite of this, I would still recommend this book as an introduction to the Meisner technique, which I think that all actors should be familiar with."},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"Mr. Meisner's book should be in your collection if you are a serious student..on the Mt Rushmore of acting teachers he would be right up there with Hagen, Adler, Stanislavsky and Strasberg. Meisner goes beyond the 'method' to what are the greatest tools you can bring to any performance...listen and react...listen and react..if you master the first the reaction will come naturally..but the first is the most difficult for any beginning actor..you might think you're listening but chances are you're not.."},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"I had anticipated being as excited about this book as I was about Harold Guskin's \\"How to Stop Acting,\\" but Dennis Longwell's \\"you are there\\" approach to capturing Meisner and his technique is almost impenetrable and, worse, reveals an unbearable egotist - preening, dismissive, often cruel to his students. This was baffling considering the gushing comments on the back cover.I read 2/3 of the book and couldn't finish it. It was too painful. I hope the students Meisner dismissed from class (and humiliated in the process) had enough sense of their own ability to continue acting.I strongly recommend Guskin's book instead."},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"I had signed up for a short series of classes and completed the series utterly befuddled. It was not until I read this book that I realized that the instructor had been attempting to teach based on the principles of Meisner.

The narrator takes you through a series of classes with Sanford Meisner - describing how he presented various exercises, his students' questions, their responses to the exercises and, finally, what Mr. Meisner was attempting to achieve through these exercises. The book provides you with an excellent overview of both the Meisner principles of acting, as well as an insight into the character of Mr. Meisner and what it would have been like to take a class with him. This book was not only informative; it was also...dare I say it..entertaining!"},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"i've been studying the Meisner Technique for two years now, and without this book I would be lost.

The DVD demonstrated how effective Meisner's teaching method was for the young actors in his class. It left me wanting to learn more about the techniques he taught. The book did help in that regard, however I can't imagine just reading the book without having seen his techniques in action. The man succeeded in drawing out truthful emotions from his students. What seemed like silly exercises somehow worked in making his students really listen to each other and respond truthfully, without \\"acting\\". What a shame Meisner is no longer with us. I wish I had been able to take his class."},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"This excellent book is an edited transcript of an actual studio class, recorded during one of Sanford Meisner's two-year studio sessions. The reader begins at the beginning and tracks this group through the major phases of training, while getting to read Meisner's own words, and those of his students. If one already knows something about acting techniques and even Meisner, this book deepens and develops that understanding right from the horse's mouth; it charms and provokes myriad thoughts about the art of acting. It's awesome. However, if one is looking for an introduction to the \\"Meisner Technique\\" or to any other technique that branches from Stanislavski or The Group Theater, this book is too advanced -- and even somewhat opaque at times -- because it takes for granted certain underlying concepts and vocabulary."},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"I was fortunate to have met Sanford Meisner, and was trained extensively by his favorite teacher, Freddy Kareman, at Carnegie Hall Studios in New York, in 1985-86. This book, in addition to the excellent Sydney Pollack documentary, \\"Sanford Meisner: The Theatre's Best Kept Secret\\", are two of the best resources for understanding Meisner's approach. The course of study of the Meisner technique MUST be experienced to be learned properly. It is not something that can be learned from a book. It requires much consistent practice (which actors are usually too lazy to accomplish). But this book is a detailed journey through the process of learning how to act truthfully from your instincts, instead of from your head. It is easy to read, and puts you right in the middle of classroom work with the master teacher himself."},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"I was asked to read this book, prior to attending an introductory class on the Meisner acting method.

Sanford Meisner, one of the members of the famed Group Theatre in the 1920's, was one of American theatre's gems, and sitting in on a course of his, through this book, is the only way to capture some of that magic.

The book is mostly compiled of verbatim notes from Sandy's class, so reading it you feel like you are auditing an acting class. Your craft is not necessarily going to improve just by reading, but I found his teachings and philosophy inspiring for sure. So it's worth the read.

The books were by Anne Bogart and others who wrote about techniques that are not the Method. I thought that I would get a Meisner book because I thought it would be good to get to know some of the history of acting... and Meisner was certainly important historically. I saw this book as a sort of \\"eat your vegetables\\". So, I left it for the last book of the bunch that I read...... and it turned out to be WONDERFUL!This book is INCREDIBLY not dryly written. It is SO interesting to read. It is written as a series of reports on a class that Meisner was teaching, so you get to follow along and learn the Method with his class and see where Meisner is coming from on his beliefs on the Method. The writing style is really interesting and easy to read because Meisner's speech is really interesting.This book is WONDERFUL!"},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"I am currently studying the craft of acting at one of the 3 year professional acting acadamies here in LA. I very much enjoyed reading this book and have done so at this point several times. I would most highly recommend it to anyone thinking about or currently studying the craft of acting.In the first chapter (Setting The Scene: Duse's Blush), we are giving a chronology of Meisners life and how he came to be such a great and beloved teacher. It is also in this first chapter that Meisner recounts the story of Elenora Duse, a legendary Italian actress who played the role of Magda in Hermann Sundermanns Heimat. In the first scene of this play, as the story goes, she is a young girl that has an affair with a guy from the same village, and she has a child by him. Twenty-five years later, or thereabouts, she comes back to visit her family who live in this town, and her ex-lover comes to call on her. She accepts his flowers and they sit and talk. All of a sudden the actor realizes that she is blushing, and it gets so bad that she drops her head and hides her face in embarrassment. Although we learn that this does not happen every performance, it is this blush that is the epitome of living truthfully under imaginary circumstances. This is Meisners definition of all good acting.The foundation of acting, is the reality of doing. It is this basic premise that is the spine of this book of exercises intended to bring the actor closer to their emotional self. It is an approach that is based on bringing the actor away from the intellectualizing of character analysis back to his emotional impulses and to acting that is firmly rooted in the instinctive. Through preparation, the actor is bought to a full state of emotional aliveness for those first precious moments on the stage at the beginnings of any scene. It would be impossible to escape the powerful impact of emotion or the importance of being able to realize and use effectively this impact in your performance.Once those first precious moments of emotional aliveness that the actor has prepared for have elapsed however, the actor must be willing to enter into a state of, what Constantine Stanislovsky refers to as public solitude (as opposed to public exhibitionism). A complete surrendering of ego and willingness to make oneself vulnerable to the ultimate revealing of truth in who we are in the context of the words and circumstance written and demanded of the actor by the playwright.Everything in acting is, of course, a kind of heightened intensified reality but it is based on one that is fully justified. Good acting isn't just the emotionless reciting of lines of text as mindless chatter. It is responding truthfully to the other person or persons on the stage. To fill words with the truth of your emotional life Meisner suggest that you must learn text coldly without expression in a completely neutral way. This learning should than be taken further through repetition mixed with a distracting independent activity. It is this repetition coupled with a distracting independent activity that takes the actor out of the intellectual mind into that of the of instinctual. That is, not thinking but simply acting and reacting honestly to what's happening on stage in every moment. But again, in order to get out of your head and into the emotional life of the instinctual, you have to know the lines so well that you don't even have to consciously think about them. As the logic goes; if you don't know your lines cold you can not get to the emotions. If you can't get to the emotions than you are nowhere near the heart of your instincts and can therefore not act or react honestly. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Learn lines and pick up impulses. This is what Meisner suggest is crucial if you are to always be in the moment of a scene honestly and most importantly, realistically. It is the truth of your instincts that is the very root of the foundation from which you must build not only your character, but also all of the honest emotional actions and reactions asked of you on stage. Living the emotional life of the character truthfully under imaginary circumstances. It is this emotional honesty and openness that will most profoundly move you and the audience for the enjoyment of you both."},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"I agree... Sandford Meisner is by far one of the best kept secrets in acting. I stuided the Meisner Technique approach to acting with the wonderful Rachael Adler and it has absolutely changed me. Not just my acting but my life as well. This is a MUST HAVE for ANY actor. Whether this technique is right for you or not, the information you will get from this book will most defenitely help you understand what makes good acting."},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"I did a 1/2 semester project on Meisner's acting techniques for an acting class (we had to compare and contrast another technique with the Stanislavski technique most of us are familiar with). at the conservatory I attend, and found this book answered just about all my questions. It was an interesting read, but from a research standpoint, would have been easier to use had it not been in journal style. However, I have come acrossed nothing better as a resource exclusively dealing with Meisner. Read something about the Group Theatre as well, which may just lead to study of some techniques of some of Meisner's contemporaries and help you to combine styles to find your own unique approach to the art."},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"I would have to say that this is one of the best books on acting around. Although I am too young to have ever studied with Meisner, I am a student of his technique, and I think that this book helps give you a brief insight into what this extraordinary man had in mind. He professes a no nonsense approach to acting, &quot;The reality of doing,&quot; that will truly benefit an aspiring artist. Meisner's belief of actually feeling something as opposed to faking something seems self evident, but was revolutionary for his time. Why substitute a response, when you can actually experience the emotion. If you are supposed to be angry actually get angry, don't fake angry. I do however have to agree with the other reviewers in saying that a book is no substitute to actually finding a good teacher with a good core group of students to work through the technique. You come to acting through feeling it, not intellectualizing it. In that you need to actually do it to feel it. It takes a long time, a lot of discipline and perserverance, but it is an extremely rewarding pursuit. The book helps as a guide post, but it is by no means that road that you will need to travel to develop your art.As with any great teacher, Meisner's lessons can be applied to more than just the subject material. There are several Life's Lessons in this book, and I would even recommend it to people who are not actors or students of theater."},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"Since I studied with Sandy for two years at the Neighborhood Playhouse and continued to study with him in his private class after I graduated from the Playhouse, I believe that I can speak with some authority. The book that Dennis Longwell has edited does an admirable job of describing the organic process of learning to act. Please note that reading is not a substitute for &quot;the reality of doing.&quot;Sandy was an extraordinary pragmatist and a man of deep sensitivity. However, he was unsentimental; astringent; and gifted with a wonderfully mordaunt sense of humor. He once said, &quot;I like to think that I prepare artists to survive in a world that doesn't always want them.&quot; In a way, he was preparing his students for battle. If he was tough, he did so only in order to be kind. Personally, I really liked him and I always think of him with real affection. Learning from him personally was a privilege and an honor.All in all, he was one of the most extraordinary people whom I have ever known, as well as one of the most influential. In a field all too often occupied by charlatans, he took a stand against pseudo-intellectuality and some self syled amateur psychiatrists posing as men and women of the theatre. His close friends included Harold Clurman and Stella Adler, whose influence he never failed to credit.Sandy didn't live in an ivory tower, or teach in some backwater college. He was truly a man of the theatre, with more than 30 Broadway credits. In fact, he was a very good actor. You can see for yourself in the 1958 movie THE STORY ON PAGE ONE, written and directed by his close friend, Clifford Odets.If you aspire to be an actor, you can get an idea from this book of what is involved in learning the Meisner Technique. Sandy had no &quot;b.s.&quot; He cut right to the heart of the matter. There is no technique that will give you acting talent if nature has failed to provide it. On the other hand, if you have talent it will take dedication and hard work in order to learn how to use it well.If you are an American, forget about reading Stanislavski. The Hapgood translations are terrible. They leave out nearly half of what he wrote. Furthermore, Stanislavski belonged to a time and culture so remote from our own lives that you can waste years trying to understand him. Instead, read Sandy Meisner, Stella Adler, Robert Lewis, and Harold Clurman. There's no &quot;b.s.&quot; in it. Then you will actually need to study. Hopefully, you will find someone whom Sandy actually trained as an actor and teacher!"},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"this is a good book with some good points to make. if one has any experience with the meisner technique it might even be very helpful. unfortunatly, i have never had any training in meisner and found the book hard to follow and uninteresting. there were some good basic lessons and anecdotes sprinkled throughout, but with out knowing first hand about the exercises i got very little out of reading about the experiences and exercises of the students. i would not recommend this to actors who have not taken at least some basic meisner classes."},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"sanford meisner on acting was recommended to me by my first meisner teacher five years ago. I had done a lot of local theatre before and wanted to improve my technique. This book not only enhanced my study of the technique but has become an often used, well worn reference guide. The technique not only made me a better actor, but i have become a much more effective communicator in my \\"real\\" life. It is a wonderful thing to feel as if you are truly \\"present\\" and \\"in the moment\\" when you are onstage. Meisner teaches better than anyone else that \\"acting is reacting\\". A great read for anyone (not just actors) wanting to increase their communication skills."},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"This book is a very good introduction to Meisner's work. As one of the other reviewers said it would be best to do this while studying in a class setting (can you imagine doing the word repition game by yourself?). The thing that's always impressed me about Meisner's work is that you won't find anything like it anywhere else. Strasberg was influenced by mainly by Stanislavsky's early work and Adler was influenced by his later work. Meisner took influences from everywhere (Michael Chekhov, Duse, etc.) and synthesized them into something all his own. This is one, I believe,of only four books on his approach to acting so this is as close to the source as you're going to get!(Meisner passed away in 1996). Buy the book!"},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"this is an extremely helpful and insightful book, especially if you've already been exposed to meisner's technique. I don't know how helpful it would be if you haven't been in some meisner technique classes. But, as acting books go, this is one of the best I've ever read. It has detailed examinations of scene work by Meisner himself and includes some telling conversations with his assistant. If you want to see Meisner act you can rent the movie &quot;Mikey and Nicky&quot; starring John Cassavetes and Peter Falk. Meisner has a couple of scenes and, although he doesn't have much to do in the picture, it's fun to see these legendary teachers on film. If you read this and want some more exposure to this technique, Larry Silverberg has a series of books on the Meisner Technique. They're extremely in depth and informative with lots of exercises."},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"Sanford Meisner brings every actor who genuinely wants to stretch and bring stellar performances the wisdom to do so in this profound book.The definition of acting is \\"living truthfully under imaginary circumstances\\" which I learned from this book, along with top training at Playhouse West in North Hollywood, CA, where this book was required reading.Emotional preparation is crucial, BEING the character, and taking all focus off of you, while you react genuinely to the other person's movements, words, gestures, and actions moment by moment.If you are serious about your acting career, this is the one book that will provide solid ground, which must accompany solid training and steady practice.

I do wonder how much someone would get out of it without concurrently, or at least previously taking a Meisner class, but I'm sure you'd at least get some great bits and pieces.But, as an actor, I didn't know how much I didn't know until reading this book!

This book will become a good reference tool. 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"This book offers much insight to meisner's technique and his own teaching style, as it is given directly by him. Because it's written as a third-person master class, it isn't very direct at times, but the benefits of this book greatly outweigh that. I particularly liked that Meisner includes brief personal moments and thoughts from his life outside the classroom in every chapter and you can truly see how he feels about each student's progress. I also feel this book is a very good companion to the DVD \\"Sanford Meisner Master Class.\\" I wouldn't recommend this to someone completely new to the Meisner technique, but it is very helpful to those who want to look farther into it."},{"Title":"Sanford Meisner on Acting","review":"Thank you for sending this SO quickly.

It outlines his life as a Reporter and how different the reporter is today as it was then. I really loved the book as it detailed the life of him as a reporter in the days when newspapers were the main source of information. He is a credit to his family and his father before him, Gene Fowler."},{"Title":"Reporters: Memoirs of a Young Newspaperman","review":"This is an excellent book, highly recommended for writers, journalists or media of any kind.

Is he still with us ??? ... because I want to tell him personally how much I enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Troubleshooting the Cast","review":"Ed Jaworowski clearly explains why my cast sometimes falls apart and sometimes works well. In &quot;Trouble Shooting the Cast&quot; he demonstrates a thorough understanding of the mechanics of fly-casting and goes from there to clearly pinpoint common casting mistakes. He has done his homework well. Jaworowski identifies and analyzes over 30 common casting problems and gives clear and concise explanations for their underlying causes. He explains the relationships between one problem and another. After dealing with the fundamentals of fly-casting, Jaworowski addresses special problem areas such as casting in the wind and casting shooting heads and weighted flies and leaders.After studying &quot;Trouble Shooting the Cast,&quot; I find that I starting to be able to dissect my (and other's) casting mistakes by just analyzing the movement of the fly line. For instance, Jaworowski clearly explains that line oscillations in my forward cast meant I had slack in the backcast or that the end of my fly line curves to the left or right because I had misdirected hand motion at the last instant of the forward cast. Now I am able to analyze each cast and know what I need to do to correct the problem.The illustrations in the book are barely adequate, and could be a lot better. Actual photographs contrasting the correct and incorrect casting technique might have helped.I agree with Lefty Kreh's assessment that Ed Jaworowski is the best fly casting instructor around."},{"Title":"Troubleshooting the Cast","review":"It's too bad that a book like this has to be written. Ed teaches the best method of fly casting there is, so if you read the first four pages and -> practice &lt;- what he teaches, you'll rarely experience the 32 problems that he writes about in the rest of the book.If you insist on using an inferior casting method and are having problems, this book is the next best thing to Ed being at your side showing what's wrong and teaching what's right."},{"Title":"Troubleshooting the Cast","review":"This was just the book I was looking for when I had been fly fishing for a while but started running into problems with my cast. This book anticipated all of them and provides easy solutions. Some casting books make it difficult to picture what they're doing with the rod, even with pictures. &quot;Troubleshooting the Cast&quot; lays it out clearly. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Troubleshooting the Cast","review":"Ed Jaworowski's \\"Troubleshooting the Cast\\" is the most valuable (and nearly the least expensive) book in my rather substantial collection of flyfishing books. Since I bought it a few years ago I've advised everyone who has asked me about flyfishing to buy this book the same day they buy their first flyrod - or sooner. Even the most impatient person in The Republic would cherish this book because - whatever is going wrong with your cast - you can find it and fix it with this book in a matter of minutes. Once the flyboy (or flygirl) has used this book enough they will be able to \\"read the line\\" and knowing what's falling apart and how to correct it starts to become second-nature. Jaworowski's book makes it downright EASY."},{"Title":"Troubleshooting the Cast","review":"This book is written and organized in a very direct efficient manner. It's not written to be read from cover to cover. Let's say you are practicing your overhand cast and you see that the end of the fly line and leader is curling to the left after each cast. What to do? Look into the table of contents for the problem. Read the answer. Apply the solution and when corrected, put the book back on the shelf.I had a problem with my casts collapsing in a series of bends after I cast the line. Looked up the problem, not enough power, thought about the answer given. It worked.While the book is not a one for one substitute for a certified casting instructor, it's absolutely great for those mornings while your significant other still sleeps and you are in the back yard getting a few practice casts in while having your coffee."},{"Title":"Troubleshooting the Cast","review":"Ed show us what we need \\"to do\\" and what is wrong , what is the cause that ruins good cast.Excelent high level instructions.

There are many fly-casting books available but none are better."},{"Title":"Troubleshooting the Cast","review":"Ed Jaworowski has written a very user-friendly book on how to diagnose and correct common fly-casting problems. He explains problems and how to correct them in terms that even a beginner can understand. He also assures us that we do not have to have a \\"model\\" casting technique. I take Ed's book with me when I go on fly fishing trips to use as a resource if I am having problems. I highly recommend his books.Rick WolfFt Worth, TX"},{"Title":"Gore Vidal: Sexually Speaking: Collected Sex Writings 1960-1998","review":"Great for people who haven't read the essays before. Vidal rules the psycho-sociological TAKE on historical relevance in today's \\"situations\\".....or \\"acts,\\" if you prefer. He knows where to provide the JUICE in each issue and has a backlog of great lit & history that helps swirl the goodies with great authority. Who knows what he's up to. ARe the days of cruisin for boys over, or does he resort to the South American tradition of \\"little boys'\\" parties. I seriously doubt it, but it would be funny. The book CRADLE OF EROTICA by Kinsey & Masters (Kinsey's ghost name is Allan Edwardes) is a great side book to have along the ride. Unfortunately he \\"peppers\\"(a word he humiliates in the essays) the good stuff with opinions on population control. Hell, the supply of young nubile boys enjoyed by the literary elite would certainly go down if his ideas were to be applied!!!Anyways, Vidal could write more of this good stuff, but his grumblin' needs to get the TRUTH out prevents it. That's fine, but that just requires his reading public to savor every word, if ya ask a true fan."},{"Title":"Gore Vidal: Sexually Speaking: Collected Sex Writings 1960-1998","review":"This collection of Vidal's essays (and a few interviews) on sex and sexuality is both timely and welcome, since, as he states, sex is never far from public consciousness in the ever-repressed U.S.A. Essays like &quot;Sex is Politics&quot; are as fresh today as they were when first published, and is there another writer alive with a more authentic knowledge of American history and a more genuine understanding of American culture and political thought? I think not. Combine these assets with, as always, exqusite writing, and you have one utterly irresistible book.Contrary to what certain &quot;gender absolutists&quot; would have us all think, Vidal's opinions on sexuality are more trenchant than ever before at a time when more men and women are transgressing the false boundaries of gender to explore sex with whoever we please. This collection is a happy defiance of those who would try to neatly categorize all of us based on our sexual acts or even our preferences (a difficult feat indeed when one considers women like me, who perform with men acts that might be considered, ahem, decidedly queer...)"},{"Title":"Gore Vidal: Sexually Speaking: Collected Sex Writings 1960-1998","review":"It is axiomatic that Gore Vidal has long been one of the more underrated American literary masters of the 20th century. It is brilliant compilations like SEXUALLY SPEAKING that do battle with this oversight. Not often do books emerge that contain such wit, history and a chilling timeliness, that can be both enlightening and serve as a puckish summer read. The supplemental commentary is piercing, poignant and vulgar. This is the book that archeologists will dig up in two hundred years, to see how sexual identity in the 20th century was both confused and triumphant"},{"Title":"Gore Vidal: Sexually Speaking: Collected Sex Writings 1960-1998","review":"... Environmental Consciousness, Political Awareness and generally not succumbing to the mindless morass of pedestrian thought and values -- which are neither thought-through nor truly valuable. Gore Vidal's compiled essays on sexuality -- both in terms of the act as well as gender and sexual orientation -- is an invaluable comfort to anyone whose rejection of \\"The American Dream\\" has been met with resistance and criticism.Read Vidal, and then remember that being who you are is more important than succumbing to who other people try to convince you to be."},{"Title":"Gore Vidal: Sexually Speaking: Collected Sex Writings 1960-1998","review":"&quot;Sexually Speaking&quot; in these times is risky business, as Clinton, Starr, Lewinsky, and Tripp et al have more than shown us.

No. Illuminating? Yes. Funny? Hell yes! Pounding down the nails of repression and hypocrisy, Vidal arms us all with intellectual firepower and in the process unlocks one more shackle, much to the dismay of those who would not have it that way... you all know who you are.A brave work."},{"Title":"Gore Vidal: Sexually Speaking: Collected Sex Writings 1960-1998","review":"An excellent collection of Vidal pieces on sexuality which made for an interesting afternoon's read. Some reservations, however: why is a dry memoir of Eleanor Roosevelt included here when there is nothing within the essay that touches upon her sexuality? It is little more than a fond remembrance of a single meeting with the great lady (and Vidal has milked many a single and brief meeting with the famous for more than they were worth more times than can be remembered). Perhaps she was gay, but nowhere does Vidal suggest this or discuss it, so its inclusion seems pointless. Another reservation is that it is time that Vidal stop insisting that everyone is bisexual and that exclusive homosexuality does not exist when he himself has been exclusively homosexual for several generations. Rather than admit that he was wrong about this proclamation which he made back in the sixties, Vidal plows ahead, sounding more and more absurd each time he says it. Vidal's viewpoint on sexuality is pragmatic and free of guilt and superstition. He is very much in line with the rationalist/utilitarian school of Western philosophy."},{"Title":"Gore Vidal: Sexually Speaking: Collected Sex Writings 1960-1998","review":"Gore Vidal is one of my favourite USA writers, because we share some ideas, which is logical and it explains why he lives in Europe, USA is very rightish this years...But it is a country where critics to the system could be thought and published (think of Chomsky, for instance), and that's good, although I'm not sure if Gore Vidal has got many readers in his own country. Anyway, he talks about sexuallity in USA, specially homosexuality, with a high sense of humour -very entertaining, indeed. And listen, the idea that there're not \\"gays\\" and \\"straights\\" is not his, you can also read it in Marvin Harris books: our Western society is the only one that qualifies somebody because of his/her sexual tendencies."},{"Title":"Gore Vidal: Sexually Speaking: Collected Sex Writings 1960-1998","review":"14 essays and three rare, vintage interviews published over the past four decades tackle hot button issues such as gay American founding fathers, sex and the Catholic church, gay-bashing in the US Congress, and bedding Jack Kerouac."},{"Title":"Gore Vidal: Sexually Speaking: Collected Sex Writings 1960-1998","review":"This is one of the most insightful books I have ever read. Once I got started reading I couldn't stop. Gore Vidal has proven himself to be one of the greatest essayist/satirist in the business, if not of all time. The way he writes and the subjects he writes about all prove to be relevant today. My favoite articles were the Larry Kramer interview and the Sex is Politics.

After reading thesix free chapters from the publisher's site (www.brainysoftware.com), I decided to buy. This is a truly amazing book that covers such an advanced topic in such a simple language. I feel I do understand the internals of Tomcat now. The first Tomcat component you can build after reading this book is as simple as 20 lines or so, as demonstrated in the publisher's site. Supporting technologies, such as shutdown hook, Digester, JMX, are also well explained so that you will be really prepared to wade through complex code."},{"Title":"How Tomcat Works","review":"I bought Budi's newest book because I liked the style of his earlier book on JavaServer Faces. He has an ability that is rare for most technical authors...He can make a very complex topic understandable.Although Tomcat is pretty easy to set up and use as a developer, to really understand the internals of the server one must wade through thousands of lines of code and even then it can be a daunting task. Furthermore, understanding the &quot;how&quot; is only half the battle. To really gain an understanding of the server, one must understand &quot;why&quot; the Jakarta folks did things the way they did.Budi (and Paul Deck) did a great job of not just giving a code review of the server, but also describing the reasons why the server is constructed the way it is.Having written a few Tomcat Components the hard way - trial and error - I can say the insights given in this book have helped a great deal.But, as I say in the title, this book is not for the squeemish. There is a sizable amount of fairly complex code. To really understand the point of the book, the reader must be VERY familiar with the Java language, Java Web Applications, TCP/IP, and be willing to ponder a code listing for a while to really understand it. In other words, this is not what I would call a &quot;passive read&quot;.If you have the basic understanding necessary, this book will shed a great deal of light on one of the darker corners of server-side Java development.This is great read for anybody wanting to really understand the internals of Tomcat."},{"Title":"How Tomcat Works","review":"THis is a Tomcat book that lets you pick the brightest brains in the industry. This book shows how Tomcat developers designed and build Tomcat from scratch. Like me, I'm sure you'll learn a lot, much more than Tomcat configuration. For example, you'll learn how a Java HTTP server is written, how object pooling is implemented, how auto-reload works, ect. This is unlike other Tomcat books that are rehash of the free documentation at Tomcat's website.Surprisingly, the language is simple. If you know a bit of Java, you can follow the chapters comfortably. It starts from a basic HTTP server and servlet container and works its way up to a full Tomcat. You'll enjoy it if you have interest in Java programming."},{"Title":"How Tomcat Works","review":"This is one of the best technical books I've ever read. This is so because the way the authors designed the book and written the 20 applications accompanying this book. I would say this is the only book that teaches its reader how to develop a major application such as Tomcat, literally line by line.If you are a Java developer, this book teaches you how to design and write large-scale applications. If you are a Tomcat user, you'll learn much more from this book than from other books. If you want to take part in Tomcat development, this is the one you should grab to get you started. I highly recommend this to any Java architect and developer."},{"Title":"How Tomcat Works","review":"A good technical book is one that is easy to understand. And this book is clearly one of those. Tomcat is a very complex system, but in the authors' hands, it becomes easy to understand. The authors appeared to have put much effort in explaining many pieces of Tomcat very well. For example, Chapters 1 to 4 cover the connector. Most authors would have probably tried it in one chapter. Considering connectors are such a complex beast, four chapters rather than one do better. It showed how well designed this book was. It is also uncanny how the authors knew which to explain first and which topics should come later.Another thing about this book is it is enjoyable, you want to start the next one as soon as you finish a chapter.So, this is something you should read from page 1 to the last. The codes were based on TOmcat 4 and 5. They are very similar so the authors put notes explaining the differences between the two versions.You'll learn a lot reading this book. The author started from a few lines of code in Chapter 1 (a Java web server) and built a simple servlet container (in CHapter 2) based on the code in chapter 1. It looks so simple and you don't realize that in the last chapter you get a full-blown Tomcat. On the way, you'll learn a lot of advanced Java topics too.There are quite many spelling errors and I would really subtract half a star if I could. However, considering its merit I was happy to overlook it this time."},{"Title":"How Tomcat Works","review":"I was tempted to only give this book 3 stars, but it does in fact do what it claims to do - explain how tomcat works, literally line by line. Because it starts with the most basic example and then builds on each component one at a time, this is a book best read cover to cover. Many of the subsequent example applications assume knowledge explained in previous chapters, so I had trouble using it as the reference I had hoped for.My biggest problem with this book is that is just stops short in so many places. In general the writing is very dry, even for a technical topic such as this. Additionally, the formatting of the book makes much of it hard to follow... the code seems to flow right into the text in parts. I believe this book was published independently, so I imagine there were budget constraints, but in this case I believe it sorely hurt the readability of the book. The authors' convention of class naming is also highly irregular and leads to much confusion in regards to which version of which class is being referenced. Finally, I was highly upset to see that the author doesn't touch on the inndards of Coyote (Tomcat5's new Connector) at all, even though it claims to \\"cover Tomcat 4 and 5\\". This is a highly significant package that is essential to understanding how connectors work in Tomcat5.If you have the time and desire to learn Tomcat from the ground up, this should be fine. However, if you're looking for a reference for a specific part of Tomcat (such as the Connector, in my case), you might want to look further."},{"Title":"How Tomcat Works","review":"From what I've come to understand, this is a self-published title, and for that, I would say that they did quite a good job at it. If it were a book published by A&W; or ORA I would have subtracted a star or two for bad editing, because it does have its fair share of typos and it could do with some proper editing.So when I give this 4 stars it is solely based on the merits of the content.I like the idea of the book. They use the internal APIs of Tomcat and then successively implement the various components. As the book progresses the components become more and more complete.This is a good way of learning about a piece of software. I'd love more books to follow this format. If A&W; or ORA were to offer these people a publishing deal, tighten up the writing and make some of the code more focused, I'd buy that book even though I own this one already."},{"Title":"How Tomcat Works","review":"This is best book to sit and read near by a fire but additionally you need a computer with you from time to time. I was very much pleased with the way author had described the interior design of Tomcat with reference to Catalina from a very simple component to the complex one. This book will sure help you to learn the big picture of Tomcat and its components and will also help you to run sample application servers.It is highly recommended to download the code and use them as reference while reading and testing the chapters. This book covers both Tomcat 4 and 5 with a tiny note what has been changed from Tomcat 4 to 5.I also liked the UML diagram and the collaboration diagram at the beginning of each/some chapters, this gives you the big picture of the package/class structure before you get into the very detail of every java classAfter reading this book, if you happen to see some runtime errors from Tomcat, you will sure be able to say where and why it is happeningThe book also act as a best documentation for entire Tomcat package, which you will not get even if you spend days on Tomcat website.I would also recommend this book to any java programmer who want to see how a complex tool like Tomcat was build, which in-turn can help you to apply that knowledge while building your own in-house software."},{"Title":"How Tomcat Works","review":"Having recently finished TCP/IP illustrated, volume 2, which is a line-by-line treatment of the BSD networking code, I was hoping that \\"How Tomcat Works\\" would be as thoughtful and as comprehensive a treatment of Tomcat's code. It wasn't, and it fell far short of my expectations. For the most part, the value of the book comes from the author's organization of the source code - first look at the connectors, then look at containers, then look at wrappers, engines, hosts, etc. This organization is valuable if you're just sitting down to dissect the source, since it gives you a place to start. Otherwise, though, the book didn't provide much information that the source code itself (freely available) doesn't. The authors just present the source code and say, \\"there you go. That's it\\". They don't delve into the why or the how - they don't show how the sources tie together or discuss areas where Tomcat might be improved (or why it can't be improved in an otherwise obvious way).

Also a great book to better understand how to manage Tomcat. The author reviews in details the code and gives the whys of it. He goes step by step and gives you code that you can run to build progressively a web server. Even if Tomcat 5 is not fully covered (when is the next edition?), it is still a great insight on Tomcat and what's going behind the scene when you write a servlet.Thanks so much for this hard work, I am waiting for the next edition."},{"Title":"How Tomcat Works","review":"I have been working in the past 4 years as an architect for several high-profile industrial strength web sites (i.e. 1,500-27,000 tps) and they all use tomcat for their back end. The common thing I have found is that out-of-the-box tomcat won't support this kind of transaction rate and some tweaking is needed. For example the threading model doesn't fly, and obviously stickiness isn't an option. I got this book to understand the code base better and to see where and how the modifications could best be made. This book is definitely for contianer/server engineers. I doubt' much bnenefit would come if you are just a servlet or jsp type. But if you are having performance problems, want to develop your own container, or are an architect for highly-scalable sites that use ro want to use tomcat then I recommend this book."},{"Title":"How Tomcat Works","review":"I am not going to repeat what others have said regarding this book, but this is a must buy for any Java developers."},{"Title":"How Tomcat Works","review":"I think this book is largely overrated. It constantly amazes to me how people we have come to professionally trust get compromi$ed. Check out this blog from Richard Monson-Haefel before you buy the book and read it again after you are done with ithttp://weblogs.java.net/blog/monsonhaefel/archive/2004/05/how_tomcat_work.htmlA few things:First: the whole does NOT actually cover Tomcat 5 (there have been two code branches after 4, namely 5.0 and 5.5), but mainly TC 4, with a few side remarks on TC 5.0. So the title is already misleading.Second: TC 5.0 and 5.5 are based on MBeans, which skimmed over in the last chapter.The loudest joke on the book comes in Chapter 4. \\"Tomcat Default Connector\\" when the author matter-of-factly states that we will describe you a deprecated code ..., which in their own words \\"it is still a great learning tool\\"If I were to write a book about TC I would instead start by explaining MBeans and then go ahead and dive into the real thing. Spending time with 'learning tools' (as they are constantly called by the authors throughout the book referring to TC 4.0) is not what you want if you are interested in 'how TC works'. There are plenty of books on how to learn basic Java programming out there.Third: I would entirely take off this book recreational code examples like a \\"basic web server\\" which you could easily find on any networking book or on the netDon't expect anything like the \\"black books\\" series.I hope they would write a book about \\"how tomcat -actually- works\\". Possibly with more explanation on logging (redirecting logs to log4j) and Apache + TC integration (which evenif not that performant as people might think/wish is still a good way to easily achieve high availability)"},{"Title":"How Tomcat Works","review":"This is one of the rare books that pave you a way through the implementation of a major software product. The last one I read was Tannenbaums classic \\"Operating Systems\\". The Tomcat book is a lot easier to access: Tomcat is written in Java not C and the author takes a lot of trouble of making code iterations especially for pedagogical reasons. I do very much appreciate this. Both authors have a very clear style. They do not enervate and distract you with any vanity. You have ample time during the read for your own thoughts of how you can do better. Usually I found that my ideas were worse and I learned something more. Sure there are rather small questions of style. The code smells a little like C. There are very many if statements. Some routines are quite long... Still it is a pleasure to read the code.In this book you learn a lot about the implementation of a major software project and a lot about production quality code. You do not learn how to install, administer and use Tomcat. Most is about Tomcat 4. Some ideas are given of the changes due to Tomcat 5. This is a Tomcat 5 aware book but not a book about that version. I am sure this book helps you to actually do extensions of the engine itself, though this certainly is not its main impetus. Be prepared for some very solid reading. Do not worry about the comments with regards to bad editing. The editing is more than adequate.Much welcome improvements:(1) Provide an overview of the major interfaces and classes. And provide the central sequence diagram. Put both at a prominent place in the book (maybe inside the book flaps). This should be straightforward and easy for the authors.(2) Update the book to the newest version of Tomcat. I know this is really asking too much. It takes at least a full time week to read the book, to rewrite takes considerably longer. But it is clear that Tomcat 5 would require even more: an entirely new adapted pedagogically design of the book."},{"Title":"How Tomcat Works","review":"I admit the book serves the purpose but the information can be obtained by the specifications and the examples are not as good as those found in other similar title book"},{"Title":"Thomas Jefferson: The Revolutionary Aristocrat (Milton Meltzer Biographies)","review":"This is an excellent book for learning about Thomas Jefferson.

Like the first one (I LOVE BAD BOYS), this one features Lori Foster and Janelle Denison, and adds rising star Shannon McKenna. Like the first one, this one was hard to put down. It was great from page one to the end.DRIVE ME WILD is the first one and is by Lori Foster, the hot star of Kensington/Brava Books. It is the last one of a series of stories featuring three girlfriends who had made a pact of asking out the first guy they spotted in the local porn shop shopping for wares that interested them. Ian Conrad had learned about the pact and wanted to be the one that Erica Lee chose. He was attracted to the standoffish and attractive Erica, but she was afraid of letting a man too close, because of situations from the past.Ian doesn&#65533;t know this, but is intent on breaking down her barriers. To achieve this, he agrees to be her sex slave and agrees to any demands she may make. Erica can&#65533;t believe that she is attracted to the company electrician, but man, do the sparks ever fly. The scenes between the two just sizzle and the love scenes are sparkling hot.What a fitting end to the Girlfriend Stories, as I enjoyed the whole series immensely.SOMETHING WILDE by Janelle Denison is the first of a series of stories about the Wilde brothers. Eric Wilde is attracted to the comely Jill Richardson, with whom he is currently working on a project with. She is resistant to his advances, but he senses her attraction. He decides to act upon them while he can and embarks on a crusade to woo her. Keep ice close by&#65533;this one is hot. Another outstanding story by Janelle Denison.TOUCH ME by Shannon McKenna is another hot, sensual and enjoyable story. It is about Tess Langley, a massage therapist, who is hired by one of her customers to provide services for a party he is throwing at a remote retreat. She learns upon her arrival that there is no party, that Jonah Markham wanted her alone so he can explore the sensual side of Tess. They both had an unsettled childhood, and must both overcome these before they realize that their attraction is love and not just lust. Of the three stories, this was darker, but still, I found it very good, and yes, very hot too.If your idea of bliss on cold winter nights is to sit down with a book with sensuality that sizzles and scorches, then pick up I BRAKE FOR BAD BOYS. All three stories shined for me and make me look with great anticipation for the next book in the BAD BOYS series."},{"Title":"I Brake for Bad Boys","review":"Fans of Lori Foster, Janelle Denison and Shannon McKenna won't be disappointed when they pick up this book! I know that some anthologies can have one or two enjoyable stories and the other will be a so-so read. Not true with this one! All three stories are totally hot and I never wanted the stories to end. Readers who haven't read these authors before will be kicking themselves for not finding them sooner!Lori Foster's novella, Drive Me Wild is a wonderful ending to the three best friend series. Erica Lee and Ian Conrad heat up the pages in this story! I enjoyed the development of the relationship between these two and Ian was the perfect match for Erica. I could not put this one down. Lori Foster is an auto-buy for me and I would have bought this book just for this novella alone.Janelle Denison's Something Wilde is hot, hot, hot! This is the first story in Janelle's Wilde series and it's not to be missed. Eric Wilde and Jill Richardson are coworkers who end up mixing business and pleasure in a whole new way!Shannon Mckenna's Touch Me is so hot it will burn your fingers! Make sure you have a fan or a cool drink nearby while reading this one. Tess Langley is a massage therapist who helps Jonah Markham relax in new and enjoyable ways that will make you blush.

Authors Lori Foster, Janelle Denison and Shannon McKenna blend their unique voices for this titillating, hot anthology. Each author adds a unique twist to the perennial bad boy theme. A combination not to be missed, I BRAKE FOR BAD BOYS comes very highly recommended.\\"Drive Me Wild\\" by Lori Foster: Three best friends and a dare land Erica in a titillating fantasy come true when Ian proposes that they bypass the porn shop dare and move straight to the bedroom games. Erica's cocky defiance and take charge attitude longs for the tender domination of this rebellious bad boy. A gutsy, risqu&eacute; premise that achieves sensual delight, \\"Drive Me Wild\\" will have readers unexposed to the previous two stories of this series headed straight to the bookstore.\\"Something Wilde\\" by Janelle Denison: Eric cannot help wondering if the creativity and enthusiasm Jill exhibits in the boardroom would extend to the bedroom. But Jill refuses to combine business with pleasure until Eric presents himself as her fantasy lover. This \\"Wilde, untamable bad boy\\" only wants one woman in his bed, and will not take no for an answer. Denison perfectly captures the spontaneous, combustible, impulsive moments that have made her one of the industry's brightest stars.\\"Touch Me\\" by Shannon McKenna: The gouges on her client's back prove Jonah's bad boy tendencies. Tess has heard that he is trouble; that he's too intense; and that he's fixated on her. But when he offers to let her call the rules, demand her pleasure, and allow him to server her, Tess cannot walk away. Shannon McKenna proves her erotic, endearing style to be on par with two of the industry's hottest writers with \\"Touch Me.\\""},{"Title":"I Brake for Bad Boys","review":"I've read all of the bad boy anthologies out to date and this one is probably the worst. The last story by McKenna ruins the whole thing -its disturbing and bordering on rape.Foster's story wraps the Wild Honey series which is about three women working in a factory who dare each other to go to the adult store across the street and find a man who's into their particular fetish and take him home. This story is about Erica, who has a dominance/ man-as-slave fetish. Its far less kinky then the others, more romantic. Ian believes he knows what Erica really wants, to be treated like a princess. So he goes out of his way to woo her with dinner, massages and bubble baths. A pretty good story.Dennison's story is about one of the brothers Wilde, Eric. Business man Eric pursues Jill, a temporary consultant and gets shot down. He knows she wants him, but is afraid of a work-related scandal. So, he sneeks in her house and makes a shocking proposal. He'll be her sex phantom, coming at night and pleasuring her, but during the day they won't speak of it so no one will know about their little affair. Things go well until the end of Jills contract and she's prepared to say goodbye, but Eric wants forever more. The pearl scene is kinky!I absolutely hated McKenna's story. Tess is a massage therapist with control issues (that is, she hates people who try to control her like her parents). Jonah is a sexy business guy with alot of family stress. He asks her out many times and she declines, she believes that he's just a playboy. He offers her four thousand dolllars to come to his lake house for the weekend and give massages. She goes reluctantly because she needs the money. Obviously there's no party and Jonah begins his seduction -here's where the disturbing stuff starts. Jonah has to hold down Tess during sex while she's telling him to get off. They yell at each other constantly during sex. She trys to run away many times and he prevents her with force. Yeah, later she says she liked it, but it still sounds like rape to me. And there's way too much sex too. At least 7 scenes which kills any dialogue or character development. I'm not a prude, but this one just left a bad taste in my mouth and ruined the whole anthology set for me.Get I Love Bad Boys or Bad Boys in Black Tie, they are much better."},{"Title":"I Brake for Bad Boys","review":"Wow is all I can say.This book has it all. Romance,humor,smiles,maybe a tear or 2,and most of all steamy scenes that will have you panting!Get this one!!!!!"},{"Title":"I Brake for Bad Boys","review":"Like its predecessor I Love Bad Boys, I Brake for Bad Boys is the erotic contemporary romance anthology headlined by the favorite triumvirate of writers like Lori Foster, Janelle Denison and up-and coming ingenue Shannon McKenna. This book lives up to its reputation of being indulgently bad, heart-brakingly sexy and darkly dangerous.Then why not a five-star review for their concerted effort? Of the three entries, Janelle Denison's story Something Wilde is discerningly the best because of her outstanding male protagonist Eric Wilde who gives room for freelance co-worker Jill Richardson to breathe, respects her opinion as to her partnership with the firm rather than corner her. That - in my view is a subtler display of passion and being sexy; their erotic coupling are fuelled by wild fantasy of reckless blindfold and pearls - yet never on par with the intensity of the romantic moment when Jill risks it all for love.That is not to say Shannon McKenna or Lori Foster isn't good. In fact Ms. McKenna's sexual scenes are exquisitely burning with raw emotions between massage therapist Tess Langley and rich businessman Jonah Markham but sometimes the marathon becomes overly gratituous. Their attraction is fierce and intense - enough to make Tess cower because she fears Jonah will conform her to a mold like her parents and her ex. The initial manhandling by Jonah may be disapproved by some romance fans but as the story unfolds, Ms. McKenna softens him into a kind of protectiveness rather than obsession that makes him endearing.Lori Foster's hero Ian Conrad is equally intrusive when he sets his sight on conquering the sassy and fiercely independent Erica Lee albeit of a lesser intensity than Jonah. Fans will rejoice with the comeback of her past characters in a reunion - Asia, Becky, Cameron and George. Yet while huge as he is, ahem, physically speaking and distant, Erica is charmed by the honorable and virile Ian. The sex scenes are sparkling yet ironically less bold considering the bondage and spanking themes in her last efforts and Erica is the most outspoken of the three.Who will ever complain a book with loads of sensual pleasures? However when it comes to this insanely talented three, I was looking for a little bit extra - and Ms. Denison's story clinched my thumbs-up. Her hero just literally stopped my heart with his graciousness. Who ever says manners don't count?"},{"Title":"I Brake for Bad Boys","review":"\\"DRIVE ME WILD\\" by Lori Foster.

Strong ending to an Indiana sex shop trio of novellas.\\"SOMETHING WILD\\" by Janelle Denison. Ever since Jill Richardson joined the company as a contractor, Eric Wilde has spun fantasies about her that Jill rejects as she once was burned when she mixed business with pleasure. With the contract nearly ended, Eric offers to maintain a professional relationship on the job, but at night play erotic games together. Jill's agreement breaks her personal vow while readers will enjoy the heat emanating from this tale.\\"TOUCH ME\\" by Shannon McKenna. Masseuse Tess Langley rejects the advances of Jonah Markham because she sees sexual scratch marks on his back as a warning. Jonah desperately offers tons of cash if she provide massages to guests at a party he hosts. However, no one but he shows up.

I rarely give a book a five star rating."},{"Title":"I Brake for Bad Boys","review":"I Brake for Bad Boys was probably the worst Bad Boys book that I've read. I liked Lori Foster's story, but I didn't care too much for Denison's and McKenna's story. All three stories were very erotic. Lori's hero was my favorite. He was in love with the heroine and came up with an idea to get her to himself by becoming her love slave. Having a love slave was her fantasy. He wanted though to get her all to himself so that she would fall for him. It was actually kinda sweet. Denison's story though was too kinky for me. The hero was a stalker as well because he kept watching the heroine through windows. This story was just not for me. Heroine works freelance for the company that the hero works for. Hero wants to get to know her better in bed. yada, yada, yada, same old boring premise. McKenna's story had lots of sex and not much else although it had a better premise. The heroine is a massage therapist and the hero fall for her. He keeps coming back to her to get massages and keeps asking her out on dates. She refuses each time. He resorts to getting her to come to his vacation home so that she can give massages to his friends and guests. All of this is pretty much a lie. There are no other guests. That isn't the bad part though. The bad part is the sex scenes where the hero and heroine are yelling at each other. Heroine is a trust issue and a low self-esteem issue and it comes out in the bedroom. So, there isn't much more that I can say about this book other than I give it 2 stars."},{"Title":"I Brake for Bad Boys","review":"If you enjoy reading about sexy hunky men and the women who love them - literally - then you have to buy this book!!

It's that good. The lessons/exercises use great lines from literature and each exercise asks students and writers to consider--really consider--their choices. Right now I'm using the exercises on Diction and they make teaching so easy. We've had great discussions come out of the questions. Also, I teach on a U.S. Army base in Germany and when we did the exercise that uses the word antidote it includes a question about replacing the word antidote with the word gift, which happens to be poison in German. What a discovery! Again, buy the book if you teach English or writing.

I bought Voice Lessons over the summer, and I'm finding it's extremely useful. In taking 15 minutes on one of the exercises per class following a 10 minute free-write on a given prompt, I find that the class has structure, and more importantly, the students are working together to consider diction, detail, imagery, syntax and tone--concepts that have never consciously occured to many of them, but must be considerations of anyone who sees writing as an art form. I really like the breadth of the choice of text selections which range from the classic to the comtemporary. Discovering Voice Lessons has made teaching this class much easier for me, and made the class a much richer learning experience for the students. Voice Lessons was just what I needed."},{"Title":"Voice Lessons: Classroom Activities to Teach Diction, Detail, Imagery, Syntax, and Tone (Maupin House)","review":"I must admit that I was reticent to purchase this item because most books designed to help students become better writers have unnecessary or unusable activities. _Voice Lessons_, however, is different: organized by technique (diction, imagery, detail, etc.), each lesson begins with a passage from prose or poetry, moves into analytical questions, and finishes with applied practice. From there, it's easier for students to incorporate these techniques in their writing.I teach grades 10-12 (including AP Language), and _Voice Lessons_ has helped all students in these grade levels improve their writing. They seemed to enjoy the activities as well."},{"Title":"Voice Lessons: Classroom Activities to Teach Diction, Detail, Imagery, Syntax, and Tone (Maupin House)","review":"I just got this Voice Lessons book, and, as I hoped, it is jam packed with reproducibles!

The activity pages are reproducible. The activities also serve admirable as writing prompts, with space on the reproducible pages for students to respond to discussion questions and apply what they have learned from specific passages.

The body is divided into 20 pages of exercises per category: Diction, Details, Imagery, Syntax, and Tone (here linked with Attitude). Each page has ample space for answers on photocopies or on an overhead transparency (both permissable and encouraged). Dean outlines practical-- and flexible--methods for utilizing the activities straight from the book with no additional preparation stress. (I can testify that the suggestions do work!)My general level to AP students' interest was piqued by samples from modern writers such as Tom Wolfe, Erma Bombeck, Chinua Cchebe and Toni Morrison along with cannonized authors like Shakespeare, Orwell, Steinbeck, Milton, Yeats, and even G.B.

Dean focuses on five elements of voice: diction, detail, imagry, syntax, and tone. In 100 self-contained exercises, the student is presented with a literary excerpt (the range and diversity of the quotations is wonderful!), and then given questions for discussion and application.

Each exercise begins with an example from a broad range of English literature and then challenges the reader to examine how it manages one of the following components: Diction, Detail, Imagery, Syntax and Tone.In addition to being a quite useful collection of exercises, there are some important, benefits to the manner of presentation. The diversity of the selections (as well as their brevity) establishes, as a given, that the issues explored in these exercises have a wide application. Also, there are no lauditory introductions to or explanations of the excerpted authors: instead, each selection is placed on our workbench and we are encouraged to paw the offering and then to fashion our own. I particularly like this respectful, workaday approach to the student and the task of learning.The exercises work independently so you should find it easy to mix and match them to conform to your existing course-plan. If you have the luxury of an independent plan for each student the book is a whole kit of ready starting points."},{"Title":"Voice Lessons: Classroom Activities to Teach Diction, Detail, Imagery, Syntax, and Tone (Maupin House)","review":"This is a superb introduction to teaching the components of voice.

The whole English department at my school uses Voice Lessons...9th grade teachers do a certain number, 10th grade, etc. By the time a student graduates, they will have done all the voice lessons.

Nancy Dean creates simple exercises that invite students to notice the craft behind all great writing. With intriguing quotes and delicious discussion starters, students cannot help but start to talk about word choice, sentence structure, tone, etc. Instead of force-feeding students with heavy terminology and rote memorization of how grammar works, Dean instead helps teachers create an environment in which those students ask for that same terminology in order to better express their thoughts.

Gangs of Arab youths ran amok in the streets of Jerusalem, and Jews were murdered and raped in the Old City.The setttlements in Upper Galilee fared no better: They became a favourite target and although Ben-Gurion did his best to continue to offer the hand of peace to the Arabs, begging them to carry on living in peace beside their Jewish fellow workers the violence escalated\\".The Pogroms of 1936-1939 were orchestrated by the Arab Higher Committee, led by Mufti Haj Amin El Husseini, and encouraged, aided and abetted by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.This led to increased British repression of Jews in the Holy Land, and the restriction of the entry of Jews into the \\"Palestine\\" Mandate.The White Paper of 1939 barred Jewish entry into \\"Palestine\\", and hundreds of thousands of Jews were turned back by the British to perish in Hitler's inferno, leading to great resentment of the Jews for the British colonists.This led to resistance by the Jewish freedom fighters of the Irgun and Lehi. The Jews of Israel did however raise a Jewish Brigade to help the Allies defeat the Nazis in Europe.After the war, hundreds of thousands of holocaust survivors were further interred by the British in concentration camps, while the British government of Attlee and Bevin, did all they could to make sure the Jewish State was stillborn, helping the Arabs in their plans to drive the Jews out of the Land of Israel.After the British pulled out, and the UN awarded a tiny state to the Jews, 6 Arab armies descended on the reborn nation, with Secretary-General of the Arab League, Azzam Pasha declaring to the world's assembled media that \\"this would be a war of extermination and a momentous massacre which would be spoken of like the Mongolian massacres and the Crusades.\\"The Jewish survivors fought back, and after losing a tenth of their population, won.At a ceremony to pay tribute to those who had given their lives in the war, Ben-Gurion told their families that \\"when future generations come to write the annals of Israel, they will write not in letters of gold, but in letters of love and honour and glory; and they will list your heroic sons together with you, the fathers and mothers who raised for us, the people of Israel, such sons.\\"now much work had to be done.

Of endurance and determination. It's the story of the Jews who arrived in what is now Israel during the period of the British Mandate. The book continues through the end of the Israeli War of Independence at the start of 1949. There are numerous substantial quotes from many of those who reached the Promised Land, as well as several pages of photographs.

Once a shy and studious girl, Ginny begins to go out with the untamable Aiden, but their wild, secret relationship ends tragically one night when he dies after driving off a bridge, but Ginny, his passenger, survives. Without the love of her life, Ginny goes into a deep depression, and her confusion and grief even lead her to try to pursue a relationship with her neighbor, Caleb, a much older man. Ginny's thoughts and emotions continue to have her mind in disarray; could she have prevented the accident? What if she had died, too? Will she ever get over Aiden and what happened that night?Falling Through Darkness, MacCullough's first novel, is freshly written and readers will easily get hooked into the story. The novel begins after Aiden's death, but you steadily find out more about the events that led up to the fateful night of the crash. Things then begin to unravel; you discover that Ginny's grief goes much deeper than first believed, and you will learn more about Ginny and Aiden's relationship, but readers, and not really the characters, seem to know what is going on inside Ginny's mind, emphasizing just how alone she must feel. This is not your ordinary story about coping with loss and learning to live again, but instead it reminds us that the answers are not always easy to come by...and neither is finding such original fiction like this author has written. This is a highly recommendable novel for teens."},{"Title":"Falling Through Darkness","review":"This novel grabs you from the very first page - I couldn't put it down.

Read it immediately!"},{"Title":"Falling Through Darkness","review":"Seventeen-year-old Ginny's life feels like a waking dream. Or maybe a nightmare. It all seemed so different when Aidan first came crashing into her life.Beautiful, vivid, reckless Aidan is nothing like Ginny--a quiet, good girl more comfortable blending in than standing out. But Aidan makes Ginny different. He makes her want more. Makes her feel more. In the end, he makes her feel too much.There was a crash. Something everyone else is calling an accident. Aidan is gone. But Ginny is left behind to piece together the shattered moments of her life with, and now without, him in Falling Through Darkness (2003) by Carolyn MacCullough.Falling Through Darkness is MacCullough's haunting first novel. This is a story about depression and falling apart, but it is also a story about grieving and acceptance. Ginny would be perfectly happy to stay in this fugue state, sleepwalking through life. That is until a new tenant moves in forcing Ginny to confront all the things she knows about Aidan, and the accident, but never wanted to admit to anyone--especially herself.Ginny's depression after the accident is palpable in MacCullough's writing. Equally compelling are her portrayals of Aidan's frenetic energy. Even when Ginny falls into his dangerous habits it's easy to understand how she would be sucked into his jet stream. The story shifts seamlessly between Ginny's present and memories of meeting Aidan and their subsequent, whirlwind, relationship with writing that is evocative and beautiful.Possible Pairings: Wintergirls by Laurie Halse Anderson, Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher, The Great Gatsby by F.

Unfortunately, it is not particularly well written. The author uses childish \\"but more about that later\\" transitions to create suspense. Also, Carr like many biographers falls in love with his subject. Sherlock Holmes stories are not the summum of English language literature. Carr vastly overates Doyle as a writer, but not as a man. This is a book that you should pick up at a used book sale for 50 cents."},{"Title":"The Life of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle","review":"Some listings of biographical archives appear at the end of the book. Charles Doyle, the father, was by profession an architect. Charles Doyle liked fishing. Arthur was educated by the Jesuits at Stonyhurst. At age 15 he visited relatives in London and was a rabid sight-seer. He studied in Germany for one year. He went to medical school at the University of Edinburgh, living at home. It was 1876 when he began.At holiday on the Isle of Arran in 1877 he met Dr. Joseph Bell. Bell used his powers of deduction to impress the students. Conan Doyle took his medical degree in 1881 and signed on to be a ship's physician on a voyage to the Gold Coast, the west coast of Africa. Arthur's London relatives were prepared to do him favors but they believed in the teachings of the Catholic Church and he did not. He decided to open a practice in Portsmouth. His mother and aunt supplied him with furniture.In 1883 one of Arthur's stories was accepted by CORNHILL MAGAZINE. He joined the literary and scientific society. A commission from the Gresham Life Insurance Company helped his income. The more he saw of medical practice, the more he turned to writing. He learned that he could write fiction that readers would take for absolute truth. He worked by fits and starts. He married a Miss Hawkins. Her mother lived with the couple. Married life stimulated his mental powers.A STUDY IN SCARLET as written in 1886. He sold the copyright for twenty five pounds. His favorite writers were Stevenson and Meredith. The book of his he prized was THE WHITE COMPANY. He put a vast amount of research into it. THE SIGN OF FOUR appeared in 1896. Two Holmes series were brought out in 1891 and 1892. The stories ran in THE STRAND MAGAZINE.He moved to Davos, Switzerland for the sake of his wife's health. Conan Doyle introduced skiing as a sport in Switzerland. On an American visit he saw Kipling in Vermont. He met Jean Leckie in 1897 and fell wildly in love. He fought the devil for ten years. He steadied himself by reading Renan. In a new study at his house called Undershaw he determined to bring back Sherlock Holmes. He wrote a play and sent it to Beerbohm Tree. William Gilette, an American, was interested in playing the part. The actor infected Conan Doyle with his own enthusiasm. He spent about five months in South Africa at the time of the Boer War manning a hospital dealing with a fever epidemic. He received a knighthood.In 1907 he married Jean Leckie. After World War I and the loss of his oldest son Conan Doyle pursued the cause of Spritiualism. Sherlock Holmes was revived again in HIS LAST BOW."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"The book is psuedo history on events based on the roman invasion of Ireland.

Plan on reading at least 4 chapter before you can put down. I would have given a 5 but like most things in history the ending is a bit sad I would have ended the story sooner and left it like there might be continuation book in the future.

I've ordered a couple more of her books."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"The book, Druids, cost all of 1 cent.

The book arrived in a timely manner and was well-protected. I highly recommend this vendor and consider this buy an excellent purchase. Carolyn Norton"},{"Title":"Druids","review":"Here is yet another evocative tale by Morgan Llywelyn. Carefully researched (though you may disagree with her determination that Druids practiced human sacrifice) this brilliant novel truly recreates what it must have felt like to live as a Druid in Gaul at the time of conquests of Julius Caeser. Her ritual and magical descriptions ring through to the soul and this book would be enjoyable to anyone wanting a glimpse into this long ago time."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"I found Druids to be a bit of a disappointment. It's been a little over a week since I finished it, and very little of the book has stayed with me. When I read it, I couldn't put it down, but that was mostly because I wanted to get through it and see if there was anything more interesting at the end. There wasn't, at least for me.The plot isn't bad, but it's not very deep. Young boy is raised to become a druid by grumpy older druid after showing he has the ability to bring the dead back to life, shows great power in a few things, less power in acquiring his current love interest, who happens to be a female druid. She snubs him, he learns more, and then he's sent off to study in other holy groves. As he's leaving, a band of female prisoners come in, and one decides she wants boy/druid. He leaves, meets up with friend he hasn't seen in a while, bard, and picks up an older dancer/slave while touring the area the Romans conquered. Comes back to his grove, becomes leader of the grove becuase grumpy druid was killer, and watches the Celts wage a huge battle against Julius Caesar, which they lose. Goes into the forest with a host of woman, and lives there.I'm pretty disappointed in this book, it gets three stars for not being terrible, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless you can check it out from the library."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"Highly recommended to anyone interested in Celtic, Druids, and/or the 'Old Religion'. The Irish author has an amazing depth of knowledge of ancient Celtic history, and writes about characters that actually did exist as well as those that &quot;probably existed&quot; with them! The book just FEELS so true...it's like a visit in a time machine. Very easy to read, but hard to put down!"},{"Title":"Druids","review":"\\"Druids\\" applies historical references and Arthurian-esque fantasy into a pleasant magical story about cultural preservation and loyalty. The first person recitation follows mystical Ainwar of the Carnutes relationship with warrior Prince Vercingetorix from a nearby tribe. The precise author seems to know and conveys the Celtic traditions and mythology quite well and does not waste a page with foolishness in the entertaining adult novel.As the title references, the storyline focuses on druids, specifically their association with balancing life and death in individuals and on society. Such a focus does not present much leniency with profound character development. The rivalries and associations between princes and tribes may be confusing. Various issues regarding Crom Daral and Maia remain unresolved other than a passing comment in addition to an abrupt ending. Interestingly, the Roman method of invading the Gaul's by cultural influence and intermarriage reflects the early 2000 United States by a neighboring country.As with about every film-based novel, I would suggest at least not watching the movie prior to reading the book if not forgoing the movie thereby leaving the story entirely to the imagination.Thank you."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"Since neo-pagan beliefs and Celtic history have become trendy, why hasn't this book been a best-seller? Maybe it's marketing. Maybe it's the rather new-agey cover art. Maybe it's just the one-sidedness of this story.Morgan Llywelyn is not a bad writer. However, neither is she a great writer. Although she can make a hardcore skeptic like me wistfully sigh in contemplation of a theoretical afterlife and immortal soul, she can't make the Romans looks like anything but rat bastards. Although the Celts exude heroism, humour, and hearty, good living, the Romans ooze out an oily discharge of bribery, poor sportsmanship, and deceit.I believe this is the, well, perhaps not fatal, but definitely wounding, flaw of Druids. Had the story been a bit less &quot;Ra! Ra! Ra! Celts!&quot; and more &quot;you know, Romans were just foreign folks,&quot; we would have had a much more enjoyable read. After all, an awful lot of people root for the underdog. Where's the fun of the villain isn't worthy?"},{"Title":"Druids","review":"I wound up reading this book for my local science fiction and fantasy discussion group, and would not have normally read a story in this genre otherwise. I'm not likely to again either.I'll give Llywelyn credit for the ability to plot and create characters, but she never convinces me that she's depicting a shamanic figure of the Classical period in her protagonist of Ainwar. In particular, the number of anachronistic phrases that kept popping up irritated me. No one of this period would have said &quot;professional jealousy,&quot; as is done by Ainwar after he undergoes some of the deepest secrets of his order, and then mulls over why the druids hold back their secrets.Toward the end of the book, the neo-ecological slant of the work also started to gall, as I seriously doubt that the people of this time would have cared.The bottom-line is that while we know precious little about the druids, these priests just come off as too sophisticated in their behavior for me to grant them credibility. ...."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"i'm dissapointed! i was looking for a book like tolkien's, were magic flows at every page. it was very hard for me to finish the book, because i knew how it would end. and that's because i've read 'asterix and the chieftain's shield' and other asterix adventures, and, believe me, it was funnier."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"I just finished reading this and came online to put all her books on my &quot;wish list&quot;. I love the way she writes! I was completely caught up in the story, to the point of it invading my dreams as I slept...the characters become so real and she writes with such authority I felt transported into their world each time I started to read.As a young girl I was enchanted by Mary Stewart's Merlin Trilogy, and this story of druid &amp; king reminded me a bit of Merlin &amp; Arthur as presented by Stewart. Perhaps that's one reason I enjoyed it so much ... and like &quot;The Crystal Cave&quot;, this is one of those few books going up on the shelf to be enjoyed again and again."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"This was a great book, very interesting and hard to put down. Sure, it's one-sided and paints the Romans as an unredeemable evil and the Celts as heroic and free and noble. But it is historical _fantasy_."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"This book entertained me, enthralled me, captivated me. It made me laugh, it made me think, it talked directly to my spirit. The Druids also challenged some of our basic cultural assumptions, which I always delight in. And it taught me something of the Druid religion and the history of the roman invasion from the Celtic point of view. It made me want to read everything about the Celts, and everything Morgan Llywelyn ever wrote. This is the kind of book that made me fall in love with reading in the first place. My only regret is that I can't find more books like this one. To be perfectly frank, the book spoke to me as only a handful of others have done. A remarkable achievement. Dear Ms. Llywelyn, can we please have more?"},{"Title":"Druids","review":"Not sure what book some of the other reviewers here had read, but this, like all of Llywelyn's prolific oeurve, is written with vibrancy and an epic literacy that few others can match. Bernard Cornwell, Marion Bradley, and Stephen Lawhead do come close. Llywelyn's characters are fully and properly heroic without unpleasantly swollen machismo. Not only is this a highly literate novel, it's also a grand romping adventure. This author has a special knack for capturing the humanity without slighting the history and this dramatic, yet quiet sensitivity is always compelling and soul-satisfying. If you enjoy the works of those authors mentioned above, you'll like this one too."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"This is one of my favourite books. I can't understand why it never became a best seller. It's beautifully written, well researched, and contains a spiritual depth which is rare in most fantasy books.The struggle of the Celts against the Romans is beautifully portrayed, and rings true. It is the epic fight against the oppressor, which will always be a reality in the world while human greed exists.Although one knows that, for historical reasons, the Druids will lose the battle, there is also the knowledge that the winner only gains that which is transient. Because the one who wins will also die one day, and then all that remains is the memory. People who have loved deeply, like Ainvar, like Briga, like Lakatu, like Vercigetorix - they are the ultimate winners, when the wheel of time has turned both the good and the bad into ashes."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"Morgan Llywelyn continues her tradition of scholarly work with Druids, a forceful account of the war between the Celts and the Romans. Unlike other texts I've read dealing with the Gallic Wars, Llywelyn draws on the history of the Celts to tell her story. With Druids, the largely unsung story and timeless wisdom of the Celts vividly shines through. I've read Druids three times and I still keep picking up new qualities to cherish about it."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"First, like every reviewer here... I'm biased. This was the first Morgan Llywelyn I ever read. I happened upon it by accident and loved it. It was a history lesson without being boring I found myself cheering on the ones I knew to be the losers actually hoping that Llwelyn would simply rewrite history. Of course as with most historical fiction (keyword fiction) her version is up for dispute but the fact remains that she develops likable/charismatic characters that readers empathize with and she weaves a good yarn. If you came looking for a book about \\"real life druids\\" I urge you to keep looking. This one is just for fun."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"I have read this book 3 times already and am planning to read it again! You never tire of the story of the Druid Ainvar and all the pain and triumphs he goes through in his life. The book is mystical, romantic, enthralling, captivating, engrossing, and I could not keep my hands off it till I had finished it the first time! You really get a feel for the Ancient Druids from this book. I did a speech this year on the Celts of Ireland and many of the things I know about them came from reading this book. A great story and great historical accuracy!"},{"Title":"Druids","review":"Never before or since have I read a book with such an ability to evoke every possible human emotion! Druids is the best book I have ever read. It will upset you, draw you into the action, and make you cry all within just a few pages. This book is a masterpiece of historical fiction. My being a scholar in the area of Druidic history, I am struck by Mrs. Llywelyn's ability to so eloquently weave the story of Ainvar and Vercingetorix around solid historical facts. AND...to top it all off, she is one of the nicest people you would ever want to meet, as I had the pleasure of eating lunch with her one summer in Ireland!"},{"Title":"Druids","review":"\\"Life is change, and simplicity had been swept away on a Roman floodtide.\\"Morgan Llywelyn's Druids is the story of the eradication of free Gaul by the Roman general Julius Caesar. It takes place in what would someday be called France during the first century before the Christian era. The Chief Druid is the \\"soul friend\\" of the great Gaulish leader Vercingetorix, whose skepticism about Druid magic is an ever present division between the two men. Ultimately, however, neither might nor magic can stop the flood tide of the Romans' technology and discipline. The entire society based on the druidical earth religion is fated to be squeezed ever north and west and ultimately blotted out by Christianity.Llywelyn's plot is subtle, though you don't notice that at first. Romans are a threat on the border when the tale begins, becoming more ruthless and more immediate as it develops. The Gauls at first are willing to let Rome in the backdoor in exchange for the luxuries traders bring in, but the Roman genera's best ally is the inability of the Gauls to work together to present a unified resistance. This is partly their tradition but also in reaction to brutality of Roman retribution for \\"rebellion\\". Vercingetorix and his Druid seek to remedy this, and here's where the subtlety sneaks in, for they start to adopt Roman discipline, tactics and technology in order to defeat the Romans, surrendering their unique identity quite voluntarily.In Ann Parson's Mystery Book Discussion group recently we talked about whether you can like a book without liking a main character. I can categorically affirm that you can, as I really rather detested the narrator, the Chief Druid. I rather wish the main character had been Vercingetorix, but that is the author's decision. I know she had her reasons. I felt cheated on Vercingetorix's part as he loses all while the narrator simply retires into the woods with his three wives. I know he lost much more, but if he believed his own view of death, that it is a short phase in life, he definitely made out much better than his friend, whom he annoyingly calls \\"Rix\\".The novel itself also sneaks up on you. I almost hit the off button a few times early in the book, finding myself not enjoying it as much as I have other Llywelyn's. But I stayed with it and am glad I did. There is a sweet bit of information revealed in the brief author's note at the end that tickled me and would not have come as any sort of surprise to the Chief Druid that you will just have to learn for yourself.From That's All She Read http://allsheread.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Druids","review":"I read the reviews about this book and was excited to receive my book and start the read. I enjoy the history and myths of Ireland and Scotland and thought this would be right up my alley. I found the book to be very average."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"A compelling historical novel, exploring both Celtic Druidic belief, and the struggle of the Gauls to hold onto national freedom against the Roman conquest by the legions of the ruthless and scheming Julius Caesar..It tells the story from the narrative of Ainvar, an orphan taken in by the chief druid of the Carnutes, and marked from an early age as having talents as a Druid.It explores the Celtic religious beliefs, in everything emanating from the Source, or the Creator. \\"Nothing ceases to be\\" Ainvar assures his beloved Briga, \\"Therefore we are, all of us, perfectly safe, even though the conditions of our existence change\\".We learn of Julius Caesar's utter brutality in his massacres of Gaulish, Helvetic, Belgic and Germanic tribes.Through all of this Ainvar journeys with Vercingetorix through all seasons in Gaul.Morgan Llyewelyn is adept at drawing up the touching scenes that grows between Ainvar and the feisty Briga, and the loyalty of the Egyptian slave woman rescued by Ainvar, Lakutu.An exciting read wherein the author demonstrates a passion and understanding for all things Celtic and Druidic."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"My review's title paraphrases a reference made in the book, I think by Ainvar, regarding the verbal transmission of all the lore and knowledge of the Celts which may be lost, and much was. The classical, written references to the druids (made by Romans and Greeks) comprise about ten pages. So I am thankful for Llywelyn's \\"channeling\\" of this tale, her \\"listening down the wind\\". I think she did a creditable job with most of what she took on in this book, and her telling of the earth connection, the extension of the senses to all that lives, and the philosophy that Menua taught young Ainvar resonated in some old part of my bones. Most of my complaints have more to do with her characterizations.Some of the things that unfold between Ainvar and Briga, his first wife made me scratch my head. Her previously described feisty nature didn't lead me to think she would share Ainvar with Lakutu so easily, and the series of events that lead to the loss of Maia seemed flimsy, and I was disappointed no resolution to that surfaced by the end of the book. Well, at least I didn't have to wait 16 years to find out if it's taken up in the new book, The Greener Shore, since I only bought a used copy in 2003 and finally read it a couple months ago.I also am unsure of her purpose in naming human Celts after deDannans, such as Dian Cecht, who was the Dannan god of medicine, and Crom Daral, who must be modelled after Crom Dubh, who, Mara Freeman says in Kindling the Celtic Spirit, was a small dark hump-backed agricultural god, who may bear a resemblence to Kokopeli of the SW American Indians. Crom Dubh, according to a Sligo legend, taught the people to sew and reap, and advised them about weather conditions. Even if we are reading of characters who may come down mythologized through the eons, the Crom described as a person in this novel seems a far cry from any helpful agricultural deity. Likewise, his father, Ogmios, described in the novel as \\"stupid as a barrel of hair\\" is based on a son of the Dagda, the Good God, of the deDannans, and is Ogma in Ireland. He is cognate with the Continental god Ogmios. Ogma is the god of eloquence and literature, so here again, I do not understand or find, the fit in naming characters so different from their originals. Maybe I'm nit-picking, but it lent an inconsistency to the narrative I couldn't put aside as I read it. Still, I plan on giving Greener Shore a go, just to see how she does deal with the Dannans, and if Maia ever shows up.Lastly, I decided to read this novel while I was watching the HBO series Rome on DVD, to get the perspective of the Celtic side, which she does give quite eloquently. Again, because the Celtic peoples did not write their wisdom, much had to have been lost, and though this novel is total reconstructionism, it does give one a feeling of connection to an important and pivotal time in western civilization. Lately I've been going about saying, if you hate the I.R.S., you have the Romans to thank!"},{"Title":"Druids","review":"Depending on your taste this is can be an excellent book, it is seemingly one sided and if your on the side of the Celts you will enjoy it emmensly. Llywelyn is great at writing historical novels and she even includes a short bibliography at the end.This book is about the adventures of a young druid named Anviar, we see him bloom from childhood into man hood and eventually into a wise coulcilor. She ties this in with the hisrotical story of Vercingtrix and the struggle between Ancient Gual and Rome. She doesnt give much explanation of Ceasor and the Romans, they are the bad guys and that is all the reader is given. Llywelyn knows much about Ancient Celtic lore and proves it in this novel, she doesnt depict the Druids as the usualy mythological creatures that only work great magic and travel the lands looking to raise the next hero, she shows their humanistic side; Ainviars jealousy of Rix, Anviars inablility to bring all the people he wants back from the dead."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"You can hardly find a good book these days that holds the perfect mixof both history and fantasy. Druids, a masterpiece by Morgan Llywelyn, has made me take a deeper look into the art of writing, and see just how much there is to know about the world.Druids takes place when a young boy is spying on the Druids, trying to see what they could possibly want with his grandmother, the only surviving member of his family. And in trying to save her, the Druids see just how powerful this young child is, hardly a man and they believe he can raise the dead. The Grove speaks and That Which Watches brings new meaning to the phrase Historiacl fiction."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"I was drawn into the world of the mysterious druids from page one. This story is told through the eyes of Ainvar, a druid initiate of the Carnutes of Gaul. I felt that the characters were well developed, and what most people do not realize is that ancient societies were very sophisticated. They were still ruled by superstition, but they weren't \\"cave-men\\" so to speak. Too many stories are told through the eyes of the victor and not the conquered. Bravo to Ms. Llywelyn for telling their story!Ms. Llywelyn used historical facts in the writing of this novel. Though much is not known about the druids, I feel she really brought their shadowed world to life.Druids is filled with magic, history and compassion for a conquered people. Her poetic writing style called out to me. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in ancient history or the way of the druids. You know who you are."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"I read this book as a project for a college class I am taking, I thought it would be good, but I had no idea how much I would enjoy it. The link I felt between the characters and myself was amazing. It has been a very long time since I read a book that has captured my attention with such a force. Makes me long for a more simple time."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"I though this was a terrific book that introduced me to a period of history I had never considered before. While, it is a fantasy book it also gives some basic background into Gaul and the Roman invasions, from a different point of view, not Rome but rather of those Rome was trying to defeat. The book definitely peaks your interest into events in that took place in history that you never would have considered. Additionally, it is an excellent story, well written and paced with memorable characters. The book combines fantasy with history and the result is incredibly good."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"I read this book years ago and was impressed with the mastery at which Llywelyn writes around a culture that has no written history, yet maintains numerous oral rumors and myths. I especially enjoyed looking at the fictional side of the northern people's view of the invasion by Caesar. Remember the conquest of Gaul and all the things written about their &quot;pagan&quot; ways came from their enemy. Hmmm.....makes the truth of the history questionable doesn't it?"},{"Title":"Druids","review":"Magical! Druids, so masterfully written by Morgan,has captured the very soul and essence of what transpired in old Gaul during the reign and slaughter of Caesar's conquest. A deeply heart- warming, yet also heart-wrenching Celtic story that leaves one in tears..Morgan's writing is simply irresistibly delicious and how she can so accurately assume the male viewpoint to the tiniest detail, is quite beyond me. This is a colourful story woven with all the sad twists of irony that befalls the fate of the Old Faith and the future of Gaul. I found myself wanting to jump right into the book so that I could personally change the face of destiny. This beautiful novel is not for the faint of heart for its impressions will be emblazoned upon thy soul forever more. Yes, I cried... This was my first Morgan Llywelyn novel, and now I am reading ALL of her books, slowly savoring each morsel of her brilliant wordcrafting With utter respect and awe, Richard"},{"Title":"Druids","review":"Easily the best work of Morgan Llywelyn's so far. I am studying the history of this novel and it is strikingly accurate and well-researched; however, Llywelyn still brings out the passion and imagination of the ancient Celts. It's certainly one of my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"Druids is an exiting book with much action and fantasy. Once you start reading, it brings you to medieval Europe with the ancient celtic Druids, and the adventure to follow. If you like books about druids, celtic myth or medieval lore, you will love this book. Morgan Llywelyn definitely knows how to intrige readers with amazing battles and magic. The book is aimed at youths and young adults but, everyone will enjoy this.

I loved it and would strongly reccomend this, or any other of her books, to anyone who likes a good book."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"Morgan Llywelyn has put the ancient religion of Druidism into the present, A story well told, with much accuracy. Morgan has a unique talent of blending history with a style that makes you want to learn and read at the same time. This book is the best presented of any on the subject."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"I picked this book up because I had enjoyed some of her other books. However, this book was a struggle. I ended up skipping over a lot of the battle scenes just so that I could get through it.Ainvar is an orphan who is taken in by the chief Druid and instructed in their ways. His friend, Rix, is a warrior. Throughout their lives, they are the opposite sides of the same coin. Ainvar comes to give Rix advice throughout the book.This is a story of the conquering of Gaul by Caesar, and the decline of the Druids. I like Ainvar for the most part, but there were times where he was just a little too whiny. The women's roles in this book are varied. Some of them seem strong to begin with, but then they change. By the end of the book, you are just hoping that things don't end too depressingly.I am glad I didn't buy this book &amp; only got it from the library. It was good, but probably not worth the money."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"Morgan Llywelyn never disappoints. I picked this book up accidentally because I enjoy Celtic lore, and I couldn't put it down. Excellent history, brought completely and convincingly to life. If you ever wished you could have been there for the conquest of Gaul, forget about reading Ceaser's account -- this book is your ticket! Word of warning though: don't start it if you have any pressing obligations in the very near future. You'll want to read this one all the way through immediately."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"The Druid's of the Celtic tribes are greatly accented in this novel. The story of how RIX became leader of all FREE GAUL is excellent. This book is so great that one of my proffessors used it in her class. I have been studying the Celtic culture for 4 years now, and this story has made the era near &quot;the change&quot; my favorite. This book was a great read even before I had to read it again for class."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"'Druids' is by far the best historical novel on the celtic druids I have ever read.

I applaud Morgan and look forward to future books by her!Bravo!"},{"Title":"Druids","review":"I read this book because I needed to do a book report from this time era, but I loved the book so much that I may do a term paper on Druidry. Every aspect of this tale enthralled me. The setting, characters, and plot all fufilled my mind's interests to its fullest extent. I plan to read Red Branch next. This is one of the best authors I've ever read."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"Wow!!! This is the first book that I have read by Morgan Llywelyn and it is the most rivoting book I have ever read. Since I am a Druid myself, I have found that Morgan has captured the essence of the belief system and provided a historical backdrop for this long forgotten religion that was part of the Celtic daily life. It has not only become my favorite novel, but it is on my referenc bookshelf as well. If you just like a damn good story it succeeds as well. It truly is a page burner."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"At the end of this book, Llewelyn includes a brief bibliography-- complete with ancient sources as well as contemporary accounts-- and the attention to detail shows in the book.It's really a treat to read a book about Druids that lacks the new-agey stonehenge-reverent \\"true religion\\" tone-- these Druids are the healers/holy people of the Celts, but they are also just people, they marry, have children, etc. They do work magic but it's more to do with perception than transformation.The story follows young Ainvar from his intrusion into a sacrifice (which is also not what it seems-- the human sacrifices come willingly, and drink a tonic the night before, so that the knife is just a ritual) to bring spring on-- his adoption by the aging chief Druid, his \\"man-making\\" in which he meets his soul-friend, Rix-- Vercengetorix-- and ultimately his involvement in the dream of forming a great alliance among the Celtic tribes to resist the incursion of Caesar.If you've ever read or even just had any knowledge of \\"All Gaul was divided in three parts\\" you probably know this isn't going to be a huge success for the Gauls. Still, you can't help hoping...Ainvar is resourceful and likable. At times the elegaic tone for the Celts (\\"we were a people who sang\\") is a bit twee, and it's true the Romans are presented as out and out villains which oversimplifies the story. There are also a few loose ends-- a kidnapped daughter's fate and the betrayal by a friend.But on the whole this is an engrossing story with a sense of historical accuracy, and a must read for anyone interested in Celts and ancient Rome. Llewelyn's prose is a treat and she writes engaging characters throughout."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"I have read a number of Morgan's novels, all of which are excellent reads in their own right, however &quot;Druids&quot; is by far the most compelling. It is a wonderful attempt to show history through the eyes of the vanquished, and not the usual creators of history - the victors. As in all her books, the writing is fluid and enthralling. The person to person stories written around the historical events are so well done the reader feels anticipation and hope even though we all know how tragically it all ends. A definate must read for anyone who has an interest in the Celts, history, or simply a well written story."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"While I do not consider this to be one of the greatest books I've ever read, it certainly is a good one. It has it's flaws, yes. Every book does.I was a little surprised that Llywelyn actually included human sacrifice in her portrayal of the druids, considering that the only source of &quot;witness&quot; to such practices were the Romans themselves, who, being the enemy of the Gallic Celts, were known to create various lies to plant fear of the druids in the minds of their followers. Note that I am not deducting any stars due to this, though, because there is very little we know about the Celts and their lives and one cannot be absolutely certain.However, I feel the need to defend this book against some of the reviews, because, frankly, many of them were down-right stupid.Take, for instance, the reviewer who deducted a star merely because it had a &quot;sad ending&quot;. How many books have sad endings? Some of the greatest books of all time do! It has nothing to do with the quality of the book, so don't deduct from the average star review for such a stupid thing as that! He follows up with an &quot;Oh, well, that's history&quot; attitude. So why deduct the star at all?Oh, and the person who complains about the central character being &quot;egotistical&quot;...So what if he ever showed any signs of egotism? That's his character! Once again, that's a part of the story. And then you spoke of the Romans being &quot;exaggerated&quot;. That's because it was from the Gallic Celts' point of view. Of course they're going to portray the Romans that way! It's their point of view! Oh, and if you're going to bash a book, at least use something resembling good English grammar so you don't look like a complete fool. There's a difference between typos and not using anything resembling capitalization, punctuation, etc. When talking about the Romans, use the plural form of the word. &quot;of Roman&quot; does not cut it.And there was another man who said the characters were too &quot;sophisticated&quot; for him, because the Celts are shrouded in such mystery. You're right, there is much we do not know. But the author has the license to guess. She seems to have done a fairly good job at remaining as historically accurate as possible. What do you want her to do? Have paper-thin, 2-dimensional characters? Come on! She has to breathe life into them somehow! And there is hardly a reason to believe that the Celts didn't have the vocabulary to express concepts such as &quot;professional jealousy.&quot;Sorry for ranting like this, but I'm tired of stupid, trivial reviews complaining about stupid things. Reviews such as &quot;this isn't what I was looking for&quot;, so the book itself is terrible because &quot;I was unaware of its true content&quot;.Like I said, this wasn't a perfect book. I give it four stars because I believe it deserves that much for it's fluidity and presentation. It reads pretty well. But it lacks something."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"Ms. Llywelyn's DRUIDS is a tour de force of historical fiction, wrongly classified under &quot;science fiction&quot; or &quot;Sword and Sorcery.&quot; If there is any magic portrayed in Ms. Llywelyn's books, it is subtle and not accompanied by pyrotechnics.DRUIDS relies on a very strong storyline to provide its magic. It is the story of Ainvar (&quot;He Who Travels Far&quot;), a young apprentice Druid in pre-Roman Gaul (France) who is sent, true to his name, to the far corners of his country to report on the growing menace of Julius Caesar and his legions.Ms. Llwelyn is a Celtic scholar, and paints a masterful portrait of life among the European Celts, the aboriginal people of Europe, whose contributions to world history are, sadly enough, little known. While much of Ms. Llwelyn's storycraft is necessarily invention, it does have the powerful ring of truth, and her gifted weaving of historical personages such as Caesar and Vercingetorix, the king of the Gauls, into this true to life and very detailed story of an advanced and settled culture on the verge of cataclysmic change, only underscores what was lost when &quot;civilization&quot; reached the &quot;barbarians&quot; of Europe.DRUIDS is a pleasure to read. It reads more like an actual memoir than fiction, and is written with humor, sensitivity, and pathos. DRUIDS sheds light on a little-known portion of history, and for those of us dissatisfied with the &quot;official&quot; brand of history sold to us in most books, DRUIDS is a refreshing and very successful tale of the meeting of cultures, and the rise and fall of civilizations, told from the perspective of one observant but imperfect human being."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"This is the only book I have ever read from the perspective of the defeated Gauls. The clash of cultures is vividly portrayed by contrasting the mechanical Romans, with their square camps and uniformity, to the nature loving Druids and semi-disorganized warriors.The book was thrilling and brought alive the events from history. It is one of the best historical novels I have ever read!"},{"Title":"Druids","review":"DRUIDS takes place in Gaul when Rome (Caesar) is trying to conquer it. The story is told through the eyes of a druid who tries to help a Gaulish warrior, king of a different tribe, unite the tribes of Gaul that they might stand against Caesar and his well-trained Roman soldiers.This is a great historical novel telling the loser's side with love and passion. My brother-in-law recommended this to me several years ago and I finally got around to it. Now I want to read more of Llywelyn's books as I'm always looking for good historical novels and this is one."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"I usually have trouble reading novels based on historical events, mainly because the outcome is obvious. Nonetheless, I found Morgan Llywelyn's 'Druids' a delight to read.The plot is fairly simplistic and easy to understand. We follow the boy Ainvar as he has his first awakening when he somehow revives his grandmother from death at a Druidic ceremony, to his eventual role of Chief Druid, and advisor to one of the greatest Celtic warriors.The characters are all very carefully woven, and interesting to watch develop. If you think you know a character, then they will often suprise you with new aspects surrounding their personality.Finally, this book is quite emotional. There are many heart-breaking events, but they all seem to be handled in a wonderful fashion, and they aren't used as useless plot points.The romance may bother some, 'Druids' doesn't preach monothesic relationships by any counts. The main male seems to get himself involved with about three women at the same time. This didn't bother me however, and it is written in a 'classy' style and not in a fashion that would insult a woman.I reccommend this novel to practically everybody. (Except, perhaps, historians who could probably find many errors) Read this if you want an engrossing tale."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"Seeing as the Celts didn't believe in writing anything down, it's really hard to know exactly what it was like to be a member of their civilization. Llywelyn's vision of a society living in harmony with nature isn't so much New Agey as it is an intelligently woven tapestry composed of our best guesses about this once-prosperous people. Despite it being historical fantasy, it's still one of the best texts I've ever read on the subject of the druids.The characters are extremely likeable, and the story is infused with the very magic that the main character/narrator weilds. It's also got a fair amount of excellent spiritual and practical wisdom as well as a fair amount of accurate historical data. It's a book that you regret finishing.To me, this book is special in many ways. I've read it many times, and it never fails to instill in me a sense of awe at Morgan Llwelyn's powers as a writer and sadness that the Gods of Corruption and Currency triumphed over the druids and their Celtic civilization."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"It was unsettling being a college student and trying to read this at the same time as I had to put it down to do homework! This book was by far the best in the telling of the story of Caesar's advance into Celtic Gaul. I loved the way she entwined the druidic way of life into the story giving you a feeling of actually being there rather than just simply reading another history book."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"This is a strong historical novel about a little-known episode. Ainvar, Chief Druid of a tribe in Gaul, comes of age during the era when the Celtic peoples of Gaul were being wiped out by Julius Caesar. Of special interest is Ainvar's friend Vercingetorix, who was a real historical personage and is reconstructed here as a valiant freedom fighter, in a doomed struggle to save his people and their way of life, rather than as a simple barbarian guerilla fighter, as in the Roman version of history. (The place names and tribal names here are authentic too.) Ainvar and Vercingetorix are two fascinating characters with great chemistry, and both are defined by a hopeless struggle against overwhelming power. Morgan Llywelyn does a great job exploring the mysterious culture of the ancient Celts, plus the religious beliefs and supposed magical powers of the Druids (who were not an ethnic group as is sometimes believed). Another advantage of this novel is that Llywelyn makes strong points about imperialism and war, with Caesar's use of fractious politics and false promises of freedom and progress in the drive to create empire, which have been used to destroy less powerful peoples ever since.Unfortunately, there are several underlying problems that keep this novel from total greatness. Ainvar achieves the office of Chief Druid at a miraculously young age, but has little trouble assuming authority and utilizing his powers. Most of the subplots concerning Ainvar's personal life are messily constructed and of little usefulness, either for the plot or the development of his character. Ainvar also has a book-long grudge against a personal enemy, which is left hanging and unresolved. Meanwhile, the final quarter of the book becomes tedious and overblown, as Llywelyn bites off way more than she can chew in the final war for the freedom of Gaul. Huge armies travel immense distances in very little time and engage in one bombastic battle after another. Fans of battle fiction will probably find the depictions here to be highly implausible. A potentially interesting character, Caesar, has almost no definition whatsoever, and the Romans and Germans, as the enemies of Gaul, are depicted as soulless machines of slaughter, as opposed to the virtuous Celts. Still, this is a generally compelling historical novel, but just not quite a classic. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"Druids","review":"Overall, the book is o.k. Her technique is good but it's a little slow at developing a plot. What I found hard to buy into was the fact that Ainvar, the main character, becomes the \\"Chief Druid\\" (a position that, supposedly, normally takes 20+ years to achieve) by the age of 16 or 17. The same thing with Vercengetorix, becoming king at 16 or 17 and becoming leader of all the Guals before the age of 20. I mean, come on.Vercengetorix is reduced to a kind of side-kick to the teenage super-Druid and the portrayal of the Roman is flat and one-dimensional. Everything the Romans do is vile; everything Celtic is virtuous. The Gallic War is handled almost as an afterthought and I thought the Battle of Alesia (the climax of the book) was very disappointing. Ainvar makes a contrived escape from Alesia (I suspect the author wrote herself into a corner) and lives happily ever after.Personally, I like my \\"historical fiction\\" to have a little more history and a little less fiction but, if you're not too picky, \\"Druids\\" is an o.k. book. If you're looking for a book about Vercengetorix (as I was) then forget about it."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"I haven't read a book i guess in 20+ years (that is for enjoyment) I read this cover to cover in a few days last book i did that with was the Firestarter of Stephen King this is good the only reason i gave it a 4 star was the ending is a bit sad but it is history if it was about the Romans it would have been happy. But that is History and it history is cruel I hope we learn from it. Morgan Llywleyn has an easy clear way of writing that keeps the story flowing and moving. The story is very believable and I learned alot about the era, the phylosophy and the people. I felt I had lived and experienced their time.

At first I was a mite bit apprehensive, but it quickly captured my imagination..it had enough fighting, and enough sensibility along with fleshing out of characters to put it on my list of must read books."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"An enjoyable read and a book clearly based on historical research (mostly Caesar's Gallic Wars). Since we actually know very little about the ancient druids, it is hard to misrepresent them. The author engages in some enjoyable flights of fancy concerning the druids, but I would recommend the book to anyone as long as they realize they are reading fiction and not fact."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"I read the book Druids about a year and a half ago, and I found the story to be absolutely captivating. I bought the book to learn a little more of the &quot;mythology&quot; of the druidry. Not so much the negative mythology we hear about all the time, but the stories the people that lived in that time told. What I found to my surprise and delight was a book that details what things were actually like. I also saw in that book the details of Romanization that we &quot;aren't supposed to know.&quot; A work of tradgedy. It is one of few books that I've read and put down absolutely feeling sorry for the people involved because Mrs.LLwelyn makes those characters come alive and the Gaelic struggle for existance becomes more real than it has in other work I've ever read. For anyone interested in history, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Druids","review":"I read this book about 4 years ago and it is still with me today.

When I opened it up, it was not the book I had meant to pick out, but The Ultimate Frontier. I still wonder if this &quot;mistake&quot; wasn't some sort of quirk of fate. Being too lazy to get back up at the time, I started reading the book in my hands.It was fascinating. In the first few pages, it explained the true nature of energy and matter, and the nature of the world in words that were so simple, yet they rang true (still do). THEN, it took on the heavier subject of the meaning of life!I still don't know how much of the material here I believe, but I know this book changed my life.

I personally did not feel any person could have possibly invented or imagined the content. It left me with an optimistic attitude.

I began to read and couldn't put it down till I finished. I'm kind of New Age &quot;inclined&quot; but the claims, I think, that are made here are justifiably outrageous. I suppose that is the reason I am inclined to sense that this is an &quot;important&quot; work by an &quot;important&quot; person. My inclination is to pursue the tantilizing trail I am on. I will contact the Adelphi Organization in Texas and further explore the &quot;leads&quot; . If anyone else out there wants to communicate his or her thoughts with me, I'd be grateful for the e-mail.

The book rings very true with the exception of Richard's future predictions and his fanciful history. I guess the motivation in 1963 to write predictions for the years 1976, 1999 and May 5, 2000 are to encourage everyone to make the most of their lifetimes, and work and strive toward worthy goals. 10 years ago I used SKYGLOBE computer software to check the alignment of the planets on May 5 2000 - and they do indeed align up in a nearly straight line! I wonder how Richard George Kieninger ( One of 9 defendants of Republic of Texas fraud case I believe ?) figured the planets will align in 1963? It's interesting that 5-5-2000 is my parents 50th anniversary. This is a book I have read in 1969,1972,1975,80... and get more out of it each time. Learn and Grow.

I was wrong. It is an intelligently-contrived heresy. It is counterfeit truth. If I were to write a fabricated treatise on the nature of reality and mankind's place in the universe, I would borrow heavily from the Bible, but twist the text, while building upon well-established New Age lies and so-called esoteric knowledge. This book does that in spades. It's amazing to me that so many people can embrace this trash with such conviction. The Bible says that in the days before Christ's return, mankind will be sent a great delusion, and that people will replace the truth with the doctrines of demons. It seems to me that this process is well underway."},{"Title":"ULTIMATE FRONTIER, THE","review":"I was a Stelle Group member in the mid 1970's, and although I don't espouse the philosophy these days, there was a byproduct of the Ultimate Frontier that was positive. That was the community of Stelle, inhabited by a group of very sincere and dedicated people.By and large, they held themselves to a higher standard than did the founder, who I met once and found extremely creepy. This was during his period of exile from the group; turns out that exile was well justified.So, regardless of whether you find the Lemuria and Atlantis material loopy, and you feel the leader was another David Koresh-like charlatan, there was good that came out of discovering the book, and that good was a community that survived despite all the upheavals."},{"Title":"ULTIMATE FRONTIER, THE","review":"I, too, am a former resident of Stelle, Illinois, and just recently I have reread my old review of The Ultimate Frontier here on Amazon, and read both new and rewritten reviews from old friends and neighbors. I still think it a remarkable accomplishment of the author to write this book and to found two communities. I still wonder why his towns never really grew, it all seemed so natural and evolutionary. As I wrote in my original review, Mr. Kieninger unfortunately did, as do more mainstream Christian leaders also, place the emphasis on externals rather than internals. Hence, negativity or \\"evil,\\" was largely a product of \\"black mentalists\\" influencing us, rather than our genetic survival-based inherited drives, what I now call the \\"human nature.\\"Stelle was to grow as the economical/political reality of the USA became ever more chaotic, which, to this child of the sixties, seemed more than likely, even if the \\"ultimate\\" scenario of world destruction in the year 2000 did not seem likely. We always had to apologize for that one.I found the book about 1976. Mr. Kieninger had already stated, following one of his \\"meetings\\" with a \\"Brotherhood representative,\\" that he had been told that the US would not survive its 200th birthday. Well, that was a good stroke, because what was the US true birthday. Richard debated the point himself, with his associates.I thought he was a pretty cool guy, definitely not very charismatic (except, apparently as it developed later, to several young female followers), but knowledgeable in a plethora of subjects, and certainly possessing a keen sense of humor.Really I thought we were all going to work on each other and find a great freedom and camaraderie. Many of us actually did do \\"radix\\" therapy together for a few years. But Americans being what we are, individuality won out. The building, and hence more masculine years of the community had also largely ended by the mid-eighties. The larger society had also changed. Long gone were energy conservation and smaller homes, not to mention the idealism of the sixties. Stelle today is a focus for alternate energies, sustainable agriculture, and more.Home schooling I hear is pretty big there, and it's a nice safe place for young children.Stelle is a school, and I do not regret my years there. I used to wonder how someone could ever \\"graduate.\\" I found out!"},{"Title":"ULTIMATE FRONTIER, THE","review":"The best review I can give of the book is to say what effect it had on me. I first read it in the early '80's, and five years later finally took action, moved to the Dallas area to contact the Adelphi group, and see what it was all about. That was one of the most important decisions I've ever made, and it has led me on an always-interesting adventure of working on new challenges. Richard is one of the nicest people I've ever met, who just happens to have a lot of information (TUF contains less than a third of the info he's been given, evidently) -- but he'll remind you that You have to try that info out for yourself to make sure that it's Truth (or not). Many people will focus on the May 5, 2000 predictions that are made in the book, but it is advancement-of-Self that is the main message. This is not a book that is easy to put down, and whether you agree or not, it will certainly make you think. Just a few of the topics covered in it would include: religion, evolution, history, politics, the physical body, and so on. None of these are treated lightly.... The reason the book is so inexpensive is simply to get the word out -- not to make $.

I understood the theory on the earth's pole shifting, and I do believe it will happen again one day, but when no one knows for sure.Every time I make a modification to my home, and there are many, I think about the 100 year goal.This book is really great; I have bought many and given them all away to friends.

This was after having graduated from Harvard and read a great many books and successfully completing psychotherapy and successfully completing my own search for a new civilization and proving to myself the existence of God and reincarnation and the Law of Karma. Coming to it from that level of education, I found that the book took my education to a new level, a level that the present culture is not aware of. I would start with what I call &quot;The Gospel According to Eklal Kueshana,&quot; a more plausible explanation of our spiritual purpose here on earth, and who Christ was, than what is taught in the Christian Church. Then there are &quot;The Twelve Great Virtues,&quot; which are the virtues I have been trying to follow all my life, named and defined: patience, courage, devotion, charity, kindness, tolerance, forbearance, precision, efficiency, discernment, sincerity, humility. And conspicuously absent are things that aren't virtues, like chastity, obedience, and vegetarianism. The role of the Black Mentalists in interfering with our lives and trying to drag everybody down to their level is perhaps the most important message of the book if humanity is to advance, but I think this message seems to be lost (because it is terrifying) on anybody who is not already psychologically advanced, including people I talked to at Stelle. I don't know why Edgar Cayce and Eklal Kueshana made such dire predictions for the Millenium. These dire predictions detract from the really good philosophical and metaphysical stuff they have to offer. Also the Hippie mentality seems to have had a huge influence on every organization working towards the spiritual advancement of humanity, The Stelle Group included. But the message of THE ULTIMATE FRONTIER is definitely not the Hippie message. It really has nothing to do with the limited worldview that was born in the drug movement and survives today as the New Age. Not that the book is flawless -- there are plenty of things I take issue with, starting with the Doomsday prophecy. But for the discerning reader, there is a huge treasure of information in this book, and certainly the kind of powerful ideas that could lead us to a whole new level of civilization."},{"Title":"ULTIMATE FRONTIER, THE","review":"Born and raised in Alexandria, Egypt, I've had the privilege of living in an ancient land which has served as a cornerstone for three of the major religions of the world ( Judaism, Christian- ity and Islam ) as well as the birthplace of one of the worlds greatest civilizations to which has been attributed, traditionally, the erection of one one of the worlds greatest enigmatical structures, the Pyramids and the Sphinx. In this modern-day historic land, two religions dominate: Islam, which constitutes the majority, and Orthodox Christianity, whose following only comprises 10% of the population. Born into the latter faith, I was raised upon a set of tenaciously held beliefs and dogmas alongside mechanically observed rituals that seemed to be, at least in my opinion, the antithesis of Christs' ethereal message. Oddly, my doubts about mainstream Orthodox Christianity would be fueled, even more, each time that I caught a glimpse of The Pyramids. The awe that these monumental structures inspire cannot but cause you to question if their builders were ' superhumans ', who, via these encrypted architectural feats, were attempting to relay to all future generations the ' true ' mean- ing of life and reason for existence. Whilst reading chapters 4 &amp; 5 my suspected beliefs were confirmed. I bought this book based upon all of the reviews that were written and I am not disappointed. Buy this book, read it, and you will be liberated from all the self-defeating constraints placed upon us by current theological misconceptions. You will revel in the ultimate freedom that only a true undersatanding of our purpose for existence can bring. I rate this book as a five only because there is nothing higher on the scale. Absolutely outstanding."},{"Title":"ULTIMATE FRONTIER, THE","review":"I would like to attest to the following.I first read UTF in 1977. The book struck home in no uncertain terms. I have re-read it and re-read it so many times now I have lost count. I determined at that time to embark upon the path of the scientist-philosopher. I approached all of the statements in the book with the expectation that they were false until proven true. I can say that after 29 years of applying the precepts to be found in the UTF, I have found no harm from them and have benefited greatly. I am able to look back 29 years now and appreciate my evolution, small though it is, lowly though it is. I have a stronger and more positive Mind now than I did back then. I have more awareness of everything around me in the universe. I am able to form theories about Truth and to formulate subjective mental experiments that prove or disprove those theories based upon the tests of time, outcome, and repeatability. This has been the most important book of my life.It has come to my attention that some others who read this book and became more closely involved with Richard were hurt by him to varying degrees, both emotionally and economically. I have read testimony as regards problems associated with his sexuality. I am truly sorry that others were harmed by his imperfections and faults. I only spent a part of a day with him, listened to one Sunday meeting at which he presided, and had a dinner with him. Since he is deceased now, and since some or all of his specific prophesies have now been deleted from this edition of the book, perhaps no one else will be harmed by him.I recommend this book to all. I have visited both Stelle and Adelphi, and found the most wonderful people on the planet at each place. Stelle is a place where alternate, earth-friendly technologies are implemented quite readily. I think the community of Adelphi is even more important now that Richard has passed on. I believe that they will keep the Ultimate Frontier alive and in publication, and provide a place where those who wish to live by its precepts can gather together in community.I am sure that it would be great to live in the same neighborhood as others who practice the Lemurian Philosophy.Remember to read this and all philosophies critically. Devise your own tests and see if the philosophies withstand the test of time, experience, knowledge (soul) growth and outcome.The best means to soul growth and evolution is in tiny increments, one step at a time, through gradual character uplift. That theory is presented in this book, and I attest to its validity.My best wishes to you in your evolution.Michael"},{"Title":"ULTIMATE FRONTIER, THE","review":"I have lived in the Stelle area for many years and have had many friends and acquaintances who were either members of Stelle or who wished to become members. I was given the book to read in 1973, when the settlement was fairly new, and was shocked that anyone with any critical reasoning ability would find it believable. I have found many of the members of the group to be credulous, judgmental and able to rationalize their (individual) egregious behavior.I am surprised that there are so many reviewers who call this book \\"idealistic.\\" I do not consider it idealistic to divide people into those who are chosen and those who are not, those who are part of the \\"brotherhood\\" and those who are \\"black mentalists\\", as any are said to be who disbelieve the philosophy (those who are not with us are against us: sound familiar?) True idealism is not secretive, nor does it seek to dispossess the many, or discount their virtue, while seeking a favored state for the few.I understand the desire for a better world. You already know how to do this: love both your friends and your enemies, treat all with respect, share what you have and rejoice in the accomplishments of any and all. You know the drill. It is easy to state, but takes work. Perhaps, for some, it feels more rewarding to believe in something which is more selective, less well-known.

They believed the prophecies, so we sold our home and moved to the middle of a cornfield in Stelle, Illinois.We had been solidly middle class. I was a happy, well-adjusted child--but after we moved to Stelle my life changed completely. There were only about 100 people there, yet everything outside the community described in The Ultimate Frontier was referred to as &quot;the outside world.&quot;I know the author of this book as Richard Kieninger; Eklal Kueshana is his pen name. Richard convinced my father to invest all his savings (money intended for college) in some crazy scheme. The money wasn't supposed to be any good anyway after the United States collapsed during the mid-1970's. By the time we left Stelle we were broke, my parents were disheartened, and I was afraid of everything in &quot;the outside world.&quot;None of the prophecies in The Ultimate Frontier came true. The United States didn't collapse during the mid-1970's, Stelle didn't grow to become a city of 250,000, nor did World War III bring nuclear holocaust in November, 1999. You can buy this book if you want, but please don't believe Richard or the prophecies.I have talked to quite a few of the children of Stelle, and their experiences are similar to mine. I think it is dangerous to believe people who pretend to know the future, especially if you have children. My parents recovered somewhat--my father refers to Richard Kieninger as &quot;God's cure for naivite.&quot; But I think some of us who spent our formative years in Stelle were permanently marked.The Ultimate Frontier describes a beautiful dream. It says that people with a special destiny will create a new nation on land that will rise out of the Pacific Ocean on May 5, 2000. It may be surprising that intelligent people could believe this, but some do. This dream appeals to their vanity, and they set their common sense aside.The philosophy described in The Ultimate Frontier is beautiful, but I think there are safer, cheaper ways to learn about it."},{"Title":"ULTIMATE FRONTIER, THE","review":"Longtime readers will welcome the new pared down Tenth Edition of THE ULTIMATE FRONTIER, which was released just a few months ago. This new edition represents a significant improvement over previous editions, which since 1963 have provided readers with an excellent introduction to the precepts of Lemurian Philosophy through the literary device of discussions with various scientist/philosophers.First and foremost, THE ULTIMATE FRONTIER is the non-fiction autobiography of Richard Kieninger, who spent his early years in the Chicago area and who currently resides in an intentional community called Adelphi, which he founded just east of Dallas, Texas. Mr. Kieninger has always claimed access to special information provided by an organization called &quot;The Brotherhoods,&quot; which early on gave him the titles &quot;Harbinger of Aquarius,&quot; &quot;The Judge of Israel,&quot; &quot;The Builder of Lemuria&quot; and &quot;The Fountainhead of Christ.&quot; References to such self-aggrandizing titles are refreshingly absent from Chapter Three of the new Tenth Edition.Gone too are Chapter Four references to a session with &quot;The Council of Seven,&quot; a group of seven advanced beings who supposedly officiated at a ceremony during which Mr. Kieninger's pen name, Eklal Kueshana, was carved into his right thigh when he was twelve years old. Also at this ceremony, Mr. Kieninger's &quot;Council of Seven&quot; confirmed his possession of &quot;the Key of David, by which your works are given authority.&quot;As the young Richard Kieninger is introduced to the Lemurian Philosophy by various of his scientist-philosopher teachers, the reader learns that the author's &quot;works&quot; are to be the building of two precursor communities, one located eighty miles south of Chicago, Illinois called &quot;Stelle&quot; and the other located twenty miles east of Dallas, Texas called &quot;Adelphi.&quot; We also learn that Mr. Kieninger is charged with the founding of a new nation, &quot;The Nation of God,&quot; on a continent that will someday rise out of the Pacific Ocean.All previous editions of THE ULTIMATE FRONTIER cited the date for the rising of this new continent as May 5, 2000, when a unique alignment of various celestial bodies would trigger &quot;Doom's Day&quot;-a massive seismic event that would lead to the shifting of the continents. A devastating nuclear Armageddon would already have occurred in November, 1999 and the wretched survivors of this earlier event were to have greeted May 5, 2000 as &quot;a blessing.&quot; In all previous editions, Mr. Kieninger quoted the prophetic words of a certain Dr. White, &quot;After Armageddon and Doom's Day, less than a tenth of the world's population will be alive to see the year A.D. 2001.&quot;Readers of the new Tenth Edition of THE ULTIMATE FRONTIER may be forgiven if they wonder why the author simply deleted all references to these aforementioned dates, while he continues to maintain the Armageddon and Doomsday predictions in full force. No explanation is offered for the failed prophecies.In all fairness, Mr. Kieninger's decision not to include specific dates is more a return to his roots than a fresh approach. As a 1950's student of the Lemurian Fellowship in Ramona, California, the author was introduced to Lemurian Philosophy through a series of twelve lessons that mention no specific dates for the prophesied Armageddon and Doomsday events. By eliminating such references in the new Tenth Edition, Mr. Kieninger may be honoring the spirit of the original Fellowship lesson material.The cover of the new Tenth Edition includes a subtitle, &quot;A Call to the Builders.&quot; Of course THE ULTIMATE FRONTIER has always been a call to action, and Mr. Kieninger has founded a number of non-profit organizations to facilitate the work of building his Stelle, Illinois and Adelphi, Texas communities as well as the building of a new city that is to be called &quot;Philadelphia&quot;--Lemuria Builders, The Stelle Group, Builders of the Nation, The Adelphi Organization, and The Philadelphia Fund. It should be noted that in 1986 The Stelle Group and its associated Stelle, Illinois community disavowed any affiliation with Mr. Kieninger because of his well-documented tendency to abuse his authority and seduce the young women of both communities--patterns of behavior that have carried over to at least 1997. Despite this recent history (not to mention Mr. Kieninger's April 14, 1998 conviction on federal bank fraud and mail fraud charges), The Adelphi Organization and its associated Adelphi, Texas community continue to support Mr. Kieninger's building projects. Current readers of THE ULTIMATE FRONTIER are encouraged to tithe 10% of their incomes to support expansion of the Adelphi community and to finance the building of the new city of Philadelphia on Cedros Island, just off the coast of Baja California.The new Tenth Edition of THE ULTIMATE FRONTIER includes one new section of commentary in &quot;Remarks by the Biographee.&quot; Mr. Kieninger writes, &quot;Inasmuch as freedom to experience and to experiment are essential to attaining meaningful Egoic growth, Adelphi is the very opposite of a cult. It is important that no one turn his life over to a guru or be obedient to one.&quot; Longtime observers may wonder, then, why Mr. Kieninger retains final decision making authority, both in the Adelphi community and within the structure of The Adelphi Organization. Even more troubling are Mr. Kieninger's claims that he has sometimes found it necessary to use his &quot;Key of David&quot; powers to discipline disobedient members by removing the veil of protection from evil that Christ promises all sincere Christians. In his landmark book on modern cults, RELEASING THE BONDS--EMPOWERING PEOPLE TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES, Steve Hassan cites precisely such behaviors when he defines what makes any political, economic or religious organization a cult.This update of THE ULTIMATE FRONTIER is indeed a welcome improvement over all previous editions. Learning to live in community has always been a worthwhile goal, and the author is to be commended for inspiring this sort of thing. It seems, however, that readers contemplating full and active involvement in Mr. Kieninger's current projects would be well-advised to consult with former participants before committing large sums of money and years of their lives to such endeavors.As for Mr. Kieninger's claim that &quot;The Brotherhoods&quot; assigned him the task of developing an advanced culture in Adelphi that will someday lead to the establishment of a perfect civilization in a future &quot;Nation of God,&quot; thousands of readers of THE ULTIMATE FRONTIER can attest that taking such claims too literally has in the past led to major disappointments. The small band of true believers who currently populate Mr. Kieninger's Adelphi community might do well to read Eric Hoffer's namesake classic, THE TRUE BELIEVER. Perhaps they too will someday decide to reduce their dependence on Mr. Kieninger's future talk and concentrate instead on the very legitimate, though somewhat less ambitious, goal of simply learning to live in community."},{"Title":"ULTIMATE FRONTIER, THE","review":"This book gave me the most profoundly negative learning experience of my life. I am another &quot;graduate&quot; of Stelle. I read the book in the early 70's and my husband and I sold all we owned and moved to Stelle. We wanted to get there before 1976, as the United States was not supposed to see it's 201st birthday. I remember the celebrations on July 4th at Stelle as everyone was excited that one of the predictions was about to come true. I couldn't believe anyone could be happy about the downfall of our country. But, we were told not to care about what happened &quot;outside.&quot; Of course, nothing happened, and the leaders of the community made excuses as to WHEN the actual birthday of the US was supposed to be. Richard Kieninger had already been forced out of Stelle by this time and was starting a community outside of Dallas.This book is filled with esoterica and new age ideas (before new age was &quot;in&quot;) but you can get much more from other sources. In fact, much of Kieninger's information is gleaned from the Lemurian Fellowship, which existed in California in the 1950's.Fortunately, I finally figured out what was going on, and left Stelle after about 3 years. I had no money to invest and I was told by the leaders that my ideas were too &quot;radical.&quot;This book is a utopic view of what a community can be, but has no basis in reality. Buyer beware!"},{"Title":"ULTIMATE FRONTIER, THE","review":"Richard, aka Eklal, has put together a narrative of somewhat haphazardly revealed information from esoteric lore. While some of the information is valid, other parts present distortions which make me question the true intentions and wisdom of Richard's &quot;Brotherhood&quot; sources. You can get some more complete and accurate esoteric information for free on various websites. Meanwhile, I'd suggest taking up remote viewing to validate any esoteric information one encounters and plans to act on."},{"Title":"ULTIMATE FRONTIER, THE","review":"I read the book in 1969 and became involved with the Stelle Group for the next five years--until the author/leader was exposed as a regular human of questionable integrity; was expelled; and went off to start his Adelphi project in Texas. The Great White Brotherhood stories presented in the book were allegedly learned by the author during his involvement with the same organization in Southern California that Elizabeth Clair Prophet sprang from. None of this material is new to anyone who has studied the esoteric traditions. Standard Masonic, Illuminati Grand Plan drama reading. Helpful, insightful, but of questionable relevance to the author and his projects. The author does a good job of casting himself as a significant player."},{"Title":"ULTIMATE FRONTIER, THE","review":"When I first read this book 3-4 years ago, I had the sensation that I had &quot;come home&quot; to something familiar. It seemed to resonate with thoughts that hadn't even been articulated yet, but were already a part of my psyche. Since that time, I have re-read portions of the book several times. While I certainly don't buy into all of the prophecies and have felt no compulsion to sell everything and move to one of the author's &quot;communities of the enlightened&quot;, I have found myself much more open to possibilities I might not have considered before.I have a very open and curious mind and find great excitement in exploring questions to which I neither have the answer nor expect to have &quot;the&quot; answer in this lifetime. This book presented me with some options I had not thought much about before I read it. Reincarnation, a hierarchy of spiritual advancement, the parallels in the development of the world's major religions; all of these topics opened me up to a number of questions which have fueled my journeys in spiritual development in the years since my first encounter with the book.For those who find as much joy as I do in exploring the questions, this book can be a valuable catalyst. For those who need &quot;expert&quot; answers and prefer to have someone hand &quot;the truth&quot; to them, this book can be troublesome or even downright dangerous."},{"Title":"ULTIMATE FRONTIER, THE","review":"I first read this book when I was in College in 1979. It was actually in the library. It was quite influential to me at that time, as other books/authors have been since. The book does tie in very well with other &quot;new age&quot;/theosophical beliefs. After reading the book I did a thesis on cults (not implying this of Adelphi or anyone else) studied the Rosicrucians and Freemasonry some, read all of Carlos Castaneda, Dan Millman, Ayn Rand, went to Stelle,IL (as part of the thesis..those of you familiar with Adelphi will probably know of/about Stelle). Through the internet I have found an org. that interests me. Has anyone had 1st hand experience with the Universal Church in Corwin Springs MT? After being to Stelle (trying to form an Atlas Shrugged/John Galt form of commune)and hearing a Richard Keininger lecture, reading others, etc...I'm still a searcher. I think universal truths are experienced and not read."},{"Title":"ULTIMATE FRONTIER, THE","review":"Richard Kieninger (RK) Eklal Kueshana), author of Ultimate Frontier (TUF), died in March 2002. He first wrote and published TUF in '63. He presented what is, at its core, a very beautiful yet idealistic philosophy, but also threw in some cataclysmic predictions and an alternative, maybe warped, view of history and metaphysical trivia. Over the years, he has edited and changed various things in TUF. In later editions RK removed some of the predictions/dates, especially when these did not happen. These changes were made in the context of direct quotes of physical in-person conversations that RK allegedly had with human beings who were \\"Brothers\\" in a \\"Brotherhood\\" working toward uplifting humanity.Anyhow, to me, the whole TUF/RK/Stelle enterprise is a lot like the movie, \\"Meet John Doe,\\" made in the late 30's, with young Barbara Stanwyck and Gary Cooper. Barbara has been fired from a newspaper, and in her last column, she makes up a story about a \\"John Doe\\" who is out of work, down on his luck, and protests the state of civilization and wants to jump off the city hall building at midnight on Christmas Eve. Anyhow, with this lie, the paper actually re-hires Barbara, hires Gary Cooper to be \\"John Doe,\\" and eventually starts a \\"John Doe\\"/\\"love thy neighbor\\" movement that sweeps the country. One theme of this movie is that good things can come from a lie.TUF, in my opinion, is a work of fiction. RK plagiarized the Lemurian Fellowship lessons in writing TUF, and wrote himself a major role in the whole undertaking. With RK's physical death in March 2002, he can no longer have a major role and wreak havoc in other people's lives. Thank God!However, there are many many good people in Stelle now, doing many good things. If you want to learn more about these good things, just go to your search engine and punch in terms, such as Stelle community or Center for Sustainable Community. The good people who have done good things in Stelle in past and present have done so, in spite of RK and his dramas.To give you some context, I read TUF in 1980, it was the 2nd edition 1970. I lived in Stelle from 1983-88 and owned a duplex in Stelle as an investment property from 1993-99. I do think that the community in general was less uptight in recent years and certainly I think the majority of the good people in Stelle were much less wrapped around RK and his various issues in the later years.Read TUF, if you want. Just read it cafeteria style, taking what you want and leaving the rest. You can leave most of the RK stuff since he's dead now."},{"Title":"ULTIMATE FRONTIER, THE","review":"I read the first edition in 1968.My friends moved to the failed Stelle community.The book helped me to start investigating.The Ultimate Frontier has about as much credibilty as the T.Lobsang Rampa books.If you want to persue an investigative path, read what Zecharia Sitchin has published."},{"Title":"ULTIMATE FRONTIER, THE","review":"I read UFs original edition in 1963 and joined the Stelle Group in Chicago; wonderful people from all over the world. Worked on the site as the &quot;city&quot; came into being. It grew more and more &quot;cult-like&quot; with Richard making personal decisions--I quit when he suggested that my wife was not for me and that we should separate. Then Richard was asked to leave for Clintonesque reasons; he did and went to Texas while his second wife, Gail, mentioned in the orig book, took a splinter group to Wisconsin. Learned a lot in my time w/the group and have verified the philosophy many times over thru other sources--but not the predictions. Never saw a more committed group of fine people--the book is worth a read but be careful. Richard is a very complex person, seems cool, highly objective and intelligent both as RK and as Ejlal Kueshana, his pen name. Haven't seen him since 1973. Have no idea how many of the orig group remain in Stelle or at &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, the &quot;city&quot; he's building in Texas!"},{"Title":"Reading to Learn: Lessons from Exemplary Fourth-Grade Classrooms","review":"I'm a fourth grade teacher with only two years of experience. I found the book to be very helpful, especially the interview/observations. I was a little frustrated at the small class sizes in the model teacher's rooms, but the ideas and information were excellent. Be warned that the editing was done poorly. I would recommend it to 3rd through 5th grade teachers."},{"Title":"Reincarnation and the law of karma;: A study of the old-new world-doctrine of rebirth, and spiritual cause and effect,","review":"I downloaded this Kindle edition of an old book which explores the views long held on reincarnation.

I recommend this enlightening book which explores in detail how other cultures/religions embraced reincarnation & karma. Insightful. Can't beat the price. Loved the book."},{"Title":"Reincarnation and the law of karma;: A study of the old-new world-doctrine of rebirth, and spiritual cause and effect,","review":"I've read just about every book William Walker Atkinson has written, including those under his many pseudonyms: Yogi Ramacharaka, Swami Panchadasi, Magus Incognito and others. This is another classic - easy to read, full of wisdom. In it, Atkinson explores reincarnation from Egyptian, Essene, Greek, Hindu and other perspectives, as well as, arguments for and against it. He influenced my writings as well - reincarnation is a theme in my novel,Mystic Warrior: A Novel Beyond Time and Space."},{"Title":"Reincarnation and the law of karma;: A study of the old-new world-doctrine of rebirth, and spiritual cause and effect,","review":"This book makes a compelling argument in favor of reincarnation. William Walker Atkinson, an insightful and comprehensive writer, makes a convincing case for the 'unknowable' through rational and intelligent reasoning. Atkinson does this by presenting history, natural laws and by disputing arguments against reincarnation and karma. Reincarnation And The Law Of Karma reads as if it were written today but surprisingly it was originally published more than 100 years ago. Although I had already somewhat come to grips with the possible/plausible doctrine of reincarnation and karma before reading this book, I have now included reincarnation as one of my profound beliefs since reading this book. If we are open minded and have our truth radar switched on we find teachers come from unlikely sources and speak to discerning souls like a Buddha. These teachers sometimes wait for us in free kindle books."},{"Title":"Reincarnation and the law of karma;: A study of the old-new world-doctrine of rebirth, and spiritual cause and effect,","review":"I was looking for something to help me believe in reincarnation.

I Googled it, and found out that he was from the past century. The book enlightens me a lot on Hinduism, but he shouldn't try to explain the Orient philosophy regardless of how short the article was, if it was not true.Like many spiritual books, they all talk about different layers of heaven.

I found it really motivating -- in fact, I went back and ordered his most popular past two books, Clutter's Last Stand and Not for Packrats Only. This book is not like those, but for me, it's still really inspiring. I tend to be really sentimental and hold on to TONS of stuff -- old term papers, mementos of ex boyfriends (even the ones I didn't like -- what's up with that???), and lots of old pictures (pre-digital era) that aren't in albums and never will be. Just reading about how other people do this same sort of thing, and how they finally rid themselves of all the junk in their lives, changed the way I look at my clutter.I admit that at first I was skeptical of a book entirely based on quotes, because that's all it is. It's not really written by Don Aslett; it's just a compilation. But I personally like hearing how everyday people overcame their clutter and how liberating it felt. It is NOT a manual on how to get rid of your stuff; if you want that, buy his two earlier books, cause they're fab too. But this book is great for a pick-me-up when you've fallen off the organizational wagon."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:L,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},R=["disabled"],M={key:0},H={key:1};function q(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",C,[(t(!0),a(w,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",H,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",M,"See more"))],8,R)):b("",!0)])}const B=u(x,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-e04c8b71"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/37.md","filePath":"people/37.md"}'),W={name:"people/37.md"},D=Object.assign(W,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(B)]))}});export{P as __pageData,D as default};
