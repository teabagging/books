Fern had saved this little pig from a certain death. She didn't want her father killing a baby pig. But as when Wilbur grows, Mr. Arable, Fern's father says Wilbur has to go. So they gave it to the Zuckermans. And there, Wilbur had a great adventure in the Zuckermans' farm also meeting Charlotte with her baby spiders.SOME PIG:These are the words in Charlotte's Web, high in the barn. Her spiderweb tells of her feelings for a little pig named Wilbur, as well as the feelings of a little girl named Fern... who loves Wilbur, too. Their love has been shared by millions of readers.What the book is about is friendship on earth, affection and protection, adventure, miracle, life and death, trust and treachery, pleasure and pain, and the passing of time.

We were familiar with the Paramount film of the same title, and enjoyed reviewing the differences. E.B. White's prose is marvelous and is a nice exploration of words with a young reader. I particularly enjoyed the \\"special read along edition\\" as it helped my son follow along and pick up the reading at different points because it was so easy to see, and the illustrations were as well.

But, fern never talked to the animals, she only listened. The story also emphasized the responsibility of taking care of an animal and the loyality that it requires. Wilbur was also outstanding in his performance of keeping the &quot;towns people&quot; entertained as well. He had to live up to what charlotte was writing about him, after all."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"I woud recemend this book to you. Charlotte's Web is about a pig named Wilbur who gets saved by a spider named Charlotte. Other characters in the story are Templeton the rat, the goose the gander and the goslings, Mr. Zuckerman, Mrs.Zuckerman, Fern Arable, Mr.Arable, Mrs.Arable. My favorite part of the book is when Templeton helps Charlotte at the fair. My favorite Character is Templeton because I like how he is sneaky and keeps a low profile on Mr. Zuckerman. I did not like the sad ending because it had a death. I would still recamend it because its not all sad."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"It's the size of a regular piece of printer paper 8 1/2 x 11.

As you embark upon the lives of these extraordinary characters, you will find it hard to put this book down. This story is about a young runty piglet named Wlibur who is rescued from an unjust death. Fern,the young girl who saves him has no idea that her actions alone will soon change the whole town. One day, Fern is forced to do the unthinkable. She must sell her beloved pig! To her delight ,her Uncle Zuckerman, who lives just across the street, purchases him. In the meantime, Wilbur finds himself quite lonely in the Zuckermans big barn. However, he soon develops a friendship with an unlikely creature, a caring spider named Charlotte. As the story continues to unfold, more friendships are made and Wilbur is yet again faced with another life or death situation. I enjoyed reading this book beacause of the many emotions it stirs. The friendships made, the suspense of what is yet to come, and the tragedy of something each of us will face one day, are some of the things you will discover while reading this book. Charlottes Web is an excellent tale and a wonderful book for all ages. The message in this book is very simple: you can do anything if you set your heart and mind to. Before reading Charlottes Web, I purchased a \\"PACES Study Guide.\\" This really helped me understand the story more. Throughout this guide, it asked questions that made me really think about what I was reading. It also pointed out some specific vocabulary that helped me understand what the author was actually saying. I enjoyed the parent questoins the most because it gave me the opportunity to discuss the book with my mom. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Having a dual form of dyslexia I did not learn to read until later in life. Thus I never read children's books while a child. Maybe that is why I read so many still today. I read this as part of a children's literature course in university.It is an interesting book, about friendship, commitment, compassion, change and death. As such it deals with a lot of the big questions of life in ways a child can grasp.For me the most moving part was when Wilber confessed to Charlotte that he did not like the thought of her as a blood sucker, towards the end of her life. Only true friends can be that open and honest.The book is a powerful tale of true friendship and how our close friends can transform not only us but those around us.(First written as Journal Reading Notes in 1999.)"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"If you are any age you will love this book. Read it and see! Wilbur goes through many things as he gets sick, hurt, and almost killed if not for his friend Charlotte. He also goes to a fair, meets some interesting new friends, and has many adventures. Also, without the rat Templeton, half of the things that happened with her web convince the famer and his wife the he is \\"Terrific\\". I recommend this book to childeren from the ages of eight and up.This book is writtenb in many different voices. one is emotional because, of course, what almost happens to Wilbur. But there is also excitment because Wilbur is a very excited pig. An example of this is when Wilbur first meets Charlotte. He gets very excited. So, the voice in this is mostly excited.This book is aimed to elementary aged childeren but it does have a few words that a young third of forth gradermight not understand. Such as the word ,\\"sendentary\\", but in the book Wilbur asks Charlotte what it means and she responds, \\" Means i sit a good part of the time and don't go wandering all over creation.\\" So this book is age appropraite.This book contains many things. An example of this is when Wilbur first meets Charlotte again. Charlotte tells Wilbur to wait till morning to see her and Wilbur has restless night. Here is a part of that right after Charlotte told him to wait till morning.\\" The night seened long. Wilbur's stomach was empty and his mind was full. ANd when you stomach is empty and your mind is full, it is hard to sleep.\\" This book has humorous parts but also some serious ones too.So I recommend this book to anyone who likes animals and adventure, childeren and s of all ages!"},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Charlotte's Web by E.B. White is a very fun and loving story. This story is about a girl named Fern Arable, who is an ordinary farm girl. Then one day her father sow had piglet's. Soon her father realized that one of them was a runt and decided that it needed to be killed. Though through Fern throwing a fit her father let her keep it as a pet. She went on to name it Wilbur. The pig leaved with her until he was five weeks old. Then her father sold it to the zukermans' family. The pig grew to be sader and sader every day because of his broken heart. Then Darkness settled over everything. Soo there were only shadows and the noised of the sheep chewing their cuds, and occasionally the rattle of a cow-chain up overhead. You can only imagine Wilbur's suprise when, out of the darkness, came a small voice he had never heard before. It sounded rather thin, but pleasant.\\"Do you want a friend Wilbur?\\" it said, \\"I'll be a friend to you. I've watched you all day and I like you.\\" Charlotte and Wilbur became very good friends. They even went on to attend the county fair with each other were everyone loved Wilbur. Though soon Charlotte died, and Wilbur took her eggs she had laid and keep her joy alive. This book is one of the best children literatures I have ever read. All of the characters in this book also play a large part. Some of these characters are Wilbur, the pig, Charlotte A. Cavatica, the spider, Fern Arable, the farmers daughter, Templeton the reat, and many more. Other works of this author are also good and make your imagination run wild. One of the other books by E.b.

This story has great themes about, friendship, animals, life and death, and fighting about something you care for. The characters are well developed and it's a cute fictional story."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"Charlotte's Web is White's classic story about the friendship of a pig, a girl and a spider. Fern saves Wilbur, the runt of the litter, from an untimely death, and hand raises him. When he is too big to stay with Fern, her uncle buys him, with the intent of enjoying pork all winter. Wilbur makes a friend in his new home, an intelligent and kind spider named Charlotte. Charlotte makes it her life's goal to save Wilbur, regardless of the costs to herself. It is a novel of friendship, of life and death, and of the power of the written word.Though White's prose is perfect, it is sometimes clinical, lacking some of the more exciting literary devices that make prose pop and sparkle. His understanding of ten year old girls seems a bit lacking, but his ability to detail farm life and spider behavior make the animal characters and background come alive. I can't help but wish Fern's character had been more rounded out, and that she had played more a part later in the story, but White's focus was on the barnyard and not on the human players.Rereading Charlotte's Web is like visiting an old friend: it stays the same but yet there is always something new as well. This time was no different, and I was newly impressed with White's message on the importance of words and language. As always, I found his depiction of true friendship to be beautiful and moving.Despite any minor complaints I may have, Charlotte's Web is a warm, funny, and real book and deservedly a classic."},{"Title":"Charlotte's Web","review":"After reading Charlotte's Web by E.B. White, I know I would be very excited to use this book in a third grade classroom. The book takes place in a rural town on a farm, and goes through the adventure of a pig named Wilbur and his friends. Wilbur, who was the runt of his litter, makes many friends, most notably, a spider named Charlotte who makes it her mission to save Wilbur from his fate of being butchered. All of the friends Wilbur makes on the farm; the geese, the sheep, and a sneaky rat, each play a vital role in Wilbur's life and ultimately if he is guaranteed to a full and satisfying life as a farm pig. I feel as though this book is full of meaningful morals and is appropriate reading material to be used in a classroom setting. Students can make connections to the text in terms of friendship, animal loving, life and death, and imagination. This book can also be tied to other subjects lessons such as a science lesson on the anatomy and life of spiders. It uses mature vocabulary to describe the parts of a spider, the life span of a spider, and reproduction of spiders. By bringing in a fantasy book for the children, such as Charlotte's Web, children are able to develop and expand their imagination in a fun, safe, and believable manner that is key to social and academic development."},{"Title":"Official history of the Russian-Japanese War: A vivid panorama of land and naval battles","review":"A half-leather book, \\"Graphically Illustrated with Nearly 100 Superb Engravings\\" in black and white \\"consisting of land and naval battles, views of war ships, portraits of Russian and Japanese Commanders, pictures of famous cities, forts, temples, and snap-shots of every-day life.\\"Table of Contents HighlightsThe MikadoThe Growth and Customs of FeudalismRise as a Modern PowerAncient RussiaThe RomanoffsKorea, the Hermit NationSiberia and ManchuriaRussian and Japanese ArmiesAmerican NonCombatantsInitial Stages of the WarThe Attacks on Port ArthurDestruction of the PetropavlovskFirst Land BattlesBattle of KinchouMukdenNaval Engagements"},{"Title":"Homemade Dolls in Foreign Dress","review":"I found this book to be helpful for use with the AMERICAN COSTUME DOLLS:HOW TO MAKE AND DRESS THEM book, also by Nina R.

I personally liked this because I can't really make the paper-and-paste dolls that well, they get too confusing.

I remember making the little manikins out of pipe-cleaner and felt, since I didn't have any stockings or copper wire. They worked just as well, and gave me hours of entertainment.The dolls are darling and easy to make, the ideas for settings and accesories more then fun, and the foreign dress (for the most part) accurate. It's a great book, HOWEVER there is one glaring flaw; the dialog is very racist. If you can get past lines such as 'fish eater' and a pop-eyed, wide mouthed African savage parody, you'll do just fine. I ended up tracing the patterns rather then let my kid sister read the book, first for racism the second for book damage. (Kid sisters are not known to be the best invention for books, however, they mean well and I love them for it.)If this book would be updated, the African 'savage' changed to a more realistic boy in traditional, not sterotyped, foreign dress, it would make a world of difference."},{"Title":"Homemade Dolls in Foreign Dress","review":"\\"Homemade Dolls In Foreign Dress\\" was originally written in 1939.

True, all his great poems had been written but an astonishing life of triumph and tragi-comedy lay ahead. &quot;Coleridge, Darker Reflections&quot; is the long-awaited second half of this award-winning biography of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. It covers the period 1804-1834 - a time when, according to popular belief, Coleridge's fertile imagination had dried up and he faced a slippery slide to an opium-induced decline. But not according to the author Richard Holmes, described as &quot;Our best post-war biographer&quot;. He is a superb story teller and unlike so many biographers before him, deeply in touch with his subject. His first volume, &quot;Coleridge Early Visions&quot; introduced the poet to a new generation of admirers (including myself who was fired into writing a play for children about the poet's early magical years). This wonderful book will surely establish STC as a troubled but gigantic genius of the 19th century. Holme's own genius is to show us Coleridge the man. &quot;Always on the knife edge between tragedy and comedy&quot; said Holmes at the London book launch this week (21st October 1998) Holmes has worked assiduously through STC's vast notebooks. Like his namesake, Sherlock, the author clearly enjoys the detection element of biography. His is a personal search for the man, his millieu and his place. Holmes retraces STC's footsteps around England - echoing the desperate perambulations of the wandering poet. Holmes tells this astonishing story at a cracking pace - he has the thriller-writer's gift for making you turn the page. We follow STC through his Malta years - a wonderful evocation of Coleridge's chaotic life. The years of tragic opium decline in London are brought to life (I challenge you not to cry) - and yet there are so many triumphs - the marvellous late poems that Holmes has championed in an earlier collection, the seminal lectures on Shakespeare, Coleridge the thinker and radical, Coleridge the father (not a very good one), the years of relative happiness in Highgate where we find Coleridge the guru. Above all is Coleridge the man. Holmes as only the greatest biographers can, brings his subject completely to life and shows us why Coleridge was such a tour de force in the Romantic movement and why Byron called Wordsworth &quot;a fixed star&quot; but Coleridge &quot;a meteor&quot;. There is so much to love in this book - it is hard to know what to recommend. If you have never read a biography before, make this your first. If you think you are familiar with the life of STC, this book, so full of new discoveries and insights, will make you reassess the poet. Holmes is clearly enamoured of his subject. It is a book that will make you laugh out loud in places. You will see exactly why Charles Lamb said of his great friend &quot;He is an archangel, damaged.&quot;"},{"Title":"Coleridge: Early Visions","review":"This treatment of Coleridge's early life is excellent in scope & detail; in fact, it won a prize. But its strength-- objectivity-- is its weakness. Holmes expresses no imaginitive sympathy for his subject. He writes about Romanticism with the detatchment of an entymologist examining a butterfly. And while he treats Coleridge's pathology in an overtly psychological manner, he fails to identify the pathologies he describes -- like a doctor who collects symptoms without making a diagnosis.The result is an outstanding example of conventional literary biography, but one that is insensitive to growth, imagination, and mind in the act of making the mind -- or why Coleridge was passionate about them. Those interested in these must seek elsewhere, but this volume remains a good place to learn the facts of Coleridge's life, despite its dry prose."},{"Title":"Coleridge: Early Visions","review":"This is the Coleridge I thought I knew through his poetry. Holmes brings him to life in this first volume of Coleridge's early years. The book makes you wish you had known Coleridge personally and shared in his life. His life is complex and challenging and so it must have been for Holmes to research and write Coleridge's life. In fact, Holmes seems to have a special knowledge into the life of one of the greatest poets of the English language. This book gave me insights into Coleridge's works I had not had before. If you want to learn more about Samuel Taylor Coleridge, his life and his works, this is the book to read."},{"Title":"Coleridge: Early Visions","review":"Somehow Holmes produces scholarly biographies that make compulsive reading. He never fictionalizes or puts thoughts in his subjects' heads that he has no authority for - and yet he keeps us turning those pages. Is it the subjects he choses? Shelley and Coleridge both had strongly &quot;plotted&quot; lives. Coleridge married the sister of Southey's wife and fell in love with the sister of Wordsworth's wife. I liked his comment on Coleridge's father's predecessor in the the benefice of St Mary's Ottery."},{"Title":"Coleridge: Early Visions","review":"Mention Coleridge and you might get the response, \\"Did he write the Ancient Mariner?,\\" or, \\"Wasn't he an opium addict?\\"Samuel Taylor Coleridge did write The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and he was an opium addict. But, as Richard Holmes makes abundantly clear, there was much more to the man.He was an extraordinary man, perhaps the most visionary of the English romantic poets. If that were not enough to warrant attention, he was also a political activist, a journalist and translator, a Unitarian preacher, lecturer, philosopher and energetic walker. My own interest in Coleridge was rekindled when I discovered he was among the founders of Pantisocracy, the movement that brought the Unitarian rationalist and scientist Dr. Joseph Priestley to my home area.This volume, which takes Coleridge up to the age of 31, covers in depth these aspects of his career as well as giving analyses of some of his better known poetry. Holmes does not gloss over the man's failings. He discusses his addiction, the charges of plagiarism, mystic humbug and less than admirable treatment of his wife.Anyone interested in the man and the period will find this book worth the read."},{"Title":"Coleridge: Early Visions","review":"In the first of his two volume biography of Coleridge, Richard Holmes presents an unforgettable portrait of his subject. Coleridge was a notorious talker who could converse on just about anything and, like the Ancient Mariner he created, there was something hypnotic about his monologues (one gets the impression that Coleridge often spoke but rarely engaged in actual conversation). Holmes uses Coleridge's words to shape a stunning portrait. Best of all Holmes captures Coleridge in all his various roles: husband, father, son, lecturer, political activist, student, poet, walker, metaphysician, friend, lover etc. Holmes shows the best and worst of Coleridge in this first volume. Best of all, he has done the research to dispel a number of myths about Coleridge (some of which Coleridge himself started). The one real problem is Holmes seems to give every side of Coleridge the same amount of attention. Simply put, some parts of Coleridge's life were more important and therefore usually of more interest than other parts of it. Despite this minor flaw, Holmes offers a model biography and leaves a vivid impression of his subject."},{"Title":"Coleridge: Early Visions","review":"The general reader and the scholar should enjoy this book.

The series features Chris's introduction to the secular life after resigning from a nunnery after half her life at age 30. Over the course of the prior novels, she \\"ages\\" about half a year per book: she meets NYPD detective Jack (who's a handy official resource to her amateur sleuthing), becomes engaged and marries him, and has a baby, now four-year-old Eddie. The various yarns feature her solving mostly crimes from the past that never received adequate police work, allowing Chris to nose around with unlimited time and questioning until new facts appear in sufficient quantity to unravel long buried truths. The tales are clean family fare, with little or no violence, sex, swearing, or much other unpleasantness other than the crime that spawns the plot per se.This latest entry, \\"Bar Mitzvah\\", starts off so far-fetched, that we were irritated almost from the start. A rich older man, Gabe Gross, decides he wants a proper Bar Mitzvah, and takes 40 friends and relatives to Israel to do it up right. Included is Chris's best girlfriend, Gabe's relative Melanie Gross, who naturally is excited at her impending foreign experience. Just by coincidence (gulp!) Chris's hubby, now a rising star lawyer-officer in the NYPD HQ, gets a special two-week assignment to -- guess where ?!? -- Israel, to coincide with the big celebration. When Gabe first gets sick, then rushed away in an ambulance, only to be the victim of a kidnapping/murder, our favorite busybody gets into her act and beats the apparently inept local police to every clue and every development in solving the case. Just in case there might be a shard of suspense to this fiction, the main plot is interrupted in virtually every chapter with little side trips by all concerned throughout the wonderful landscape of modern Israel and its wonderful biblical settings, visits to the wonderful shops there, meals at the wonderful restaurants there, etc. Get the drift? By the time the whole story comes out, involving a falsified last will and testament and mysterious things found in Gabe's safe back at home in America, we're so tired of the whole thing we just want it over. Only the last 25 pages or so of this plodding 250-page account had us really turning pages out of anything but loyalty.This book smacks of something due to fulfill a contract, and as justification for author Syrell Rogovin Leahy traveling to Israel as \\"research\\" to write off her trip to the homeland of her ancestors. To us, an interesting travelogue it isn't; moreover, the now worldly Chris is getting to be a bit of a bore if you please.We note that Harris has turned to a new character for both the previously published \\"Murder in Hell's Kitchen\\" and her upcoming novel \\"Murder in Alphabet City\\", both featuring NYPD Detective Jane Bauer. Perhaps Lee herself realizes Christine may well have run her course. Although I see (from the author's web site) that at least one more entry is due in the set, we hope she returns to form with a story that grabs and holds our attention. \\"Mitzvah\\" wasn't wretched, just disappointing compared to the rest."},{"Title":"BAR MITZVAH MURDER (CHRISTINE BENNETT)","review":"Christine Bennett's best friend Melanie Gross and her family are going to Jerusalem for the bar mitzvah of her wealthy cousin, Gabe.

Matter of fact, her in-law's agree to come too and take care of their son in a separate hotel. Chris is looking forward to sightseeing with Melanie while her husband is working.Then Gabe goes missing. Apparently at the party the day after the bar mitzvah, Gabe took ill. An ambulance came and took him to a hospital, but no one can find out what hospital he went to. They begin to wonder if it really was an ambulance that arrived. Then he is found dead. Who would want him dead, especially in Jerusalem? Could it be one of the family members he brought with him?Chris begins to investigate. Melanie assists her while she is still in Jerusalem. Joshua Davidson, the policeman Jack was working with, assisted Chris with some information. Plus Jack contacted some people in his precinct to assist with information from home.Chris puts herself in some harrowing situations. Can she figure out this mystery before she goes home? Is it tied to events happening at home?Chris is such a great character. I always enjoy reading a new book in this series. The relationship between her and Jack has really grown. I like that he helps her and encourages her in the investigations while still asking that she stay safe.Melanie and Chris make a great team. It is nice to have Melanie help more with the investigation this time.Once again Chris (an ex-nun) calls Sister Joseph back at the convent for advice and guidance in her investigation.I highly recommend you read this book and the rest of the series."},{"Title":"BAR MITZVAH MURDER (CHRISTINE BENNETT)","review":"I have just finished reading The Bar Mitzvah Murder and found it to be one of the best in the entire Christine Bennett series. The plot is lively and dynamic, yet the atmosphere is 'cozy.' The setting is refreshingly different, and the heroine is focused on adventure rather than on the particulars of her daily life as wife and mother (a bit too much of that in the other books). She is tougher and less sentimental, too. I look forward to more Christine Bennett books where she will get away from home and go to interesting places, with or without her husband, to solve her cases."},{"Title":"BAR MITZVAH MURDER (CHRISTINE BENNETT)","review":"Recently, versatile Lee Harris gave her fans a much grittier, extremely intriguing change of pace with &quot;Murder in Hell's Kitchen&quot; which introduced police detective, Jane Bauer, coping handily with mayhem and murder in The Big Apple. Although Ms. Harris' latest novel, &quot;The Bar Mitzvah Murder&quot;, takes us back to her established series characters: Christine Bennett (former nun turned amateur sleuth) and her policeman husband, Jack Brooks, it too represents something of a departure from her usual suburban focus which makes it, I think, one of the strongest and most moving novels in the 'Holiday Mysteries' to date. After a rough patch of several years while Jack struggled to balance his responsibilities to NYPD with night classes at law school, things are finally looking up for the Brooks family. When the novel opens, degree in hand and newly-promoted to a lieutenancy, Jack comes home with the astonishing news that the Police Commissioner has personally assigned him to a joint American/Israeli task force aimed at tracking down international criminals and that creating a database for this project will entail a two-week trip to Israel...a trip which can and will also include Christine and their young son, Eddie. Thrilled by the prospect of fulfilling her life-long desire to visit the Holy Land, icing on the cake for Christine is knowing that her trip overseas will overlap a visit by close friends, Mel and Hal Gross, who have been invited...all expenses paid...to attend Mel's wealthy cousin Gabe Gross' late-life Bar Mitzvah being held in Jerusalem just prior to the Brooks' arrival. So much for dream vacations! Still fighting jet-lag, Christine receives a frantic yelp for help from a thoroughly panicked Mel: Gabe has disappeared! According to witnesses, he had left his party, was found lying on the ground outside the hotel, and while a doctor member of the family tried to administer CPR, an ambulance came and whisked him away. Problem? The ambulance never arrived at any of the local hospitals. While Jack uses his connection with the Israeli police to jump start an investigation, Christine focuses her attention on the immediate family only to discover that genial Gabe was not averse to sharp dealings, had a troubled marital history and had managed to completely alienate his adult children. After Gabe's body turns up DOA some days later, Christine subjugates sightseeing to sleuthing. The cops now know how he died...it's up to her to discover why and who. As usual, following in her footsteps while she does so makes for a thoroughly satisfying and completely enjoyable reading experience.I always finish a Lee Harris novel with a smile on my face. In addition to the fun and excitement of tagging along during their well-plotted, intricate investigations, connecting with Jack and Christine's world and becoming part of their extended family is always such a pleasure. Lagniappe for me in &quot;The Bar Mitzvah Murder&quot; was a chance to not just see, but genuinely experience Israel vicariously while I shared their working vacation. Emis! They were absolutely delightful travel companions."},{"Title":"The Castle in Medieval England and Wales","review":"This book contains tons of illustrations of castle layouts and is an excellent source of information on castle architecture. It's focus is on the buildings themselves, rather than the social history, as Francis Gies' Life in a Medieval Castle is. If I had one complaint about the book, it's that some of the photographs are too dark, you loose details. It could just be my copy. But it's very noticable next to the nice, crisp line drawings."},{"Title":"The Jim-Jams","review":"The Jimjams is an awesome scifi horror novel. I honestly didn't expect much, but this reeled me in with the gruesome descriptions and sudden twist on the characters. Little is explained outright, and you get the chilling answers the more you read. It's a sinister, macabre novel that takes the cliched insects-taking-over-the-world theme and turns it back into raw meat. I like it the more I think about it.Definitely a sick novel though, filled with violence and wierd sexual stuff, which makes the novel even more creepier, rather than detracting from it.Overall, a frightening plunge into everyone's worst fears, that is both straight-forward but with excellent little hints dropped throughout the story, filled with everday people with everyday problems. It's entirely worthy of a sequel."},{"Title":"The Jim-Jams","review":"The actual rating is pretty close to a 5, but I felt that Mr. Green's later work Dry Skull Dreams was superior. Still, Jim Jams is a beautifully surreal,grittily unsentimental novel about nothing more than simple evolution...in this case the first arrival on Earth of a \`superior' insect-based alien race and the beginning of the human race's sublimation into it. Because Green doesn't indulge in typical expository sequences that explain developments in simple terms - a la King or Koontz - the average reader may find him hard to get. Reminiscent of early Clive Barker in its explicitness:not for the faint of heart."},{"Title":"The Jim-Jams","review":"Michael Green's the Jim Jams is a surreal and entertaining novel.His descriptions of the takeover of the resort are positively unsettling.Uncovers the fears that all of us share in one form or another of the unknown.Although I agree with one of the previous reviewers that Green's Dry Skull Dreams is a superior novel to this one regardless what my friend that gave me the two books thinks, nonetheless I enjoyed this work immensely and recommend it to anyone with a taste for creepy horror books."},{"Title":"The Jim-Jams","review":"Okay, the writing is uneven, diffusive, and dull. Green tries to be funny but ends up being stupid. The monsters are a miasma of bits and pieces of Lovefraftian-style critters, and their descriptions are really lousy. No one, not even the author, seems to know what the plot is or what motivates these critters, making this a lousy C Movie, like the kind that The Sci-Fi Channel puts out. Indeed, bad writing equals turgid plotting, dull characters, plus trivial dialogue -- which is the losing formula for many cheesy sci-fi horror B-flicks, as well as for this story.Conclusion: I'm only marginally relieved that I paid $2.02 for this book. That's because I still feel as if my $2.02 has been wasted. END"},{"Title":"Cocoa Recipes for Mac OS X","review":"This book takes an unusual approach that some people seem to like and others don't. The entire book is devoted to building a single Cocoa application, step by step. Each step builds on what has come before, so you really can't jump around in the book at all. And the book is entirely example-driven; there is very little text talking about higher-level concepts, principles and design. If you learn best by example, and you want to see a large, high-quality application in Cocoa built from the ground up, then this book might be very good for you. Others will probably find it frustrating."},{"Title":"Cocoa Recipes for Mac OS X","review":"Cocoa Recipes for Mac OS X is a great guide for anyone interested in writing applications for MAC OS X.

Lots of code examples show you how to implement tabbed views, menus, drawers and a whole slew of other user-controls.One outstanding feature this book provides (and should be standard in every programming book) is a Table of Topics. This table immediately follows the table of contents and provides an alphabetical list of controls, objects, and major classes from the Cocoa Framework and where in the book to find examples on coding these items.

There is a lot of information packed in this text- unlike some, there are really very few figures and pictures and there is an awful lot of explanatory text and digressions as new concepts arise. The main problem I have with the approach here is that it takes a _long_ time between successive builds of the application. In fact, one must plow through 70+ pages before even getting to the first time you are told to build an executable of what you have been working on. This really goes counter to the Cocoa paradigm of ease of application construction- I much prefer a more experimental approach in which small incremental changes are made to the application, so that the effect of new features can be appreciated right away. Here, by the time you rebuild the application, a lot of time has passed since you coded the features, so the connection between the code and the app feature is not so immediate or clear. Also, if there are bugs from your typing, it is hard to fix your app as it has been a long time since a previous build, so for someone new to Cocoa, it can be hard to know where to look for the errors."},{"Title":"Cocoa Recipes for Mac OS X","review":"This is an excellent programming cook book.

Yet it wasn't until many years later that I read his own account \\"Of Plymouth Plantation\\" which was written during the years 1620 - 1642. The sense of adventure and human drama found in this book are very gripping despite the often florid style of language used at the time. Once can't help get caught up in these people's struggles and imagine how difficult it must have been for them in so many ways before during and after their treacherous 2 1/2 month sea voyage. I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in history as it was written concurrent with what was happening and by someone who was instrumental in creating this history. One does not have to be directly descended from the Pilgrims to find this story compelling.

Bradford wrote the story of the Pilgrims as a journal for his family, to be passed down through the generations. (It's own history of how it got out of the family, was lost for many decades, where it was found and how restored to Plymouth is a fascinating story in itself.)Bradford was one of my 7th great-great grandfathers, Elder Wm.

I just bought 3 more...to give to my children and their kids for Thanksgiving...and it will be shown here after our VERY traditional Thanksgiving dinner.We all benefit from the sacrifices and perseverance of the Pilgrims.

However, I was deeply impressed on the field of Semitic and Indo-European etymology because of this book. I have also Hermann Mueller's &quot;Vergleichendes indogermanisch-semitisches Woerterbuch&quot; published by Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht (This one is available in amazon.de, Germany). Hermann Mueller's is really valuable one. But it is just a dictionary.However, Mr. Saul Levin's works are especially interesting. Being the Distinguished Professor of Ancient Languages, State University of New York, he made such great achievements in Semitic and Indo-European Etymology.This Book has more than 514 pages, including major contents, bibliographical references, Index of Scholars,Index of Languages, Index of Grammatical or Linguistic Terms, especially well arranged Linguistc Forms, and so forth.The major contents consist of the etymology of Non-verbal Nouns(Chapter I),Verbal Roots (Chapter II), Pronouns (Chapter III), Prepositions (Chapter IV), and Numerals(Chapter V).

On those terms it is successful, but it has rather less charm than is usual with Berkeley, largely because (uncharacteristically), he chose to load this little book with a heavy dose of right wing imperialist apologetics. The result is that this a rather dated, and often a rather irritating novel."},{"Title":"Death in the House","review":"This is the second Anthony Berkeley book I have read; and like the first (\\"Layton Court Mystery\\"), it is a good example of the British \\"Country House\\" type --- except that in this case the \\"House\\" is the House of Commons, where a series of ministers are murdered while trying to introduce a very controversial bill. Berkeley is a good story-teller. The action moves at a quick pace and reaches a dramatic crescendo in a wild scene, the likes of which are more typical of a Tom Clancy thriller than the sedate suspects-gathered-in-the-library format we expect. My only problem is that, as in the Layton Court Mystery, the identity of the murderer is pretty obvious about 80% into the story -- so much so in fact that I assumed that the give-away clue was an obvious plant to mislead the reader. It wasn't. But the plot is still a good one; and the book entertains from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Dreamers of the Valley of Plenty: A Portrait of the Napa Valley","review":"I have not yet finished the book, but the rating stars can only increase.

She is able to bring to life twelfth-century England, mixing monastic daily life with the very real threat of murder and mayhem, which there seems to be a lot of in the town of Shrewsbury. \\"Dead Man's Ransom\\" is the ninth chronicle of Cadfael's sojourns into sleuthing and it offers readers a unique mystery.With border clashes an ongoing problem between the English and Welsh, a young Welsh prisoner is brought to Shrewsbury. Hugh Beringar is now in charge of the town since his sheriff has been captured by the Welsh. He hopes to exchange his prisoner for his sheriff, which he manages to do, but not before complications arise. For the sheriff's daughter falls in love with the prisoner, and they know that her father's return will tear them apart. Shortly after the sheriff returns, he is found murdered in the abbey where he had been recovering from his wounds. The likeliest suspect is the young prisoner who had everything to gain if the sheriff was out of his way, and now he must try to clear his name on foreign soil.\\"Dead Man's Ransom\\" is a quick-paced read and an interesting mystery that may keep readers guessing. At times Peters' prose is weighed down with too much effort at capturing twelfth-century English turns of phrases, but Brother Cadfael is a unique detective and one that keeps readers interested."},{"Title":"Dead Man's Ransom: The Ninth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael","review":"In the tenth installment of the ever-so-popular Brother Cadfael series, author Ellis Peters proves a winner once again with \\"Dead Man's Ransom.\\"Set in the year 1141, civil war runs amok in Britain between King Stephen and the Empress Maud, and it appears that the end of the twelve year old struggle is in sight. The war has taken its toll in many areas, as civil wars do, and the people are quite weary of it all. Maud's forces, however, now have captured the king himself. The sheriff of Shropshire, too, has been taken captive. This means, in those days, that in all likelihood an exchange of prisoners will take place.Alas, one of the captives is now dead and it is our Brother Cadfael who senses that, indeed, it is murder, and, just as naturally as Peters would have it, it is he who is given the responsibility to solve the case and to try to bring about the release of the king.Brother Cadfael is the former crusader now a Benedictine monk, who specializes in herbal medicines, solving murders, and compassion. Peters (Edith Pargeter) has developed her Cadfael through this series of medieval whodunits into a man of the cloth easily admired and respected. He is a man of firm, and devout, principles; a man who seems to carry the weight of the shire on his own Welch-born shoulders!Peters has made grand the area of Shropshire, and especially the town of Shrewsbury there on the Welch borders. She has also created an exciting family of literary characters to complement Cadfael: Hugh Beringar (deputy sheriff of the shire and Cadfael's closest friend) and his wife Aline, Abbot Radulfus (the venerable patriarch of the abbey, and other members of the abbey. It is not essential that this series be read from the start (with \\"A Morbid Taste for Bones\\"), as this book could easily be read first and it would still hold up as a book on its own; however, readers generally will want to read them in order, as the presentation of character, of historical events, of character-interaction does show development in the series' genealogy. Peters died a few years ago and apparently there are no more Cadfael episodes aside from the twenty or so published, but each of the books extant bring the reader a treasure of reading adventures.Billyjhobbs@tyler.net"},{"Title":"Dead Man's Ransom: The Ninth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael","review":"Ellis Peters is in a class by herself. Before her death at the age of 82 in 1995, she wrote a series of 20 mysteries set in England and Wales during the 12th Century. (She also wrote many other books under her real name, Edith Pargeter.) In the Cadfael mysteries, her &quot;detective&quot; is a former Crusader who has decided to spend his last years as a monk in a monastery in Shrewsbury. I have found the Brother Cadfael in the books to be far more interesting than the Brother Cadfael of the television series. Many of the books in the Cadfael series are as much (or more) historical romances as they are mysteries. Don't start any book in this series unless you enjoy a strong dose of romance and medieval English history mixed with mystery. The Cadfael series (like most good series) is more enjoyable if the books are read in sequence. Dead Man's Ransom is the ninth book in the series.In Dead Man's Ransom, Brother Cadfael is called upon to solve the murder of the Sheriff of Shropshire, Gilbert Prescote. Suspicion falls on a Welsh captive and on others who have a grudge against the stern sheriff. Cadfael's investigation is hampered by Welsh raids along the border and by continued strife within England."},{"Title":"Dead Man's Ransom: The Ninth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael","review":"With the civil war raging between King Stephen and the Empress Maud, Welsh raiders make a move towards attacking the convent at Godric's Ford, leaving one of their number in the hands of the nuns.

The trade goes smoothly enough, until Sheriff Prestcote is found murdered in his room. Now it is up to Brother Cadfael to find out who murdered the Sheriff and why.This is the ninth book in veteran author Ellis Peters' twenty-one novels starring Brother Cadfael. This is a very good book, with a perplexing mystery and lots of interesting characters. As with all of the Brother Cadfael books, this one is not only a great mystery but is also a great work of historical fiction.If you have not read any of the other Brother Cadfael books, that's quite all right, you can read this one as a stand-alone novel, and enjoy it immensely.

Then, I found out that not all the novels had been used. There are 7 (really 8 as one was not followed all that well) left over - not counting the related book of three short stories. The novel here, Dead Man's Ransom, is the first of the novels not used for TV which is the ninth in the overall series of the Cadfael chronicles/novels.I enjoyed the book, but it seemed to start off a little slow and some of the \\"expressions\\" used were a little hard for me to understand - maybe you have to be British. In any case, things do pick up and there are numerous plot twists/surprises along the way to keep things interesting. The author managed to do a lot in only a short number of pages - 190 in the edition I read.I did manage to figure out who the killer was before it was \\"announced\\", but maybe it was pretty easy by that point as there were a lot of clues by then. There is at least one other crime as well which was resolved in a somewhat \\"unexpected\\" way. Some may think the ending a bit of a cop out, but at least it is a happy one.I look forward to the other 6 or 7 novels remaining for me."},{"Title":"Dead Man's Ransom: The Ninth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael","review":"During the course of the ongoing civil war between the followers of King Stephen of England and his rival to the throne, Empress Maud, Sheriff Gilbert Prescote of Shrewsbury, is wounded and taken prisoner by the Welsh. An exchange of prisoners is agreed upon, with Elis, a young member of the Welsh nobility, at present in the hands of Deputy Sheriff Hugh Beringar, to be exchanged for Prescote. The wounded Sheriff is returned to his home in a litter and placed in the infirmary at the Abbey of St.Peter and St.Paul, in the care of Brother Cadfael. Less than a day later, Prescote is smothered in his sleep, leaving the finger of suspicion pointing at Elis, who was seen entering the sick man's room. Elis had fallen madly in love with Melicent, daughter of Sheriff Prescote and intended to ask for permission to marry her, but is shattered when she declares him a murderer and wants nothing more to do with him. Among the Welsh soldiers who returned the Sheriff to Shrewsbury is Eliud, cousin and foster brother to Elis, and who is ordered by Owain Gwynned, a prince of Wales, to remain in Shrewsbury until the murderer is found and brought to justice. Marauding bands of outlaws, taking full advantage of the state of civil unrest which exists because of the war, burn and plunder neighbouring farms and threaten even a local convent, so Beringar joins forces with their previous enemy, the Welsh, to restore order to the area. The rather convoluted love stories between the two Welsh noblemen and their chosen ladies becomes so threatened by war, murder and danger from the law that happy endings seem impossible and would have been, without the clever assistance of Cadfael who finds the murderer from the most minute clues and once again ensures a happy ending."},{"Title":"Dead Man's Ransom: The Ninth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael","review":"I am an avid fan of the Cadfael series and I enjoyed this book very much. The ending is terrific, though some people may not agree with me. Am deducting one star because of the character of Millicent Prescote. She is extremely disloyal and changeable. I truly wondered at the end if her marriage will be a happy one."},{"Title":"Dead Man's Ransom: The Ninth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael","review":"Elis ap Cynan is a young Welsh nobleman captured during a border clash with the neighboring English, brought to Shewsbury for a prisoner exchange. He's to be traded for Shrewsbury's sheriff, Gilbert Prestcote, who must be brought on a litter from Wales because Prestcote is recovering from battle wounds. Young Elis pretends to know no English, and merrily insults his captors in Welsh, until Brother Cadfael is called in to deal with the noble captive. Cadfael of course quickly proves that Elis both speaks and understands English, and he just as quickly develops sympathy for the young man. When Elis falls in love with Melicent, daughter of Gilbert Prestcote, things go awry with Prestcote's death shortly after he is brought to Shewsbury but before the exchange can take place. The Welsh commander proudly declares that he cannot use a dead man to ransom Elis, and Cadfael complicates matters further by seeing evidence that Prestcote was murdered - not dead from his wounds combined with the stresses of the journey. Elis was the last person to see Prestcote alive, visiting the sleeping invalid in hope of pressing his suit with Melicent's father. So he now finds himself accused of the murder; and Melicent turns from declaring her own love to hating Elis, and wanting nothing more to do with him.Such is the tangled web that faces Cadfael, who with his friend Deputy Sheriff Hugh Beringar takes on the task of finding the killer and thus clearing Elis. The young Welshman's cousin and foster brother, Eliud, is among the soldiers accompanying Prestcote; and Cadfael soon learns that the girl who has been betrothed to Elis since they were infants loves Eliud, not Elis. It's a betrothal that Eliud, despite returning Cristina's love, determines to respect - but now Elis wants to be free from it so he can marry Melicent. First, though, he has to clear his name so he can win Melicent back.The politics of the age drive much of the plot in this book, and they can be complicated. The human element never gets lost, but at times it does seem - well - a bit overshadowed. This isn't my favorite Brother Cadfael tale, but it is both a well written historical novel and a deftly plotted murder mystery. Enjoyable overall.--Reviewed by Nina M.

It is no surprise that the creator of this sensitive, beautiful children's book is also the creator of an Emmy-Award winning animated children's series.Each page is a work of art, filled with eye-popping, colorful, original characters. The MOON is a great character for children, and my grandchildren loved this book. As a grandfather and a writer, I am delighted with the subtle, positive messages that are expressed in the story. It shows the importance of taking responsibility for one's actions. It also illustrates the role of good manners in life, as realized by the main character. While only a short story, it is rich with positive, natural examples for children.Joe Murray brings the MOON and other characters to life on every page, including the cover, which glows in the dark! As a grandfather, this book is now a part of my developing repertory of stories for my grandchildren. Thank you, Joe Murray. What will the MOON do next?"},{"Title":"Who Asked the Moon to Dinner?","review":"When Isaac invites the Moon to be his guest at his Aunt Fay and Uncle Snog's house, the luminary guest arrives as the largest, rudest visitor anyone has ever met!

That's when poor Mr. Moon admits he had never been asked to dinner before and didn't know what to do. Isaac offers to teach Mr. Moon how to behave and this unique and remarkable picturebook story ends with Uncle Snog remarking as to how Mr. Moon had so improved into being a lovely guest that perhaps they should invite the Sun to breakfast!

Browning, American Gunmaker: A Illustrated Biography of the Man and His Guns","review":"John Browning is one of the greatest firearms designers the world has ever known. Many of his designs are still in production over one hundred years after they were first sold. Some of these like the 1911A1 45 caliber pistol, which is approaching 100 years of continuous production, are still considered the benchmark from which all other semi automatic pistols are judged. As evidence of his genius, some of his machine guns and pistols he designed for the US Army are still are issued by various branches of the US Military and used in the Iraq war 80 years after his death.To give the reader more of an idea of the importance of this person in firearms design, every lever action rifle, machinegun, and semi auto shotgun rifle or handgun made in the last 100 plus years incorporates a variation of or direct copy a Browning patent in the design. Even the Soviet AK-47 has design features which are taken directly from his patents.Whether you like guns or not or just interested in the historical aspect, this is a very good book on the subject. Not only does this book cover John Browning's life as a prolific gun maker and inventor and to some extent his father, it also covers his life as a child and a young man as well as accounts of how his firearms effected the history of a new nation. This is also to a certain extent a historical look at a segment the early American west and the Mormon migration to Utah.This is a a great book and very well written I highly recomend it."},{"Title":"John M. Browning, American Gunmaker: A Illustrated Biography of the Man and His Guns","review":"If you ever wanted to know about the history of some of thee most famouse and influential firearms in U.S. history, this is the book for you.Excellent information regarding JMB's life, his inventions and some of his greatest triumphs. Truly an amazing man.The end of the book is probably the best resource I've seen for Browning firearms."},{"Title":"John M. Browning, American Gunmaker: A Illustrated Biography of the Man and His Guns","review":"As a docent at the Browning Firearms Museum in Ogden, UT I research everything I can find to increase my ability to educate people who are interested in the history of John M. Browning and his genius in inventing firearms. This book is a great history about Mr. Browning. Many people do not realize that Mr. Browning was born in Ogden, UT, lived his entire life here, raised his family here, all of his 128 patents were invented in Ogden, and he is buried in Ogden. People are astounded that someone out in the Utah Territory (It was not a state at the time) could invent such firearms. These firearms literally changed the course of world history in defending our freedoms starting in 1895, then WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, and even today our defenders of freedom are using weapons he invented 100 years ago in the field of battle. This book does an excellent job in bringing Mr. Browning's history and genius to life. This particular book is the first edition printed in 1964, subsequent editions contain more information and reviews."},{"Title":"The Nothing Things","review":"The premise for this story is fantastic - a bunch of &quot;young&quot; girls are taught by their sorority sisters. But what happened to the story? At a point very quickly into the story (10 pages), the author seems to lose interest, and the book just wallows along. There is also very little erotocism. This is a fast food book. Frankly, a reader would be better of with any of the Emmanuelle series or The Story of O. While the stories are different, the writing is far superior, and at least the authors complete a thought."},{"Title":"The Nothing Things","review":"If you like to read about deserving girls getting their backsides paddled, birched and caned then &quot;The Nothing Things&quot; is a great book to start with. There are tons of spanking scenes and very little sex, which is personally the way I like it. So whether you're an &quot;s&quot; or an &quot;m&quot; you'll like this book! Also try, &quot;Presented in Leather&quot;, &quot;Our Scene&quot; and &quot;Love Lessons&quot;. All these titles are available with Amazon."},{"Title":"The Nothing Things","review":"I can see that others found this book exciting, but to me this was an all time low.I don't see the piont in naming pure sadism erotica. Punishment and no passion. Torture and no sex. Pleeding girls and merciless mistresses.In BDSM sexual fantasies, the punishment should be part of a sexual thrill which consequently leads to hot sex, concensual or not. At least that's my idea about this genre.So, if you like spanking, spanking and spanking, this is it. If you like BDSM sexual fantasies, find something else!"},{"Title":"The Nothing Things","review":"... But most of the erotica involves these two fetishes, so if your looking for straight sex, you won't find much here. Since I'm a certified hard-core spanko, I was very turned on by the focus on the humiliation and suffering of the girls. The best part is the caning of three of the girls at once -- and the amazing consequences for the two who give up first."},{"Title":"Roswell: A New Beginning","review":"My opinion of this book is pretty simple: Just plain horrible. You can't even completely blame the author because there were too many typos to count. But falling on the author(and editor)is that the material had not been proofed. I would hope that if you write a book about something that you have researched the details. I also remember on an episode from second season when Isabel is talking with Max about leaving for college and mentioning that she could change the value of money. I have to point out that in a section of the book when Michael, Max and Isabel are outside painting,Max is recalling a time back when he was thirteen and they were painting with his dad. Dad said he was glad Michael could join them but on one of the episodes Max and Isabel's mom had mentioned that she was surprised to never have met Michael before.Also, HOW MANY TIMES CAN THE AUTHOR HAVE MARIA CALL MICHAEL SPACEBOY?"},{"Title":"Roswell: A New Beginning","review":"As a Roswell fan, I was extremely excited to see this book come out, picking up right where Season 3 left off, telling the story of Max, Liz, Michael, Maria, Isabel, and Kyle, after they fled Roswell from the FBI Special Unit. Apparently, this takes place before Max and Liz get married, because she is referred to as Max's girlfriend in the book. So, that gives you an idea of the timeframe.Unfortunately, I found this book to be extremely disappointing for three main reasons:1) The plot of the book is EXTREMELY slow. They end up with their van broken down in this small town out in the middle of nowhere just one day out of Roswell. They have to get jobs to earn money to fix the car. In the meantime, there are these references to girls disappearing. That pretty much goes on for all but the last four or five chapters of the book. The set up for the main action of the story is just way too long, and causes it to drag. Most of the book is mainly Kyle trying to fix the van, while a jealous mechanic named Gomer (ha, ha) doesn't like the way he looks at his girlfriend; Max, Isabel, and Michael paint a restaraunt and play some cards; Liz and Maria wait tables at the restaraunt and pitty a local boy who's sister is missing. That's it until chapter nineteen or twenty.2) This story was full of plot holes from the time they broke down in the small town. The author really needed to study the show more closely for information about Max's, Isabel's, and Michael's powers. Supposedly, they have to get jobs to make money to fix the van. But Isabel indicated in an episode of Roswell she could change the denominations of money (in one of the late season two eps, after Alex's death, during a conversation she had with Michael). So, why didn't they just change their one dollar bills into one hundreds? The reason for them being stuck in the town, as a result, did not fit for me in the first place. Plus, I still think one of the pod squad could have just fixed the engine, as indicated in Season three when Kyle was bringing Isabel engine parts for her to use her powers on to fix (see episode \\"I Married an Alien\\"). Add to that the fact that the author's time references for past events were all wrong. For instance, the incident in which Max and Michael infiltrate an Air Force base to save an Air Force pilot who collided with Tess' ship was referred to. This event was placed at a couple of days before graduation. That couldn't be, considering that a week (at least) passed between Tess's return in the next episode and Max giving up his child at the end of that episode. This was only one of several references to past events in which the timeline was wrong. To the average reader, these might not be major sticking points. But to a Roswell fan, they stick out as plot holes, and since Roswell fans make up most of the readers for this book-well, it kind of hurts its quality.3) The whole alien monsters coming down in a ship and taking women was like something out of a 1950's science fiction film. \\"Mars Needs Women\\" kept popping into my head, referring to the title of a cheesy 1960's Sci-Fi picture. Plus, when Max and Michael attack the ship, the evil aliens try and shoot some kind of ray gun at them (I wonder if it looked like a hairdryer, just like in the old Flash Gordon serials). The description of the monsters made them sound like the Creatures From the Black Lagoon (green, scaley, clawed). This whole plot device just seemed so hokey.That being said, there are really two things that still make this book one a Roswell fan would still want to pick up and read once. First, the first couple of chapters, in which Liz has a vision of the future described by Future Max in the episode \\"End of the World\\" is very compelling. Liz's revelation of this long kept secret to Max and the others also makes for some interesting dialogue. Second, though the whole alien monsters abducting women plot device is rather cheesy, the action in the last few chapters of the book is pretty good. Max, Michael, and Kyle taking down the alien bad guys was fun, and it showed how the first two had really come to accept Kyle as their friend and comrade (thus, good exploration of character development). Add on a few comical moments (like when the guys try and explain the Godfather to the girls), and you get an okay read. But(I'm sorry to say) a very disappointing and poorly constructed one."},{"Title":"Roswell: A New Beginning","review":"I was thrilled to discover that the series was being continued, if only through the written word, and I would have loved to be able to give it 5 stars. I freely admit that I am a true Roswellian and have been reading fanfiction regarding this series for the past couple of years. As a result I could hardly help but enjoy this SUBJECT. However, getting past the fact that I am a fan of the show and Metz's books, I had a very difficult time enjoying the actual BOOK. The plot was slow, but forgiveably so as it did a decent job of getting into the characters' minds. I really enjoyed the growth and importance of Liz's abilities. I also enjoyed the fact that they decided to stop running and to use their abilities.The difficult part came in the reading. I am a college graduate who is currently going through the masters program. (The only reason I even say this is to let you know that I know what I am writing about.) I am well known for my writing and editing abilities but was prepared for a teenage writing level as that seems to be the focus demographic. I certainly was not prepared for this. The punctuation was terrible, the spelling was a disaster, and the grammar was atrocious. The discontinuity between the author's statements and the show, not to mention the page by page disparity found within the writer's own storyline (like the money brought up in the first section), is appalling. I cannot applaud a book whose storyline is disturbed by the fact that I have to read and reread the same statements in an effort to figure out what the author was trying to say because the author didn't write it decently. At best I could call this a fanfiction PRE-editor. However, this is a book that cost me $6, and not a free fanfiction that I could have found on the web at a myriad of sites and that I could have read more easily and enjoyed more completely. This was supposedly a professional work.That said, I want to restate that the plot was a decent one, and that there were some bright spots to it. I would definitely suggest this book to any other Roswell fans for three reasons. One, it is another item that can be added to your library. Two, it is a decent plot if you can ignore the way it was put together. Three (and this is the most important), WE WANT MORE ROSWELL and if we are going to get more we are forced to support any effort, regardless of its quality.I don't want to tell the author to never write again. Just next time (and if it is based on Roswell, I'll probably still read it), be more careful, think through your story more completely, and get it edited by people who actually know how to edit."},{"Title":"Roswell: A New Beginning","review":"I was a bit startled that the book picks up the story a mere few hours after they left Roswell. I was thinking that Max and Liz would be married and they would have been on the road for some time. Of course, since they were on the road only a few hours, there was no time for them to get married. I hope they will be in the next book.I had a few problems with the book, one of them being the incredibly numerous typos. Didn't anyone proofread this book? Also, I couldn't stop wondering why they didn't just take some paper and change it into 20 dollar bills. They did with plane tickets in the 3rd season episode \\"Interruptus\\" and that seemed to work just fine. Also I was unsatisfied that there was no real resolution. What were the aliens doing? Who were they?However, I overall liked the book. It was kind of refreshing to see what happens after they leave Roswell, kind of like getting a season 4. The relationship stuff was all good, although I'm irritated at Maria. I like how Michael was thinking about how hestayed on the planet for her. Those two need to have a serious talk and she needs to apologize for how she treated him in season 3. Max and Liz are happy, so I'm happy. I wish Isabel wasn't actually married to Jesse, so then eventually she and Kyle could end up together. At the end of season 2, I really thought they would end up together, and now it seems like that's the best thing to do.I'm a bit disappointed that these new books are not a continuing series with cliffhangers at the end like the Melinda Metz books. Still, though, any Roswell is good with me, as long as they don't kill off any of these remaining six characters. If you likeRoswell at all, read this book!"},{"Title":"Roswell: A New Beginning","review":"this is the first roswell book that dares to venture where the tv show left off last year. it finds our 6 friends on the road and in deep thought about their future. all of a sudden liz has a dream of the future where max and the 2 aliens are killed in the future. this also comes along the time the van breaks down outside of a small town where females have been disappearing. vowing to help people instead of trying to protect themselves, they delve head first into the live of the small town and they are in for an adventure they could not believe possible in such a small place. this book is for any disappointed roswell fan who was as upset as i was that the show was cancelled and the last 6 episodes were obviously thrown together in haste as the network pulled the plug. i hope authors such as this one keep the faith alive and keep writing books for many years to come."},{"Title":"Roswell: A New Beginning","review":"I'm only about a third of the way through this book, but I have to say I'm EXTREMELY disappointed in the proof-reading and editing. Three major errors in the first 12 pages is rediculous.The author can't even get the timing right. He indicates that Max and Michael have known each other for 18 years before leaving Roswell. They were six when they came out of the pods and weren't reunited for two years after that. This makes only 10 or 11 years together. Not 18. (although I would agree to 12 if you want to count the day wandering in the desert together.)It's so filled with errors, I'd think it was a vanity press edition of a fan-fiction. Although I've read better fan-fiction, too.There are some good points, but in general, I'm not at all impressed."},{"Title":"Roswell: A New Beginning","review":"I purchased Roswell : A New Beginning and the 3 subsequent titles of the new series to satisfy my curiosity after the TV series was unjustly axed. It would be interesting to know if these novels are in anyway based on the direction the TV series would have taken.I was not expecting a literary masterpiece which this title isn't. It does capture the characters quite well and I am willing to overlook most of the plot discrepancies and typos that other reviewers have mentioned. One thing that does annoy me is the mess the author made in regards to the problems with their van as it becomes a major aspect of the plot when it breaks down.It is described as a 60s Volkswagen van (a Kombi) yet the author has Kyle walk to the front of the van to inspect the motor and then describes problems with the belts, hoses (I assume the author meant water hoses) and timing chain.Sorry to tell you this Kevin Ryan but the motor is in the back of the van, it has one belt that wouldn't prevent the van from starting and the hoses only direct air for the heating as the motor is air cooled. Also there is no timing chain in these motors, they use gears to drive the camshaft. A dropped valve would have been a more convincing scenario for the novel.Before you think that is all, the wrecked van next to the garage is described as having an alternator - wrong. Old Kombis have a generator. Then later on the van breaks a spring which is OK but no 60s VWs use the coil springs described, they are fitted with torsion bars. A break in these would be obvious by the entire front of the van having dropped but not visible by looking at them as they are sealed in a metal tube.I am assuming that the author may have had a Ford or Chevy van in mind whilst writing this novel but changed the brand to match the van used in the final episode of the TV series. If this is not the case I would certainly think twice before getting my car serviced at Harbor Auto Repair (see thanks page). Perhaps I am being a bit picky as I used to work in a specialist Volkswagen garage and the average reader of this novel would not be any the wiser to the errors.In the end I did wonder why Kyle just didn't get Max or Isabel to fix the broken parts once he had removed them from the engine and once they could see what needed to be done.Overall I am pleased the series is continuing, at least in book form, and I quite enjoyed the read. The recent rumours of a Roswell movie to finish off the series is great news, however the books will have to do for the time being."},{"Title":"Roswell: A New Beginning","review":"So what happens to them after they drive off?

This book lacked a lot of key things that makes me a roswell fan. Where's the relationships?, Where's the comic relief?.....

Her narrative illustrations of the assasination of Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo and the attentat that killed King Alexander and Queen Draga in Belgrade are some of the most amazing prose written, whether you view her version as fact or fiction or somewhere in between.West is a marvelous storyteller, especially when the story -- in some form -- took place, making this worth a look, even if it's only to read through sections of specific interest."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"This is perhaps one of the most amazing and persuassive exercise of the power of empathy, of how a person can absorb and relay not only the facts, but the nuances which West observed such that the reader has empathy for all &quot;tribes&quot; in the Balkans. I do wish our President had read this book.This book is crucial reading now, much more than just art, for those whose actions will impact millionsin the weeks ahead. For those people, not to read this book would be just short of a criminal, as history, especially in the Balkans, repeats itself over and over and over and over."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"During her travels through Yugoslavia Rebecca West was mostly accompanied by Constantine, a Serbian Government Official, most of her explanation of historical events are actualy the opionion of her travel companion. Constantine is a strong supporter of a Yugoslavia, therefore he is not only Pro-Serbian but is racist against Croats and Muslims. It is very evident in this book that Ms. West has developed this racist attitude as well.I found the book very difficult to follow because of her poetic descriptions of situations and her habit of wandering off on tangents. I recommend the book, solely as a good travel book and not as a good source of history. I recommend instead, A Nation Forged in War by Marcus Tanner as a history book, not only is Marcus Tanner's book well written and organized, it is very objective, therefore reader gets a better understanding of why certain ethnic groups would feel a certain way."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"I purchased BL&amp;GF a week ago to read about the former Yugoslavia. I can understand that after the first Great War there was plenty anti German sentiment to go around. The racial and ethnic stereotypes do not stop with Germans but with Croats, Bosniaks, Montenegrins, and Macedonians. The latter which were referred to as either Bulgarians or Serbs. It was well written but historically inaccurate. All we need now is for Oliver Stone to Direct the movie."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"This book will perk your interest in travelogues and Balkan embroidery. It is masterpiece theatre fodder as well as an a comprenhensive overview of Balkan history and politics.(1) She is decidedly biased (as acknowledged in other reviews); pro-Serbian and anti-Teutonic. Examples of her anti-Teutonic bias include: Germans sneaking into the first class compartment on a train, the vilification of a German orthodox monk, the pomposity of the German WWI memorial, and the cruel Austrians who imprisoned Princip in a damp and unhealthy cell as punishment for assassinating the Archduke.(2) Rebecca West was obsessed with degrading effeminate men and discussing the castration of masculinity. This obsession led us to believe all was not well between Rebecca and her banker husand in the bedroom. We were left questioning the sexuality of her emasculated husband.(3) Often times Rebecca was left alone, when her husband and their driver, Dragutin, suspiciously disappeared and then returned after long periods of time with pretty flowers for Rebecca.(4) We think this is an engrossing introduction to the Balkans, author's subjectivity notwithstanding. Rebecca's characters in the book may not be real; they may have been embellished to make a point. For example, did Constantine - the self-hating Jew - and Gerda - his pro-Nazi wife - really exist, or were they invented for propoganda purposes? We think Rebecca was trying to alert the unsuspecting populace of Europe to the negativism of fascism.(5) Did she buy heavily embroidered clothes for her effeminate banker husband? Where are all of those fine examples of Balkan folk art now? However, having just recently returned from the Balkans, one of us can attest that works of embroidery are still sold as souvenirs, albeit in the airport gift shop.(6) Her absence of gruesome details of torture are most appreciated. Even without gory details, there is a memorable account of Queen Draga's assisnation and how the palace coupe was brought to fruition at her very &quot;finger tips&quot;. Wait a minute, Queen Draga, or was it a Drag Queen?(7) Amuse yourself by opening the book at random and seeing how many descriptions you can count of &quot;jolly, healthy men&quot;.(8) What did Rebecca have in mind when she recounted the episode in Montenegro where she was led down a slippery and rocky precipice in the mountains by a disturbed young man?In addition to the salient points above: the prose was exemplary, however, the length was daunting - it took one busy executive six months to finish the book, while another executive finished it in two months, as he was able to read it during staff meetings."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Ms West was a great storyteller and she shines in this book.

Anyone interested in understanding the roots of the current conflict should read this book. West covers Yugoslav (esp. Serbian) history in depth, and provides great detail about early 20th Century Yugoslavia. She also provides great insight into the historic conflicts that led to today's confrontation between NATO and Yugoslavia."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Or in this case, &quot;Too many words.&quot; Among serious books this is the most needlessly verbose and narcissistic I've ever read (exclusive of anything by Proust.) It must be largely fictional since West purportedly repeats verbatim many extremely lengthy and involved conversations and disputes that would only be capable of capture by a tape recorder--and she didn't have one. It is entirely pro-Slavic and tediously anti-German. To West, Gavrilo Pricip is a hero and the Archduke Francis merely a foreign agitator. She includes a vast array of detailed historical anecdotes but leaves one doubtful of her accuracy. She is apparently unaware, for instance, (perhaps deliberately) that the Albanians are not Slavs, that their ancestors were the ancient Illyrians, and that their roots in the Balkans go back to at least 2000 B.C. Some claim to admire her writing style; I found it excessively wordy and personalized."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"The subtitle of this book is &quot;The Domestic Front, 1939-45&quot;, which suggests that it will be an essential read for anyone interested in the Battle of Britain in 1940-41. The focus is on the role of the British women in that period, and their roles as mothers, wives, factory workers, nurses, entertainers, farmers and others. In the process, the authors provide a wide-ranging description of life in the British isles during the period. Not the least of the virtues of the book are numerous photographs--dramatic ones of bomb shelter existence, domestic ones such as that of a woman pondering the complexities of ration stamps. Also fascinating are reproductions of posters, advertisements, government documents, and other semi-official literature to inform and inspire the civilian population. This book will be invaluable to anyone interested in the period."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"This book is a huge disappointment.

Having spoken with Serbs, Croats, and Bosniacs in Bosnia, and from reading the daily newspaper articles and political rhetoric from the region, I believe that West understands the historical reasons for the attitudes of the peoples she meets as well as anyone can understand them, and she reports them acurately. There are only two shortcomings to the book, neither of which is nearly powerful enough to make the reader want to pause. First, and this can't really be called a shortcoming, the book is pre-WWII, so a significant source of modern Serb-Croat animosity is unrealized. The work Chetnik is mentioned only once or twice in passing, and the word Ustashe has not yet even come into being for West. Balkan Ghosts by David Kaplan is a good &quot;sequel&quot; for those who want post-WWII history. The second, and very real, downfall is West's conceit. She is supremely opinionated against those with whom her personality conflicts, and she often allows a perceived slight from a passerby or the disagreement of an acquaintance to turn into a half-page rant about how &quot;ignorant&quot;, &quot;childish&quot;, &quot;stupid&quot;, or &quot;idiotic&quot; such people are who fit her type-cast of her newfound social or philisophical enemies. Also, you will have to drudge though her lectures on art and archetecture, which are usually the sources of her aforementioned literary ravings. Overall, the book is a treasure of history, infinitely preferable to the serious mind to any title by one of the myriad of historical carpetbaggers on the subject with titles containing the words &quot;death&quot;, &quot;destruction&quot;, or synonyms thereof."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"BLGF is a gigantic grab bag of a book.If your interested in the former yugoslavia,it is a fascinating read.Although i don't think anyone would wish it longer than it is.West offers sharp and at times profound insights.However the reader needs to be careful.West's prejudices distort much of what is on view.The first of these is her near pathological hostility to all things german.One might think that would not be all that important in a book on yugoslavia.It turns out to be of critical importance.West combines this anti-germanic perspective with a pronounced anti-catholic bias.Once you realize this the opinions expressed in the book as well as its omissions begin to make a kind of sense.It's telling that West virtually ignores slovenia except to point to bad conduct by the catholic church.Slovenia is mostly catholic and even worse the most\\"austrian \\" of yugoslavia's nations. As such i think she considers it unworthy of her attention.Croatia is a place she has to write about but one can infer she'd rather not.The croats are too catholic and somewhat german influenced.Almost as bad they are also italian and hungarian influenced.They just aren't \\"slavic\\" enough! Well it is fairly easy to guess who is slavic enough,the serbs.This is a very distorted picture.Westdoes seem to think that the serbs are noble savages by virtue of their freedom from non slavic influences.Whereas the northern south slavs are tainted by foreigness.To say the least,this is a strange viewpoint for a writer of\\"advanced\\" views.It smacks of an odd provincialism.Italy was at one point one of the most creative and dynamic societies on earth.It's croatias neighbor.Does West really think that the croatians should have turned their back on italy inorder to cultivate slavic purity?I think the answer is ,yes.West dissmisses late imperial austria as an intellectual and cultural wasteland.That can only be explained as a by product of ignorance.This was afterall the land of klimt,mahler,freud and wittgenstein.Joseph Roth would wind up downright nostalgic about it.West says austria-hungary was the most repressive state in europe after russia.This is oddin two ways.One i doubt it's true.Austria was more repressive than the ottoman empire,spain,portugal,romania and bulgaria?Also even if true no one with a straight face could argue that austria was comprable to russia as a tyranny.That said this peculiar book is fascinating.Although like some of the other reviewers i too wondered what's the story on the husband and what's allthis talk about the positive benefits of the absence of homosexuality?(and where did she get that idea from?)."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"I have read the book, and the reviews to date. I agree that the book was too wordy. West seems to indulge all too much in stream of conscious writing. A good editor would have helped to focus the book more. It combines a travelogue with history, a dangerous combination as it becomes all too easy to lose historical continuity: her thoughts are prompted by what she sees, and thus she wanders back and forth through regional history in a way that confused me. But, the insights, I think, were very interesting. But beware: she has terrible prejudices that would be totally non-PC in a writer today: her views on Germans, Austrians, Russians, and homosexuals are probably unsustainable. She tends to oversimplify Jews and their views(other reviewers mentioning Constantine missed the complication: he was Jewish with an almost Nazi wife).To those who say her book tends to explain modern Kosovo and KLA actions, I say no. I think there is a very important piece of post WW2 history that I do not understand, but I know is there, that also has a very big impact. The whole answer is not there as far as I can see.It took a very long time for me to get through the book, simply its length and somewhat distracting habit of going off on tangents tended to exhaust me.But, for what it is, I think it deserves the accolades and should be read by anyone with an interest in European or Balkan or religious history."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Rebecca West spent 6 weeks as a tourist in Yugoslavia, and somehow ended up as the most frequently quoted writer about the area. This is probably because her beautiful prose style and gift for storytelling mask the deep and pervasive flaws in her perception of the country. My rating (3 stars) is an attempt to average the book's strengths and flaws.BL&amp;GF is well worth reading as a travelogue; by turns epigrammatic (good), anecdotal (good), and philosophical (not so good), it is nearly always absorbing. (&quot;Nearly always&quot; because those philosophical passages do have to be endured.) Don't go looking for more than that, because she is notoriously unreliable as an interpreter of Yugoslavia. The situation in which she wrote it--early World War II--overshadows her perceptions of the place, slanting the book in favor of the Serbs and against the Croats, the Albanians, and just about everyone else. Her sympathy for the poor beleaguered Serbs looks pretty foolish in retrospect. She also betrays a very shallow understanding of the complex and shifting web of ethnicities in the area (particularly in Kosovo, which she calls &quot;Old Serbia&quot;).So by all means read BL&amp;GF; just take that &quot;definitive work about Yugoslavia&quot; reputation with a grain of salt. If you really want to understand the Balkans, though, read Edith Durham--she spent 7 years in the area, did relief work for the Macedonians and Albanians, did the first serious ethnographic work on the Albanians, was a war correspondent in the Balkan Wars, and became a national heroine in Albania. (She's also a much better observer than Dame Rebecca to begin with; and an entertaining storyteller, with a sharp sense of humor.)"},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"One of the most passionate and beautiful travel books ever written, and a masterpiece of 20th century prose. Written during the London Blitz, as West doubted the survival of our species, this book uses the outline of a travel memoir through Yugoslavia as a structure to critique all of Western Civilization. West shows a strong pro-Serb bias that alienated some readers when the book came out, but most acknowledged it as one of the great books of the century. The language is ironic, clever, philosophic, despairing, wonderful by turns. But fair warning - the book is quite massive and takes some dedication. You will have to read the first twenty pages or so to know if it's for you, but if it is, you will never forget it."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"For anyone living in or traveling to the Balkans, this books is a must read. R. West brings you back to the days before WW2, and her telling of her story brings the people, the area, and the era alive. Its also very interesting to see what was similar back then, compared to now."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Get this book.If there is one book you should read, that is pivotal in early 20th Century History, I'd strongly recommend that you read this book. By following Rebecca West's footsteps through Croatia, Dalmatia, Bosnia and Kosovo, she engages you with her trivial and quaint observations of people and places, set against her awesome knowledge of art and history, which is fascinating and worth re-reading time and time again.And then you realize that this journey took place just before the start of the second world war. What a place to be, what a time to live, what a book to write. It is a long book, no doubt about that. In some respects, it is too short to fully tell the whole story and she helps with a full bibliography and index.So, get this book and re-live her experiences."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"There is no way this book is not a classic. People who don't appreciate it simply haven't read it or are too prejudiced. Its 11 hundred marvelous pages are full of wisdom, historical accounts, relevant personal experiences, wit, humor, love of literature and personal humility. Despising it is a suicide of the intellect.Rebecca West must have been a one of a kind woman, understanding and forgiving. She dwells on all topics through this travel book. There are passages that are so interesting and so well written that must win her a place among the best writers in the English language.I'd like to chose two excepts from this nice Penguin Classics edition. One is a humoristic and down-to-earth rationalization of xenophobia:'She was the gentlest and sweetest of women and for that reason had developed a most peculiar form of hysteria. Perhaps because of her experience as a tiny child in the war she was a true xenophobe, she could not imagine anything more disgusting than a member of another race than her own. ut she did not like to feel anything but love for her fellow-creatures, so she transformed her loathing for them into a belief that they exude powerful and most unpleasant odours.. This belief made her life as a chambermaid an extraordinary olfactory adventure, for to this hotel there came people of all nationalities. [...] The Hungarians seemed to her to have a strong smell, which, however, was not unpleasant, only extremely different from the smell a human being ought to exhale. But the Germans and Austrians were definitely very gross in her nostrils, and the French smelt wicked and puzzling, as I imagine a chemist's shop might to a country woman who knew the uses of hardly any of the articles it exhibited.'Or this one:'There are those who sourly remark that Bolshevism was made in such rooms. It is not true. The Russian exiles who were responsible for that sat on unmade beds in flats as untidy as Versailles or any medieval castle. They were the powerful people who never tidy up, who only happened for the moment to be out of power. But those who live in these wept and garnished rooms wish only to serve. In the hereafter they shall be saved when all the rest of us are damned.' Eloquent, isn't it?And what about this almost mystical passage:'In too many Western pictures Christ looks as if He were wholly dying, and as if He were making an unmanly fuss over it considering His foreknowledge of the Resurrection. But in all these Macedonian frescoes death is shown working on the body that is bound to the spirit of Christ, wringing the breath out of the lungs as a laundress wrings water out of a shirt, taking the power out of the muscles and nerves like a dentist drawing a tooth whose roots drive down through the whole body. There is demonstrated that separateness of the flesh which Proust once noted, in a passage which describes how we think in our youth that our bodies are identical with ourselves, and have the same interests, but discover later in life that they are heartless companions who have been accidentally yoked with us, and who are as likely as not in our extreme sickness or old age to treat us with less mercy than we would have received at the hands of the worst bandits.'Must be read slowly, like a good wine."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"As I read in the daily papers the news of Serbians fighting separatists in Kosovo, I am grateful once again to have read this classic four summers ago. Faraway names and events become meaningful when you have the background it will give you. It's not a travel book at all; it's an exploration of the European soul. Read it, and you will begin to understand the intractable nature of the conflict between Serbs, Croats, and Bosnians (not to mention Turks, Greeks, Montenegrans, Austrians, Italians, Jews, Muslims, Catholics, and Othodox). Humane, biased (as aren't we all?), beautifully written, and supremely enlightening. You will find yourself reading long passages out loud to others; underling paragraphs and dog earing pages.Despite its bulk it moves along in a compelling, novelistic way. I may never see Dubrovnik, and the bridge at Mostar is gone forever, but I went there through this book."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"The prose in this book weaves a mosaic of rural and town life in the 1930s Yugoslavia which is gone in fact but captured in West's captivating prose. This was a Yugoslavia whose name was adopted a few years before, whose eastern and southern borders were agreed in 1913 with Bulgaria and Greece , just one year after the Ottomans had been evicted in 1912 after 500 years of rule . And published just before Catholic Croatia's Tito and Orthodox Serbia's Mihailovich led separate resistances against the Germans then like two pit bull terriers fought until Tito emerged as victor and ruler for three decades . The war between these carnivores ended in 1991 with the unravelling of the mosaic West had so beautifully weaved just over 50 years before.The scenes-in-words of a run-down town of Bitola (ex-Monastir) and a lakeside lovely Ochrid provide instructive insights into a Macedonia before the Communist Tito created a Republic of Macedonia (in 1944) in an effort to destabilise the northern borders of Greece at the beginning of her wrenching civil war.West's is a must-read for students and scholars of the land of the southern Slavs during the fleeting time it was a union and they wish to relish one of the classics of 20th century English prose."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"This book is huge and I have only read chapters.

The issues that she ultimately addresses are not confined to history---they linger with us today; nor are they simply questions to aid us in understanding polito-cultural behaviour in the Balkans...they are universal, timeless issues.

The shere volume of the text (1180 pages in paperback) underscores Ms. West's attention to the detail of setting, the psychology of character, and the wit of a feminist watching the world condense into male political inanity. She captures the character as well as the picture of each State (Croatia,Dalmatia, Serbia, Macedonia, Bosnia, and Montenegro). We literally travel with her through the spring snow, the beautiful countryside, the mountains, toward the religious festivals and ceremonies (Orthodox, Catholic, and Muslim) she seeks with such vigor. We witness with her the conflict of past and present history, past and religion that sparks up like flint banging out fire in such tight geographic proximity-- conflict we see even today. The book is long but broken into manageable chapters; the work, plowed through from beginning to end, is exhausting-- as if we actually walked with her through each of the states, climbed each stone wall and looked over her shoulder as she rested under a tree recording in her journal everything she is about to tell us. If there is one criticism I have of the present edition it is simply that there are no maps-- I can see everywhere I go in the journey with her crisp description of place, but I was forced to go to an atlas to see where I had been. This has been called a classic of 20th Century Lit. It is an amazing tour de force. And as much as it is a journey through the history of people and place, it is also a powerful description of the mind of a woman who had eyes to see and words to help share that world with all of us.

It also explains why a bunch of thugs like the KLA would get such deep support from Germany.I thank Ms. West for her blunt words.

A classic, if ever there was any, a masterpiece without a doubt. It is as fresh as yesterday's news and as ancient as the monasteries it describes. It is an eternal work, a must for Balkan afficionados, a work of scholarship and love. Influenced by it, I wrote this (in my 'After the Rain - How the West Lost the East'): 'The Balkans is the unconscious of the world...It is here that the repressed memories of history, its traumas and fears and images reside. It is here that the psychodynamics of humanity - the tectonic clash between Rome and Byzantium, West and East, Judeo-Christianity and Islam - is still easily discernible.' Thank you, Rebecca West. Sam Vaknin, author of 'After the Rain - How the West Lost the East'."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"This is a fascinating book on a number of levels. It is intensely personal, written in Rebecca West's characteristic tone of bullying good sense. It describes with great insight personal relations between a number of sharply-drawn &quot;characters&quot; in a distinctly novelistic way. It also provides a vivid travelogue of a long-lost age, by now nearly as remote as the middle ages, irretrievably lost to us behind the triple cataclysms of World War II, communism and Milosevic. Finally, long digressions in the book provide an impressionistic presentation of Yugoslavian (mainly Serbian) history.The weakest part of the book, in my opinion, is the dialogue, which is frequently stilted and for that reason detracts from the immediacy of the travelogue. West's unnamed husband -- referred throughout merely as &quot;my husband&quot; -- is made to talk exactly as West herself writes, and unsurprisingly he and she always agree. But that the book should contain considerable dialogue, and that of distinctly intellectual cast, in itself illustrates its uniqueness.Reviewer Edo Bosnar's main complaint, it seems, is that the book is not something that it makes no claim to be. It's not a textbook of Balkan history or politics, nor is it presented as a work of scholarly research or interpretation. It makes no pretense of being fair -- fairness doesn't enter into it. What makes the book so compelling, in my view, is precisely that it doesn't fit into any category. It's not just a book, it's a genre all its own.I write as a person who believes that no book should exceed 300 pages without some very good reasons. Black Lamb and Grey Falcon has some excellent reasons for its great length."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"West probes well the issues of &quot;the Balkans&quot;.

Deeply disappointed after the initial chapters, I could not force myself to read it beyond the 94th page of the Penguin Book edition. Let me tell you why.In the end of the prologue the author states: &quot;I am never sure of the reality of what I see, if I have seen it only once; I know that until it has firmly established its objective existence by impressing my senses and my memory, I am capable of conscripting it into the service of a private dream.&quot; This sentence explains best why this whole book seems to be nothing but a private dream; she sees most things only once, and many of the historical anecdotes described by her not at all. Her bias towards one of the nations begins with her Note on Pronunciation, and her understanding and comments on the spelling of local names is representative of what she does to the history and facts found in this region.Magnificent in volume and truly eloquent descriptions of private dreams that begin on page one with the description of a dream-like state induced by anesthesia, and this state of mind seems to permeate the whole book. If you are interested in that and in numerous irrelevant stories and fictionalized history, you will love this book. If you want objective information on this region, and will be bothered by not being able to differentiate between what is fact and what fiction, you should probably stay away from it, since it will be a waste of your time.There are much better books than this one. For the lovers of fiction I can only recommend the Noble prize winning &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot; by Ivo Andric, a true masterpiece, or for the lovers of fact and history the excellent and fun to read chapters on Yugoslavia in &quot;Eastern Approaches&quot; by Fitzroy MacLean."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Like many other reviewers on Amazon, I discovered this author and her work through reading Robert Kaplan'sBalkan Ghosts: A Journey Through History. \\"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon\\" is certainly a compelling work, full of vivid imagery and references to otherwise unknown or poorly understood historical events but it may, however, not be an entirely objective account. The reader must be aware, however (and it is hard to see how any reader could possibly miss it) that West was not only a Serbophile and an enthusiast for a greater Yugoslavia dominated by Serbia, but also (perhaps unconsciously) willing to stamp her romantic vision of South Slav/Serbian nationalism and idealised peasant society on everyone fated to live in the Balkans. In every respect, West lives in a Manichean world where Serbia is white and any historic adversaries (the defunct Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires in particular) are uniformly black, and while I am sure that it was very easy at times in the 1930's to see much that was dark in Germany, her Germanophilia - in matters large and small - is surely excessive.Reading \\"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon\\" I was reminded in different ways of three near contemporary English authors, George Orwell, Wilfred Thesiger and Virginia Woolf. West shares with Orwell broadly similar (strongly held) political positions and a real descriptive power, with Thesiger the innate sense of inquiry coupled with a desire that these picturesque natives should retain their romantic customs pleasing to the English passerby, while with Woolf (who I am admittedly less familiar with - or fond of - than either Orwell or Thesiger) she shares the tendency to superimpose the concerns and perspectives of a very select class of literary-minded upper-class Englishwomen on humanity in general and women in particular.This may sound like a negative review, but the power of West's writing is such that this is actually quite an engrossing read - the experience of reading it is just somewhat like reading a erudite, interesting (albeit very long) but clearly partisan opinion piece in a newspaper which prefers to promote a \\"world view\\" rather than objective. It is still a rewarding read and does provide one particular view of the Former Yugoslavia, but I would caution against forming too many historical or political opinions on this work alone."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"The best reason to read this book, is not so much to learn about Yugoslavia as it was before WWII, but to enjoy Rebecca West's enormous witty and profoundly intuitive gift for illuminating entire themes, peoples, places, social patterns, and aspects of history, through the application of metaphor to small, anecdotal events or particular places or sights.Examples will illustrate this: (pg 268) (Describing Slavs listening intently to a folk musician) \\"Look at them, they are Slavs, they believe that the next Messiah may be born at any minute, not of any woman, for that is too obvious a generation, but of any impersonal parent, any incident, any thought.\\" (pg 655): \\"some superb women whose fine and bitter faces were unveiled, and therefore must be Christian, yet wore the Turkish trousers, and strode along in a gait that knew nothing of Islam, or indeed of Christianity, but remembered a primitive matriarch.\\" Or (pg 75) \\"he lived his whole life to free Croatia from Hungarian rule...he had ended by believing that the Hungarians had had the best of everything in all respects, and that this world of musty antlers, and second-rate pictures and third-rate furniture was superior to the world where peasants sang in church with the extreme discriminating fervor which our poets envy, and wore costumes splendid in their obedience to those principles of design which our painters envy....\\" Or, (pg 379) \\"This was a Slav, this is what it is to be a Slav. He was offering himself wholly to his sorrow, he was learning the meaning of death and was not refusing any part of the knowledge.\\" (pg 92)\\"She had that vigorous young beauty that seems to carry its keen cold about with it. Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed as if she were not really here, as if she were running on her points up the cornices of a snow peak to a fairy ice-palace.\\" WEst's whole book is teeming with such jewels. Gather them and delight in their faceted lights!To relish these intuitive glimpses into present circumstance, that illuminate whole patterns of the human condition, is why you read Rebecca West. Some reviewers have critiqued her for being \\"germanophobic,\\" possibly because in her book she honestly records her struggles with Gerda, the German wife of her Serbian guide Constantine. However, unless we imagine that West is completely making up the stories about Gerda and her extraordinary negativity and rude behavior, which would be quite out of keeping with what we can readily discern of West's character through her writing, we must acknowledge that it really isn't her German ethnicity which makes Gerda so offensive: she's just a highly offensive and rude person who happens to be German. Besides, West is able to draw color and adventure out of Gerda's rudeness, in the fine manner with which she seems able to do this with every aspect of her travels: \\"In the lounge Gerda was sitting quite still, dazed in contemplation of my inconsiderateness as an antique monk of Mount Athos in contemplation of his navel, and Constantine was nervously agreeing with the strictures she had made before she passed into full ecstasy.\\" (Pg 633).Anyone who is capable of seeing how a person can actually find what almost amounts to spiritual \\"ecstasy\\" in their own contempt or dislike, is someone who has something so valuable to offer all of us, to free us from where we may find obstacles and constrictions in \\"the human condition\\", and instead find these manifestly endearing, poetic and metaphorical tributes that open us up to the fascinating mystery of human life, in Yugoslavia or anywhere in the world."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Rebecca West's classic book hardly needs a review from me but suffice to say that I re-read it with great enjoyment during a recent ten day-long tour of the Orthodox churches and monasteries in Serbia and the now independent states of Kosovo and Montenegro.It is truly amazing how evocative a book written this long ago can be.

Many pages are devoted to death by details, but the total canvas is a rich, detailed one of a region buffeted by the crosswinds of history. It provides an excellent foil to works such as Huntington's Clash of Civilizations and Fukuyama's End of History.Traveling by car, train and foot through many a spot that would not show up even in a Michelin guide, Mrs West paints a detailed picture of the (now former) Yugoslavia. The Austrians, Hungarians, Turks and Italians do not come off well under her historical microscope. With perhaps a bit of traditional British dislike for Napoleon, Mrs West reserves some of her harshest criticisms for Marshal Marmont and his cynical rule in Dalmatia.Written as a traveling journal in the late 1930's, the book is free of much of the angst ridden writing of today on this region. West has no clear political agenda to advance in this book; rather, she lays out a series of experiences, analyzes them, and provides them to the reader for consideration. With the advantage of hindsight, many of her ethnological observations are uncanny, especially the role that the Serbs and Croats would play in the 1940's and again in the 1990's.Her understanding, and further exploration, of the depth of religious current swirling in the valleys and plains of the Balkans is impressive. Although she appears somewhat cynical about the true depth of feeling in many instances, she nonetheless accords the importance of religion, and what I would call the &quot;cult of martyrology&quot; its due respect in this turbulent historical region.For someone looking for a quick, executive summary type read on the Balkans, this is not it. For someone who knows how to speed read, and extract nuggets of wisdom and keen observation, this book is a must read for the Balkans."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"A nice read but highly romanticized outlook of the old Yugoslav Kingdom and the people of Yugoslavia. The book is based on the authors interaction with the Yugoslav intellectual elite and her observation of the people of old Yugoslavia. Her interpretation of the Slav character needs to be understood in the context of the orientalist approach of the time- as a result - the Slav character in the book is idealized in the same manner that modern day nationalist in the same region see themselves. Namely, the great Slavic nation of the Serbs who defended Europe from the Turks and saved the rest of the Southern Slavs from the Austrians. Given the time in which it was written (late 30s) the author suffers from an extreme germanophobia in every possible sense! She seems to come across only irrational, pompous and arrogant Germans who can't appreciate the Yugoslav people in the same way that she and her husband can. The book is extremely pro-Serbian, so much so that the Croatian and Macedonian discontent and wish for separation is seen not as a solution to the Serbian dominated Kingdom but as, sometimes Vatican sometimes Austrian and sometimes Italian inspired propaganda to divide the otherwise brotherly relations between the Serbs and the Croats! How much of this brotherly love was genuine - we saw in the WWII that followed as well as the bloody brake up of Socialist Yugoslavia. As much as she has made a conscious attempt not to become another British traveler in the Balkans that picks her pet-nation and promotes their interests - she falls under the Balkan trap of victimization and myths and becomes in the process an ardent pro-Serb - as indeed her political activities would later reveal."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Masses of fascinating information here,some of it silver thruppeney bits, some of it perhaps nuts. Written in a truly remarkable travelogue style. What is perhaps the most impressive element of the book is the depth of some of the conversations that West recounts- a truly humbling experience given that these discussions, that often cover hundreds of years of history must have been conducted simultaneously in several different languages! It is a sad commentary on the present era that such a conversation is unlikely to occur again. A must read for anyone serios about the Balkans."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"As an American soldier facing the strong posibility of travel to the Balkans in the near future, I truly enjoyed Mrs. West's book despite the several months it took me to read it. The book provides a detailed account of life in the Balkans during the 30's which continues to have relevance in today's world. I recommend reading the book with a high-quality world atlas and following her journeys on the map. This book is not for the casual reader. In fact, I would have given it five stars except that it is somewhat confusing at times due to the author's tendency to shift between the past and present. For those who only recently became interested in Balkan hisotry, the book provides a good starting point for the study of a complex culture."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"I have a highly ambivalent realtionship with this book, and with Rebecca West. She present stories as history, but they are wonderful stories (hm, that should probably be &quot;wonderful Serbian stories&quot; considering West's preferences). They main problem I have with this book is West's &quot;noble-savage complex&quot;. She sees a guy carrying a lamb in a hotel lobby and concludes that Serbia is untainted by the restrictions of Western Bourgeois Civilisation. She dislikes Croatia because she believes that people have been spoiled by their interraction with the Austrian Empire. So, everything in Serbia, and especially Kosovo, is unspoilt and delightful, everything in Croatia is germanised and uptight: look out for the ever so picturesque Albanians, notable in West's eyes predominantly for the precarious positioning of their trousers. It IS a good book, but probably best to go and see for yourself before drawing any major conclusions about the &quot;balkan soul&quot;."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"This is a deeply biased almost fictional and totally one sided account and portrayal of the history of Yugoslavia, especially of the Serb people. The author is a devoted Serbophile mixing historical half-truths and half-fictions always to the elevation of the Serbs among other balkan nations. The result is that nothing in this book can be trusted for any historical value and in the long term it backfires on many fronts as history has recently proven. In the end this book can only bee seen as an exposition of the views and ideas of the author herself rather then the people that she's describing. As a conclusion this book doesn't serve anybody's purpose as a historical/travel account book, but would certainly be much better suited to the 'Fiction' section of the library where it would be appreciated for what it is, a fiction/propaganda book."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Love it or hate it, anyone with an interest in the Balkans will eventually have to deal with this book. Rebecca West is one of the giants of 20th century literature. Never heard of her? I hadn't either until I read this sprawling opus. Don't be put off by the size of the book, however (West herself writes that most people probably won't read this book because of the massive length). Black Lamb and Grey Falcon is a travelogue detailing West's travels through 1930's Yugoslavia. The book goes far beyond travelogue as West intersperses massive doses of Slavic history and philosophy with her travel accounts. Not only do we see the things she sees, we understand the mentality of the people. These people she meets and places she visits become almost mystical under her magical pen. I read this book over a six week period at the end of the summer. Like West on her travels, I meandered through the book, reading it religiously at times and then setting it down for a bit to read other things. This might be the best way to read the book. It allows the reader to absorb what West is trying to say without being overwhelmed by the immense amounts of information.I have to say that I was most fascinated by her discourses on Yugoslav history. Balkan history can be a challenge because most of us in the West really don't understand the people or places involved. A section on the assassination of Franz Ferdinand runs on forever and never becomes boring. In fact, I became so enraptured of this event that I started reading other works concerning the assassination. Even though there are some problems with West's interpretation of history, her accounts are so well written that it makes the reader want to go out and read more about these events.Many have criticized Rebecca West for her bias and her tendency to simplify history. This is a valid concern. Her most serious transgression is her rabid hatred of anything German. It literally infects parts of the book with a somber, unpleasant tone. Right from the beginning of the book we see West criticizing a group of German tourists who are on a train with her as she travels into the Balkans. The bias finds greatest expression when West writes about her relationship with her Yugoslav guide Constantine and his wife Gerda. Constantine is a Jew and a Slav, but Gerda is a German whom West seems to believe is a Nazi. West's slanders on Gerda are endless, so much so that Constantine himself eventually turns against West. What is important to remember is that West is English and World War II was only a few years away. West actually wrote this book a few years after her trip, in 1941, so war was already raging between the two countries. If I were a German, I would be offended by West's comments.Please read this book. I guarantee you'll enjoy it, at least to some extent. Even if you don't like history, the descriptions of the Yugoslav people and places are enchanting. I wanted to hop on a plane and go to Yugoslavia after reading this book, although it's important to remember that this account was written during World War II and before the Communist occupation that followed the war. I imagine things have changed quite a bit in this part of the world since the 1930's. What prose! What endless beauty! Images that flow like honey! Read this and dream!!"},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"I read BLGF after returning to the US after living in the region for over two years. I found and read Robert Kaplan's \\"Balkan Ghosts,\\" while the 1999 NATO action in Kosovo within clear sight of the situation. Kaplan made numerous positive referrences to BLGF so I found and read that soon after returning to the US. (I do know that Clinton did read BG (and that this led him to intervene in Bosnia-Herzegovina) and so may have read BLGF after leaving office). I suppose it was because of my very personal witness to the Balkans when I was living there, in particular the personal stories and lives that were generously offered by loving and almost pathetically nationalistic people. I found that RW, regardless of her \\"only six week\\" tour of Yugoslavia hit the button on the head in an overwhelming fashion. The personal emotional bias must be understood and the historical meat filtered through it. I didn't find that any history she related was false. What did startle me was how much similar her findings were to my own, fifty years later. When one understands that Tito effectively froze the populations of Yugoslavia in time through the use of forced migrations and a strong secret police force, how this could be becomes easy to grasp. But Rebecca West's journalistic intellect reaches its zenith when after witnessing the ritual slaughter of lambs, makes one of the best arguments against religion I have ever read. At once, she makes the best intellectual and emotional argument I can never have imagined as I read the brilliance of it. How a people come to act as both lambs and falcons, victims of history, myth and legend. The story of the Serbian people and for that matter the Balkans is something not to be missed by anyone interested in the story of civilization.I lived in Slovenia in the late 1990s for over two years, serving the public in concert with a Slovenian orthopedic surgeon. I was married there in 1999 before returning to the US. As one deeply drawn to historic studies since childhood, I carried along with me, a small library of historic works on European history, including the very large History of the Habsburg Empire, published by the Berkeley University Press. I traveled to many regions, but more importanly, had (and still retain) friends who are Slovene, Serb, Bosnian Serb as well as acquaintances of some in higher government and military offices. At one point, I was even invited to an informal meeting of (Ljublijana) university professors and a Croatian UN Bosnia-Herzegovina Peacekeeper mission executive. I was present to witness the development of the problems in Kosovo and led to the Bombing Campaign in 1999. I saw the protests against it that took place in front of the US Embassy in Ljublijana as I went there for the settling of various matters so I could be married in Slovenia legally. My dear, loving Serbian receptionist was symbolically blocking the entrance with other protestors. And later that day we met at the office and worked with only the slightest bit of simmering resentment, so deep was our care for one another. Through her, I learned so much, and on a later return, attended a Serbian Orthodox service as her guest, just to get a deeper feeling of the history of these people. It was very moving. People torn between the most generous loving inclinations with a rare love of life and at the same time, mutilated by a long history of oppression. They see themselves alone with the world against them. This same friend was also in the crowd in Belgrade that finally brought down Milosevic. All attempts to understand and find the tortured human element in Serbs is an obligation for us. And doing so does not require that we denigrate or minimalize the Albanians or any other of the ethnic groups in the Balkans. BLGF so enriched by complement, all these experiences. When I return, I do so with a greater and greater depth of knowledge and tolerance for all, regardless of the minefields of strong nationalistic sentiments one must step through to do so.What makes BLGF so great and a must read for anyone remotely interested in history or literature in general is that it is at once an excellent source of introductory history of a region that has been for the West, lost in a mist of vagarities and myth. At the same time related as a personal experience by RW in a almost lyric fashion. Go with it, even the angry diatribes about men. History becomes real when it is felt as a personal experience; That is why traveling and living abroad is so valuable for everyone, but especially for Americans, who need to understand the world that their government so often effects. If there is anyplace in the world that can teach us that nothing is simple and perhaps most important, impress the American reader with the eternal sense of history, expanding that compression of time that US history lives in, the Balkans are it. This is a book that ought to be used at least at the community college class level in both literature and history classes.I have read many of the reviews and various opinions on this book, including the one critic living in the region who only allowed one star. (Locals hate outsiders having any opinion of them). My view is that all the praises and criticisms are valid and deserved, even the one that questions whether RW and her husband had any kind of sexual realtionship and if her husband might have actually been homosexual. Without doubt, RW was a strong willed individual and I gathered from her occassional diatribes concerning men that she had a issue with the entire gender and completely capable of a \\"marriage of convenience.\\" (So what)? Realizing that her father had left her mother and then soon died, must be somewhat to blame. Allow her to be human, it made her what she was as a writer. So although I found her rants less than usefull, I allowed her to be human because this book is part journal, part essay and part diary. How many authors have laid their own feelings out so clearly. Given the period that it was published in, that took courage. I have to wonder with our emotionally suppressive PC enviroment today, how could anyone even conceive such writing today and not be shouted down by the \\"thought police\\" installed in their own mind? Welcome to journalism before PC! What a gift that is in itself - an artifact of true intellectual freedom."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"In Black Lamb and Grey Falcon, Rebecca West weaves together history, ethnography and travelogue into an encyclopedic and unforgettable portrait of this troubled region. As I explain below, I think there are some marvelous things about this book, and some aspects that are less well realized. On balance, it is well worth the effort, but for somebody considering it, the cautions are worth noting. First the highlights:West is at her best as a reporter. She has a truly brilliant eye for detail, for simply seeing how the people lived, what they wore, how they worshipped and what they did with their days. Her images, particularly of the remote communities and the many churches and religious shrines that she visited, are particularly well rendered. Although the book lacks photographs or drawings, West's very considerable talents for description are such that the reader really gets a feel for a large number of diverse places within the Balkans.She also does an excellent job illuminating a great deal of the history of the region, both relatively modern history (meaning modern at the time the book was written -- 1941) and more ancient history. Modern history at the time West wrote meant dealing with the Balkan wars, the series of rebellions by which the vestiges of the Ottoman empire were overthrown in the 19th and early 20th centuries. West devotes particular attention to the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo in June 1914, which precipitated World War I, an event that at the time of the writing of the book was still relatively recent in the world's memory, and the facts of which were still somewhat controversial. Ancient history meant dealing with the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, the decisive battle in which the Turks defeated the Orthodox Serbs led by Tsar Lazar and began to move further north and east in Europe.West's writing on why liberal democracies are typically reluctant to arm themselves to confront militant totalitarian regimes, which forms a secondary theme, seems quite fresh. West writes as an unabashed liberal and closely analyzes both her own squeamishness about violence and why, in more general terms, liberals' reluctance to use force is ultimately suicidal. Her criticism of the pacifism of the governments of pre-World War II England and France in the face of the visible threat of a rearming Germany and a bellicose Italy is both fascinating and dead-on. One of the points she makes in her admiration of the Slavs is that for five centuries, beginning with the Battle of of Kosovo, and largely ignored by Western Europe, they took arms against the totalitarian regime of their day, militant Islam in the form of the Ottoman empire. Her point of view on this issue is quite clear: for taking on this task, she regards the Serbs to have been the unrecognized and unthanked saviors of Western Christianity.As brilliant as this book is, however, it will not be to every reader's taste, even those who want to explore the history of the Balkans in depth. West makes little effort to disguise her prejudices: she sees the Slavs as an heroic if primitive race who had been ill-used by the then Great Powers of Europe, Great Britian, France, Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. And within what was then the newly-formed state of Yugoslavia (which came into being after World War I), she is emphatic in her sympathies for the Serbs, whom she sees as the the descendants of what was good and right in the Byzantine empire. West is equally obvious in her lack of sympathy for the Croats and the Bosnians. But seen through the lens of the more recent wars of Serbian aggression, it is harder to see the Serbs in such an unqualifiedly heroic light.Other parts of the books also wear less well, including her prolixity (the paperback edition is a whopping 1150 pages of small print). West's long tirades on the evils of the Austro-Hungarian empire seem a curiosity at this point; as evil as it may have been, it has long been relegated to the dustbin of history. Her antipathy to the Germans also seems an historical set piece, although rather more understandable in its context. And West's economic analyses of modern capitalism appear naive and superficial. Finally, the relatively major roles played in her narrative by she and her husband, their Serbian guide Constantine, and his German wife Gerda, are, at best, distracting. But these reservations should be seen for what they are: minor criticisms of an awe-inspiring work."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"...I initially was not so moved to write this review of Ms. West's remarkable work. What has inspired in me the need, though, was the reading of her being persistently condemned for her sympathy for the poor beleagured Serbians. Indeed...moreso than anything else, her work has forced me to ponder the question of 'What shall we tomorrow say of the 'poor, exploited, tormented Kosovars'?' It is most ironic that Ms. West's six-week journey through Yugoslavia should have so accurately succeeded in capturing the spirit of the land. Read it not for a travel guide, but as a snapshot of the past...nowhere else do we have access to many of the prodigious quantity of sources which she employed in her authoring...and whereelse may we hope to find a British tourist's view of the Balkans upon the eve of war? Nowhere. It is unique...and incomparable...and her revelations are sometimes stunning, her prose frequently beauteous...thus, five stars."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"One has to stand in awe before this enormous (ll40 pages) masterpiece of literary travel writing, even with its prejudice and poetry and occasional unkindness. Ms West and her husband and Constantine (he of the stubby fingers and wicked keyboard technique who tells unbelievable stories and opines on every imaginable topic) travel through Yugoslavia at the time Hitler is gaining power in Germany and the Habsburg Empire is just a dirty memory. Constantine is a Serb utterly devoted to the continued existence of the Yugoslav state but he's married to a dreadful hausfrau who despises anything that is not German and especially Slavs. She thus makes her own life miserable and does a number on the lives of everyone else. The book offers rich descriptions of all the states that make up (or made up)Yugoslavia, including religious and social customs, the mental and emotional tendencies of the people (sometimes depending on which outside influences -- Turkish, Austrian -- have impacted them most decisively). Montenegran men come in for high praise because because of their physical beauty and the presumed ease with which they could inseminate any woman. The book is a masterwork of richly textured Enlgish prose done in long, elegant, sometimes convoluted sentence that are a delight to read and may remind some readers of Proust. St. Paul and St. Augustine come in for the mistreatment they so richly deserve (the author traces several questionable religious practices she encounters to ideas found in their writings). This is a work for reasonably well educated adults, so anyone approaching it in search of accurate factual history is making a mistake. But nor will it mislead anyone on matters of historical fact."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"&quot;One must give these sheep-stealers plainly to understand that the European governments have no need to harness themselves to their lusts and rivalries.&quot; So Otto von Bismark, the German Chancellor and all-round diplomatic high-wire artist. The sheep-stealers in question are the nations of the Balkans, whose politics, evidently, were enough to frustrate even this most adroit of intriguers. Perhaps happily for him, he did not live long enough to see the world do exactly what he feared.There are two ways to get a grip on those Balkans -- a short way and a long way. The short way is through &quot;The Bridge on the Drina,&quot; by the Slavic Nobelist, Ivo Andric. The other is the great, sprawling monstrosity (cited above) by Rebecca West. Andric's novelized account of a near-millennium of Ottoman rule is a marvel of (if nothing else) concision. Individual set-pieces are unforgettable: the account of an impalement is not for the faint of heart.But anything as compact as Andric's narrative must necessarily expose itself to a charge of oversimplification, That is one charge few could bring against West's 1100-odd pages (not including index and bibliographical note). This is an irony, because West on the surface appears to have an agenda so simplistic as to be crude: the Yugoslavs are a species of noble savage, while their North European &quot;betters&quot; - more precisely, the Germans, are a gang of buffoons. Her caustic sendup of life in a train compartment with a party of German tourists is hilarious in its own right, and it surely didn't hurt her as the book hit the market at the beginning of World War II (also: it is near the beginning, so anyone who wants to claim to have read the whole will want to get at least that far).But facts do her the kindness of getting in the way. Agenda or no, West is one of the world's great reporters, with an enviable capacity to see not just what she wants to see, but rather what is before her eyes. The result is the best kind of journalism, and the best kind of history: a book full of exceptions &quot;We are too rough and too deep for your smoothness and your shallowness,&quot; her guide tells her in a fit of impatience. &quot;That is why most foreign books about us are insolently wrong.&quot; West must be wrong about a lot of things: any book so rich in detail and texture would have to be wrong about something. Thanks to her good efforts, it will be harder for her readers to be wrong."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"I read _Black Lamb and Grey Falcon_ about three years ago, just as the Kosovo conflict was at its height, and the book seemed to me then almost an essential primer to Yugoslav history and politics as seen from Anglo-American eyes. West has a strong tendency to simplify history and to write through the lens of prejudices against Germans and Muslims, so don't take her historical accuracy for granted. But she is a sympathetic traveller, a person who is fascinated by foreign places and who understands that cultural context is everything, and simply for this the book is worthwhile.However, I find the book especially valuable as an example of the &quot;encyclopedic&quot; book: the kind of book that transcends genres (history? travel literature? personal essays? memoir?), that is eager to accumulate and to share knowledge, that a reader ends up wanting to live with. Even though the important conflicts of the day have shifted east from Kosovo (but her discussion of the migration of the Turks into the Balkans is essential material for understanding the place of Muslims in Europe today), her book stays with me: not for what it says about Yugoslavia, but for what it says about how literature can be the tissue that connects individuals and history. Although reading this book is by no means a minor undertaking, it's well worth the time and trouble."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"The legendary critic Diana Trilling, who in this edition's blurb calls it one of the best of the 20th century, gets it right. The nay-sayers here who pan it, don't.Its reputation suffers currently because Rebecca West, writing in the late 1930s, sympathized with the Serbs, whose reputation has been darkened in our time by the atrocities of Bosnia and Kosovo.I would guess most West opponents favor rival Croats or Albanians just as they claim she favors the Serbs. A Serb advocate might point out that Croats and Muslims committed a few atrocities of their own as Yugoslavia broke apart. And a West defender may note that she was not equipped with a crystal ball showing Slobodan Milosevic's rise a half century later.When she wrote, the Serbs readily evoked Western sympathy: They were on the Allied side in World War I, and would be again, before the book went to press, in World War II, when they were invaded for bravely defying Hitler. They were Christians, inheritors of the legacy of Byzantium, who freed themselves from five centuries of Turkish Islamic domination, and had fought as well to free Macedonia and Bosnia. Their king had just been assassinated in France in an act machinated by Mussolini and abetted, through silence, by the world's nations. They suffered greatly throughout their history, including World War I, when the war with more powerful Austria swept back and forth over the land twice, forcing the army and many civilians to flee at one point in a horrifying death march through winter and mountains. And the Serbs had always fought with little more than moral support from great power allies, who betrayed them again and again. Weighing against them was their Orthodox Christian rite which often put them at odds with the powerful Roman Catholic Church.This book, however much it might have seemed dated during the 1990s, takes on a greater significance in the post 9/11 world: She shows us just how deep the roots of the Christian-Islamic conflict run in this land, for centuries that conflict's front line.West, for example, distinguishes marvelously between the Bosnian Muslims - Slavs who converted to Islam during the Turkish occupation, many of them Slav nationalists who supported Yugoslav nationhood - and the Turks themselves, who regarded the Slavs as other and inferior. She finds fascinating cross-religious alliances, with the Austrian Catholics cozying up to the Muslims of Bosnia when Austria ruled it, to the detriment of the land's Croat Catholics and Orthodox Serbs, who expected better of fellow Christians. She details a positively surreal scene in Sarajevo, where the Muslims anxiously await the first Turkish republican emissaries since the Ottomans were driven out a half century earlier. When these modern, Westernized diplomats arrive, from their land where Ataturk banned the fez and the burka, they are warm to modern Yugoslav officials, but baffled by and cool to what they regard as the still-backwards, Orientalized Muslims of Bosnia.West got away with a writing style full of ethnic generalizations that, today, would likely be attacked, by airheads anyway, as politically incorrect, regardless of the many hard truths she wrote. A feminist, she wrote of gender in a way delightfully free of today's academic cant. You'll find nary a \\"patriarchy\\" or \\"hegemony\\" here; she talks of men and women only when it matters.I don't believe she leans too strongly towards the Serbs. It is, after all, in great part the story of their lands, and of the short-lived state led by their monarchy. Her section on Bosnia, where the Croats, Serbs and Muslims all mixed, is fair to all sides. She finds much with which to fascinate the reader in Dubrovnik and elsewhere along the Dalmatian coast. The primary villains here are the Turks - not today's modernized, democratic Turks, but their imperial Ottoman predecessors, who sucked wealth and civilization out of the Balkans to set the stage for today's animosities. And West even manages to find some redemption for them in their transcending love of nature and the well-designed, pleasant homes they left behind.You are unlikely to find in English a more cogent account of the Archduke Ferdinand's assassination, which led to World War I. One sees how this equalled the Kennedy assassination for its lingering scent of conspiracy - was the killing actually orchestrated by the Russians? by the Austrians themselves? - and surpassed it in shaking the world, despite targeting a much less popular or powerful man.Many histories can supply hard facts. BLGF stands out for West's elegant travelogue writing in which she lashes together history; national and individual character; geography, ethnicity, and politics. She and her husband journey through Yugoslavia accompanied by a guide and translator who, also a poet, helps interpret the places that signify in Yugoslav history, as well as mundane settings from which West gleans the essence of the nation's many peoples.The book's length daunts, and sometimes the writing drags. Tensions with the guide-poet's German wife during the group's trip through Macedonia take up too much space. But one can forgive even this: West finds, in this woman's hostility and condescension toward her husband's country, the attitudes that were then driving Germany toward conquest - including its brutal occupation of Yugoslavia beginning in 1941, the year this book was published.Readers might consider countering the book's length by taking each national section - on Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, Macedonia and so forth - as individual books, setting the tome down for a while before starting the next unit."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"A somewhat queer book, but widely regarded as a classic. West is a splendid prose stylist, but not entirely trustworthy as a historian. She flits continually back and forth across the line between fact and fiction, and draws more symbolic meaning and universal truth from any given scene than any mere mortal rightfully ever should. West can be criticized for being almost obsequiously pro-Serbian, narrowly anti-Croat and even bigoted in her aversion to Germans, but her attitudes are easier to understand if one considers the time during which she did her research and writing. The book became controversial in some intellectual circles during the 1990s, as some believe Western policymakers were under the influence of Black Lamb and Grey Falcon when they were late and weak about intervening in the wars of Yugoslav succession. That strikes me as a silly notion. In that West has written 1,150 pages and continually diverges from the main thread of her narrative, I frankly doubt that more than a handful of policymakers-in all countries of the globe combined-ever have read her book from cover to cover. She herself confesses (p. 773) that \\"hardly anybody will read\\" her book \\"by reason of its length.\\" Like War and Peace, Moby Dick and the Holy Bible, this is a literary classic that one should read because it is good for you."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Yes \\"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon\\" is wonderful for all the reasons stated in these reviews, but for all that it must be said that the dominant theme of Ms West's masterpiece is the eternal human condition. She sees with the eyes of a woman and the eyes of a genius. She has seen humanity's troubled soul, and gently brought it to the surface in the fabric of her marvelous linguistic tapestry. \\"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon\\" is in a class by its self."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Rebecca West was a novelist, biographer, journalist, and critic born in 1892, when women were not liberated. Even so, in the 1920s she began working for the New York Herald-Tribune as a reviewer. Black Lamb and Grey Falcon was her magnum opus, published in 1941, after Yugoslavia had been conquered by the Nazis. This book is not only a travelogue through the Yugoslavia of the mid-1930s but it is a history of the region from the time of the Romans until the fall to the Nazis in 1941. A lot of what she has to say explains the problems that exist in the region today and why there must be a U. N. Peacekeeping Force there. It is a long book (1150 pages) but it is well-written and well-worth the read."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"I read this book while living in Tuzla, Bosnia. I've talked with the people and lived there, the attitudes of the public have not changed much and the same goes for the politics. To some West may seem to have favorites, but it is her book and her trip, read, learn, and follow along. The places she has been are really as beautiful as she describes them, the valleys are deep and green in the summer and white and serene in the winter. The people friendly, and welcoming. I truly enjoyed the book and am at this time reading it for the second time, reliving the experiences she had and the memories I have of that beautiful but troubled county."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"It amazes me that \\"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon\\" is still being read by people to inform themselves about the former Yugoslavia. It's not that the book lacks merit, but this value mainly lies in a number of West's keen observations of Yugoslav politics and society during the late 1930s and in the large number of interesting statements made by the people she met and associated with. Thus, it can be used as something of a supplement for the study of South Slav society in a given historical period--the 1930s (although cautiously, as West is notoriously biased). Also, her forays into (mainly) Serbian history contain a number of fascinating anecdotes, even if her general presentation leaves something to be desired. The key problem with \\"Black Lamb\\" is that it is also a very prejudiced text: West has her obvious favorites among the Yugoslav peoples, and her anti-Germanism sometimes borders on racism. This is understandable given that she wrote the book as Nazi Germany was attacking England, but it seriously taints many of her general conclusions about Germany and the Germans and their role in Central Europe. Additionally, although her most frequent criticism of the Germans is their allegedly irrational hatred of the Slavs, her own views are imbued with a patronizing fetishization of the Slavs that is only a little better than this apparent German animosity. West also spends a good deal of time bemoaning the horrible consequences of \\"Turkish\\" (i.e. Ottoman) rule in the Balkans, even though the Ottoman presence in this region had many positive as well as negative aspects. This, together with West's excessively lengthy, opinionated and often mind-numbing lectures on art, architecture, politics, philosophy and her skewed presentations of history (this is in fact why a book about a six-week tour of Yugoslavia meanders on for well over 1,000 pages) truly make this a poor source for general information on the Yugoslav peoples. Unfortunately, because it is still so widely read for precisely this reason (especially after it was re-popularized by Robert Kaplan in his equally flawed \\"Balkan Ghosts\\") and, somewhat inexplicably, because many serious Balkan scholars still include it in their bibliographies and reading lists, \\"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon\\" is something of an unavoidable text for anyone really interested in the former Yugoslavia. My point is simply that this book should not become the foundation for anyone's knowledge or study of this topic."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"This book recounts a journey made by the author and her husband as they traveled through Croatia, Dalmatia, Herzegovina, Bosnia, Serbia, Macedonia, Old Serbia, and Montenegro at a time when Hitter threatened to engulf all of Europe in a World War.Describing and analyzing the journey, the author fills more than a thousand pages.The highlight of the book is the epilogue which recounts the author's thoughts of the impact her travels made on assessing the politics of Germany and the Balkans at a turning point in history."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Black Lamb and Gray Falcon is monumental, and anyone that has written formal fiction or non-fiction can only marvel at how West maintains control over her materials at nearly 500,000 words, and over 1100 pages. We never get the impression that she is fatigued with the work --- and there is no repetition. Even if one is not interested in travel literature, BLGF is a must read, because it one of the great examples of its genre, and as such, transcends it. For all its length, West complains that one can never fully write about a place, can never actually capture it! That nugget is somewhere on page 900, I think, and although the reader can sympathize with her exasperation, we can hardly believe her."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"I'm a Serbian/Croatian linguist for the government, so this book struck my fancy right away. This is the most readable non-fiction book I've ever read. Mdm West's prose makes me feel as if I am traveling with her. I feel that I could easily find my way around 1930's Yugoslavia with no problem. Should I make a trip to Croatia, Bosnia or Serbia anytime in the future, Black Lamb and Grey Falcon will certainly travel with me."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"A Classic. Perhaps a little long-winded for the modern reader but full of interesting insights on interwar Jugoslavia and the imminent Nazi threat. Lots of information on earlier history and some amusing commentary on West's relations with her travelling companions who were a Jewish government official and his German wife, particularly considering the politically charged social atmosphere of the time. West has some 'interesting' opinions. In light of the author's background, it might be worth reading earlier works by Edith Durham as an interesting comparison."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Having visited Slovenia last year, this book was recommend as background material on the history of the area, before Slovenia become a country and other states in the area were formed. Her notes on her trip around and through most of the area was well written. It is a huge history, but with more detail than the average reader might want from this book."},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Rebecca West writes about her tour through Yugoslavia except Slovenia in the late 1930s,in great detail; combining history, legend, geography and her opinions. She meets a large cast of fascinating characters along the way and forms opinions about all of them and everything she sees. Ms West has vast knowledge and makes connections between much of what she sees and the entire fabric of European history, art, religion and pretty much everything else. Perhaps the best and most amusing parts are when she gets critical of the locals and her friends. The book is quite a slog and apparently never was presented to an editor. I read it in four pieces, while I was recovering from surgery. If your interested in Eastern Europe and particularly its most interesting country it is worth reading assuming you have a lot of time on your hands or don't mind spending two months reading one book"},{"Title":"Black lamb and grey falcon: A journey through Yugoslavia","review":"Honestly, this book is a classic travelogue about the Balkans region which was completed in 1938, but could have easily been written in 1988 just prior to the breakup of Yugoslavia. You will either love or hate this book, particularly the style of writing. Rebecca West is an upper middle class English feminist who obviously (and sometimes with too much gushing prose) LOVES the land and people of this troubled region.If you can get through the oft side-tracked narrative and the sometimes over-the-top prose, you will be rewarded with a frozen slice of European history that didn't begin to thaw until Tito's death. You will be amazed at her uncanny ability to get to the heart of the religious, cultural, and ideologically splits that existed within the Slavic communities just prior to the Second World War (and that still exist to this day!)Bottom line: this is a seminal work about the troubled Balkan region. If used as an anchor to other Balkan works, you will have a strong fundamental knowledge about the inevitable collapse of Yugoslavia into its diverse and rival parts."},{"Title":"Nightfisherman: Selected Letters","review":"In his endorsement to W S Graham's \\"The Nightfisherman: Selected Letters,\\" the 2005 Nobel prize winner Harold Pinter observes that W.S.Graham's \\"song is unique and his work is an inspiration.\\" Pinter adds \\"the same applies to this brilliant collection of letters.The subject is poetry\\" and \\"W.S.Graham drank and ate poetry every day of his life.\\" His letters display \\"an intelligence and sensibility ravished by language and conundrums of language.\\"Pinter is dead right, as ever on the ball.

They desire to know more about God and Jesus and these Bible stories are a perfect introduction for them. The stories are short enough to keep their attention, but amazingly have a lot of detail. There are plenty of illustrations, they remind me of Norman Rockwell artwork. It's a good size sturdy book that has 73 stories in it going all the way up to the New Testament where Jesus returns to Heaven. I really like how it starts w/the Adam and Eve/Genesis and continues on just like the Bible. It does not label the stories this way though. For example the first story is called \\"God Makes a Beautiful World\\". Included at the end of each story are a few questions. They prompt your child in their understanding & to apply the story to them self or current day situations.If you are looking to teach your children about the Bible and our Lord this is the book to do it.

It provides a lot of useful information, and I would consider this book a MUST for any Mego collector (though I'm not sure the latest edition is necessary). If I could make one change to this book, I would make it more of an \\"action figure archive\\" or \\"reference guide\\" and less of a price guide. It would have been very useful if the book spent more time telling us everything about each figure, including variations and accessories (kind of like the Mego Museum does), that would have made this a GREAT book. Also, this book seems to slight the WGSH figures a bit (i.e., not as much information or pictures about them as about the other figures). Don't get me wrong, I still found this book to be very useful and well worth the money (i.e., it did a lot of what I hoped, just not everything).

It said &quot;This book is for you.&quot; I took one look at it and suddenly my childhood came flooding back all over again.

Crammed full of an entire museum worth of mego toys, this book has everything from foreign exclusives to unproduced prototypes and production artwork. All the informative stories within are just priceless. I dare anyone to find a more comprehensive mego guide anywhere. There just isn't anything that compares to it. I only wish it could be longer. I just couldn't get enough. If it could be twice the size, I would gladly pay whatever price necessary. This is the book I see people using at all the toy shows.

I can count a handful of pictures that are actually new to this edition. I was looking forward to this book as I am an avid Mego collector, but I cannot express to you how disappointed I was in this revised edition. Everything is virtually the same. Some figures are curiously overpriced. (Example: a prototype that is valued at 6000.00, yet it is the only one and has never been sold - where does that value come from?)If you have the first edition of this book, it is enough for you to have some good reference, but this second edition is a total waste of money."},{"Title":"Holy Bible New King James Version Word in Life Study Bible","review":"I think that this is one terrific study Bible.

So half its people live in worsening poverty, a third are unemployed, and foreign debt totals $400 billion.Nieto focuses on the Cuban revolution and its effects. In March 1959, President Eisenhower ordered CIA sabotage and terrorism against Cuba. Kennedy was worse: Nieto writes, \\"His policies opposing the Revolution were more aggressive than Eisenhower's.\\" Two days before the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, US planes bombed Cuba's cities, under Kennedy's orders. Kennedy started the US policy of counter-insurgency in Latin America (and Africa and Asia), supporting death squads and military dictatorships. Nieto shows how the US state sponsored counterrevolutionary wars in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Guatemala and Chile.Johnson carried on Kennedy's policies: he backed the generals' fascist coup in Brazil in 1964, and attacked the Dominican Republic in 1965. Nieto depicts Reagan's wars - occupying Honduras, arming the death squads of El Salvador, running the Contras' terrorist war against Nicaragua, attacking Grenada - and Bush's attack on Panama.The US state has never ceased its illegal, terrorist attacks on Cuba. The New York Times reported in 1983 how the head of a Miami-based anti-Cuban terrorist group admitted in a US court that he had taken germs to Cuba in 1980, proving Cuba's accusations of CIA biological warfare against Cuba. The US state made Armando Valladares - a former Batista police officer and convicted terrorist - ambassador and president of its delegation to the UN Human Rights Commission.But the Commission's 1989 report refuted all the US slanders about Cuba's torture and abuse of political prisoners. The world knows now who tortures and abuses political prisoners detained without charge or trial.Nieto's final chapter examines how Cuba has survived and kept its revolution going. The key is that its people, determined to defend their democracy, independence and sovereignty, actively prevent the counter-revolution from organising."},{"Title":"Masters of War: Latin America and U.S. Agression From the Cuban Revolution Through the Clinton Years","review":"This book is a typical denunciation of US policy towards Latin America. It focuses on Cuba since the Revolution (1959), but covers events from countries throughout the region, including the Central American civil wars and the Southern Cone military dictatorships. Everything is true in the book; but its great weakness is that it is nothing more than a long list of events trying to show that US policy towards Latin America was belligerent in the latter half of the twentieth century. It lacks any original or dynamic interpretations. I would only recommend this book to someone who does not know, or believe, that the United States has behaved as an imperial power in Latin America."},{"Title":"Masters of War: Latin America and U.S. Agression From the Cuban Revolution Through the Clinton Years","review":"This text is a required reading for any Latin American course.

My one critique of the book is an obvious bias against the United States with no intent on even trying to be objective. I would still highly recommend it. The obvious biases aside it is an excellent tool in understanding why Latin American people and leaders have negative feelings towards the United States and why Latin Americans see the U.S. as the bad guys."},{"Title":"MAGICAL MELONS","review":"This book has more great stories about Caddie Woodlawn.

I had lived in Japan as a child two different times during the occupation, and later during the cold war.My parents made sure we kids explored the country, its people and customs (my father worked with the DOD as a Japanese language specialist)...I studied classic Japanese dance and my sensei begged my parents to leave me with her (I was 15) when they returned to the states, which of course they didn't. I returned after college and lived another 10 years. I was often told I was more Japanese than the Japanese women of my generation, and I felt it, too. I wore kimono and behaved as though I'd been born AND raised there. SO...I tell you that I was so increduluous to read a book that put into words all the frustrations and criticisms I had about the culture. I have recommended it to many people who are seriously interested in the Japanese mind set,but didn't even know if it was available, and have looked for a copy for years. I am so pleased to see it available.I can not speak for the current generation of Japanese living in Japan, and this book probably IS dated, but at the time, it was totally accurate... he knew exactly what he was talking about; he did not have some superficial, romantic, brainwashed take on the way things really were. Speaking of brainwashing, I made sure I left the country before my daughter became school-age, because brainwashing is exactly what I would call what they did to the kids in school back then. I understand it has improved, and they are now encouraging kids to think for themselves, but I live with a 68 year old Japanese man who just the other day said it wasn't necessary for girls to go to college!I will have to re-read this book before I can fairly rate it........"},{"Title":"The kimono mind : an informal guide to Japan and the Japanese.","review":"'The Kimono Mind' makes a laymans effort to try to explain the intricacies of Japan. Rudofsky denounces the customs and history of the country as soon as he erroniously explains them. Ancient accounts from racist sailors are given to back up the history of Rudofsky's bad interpretations, lending to some downright obsurd and incorrect accusations of the Japanese people.This is a book that is not fit for anthropological research, and seems to only belong to a bygone era. If you are looking for the skewed American view of Japan from the 'The Kimono Mind's publishing date of 1965, this is the book for you. Typical of old white American men in 1965, the book has a racially biased tone and misquoted history to serve it's purposes. If you are rather searching for a quality read with anthropological fact and information on the Japanese as a people, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Folk Shawls: 25 knitting patterns and tales from around the world (Folk Knitting series)","review":"A fantastic collection of shawls from the past.

Some are such obscure techniques that I can't even find a knitter who has heard of them.Substitutions have also proved successful -- one pattern called for a delicate DK weight yarn (which just wasn't soft enough for what I wanted) but turned out gorgeous when knit in a merino worsted.The veriations of \\"shawl\\" in this book have to be seen to be believed -- laying in the dust all those \\"just knit it in a different color and call it a new pattern\\"-shawl books."},{"Title":"Folk Shawls: 25 knitting patterns and tales from around the world (Folk Knitting series)","review":"I liked this book.

So far I've understood all the instructions, considering I am still a beginner."},{"Title":"Folk Shawls: 25 knitting patterns and tales from around the world (Folk Knitting series)","review":"I bought this book as an introduction to knitting lace shawls. I want to learn the basic increase/decrease and shaping techniques so that I can design my own patterns. For me, this book was the perfect place to start.In the current printing of this book, it appears the pattern errors have been eliminated. I went to the Interweave Press website to print the errata for the pattern I'm working on, and found that all of the mistakes had been corrected. If you have an older copy of the book, you can print the corrections from PDF files at the IP website.This book was highly recommended to me by other knitters when I asked what pattern books to purchase to learn lace knitting. The instructions are concise, and the charts are easy to read. The variety of patterns makes it a perfect book for experimenting with yarn substitution, and different lengths and shapes for shawls."},{"Title":"Folk Shawls: 25 knitting patterns and tales from around the world (Folk Knitting series)","review":"I love the little ethnic/historical stories that go with each shawl. And that there are shawls from all over the world. These are the practical shawls that women can really use, not just museum pieces that will be used once for a special ocassion, wrapped in tissue and put away somewhere. The directions are clear and the drawings are great.And, I liked seeing each shawl on the author. Seeing each one on the same person gives a sense of size and scale that you don't usually get from knitting books."},{"Title":"Folk Shawls: 25 knitting patterns and tales from around the world (Folk Knitting series)","review":"This book was purchased for me as a gift. My favorites to knit have always been small items. That is, until I received this book. The pictures are beautiful, and the patterns are clear and easy to follow. Most of them come in both chart and written instructions. I have read the descriptions of the myths and legends surrounding these works of art over and over again. Also, there is a wide variety of shawls, from small triangles to very large squares! I have to mention that there is a few errors, and if you look online you can find the corrections. I would suggest that anyone who knits order this book....and be prepared to start knitting yourself a shawl!"},{"Title":"Folk Shawls: 25 knitting patterns and tales from around the world (Folk Knitting series)","review":"This is a nice little book of shawl patterns. Although it lacks the sophistication ofVictorian Lace TodayandA Gathering of Lacewith respect to elaborate lace patterns in the light weight lace yarns, it does present a collection of simple, utilitarian patterns in basic worsted weight yarns.This is a good place for a beginning to intermediate knitter to start learning lace stitches and their effects. Furthermore the patterns provide immediate, attractive fabrics that serve a useful purpose. Although I didn't care much for the style of the Ruanna, it would easily \\"dress up\\" with the stitch design and color way for the Robozo in the same section. The Japanese Kimono shawl is a very nice leaf style stitch, which makes a lovely wrap and and allows the newcomer to lace patterns to gain a lot of practice without being overwhelmed by the number of non-repeating rows in a single design or the variety of patterns in combined design. The Aran pocket shawl is very clever, and would be easy for a new knitter to get started.The photos are very nice, and while the ambiance of the background is not as impressive as the above books, the patterns themselves are well illustrated."},{"Title":"Folk Shawls: 25 knitting patterns and tales from around the world (Folk Knitting series)","review":"This book is fantastic. I'd like to make everyone of the shawls. So far I've made one, and started one some time ago from the pre issued pattern with mistakes. Now I've just cast on two more and since I'm traveling it has to go in my suitcase and I'll probably gift it to a knitting friend out in Indonesia. So I have to order a second copy! The shawls use lots of different weights of yarns and the patterns are beautiful and not difficult and the geographical background of the shawls makes it more interesting. I'd love to see her write a second book on shawls."},{"Title":"Folk Shawls: 25 knitting patterns and tales from around the world (Folk Knitting series)","review":"I'm a Latina, married to a Japanese man, and have a Navajo sister-in-law. There is a Spanish Christening Shawl, a Mexican Ribozo shawl, a Kimono Shawl, and a Native American shawl in this book. Not to mention many many other types of shawls from around the world. I also love the sampler shawl, it is beautiful. I basically want to make every single shawl right now. I don't wear shawls. That's how inviting this book is. The photos are exquisite. It is the first book I bought on the spot in a book store in a long time, rather than waiting to get it shipped from Amazon. Something about having my cultures included makes it a very special book for me. Plus, the author lives in my neck of the woods:)"},{"Title":"Folk Shawls: 25 knitting patterns and tales from around the world (Folk Knitting series)","review":"Love this book !!

The Folk Shawl book is easy to read, easy to understand, and gave me my first introduction to lace knitting. I was instantly hooked. I've knitted several of the shawls from this book and highly recommend it to anyone exploring lace knitting for the first time and as a tool to introduce newer knitters to this art. I've had great fun with Folk Shawls and have become a wearer of my shawls preferring them to sweaters.....they easily slip on and off and are a comfort in the cold weather. I even knitted a heavier version of the larger Stora shawl out of worsted weight wool and wore it as a substitute for a coat over an alpaca sweater!Thank you Cheryl Oberle for a wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Folk Shawls: 25 knitting patterns and tales from around the world (Folk Knitting series)","review":"After several attempts at teaching myself, I STILL cannot manage two needles at once! So, I can't vouch for the clearness of the knitting directions, but the background stories and beautiful, clear photographs are inspirational enough to make this book well worth adding to your collection. The charts made it possible for me to convert my favorite pattern to crochet (it took me a long time to decide on just one!) and I suspect there may be more shawls in my future...."},{"Title":"Folk Shawls: 25 knitting patterns and tales from around the world (Folk Knitting series)","review":"comprehensive, creative showing of a number of traditional shawls. Some designs are original to the author. Cast-ons, and cast-off choices are considered and explained. Good, clear photos.Ironically, I have this book b/c other people made shawls from these patterns in other color-ways. The color and yarn choices in the book aren't particularly attractive, at least to my eyes. The Mustaa Villaa variation on the cover shawl sold the book, as far as I'm concerned.Nice interludes, quotes and research."},{"Title":"Folk Shawls: 25 knitting patterns and tales from around the world (Folk Knitting series)","review":"My copy is dog-eared and full of notes. It's in the section of the bookcase in my studio that is within arm's-reach when I'm working. Culture, history, and diverse methods of construction provide a wealth of information in a modest little package. The block prints by Cheryl's husband are charming; I'd love a book of those! Included are stoles, triangular worsted-weight shawls, Faroese in two sizes, Japanese tea shawl (a lovely stole with an oriole-type lace), an amazing Irish shawl that could shelter a small family, and lots more. Cultures all over the world are represented here, lending a charm and warmth to the backstory of each.I strongly recommend \\"Folk Vests\\" by Cheryl Oberle as well. It sits right next to \\"Folk Shawls\\" and is in use constantly. Cheryl is an excellent judge of what to edit, leaving behind solid, clear instruction from a trusted, creative source."},{"Title":"Folk Shawls: 25 knitting patterns and tales from around the world (Folk Knitting series)","review":"Folk Shawls is mostly a pattern book. There are many great anecdotes about the countries the shawls derive from, and historical information about how the shawls were derived. The shawls are all lovely, and range from simple to complex.Oberle does not waste the experienced knitter's time with a how-to section. There is a \\"techniques\\" chapter, but it only gives instructions for specific methods used in the patterns. These are methods that will probably be familiar to experts, but the chapter is informative for beginning and intermediate knitters.I say it's \\"mostly\\" a pattern book, but the construction of each design is broken down in such a way that a knitter of intermediate or higher skill level could adapt it for a different yarn and gauge. So in that sense, it is also a book of inspiration."},{"Title":"Folk Shawls: 25 knitting patterns and tales from around the world (Folk Knitting series)","review":"After burning out my eyes and hands on doing numerous lace weight projects, I was thrilled when a friend introduced me to this book. Not only does it have a wonderful collection, but a number of projects are non-lace weight, a sorely needed respite. Additionally, finding a book that I have done multiple projects from is no small feat as many knitters know. It is easy to modify patterns to your liking, e.g., I modified the Wool Peddler's Shawl and omitted the lace chart, added a yarnover eyelet row and a small ruffle. I'm hoping to making the Indian Wrap for a friend of mine who hosts sweat lodges. The Rebozo takes my breath away. Another great point is that so far, the yarns are still available!! How many times have I come across patterns in which the yarn has been discontinued. Folk Shawls brings attention to one of my favorite yarns (Harrisville Designs), as well as other easily obtained fibers. A \\"go-to\\" book that will be relevant throughout my knitting experience."},{"Title":"Folk Shawls: 25 knitting patterns and tales from around the world (Folk Knitting series)","review":"This is one of those books I have looked at over and over. The photos are beautiful and I drool over which shawl I want to knit first.The shawls are a collection of ethnic patterns representing countries all over the world: The Faroe Islands, Ireland, Japan, The American Heartland, Iceland, England, Russia, Scotland, South America, Norway, Native America, the Himalayas, and Spain.This book is for intermediate to advanced knitters and for those who can work with charts. It is way too complicated for a beginner. Most of the patterns are lace.I recommend this book for any lace knitter who wants to knit a shawl and for others who want to look at beautiful knit items and find inspiration."},{"Title":"Folk Shawls: 25 knitting patterns and tales from around the world (Folk Knitting series)","review":"I've only been knitting for about a year so I wasn't sure if this book would be way out of my league. I think it's going to become one of my favorite pattern books. All of the shawls are gorgeous and the instructions are great for an intermediate knitter like myself. It has a wonderful mix of easier up to more challenging patterns. Right now I'm working on the Victorian Wood Peddler's Shawl. I cannot wait to wear it, and I'm sure at some point I will have made one of each pattern in the book. It's a must have for the shawl-knitter's library."},{"Title":"Folk Shawls: 25 knitting patterns and tales from around the world (Folk Knitting series)","review":"Any knitter will be pleased with this book of shawls, there are shawls for everyone's taste.

Lovely patterns worth making more then once."},{"Title":"Folk Shawls: 25 knitting patterns and tales from around the world (Folk Knitting series)","review":"This book contains the absolute best collection of gorgeous shawl patterns I've ever seen in one volume.

They originate from Ireland, Japan, Iceland, Victorian England, Russia, Scotland, Mexico, Norway and more. Each design will teach you more to enhance your skills and an average knitter should be able to create most of them. The instructions are both written and charted.This is an amazingly creative book for knitters or anyone who loves fashion and fashion history. For me, this would even be worth purchasing if I didn't know how to knit.

And Cheryl Oberle's book on shawls is not to be missed.The photography is really outstanding. Cheryl models her shawls in such a way to show the beauty of the shawl and at the same time make an artistic statement.The shawls represented are quite varied; most are done, however, in sport weight yarn. This is convenient for those who don't want to attempt a project in cobweb-fine laceweight yarn. However, directions are given if you do want to change the yarn weight to suit your tastes.The schematics include a layout of the shawl shape (oblong, diamond, triangle, etc) and the lace patterns are charted in many cases. There is a nice section on techniques.All together, a really fine volume in the folk series from Interweave Press."},{"Title":"Folk Shawls: 25 knitting patterns and tales from around the world (Folk Knitting series)","review":"I found this book to be excelent. Not only do they have some of the best patterns I have seen in a while. But it also gives you the history of the shawls. The patterns are easy to follow. With clear instructions. It also contains line by line and charts for the patterns. Which make them great to follow. With shawls from The Faroe Islands, Ireland, Japan, America, Iceland, Victorian England, Russia, Scotland, Mexico, South America, Norway, Native America, The Himalayas and Spain. Also three others that are called variations. This book has somthing for everyones tastes. And in the back of the book it gives the yarn sources used in the patterns. Containing addresses, telephone numbers and web sites. All of the shawls are pictured with the aurther. They are done with a clear picture of the shawl. You can truly see the work on them and their is also a drawing of all of the shawls. So you can see the shape of the finished product. I truly like this book. I think the story that comes with each one is truly inspiring."},{"Title":"Folk Shawls: 25 knitting patterns and tales from around the world (Folk Knitting series)","review":"Shawls are a great thing to knit. Even for beginners, the lack of shaping (armholes, etc.) allows for a project that can be elegant when finished and is often deceptively easy to make. Shawls are in the fashion news and Cheryl Oberle's book couldn't be timed better.This is primarily a pattern book. Cheryl's designed 25 terrific rectangles, squares and triangles drawing upon international traditions (and her own imagination). She includes a brief history of the tradition as an introduction to each shawl. The photography is wonderful. As for Cheryl being the model, the story (straight from Cheryl's mouth) is that Cheryl was demonstrating how to wear the shawls to the model. The photographer said that there was no way the model would ever wear the shawls as gracefully as Cheryl -- hence Cheryl the model.My only reservation on this book is that it's light on technique. There's a small opening segment with everything one needs to know for the book. But, if you aren't looking to make one of the shawls, this isn't the sort of book you're likely to use as a reference or source of inspiration for your own designs.Skill range -- advanced beginner to expert."},{"Title":"Folk Shawls: 25 knitting patterns and tales from around the world (Folk Knitting series)","review":"I resisted buying this book for quite a while because I had been disappointed by an earlier purchase of a book about knitted shawls. I'm SO glad I gave in and ordered it! This book had what I missed in the other book - descriptive histories of the particular style or origin of shawl traditions from many countries (mentioned in other reviews). The historical perspective is fascinating and inspires thought about the day-to-day reality of the women who knitted them and the role that shawls and knitting played in women's lives. The shawl is perhaps one of the oldest of garments, worn by women in all kinds of rites of passage: as christening blankets, wedding veils, winding sheets, in celebration, in work, in prayer and in mourning. Surprisingly, while the shawls pictured are faithfully drawn from the traditional style of each country, none of them look dated or dowdy - all are superbly wearable today. The photographic presentation of the shawls is excellent - modeled by the author in a manner to focus on the shawl itself, its drape, its pattern, its construction. The shawls range in knitting challenge from beginner to advanced; from simple garter stitch to intricate lace pattern. The construction variations are fascinating - rectangular, triangular, square, butterfly-shaped, pieced. Each shawl pattern is presented in photograph and line drawing with both line-by-line and charted knitting directions. It is clear that much research, thought and love went into this book. Even if you don't wear shawls (&quot;you just haven't met the right shawl&quot;, says the author), this book is a must-have for every true knitter's library."},{"Title":"Folk Shawls: 25 knitting patterns and tales from around the world (Folk Knitting series)","review":"This book is by far my favorite knitting pattern book. I've had it for nearly five years and it's a standby for me when I need a tried and true lace pattern or an edging for a project, or when I need to make an extra special gift. The designs are stunning and the stitch patterns are transferrable to other projects like sweaters, scarves, ponchos, socks, etc. Since gauge isn't as important in shawl knitting as it is in a fitted garment, substituting yarns is a breeze and I have the freedom to experiment and carry my results over to a project that requires more precision.There is a small amount of time spent in teaching new techniques and the reader is forced to read charts on some of the designs, although most have the long hand directions as well. There are beginner patterns as well as some very challenging patterns and everything in between. My 12-year-old daughter knit the Garter Stitch Prairie Shawl in a rayon yarn from Interlacements and it turned out unbelievably beautiful. After working well over half of these shawls, some more than once or twice, my favorite so far is the Feather and Fan Triangle, but the Highland Triangle Shawl is, so far, the most durable and practical for everyday use. I've learned so much about knitting and garment construction from doing these patterns. They offer so many variations that even after you've done every one, you could start all over and do them again in a different yarn at a different gauge and add your own little touches to give you a brand new design.A nice bonus is the folklore that is included about each shawl--charming reading and great little tidbits to pass on. This book, along with Traditional Knitted Lace Shawls by Martha Waterman have moved me along by leaps and bounds in my knitting endeavors and given me \\"visions of grandeur\\" about designing my own patterns.Just a quick warning--check the Interweave website for corrections before starting a project. More recent editions may have the corrections in them, but there are a number of small errors that an experienced knitter would work out for themselves, but a beginner would stumble over. Nearly all knitting books have errors somewhere, so better to check than be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Folk Shawls: 25 knitting patterns and tales from around the world (Folk Knitting series)","review":"As other reviewers have mentioned, shawls and wraps--especially hand-knitted ones--suffer from unfortunate connotations of aged decrepitude or hippy-dippy New-Age peasantry. This book, however, manages to integrate history, folk tradition and beautiful taste without invoking the Shawl Curse.A perfect combination of simplicity and style sets off these well-chosen designs, making \\"Folk Shawls\\" a pleasure to browse as well as to use. These are elegant, sophisticated garments, beautifully presented. You may well find yourself considering them as gifts for friends or family members you would never before have labeled shawl-wearers.Another attribute of this book is clear, well-presented instructions; I have worked practice motifs on nearly all the designs, and have yet to find an error... something I certainly couldn't say about a few other recent knitting book purchases. Even if you tend to buy knitting books more for idle musing and planning than prompt execution of projects, it will provide you with much to enjoy."},{"Title":"Folk Shawls: 25 knitting patterns and tales from around the world (Folk Knitting series)","review":"As a somewhat inexperienced knitter (been knitting very little more than stockinette stitch for nigh on 30 years), I found this book to be excellent! The patterns -- reworked from traditional designs into knitting patterns reflective of the origins and intentions of the originals -- are lovely, and the photographs give you a marvelous preview of what the finished product should look like. Of course, the one that I chose was one of the most complex in the book. The charting and instruction given, including (and especially) the section on techniques, were most helpful, and I was able to create an heirloom quality piece without running to anyone in the middle of the night for assistance. I'm eager to try another!BE ADVISED: It does take quite a long time to finish some of these projects. It has taken me three months to finish one since I don't have large blocks of time to spend.

I have almost finished the \\"Simple Garter Stitch Prarie Shawl\\". Despite its simplicity, the author said it \\"was a joy to knit\\"--and so it is.

If your looking at this book and thinking about getting it, I recommend getting the book, if your new to these kinds of things, like me, you can always start using scrap yarns and then move up to the more sophisticated yarns if you are comfortable with reading the pattern.

The only drawback which is easily overcome if the desire to learn is there, is that this book has SO MUCH information, it can be a little tedious learning all the terms and following the scientific basis for Mrs. Rogers studies.

I bought this novel from a book shop (shucks, sorry about that, Amazon). This is my first ever review, and even though I've bought this book elsewhere, I need for you to know how wonderful it is - quite simply, I love it.The novel is beautifully written. It is told from the point of view of Elinor, an American who moves to France with her husband and two children. There, a beautiful Frenchwoman, Beatrice, catches her attention and she finds herself inexplicably drawn to her.This is a novel of substance. There is great insight and observational irony as the story weaves through the difficulties of being an American abroad on the eve of the Iraq war. In the industrial town of Cherbourg, the American expat community is tight and conformist and Elinor finds herself making friends with the expat wives out of convenience rather than desire. Fully aware that Cherbourg, a bleak, industrial town is nothing like Paris where she spent a year as a student, Elinor slowly develops a friendship with Beatrice, and is confronted with the strictures of living a conventional life while desiring another. The growing but subtle attraction throughout this story is powerful and exquisitely told. Here's a little taster:\\"But that day, at the beginning of Alexi's third school year, Elinor looked past Harriet Randall's head, momentarily distracted by something extraordinary. A tall, dark-haired woman, bent down and effortlessly lifted her small daughter up onto her shoulders and carried her past them, out of the courtyard and onto the street. The woman led with her free hand another tiny boy and her two older, beautiful daughters followed behind. At once, everything about the woman was vigorous, strong and fine, nothing like Elinor had ever seen before. There is never anything so startling as a beautiful woman rendered more obvious among a great many dull and tedious members in the crowd of the school yard that day, and Elinor tried not to gape. She tried to pretend to Harriet she was listening to her, reluctantly taking her gaze from the woman and settling in on Harriet's very ordinary features. She said something, \\"you're absolutely right, they should do something,\\" and turned back to look in feigned concern for any other wayward child, past the gate after the woman, walking it seemed in slow motion, her long strides, carrying her up the sidewalk, her mane of dark hair loose to her shoulders. Elinor would not admit then that she had chosen her as decidedly as if she had stated out loud to Mrs Randall, \\"she's the one.\\"\\"This book is the gem in my collection. It is the one I turn to often because it has passages that simply stop me in my tracks. Like I said, it isn't your typical lesbian romance story - it's not designed to make you sizzle as it builds toward a climactic moment. But, it might make you run a forefinger gently over a line that challenges you to think about your own life and your own desires."},{"Title":"French Postcards","review":"I love lesbian romance, have read hundreds of them but knew this would be something different because Spinsters' Ink doesn't do the typical lesbian romance. Did I get a surprise? I could not put down this book, had to read it at one go! It is an inner monologue, as one reviewer wrote, but written in a way that just swallowed me whole! Elinor's quiet ruminations, observations, tightly held feelings - they are completely captivating, and I really enjoyed the undercurrent of gentle irony that coloured it all. A \\"lesbian romance\\" it is not, but a beautiful love story nevertheless! Love the cover too!"},{"Title":"French Postcards","review":"When I ordered this book, I expected to receive a lesbian romance. What I actually received was a lonely woman's retelling of her unrequited love affair with another woman. Elinor and her family have moved to France. She begins to notice one of the other mothers at her kids' school and starts to fantasize about having a romance with the elusive woman. Over time, the two near-strangers begin to develop a fragile friendship. Elinor can't decide if the other woman is interested in a romance, nor can she decide if she herself would be willing to take that next step.The simple fact is this book is rather boring. The entire story is told via a conversation in Elinor's head. The other woman's name isn't even revealed until the last chapter or so. There is only one kiss. There are no declarations of love or forever.Although it is very light on romance and wasn't what I expected. The story is well-written, but is not engaging. Once I readjusted my expectations, I was able to finish the story. However, I feel the description on the book is misleading and does not accurately reflect what is between the covers."},{"Title":"French Postcards","review":"An unusual and entertaining novel, French Postcards by Jane Merchant is the engaging story of Elinor and her husband's decision to move their family to France. As Elinor adjusts to the life among the French, French Postcards creatively depicts the progression of her unexpected attraction and relationship to a woman named Beatrice. French Postcards is an exotic narrative story of two women who betray their life with husbands and children for a love never before discovered or imagined, and is very highly recommended for its unique and diverse perspective on intimacy and passion, as well as love at its most pure and true state."},{"Title":"French Postcards","review":"June 10, 2007French Postcards by Jane MerchantA perfect summer read! I'm still thinking about it. If you love Jane Austin you will love this modern, intelligent book. American Elinor is as real as Emma and the Frenchwoman is as inscrutable as Miss Fairfax. It is the best comic novel I have read in a long time. France, in Elinor's imagination, is romance personified and when she sees the tall Frenchwoman in the school yard hoist her little girl onto her shoulders, she is smitten. The foolishness that ensues is laugh out loud and yet very touching. If you want to be taken to another place, read this book.

I inherited my copy from a relative.Even as a kid I found its advice bizarre and at times hilariously funny: The reason caucasians are superior, why girls should save themselves for marriage (and what happens when they don't), and how if the young bride keeps a clean, odor-free body she will be assured a long, happily married life. One chapter encourages you to pass on these and other worthy thoughts with the title, \\"Explaining Sexual Life to Your Daughter.\\" Nothing similar for \\"your son,\\" of course, as we all know what HE should do!The \\"eugenics\\" part of the title clues you in on the overall theme of racial and class superiority and the \\"white/rich man's burden.\\" I am not a historian, but this book clearly represents the thinking of the times, and boils it all down in a very unapologetic way.I think any scholar who attempts to explore the nasty underside of early 20th Century American thought might want to have a copy of this text that was taught in sociology classes to people who went on to assume leadership of the country in the 1950s.I found in Google that at least some others have already done this sort of study and that this particular book pops up in an interesting essay by Michael Rembis. He points out that while governments in Europe were passing laws to brutally enforce these \\"eugenic\\" absurdities in sterilization clinics, leading ultimately to the Nazi atrocities, in the U.S, a more subtle approach was used to spread similar thinking in classrooms and private homes.It would be interesting to know how much of the Rush Limbaugh knee-jerk radio rabidness of today is left over from such formal teachings to our parents and to their parents.

To improve the book's value in the field, my associates and I carefully copy considerable information from the American banding manual and other references to my BNA field book; we need the book to last a long time. Unfortunately the paper in my older less expensive hardbacks is apparently superior under field conditions to the newer versions. My latest hard cover version absorbs water excessively, pages are swelling, getting warped, and accept new ink poorly, The book rather quickly becomes awkward to use and is getting worse. The pages and page numbers in the soft and hard cover books are not the same. The first and last bit of pages are not even the same. Some useful index summaries are not correct for both and communication at a banding station is complicated when some are not using the same type cover.

Having maps, colored pictures and information all on one page is the most helpful part of this book. The top left corner of each page is color coded and useful when looking for particular birds. The \\"song\\" information is not as helpful. The graphs are too small for me as an older person.In addition there are drawings of different positions of birds, showing wing span and wing colors of birds in the same families.Other features are shown as well, so that one can spot females from males and immature from mature birds.

I wanted an updated version, and the information in this new printing is indeed updated. But the pictures are very badly reproduced. My 44-year-old version looks brand new in comparison. The plates are blurry and over-exposed, making them look washed out and destroying important nuances.

Any bird spotted can quickly be indentified quickly and easily with this guide."},{"Title":"A Guide to Field Identification: Birds of North America","review":"No one has captured the real look of birds the way Singer has. Singer's paintings are really a major creative event.HOWEVER, St. Martin's doesn't seem to have the reverence for these illustrations that it should. Instead of remastering the originals and providing the book with the best reproduction of the paintings, St. Martin's has cheaply reproduced them in such a way that colors are noticeably faded and washed out -- to the point of possibly affecting identification in a few places. Also, terns and other white birds often seem to vanish into the page.When the original edition came out many years ago, it changed the look of all field guides for the better. People were also impressed with the value they got. Even the cover was not some rehashed illustration from the interior of the text, but a specially-painted scene of three buntings. That piece of art has now been tossed out entirely and replaced with a rather dreary and photographic-like illustration of two bald eagles perched together with an immature -- obviously their offspring.My copy has the birds' wing tips, tails, feet, and sonagrams cut off at the bottom of many pages. This is very annoying.Also, the broad-billed hummingbird is mistakenly labeled \\"broad-bellied\\" on page 191. I spotted the broad-billed the other day and couldn't figure out what was going on in the text!Where are the check boxes in the index? That's a huge omission!I still highly recommend this book. No other captures the look of birds in the field as well.St. Martin's would be well advised to never throw out any of Singer's art. That's kind of a crime and they need to appreciate that fact before they diddle with this great book anymore! The publisher needs to lose the current cover and replace it with the old -- or a redesigned cover with the original art. The edition should be redone with improved reproductions of Singer's fabulous paintings.If you don't have this book, buy it anyway! It's great and the price has always made the book a steal."},{"Title":"A Guide to Field Identification: Birds of North America","review":"Were this the only guide to North American birds, I would emphatically recommend it. However, it is not. The Sibley's guides have come out; they are leagues ahead of this one in clarity, accuracy, and pure and simple artistic beauty.I also strongly recommend the National geographic series guides, third or fourth editions.Getting this book would be like buying a 20 years old, cosmetically refurbished car for 4500 dollars when you could get a brand new, superior model for 5500 dollars."},{"Title":"A Guide to Field Identification: Birds of North America","review":"As an avid birder who deals with many difficult ID's in the field, I can say based on experience that this guide is one of the worst. Colors are poorly represented and some field marks are just outright incorrect. This guide would have one believing that every species of sparrow or warbler is exactly the same shape (Not so! In fact many birds can actually be identified just by shape). The birds in this book don't even have eyes that are properly placed on their heads! That should tell you something about the overall accuracy of this book.I do not know a single professional birder who uses or recommends this guide as a primary source. (Sibley guides are by far the best choice for beginners or pros)Beginning birders are usually happy with this guide, but beginners have no way of knowing how much they are missing out on by choosing this guide. If you have trouble identifying sparrows, fall warblers, peeps, or gulls, this guide will be of little help compared to the many superior guides now available."},{"Title":"A Guide to Field Identification: Birds of North America","review":"Late May, 2011:I have a very large home library of bird guides from across decades. The 1996 edition of the Golden series Birds of North America was just fine with its wonderful Arthur Singer paintings, range maps,and sonagrams. It remains a great casual guide, easy to tote in the field, especially for beginning birders. I wanted the 2001 version to compare changes in range maps, and any new sonagrams. It is not up to date with species splits and changes. As of 2011, any/all birding guides are yet to be up to date with current IOU species changes. My main complaint and the low 2-star rating has to do with the poor production qualities of the plates. The original Golden Guide with the gorgeous cover painting of buntings was worth owning just for the Singer plates. The 2001 edition plates, at least in my copy of this book, appear washed out, faded, color-distorted (especially in the yellows) and even slightly 'fuzzy.' The rich colors and the crisp outlines of the bird images are not present in the 2001 edition compared to the the original edition."},{"Title":"A Guide to Field Identification: Birds of North America","review":"I have all the major guides (National Geographic, Audobon, Peterson, etc.), and do refer to them for cross-referencing. However, it is the Golden Guide that is written in, tattered and dusty (thank goodness for its &quot;old-fashioned&quot; stitch binding and wipe-clean cover), and in my &quot;going birding&quot; kit or within arm's reach on my desk at home. Why...?Because paintings can show all field marks to advantage, whereas photographs are limited to focus, lighting, bird position. Because maps, text and pictures together on facing pages makes birding a joy instead of a &quot;research project&quot; (and prevents paper cuts from holding 3-4 place pages at a time). Because there is good information on seasonal changes, breeding habits, etc. -- even in the limited space available. (No guide offers enough of this, in my opinion -- try identifying a Lark Bunting for the first time -- in winter colours!) Because information is presented in layperson language, understandable at any age or level of experience.Now, to be &quot;scientific&quot;, I have made each of the others my primary guide for periods of time. My choice of the Golden guide is subjective -- preferences always are. But, for my simple kind of birding, this guide encouraged a child to keep trying, and reminds an adult to enjoy these delightul creatures with whom we live."},{"Title":"A Guide to Field Identification: Birds of North America","review":"This book is excellent for all people interested in birds. Unlike the Peterson books, this book has all birds of North America in one edition. Also, it has maps right next to the description of the bird so you don't have to go flipping pages to find it. It is fully illistrated, which in my opinion is better than photos because you it shows all the different plumages and if the light was off while the picture was taken, it might not look right. It shows all birds and if two look alike, it will tell you how to tell them apart. It shows pictures of male and female bird. It also includes sonograms of bird calls. The content of each bird's description is remarkable, telling how to attract it, etc. Golden Books has done a wonderful job on this book."},{"Title":"A Guide to Field Identification: Birds of North America","review":"I cannot discard my Golden field guide for sentimental reasons. It is the book that as a young birder I took to the field with my father. For its time it was good as a general and easy to use field guide. Browsing through the newest edition was very disappointing. Production values are not impressive and while I did not compare it to the previous edition page-by-page, it just felt mausoleum-like. I suspect that St. Martins knew that they could not really compete with the field guides that we now have and just weren't going to put the needed resources into its publication.I have all the editions of the National Geographic and the latest (5th) is really the best for North America birding.

As a teenager growing up in southern Ontario, I used to marvel at the &quot;Carolinian&quot; species - those species which reached the very northern limit of their distributions in the area I grew up - on the pages of this wonderful book. Singer's renditions of Orchard Orioles, Carolina Wrens, Cerulean and Blue-Winged Warblers, amongst the other 700+ species illustrated with such precision and described in exquisite detail by Bruun, Robbins and Zim are painstakingly accurate, and not only defined my youthful birdwatching days but evoke many memories of growing up in the Canadian countryside.

Easy to see which part of the country the birds live and migrate in."},{"Title":"A Guide to Field Identification: Birds of North America","review":"The Golden field guide, *Birds of North America* has been a favorite companion for countless birders since it was first published in the late 1960's. It has the virtues of being nationally comprehensive, easy to follow (illustrations, maps, songs, and descriptions are provided on the same two pages), and perhaps best of all, small enough to carry in a jacket pocket. It also uses an interesting and highly useful visual &quot;sonagram&quot; approach to conveying information about bird vocalizations.Unfortunately, however, the ornithological powers that be are constantly lumping and splitting species, rendering field guides at least somewhat obsolete overnight. Consequently, these books must be updated periodically so as to be optimally useful to birders. The Golden guide was last updated during the 1980s, and was long overdue for a makeover.Happily, this has finally been provided. And indeed, this revised version of the guide is (for the moment) up to date regarding the various lumps and splits that have gone into effect over the past decade. Some of the &quot;splits&quot; are fully illustrated, as with the Canyon vs. California (formerly Brown) towhee. Some, however, are only mentioned in the text, and sometimes all too briefly. It's probably ok not to have a separate illustration of the smaller Gunnison species of the Sage grouse, but a separate illustration of the California gnatcatcher surely should have been provided. Similarly, the somewhat larger and brighter Island scrub jay should have been depicted separately from its relatives the scrub and Florida jays.Certainly, the publishers of this revised version of the Golden guide have made an earnest effort to provide an updated and attractive entry into the increasingly crowded birding field guide competition. They have included, for example, some new plates illustrating the various introduced parrot species and some (surely not all) of the Eurasian vagrants that are reported in Alaska and along the west coast. There also is a fine illustration comparing the tail feather patterns of both common and accidental pipit species.However, it seems apparent that the update to this guide was done on a fairly tight budget. Most disappointing is the sometimes mediocre reproduction of what otherwise are fine color illustration plates. Particularly in the shorebird, gull, and tern sections, the quality is simply not first-rate. Apparently sloppy reproduction work also can lead to some misleading visual information. For example, based upon the illustrations of the loon species, one might conclude that the summer Pacific loon has a greenish throat patch while that of the Arctic loon is purplish.Still, overall, I have always liked this field guide simply because it is so very easy to carry and to use. Consequently, whereas other larger, heavier volumes may be what I study while preparing for a day in the field, the Golden guide provides me with the quick reference I might need while out in the field. As a handy pocket reference, I would continue to recommend that birders consider purchasing this field guide in its updated version."},{"Title":"A Guide to Field Identification: Birds of North America","review":"I have carried the older edition of this bird book for a number of years, and purchased this new one as the old one had become so dog eared as to be embarassing. Also we knew that many species ranges were changing, and wanted to be up to date on that information. The new edition has the same format (down to the exact page) as the previous, and same illustrations. The many advantages of this guide include:1) It has every bird you are likely to see in North America 2) Everything about a species is on one page, including illustration, description, range map, and sonogram of song (for many species) 3) Nice comparison charts of similar and confusing species 4) Range maps include migration date lines 5) True pocket size -- you will carry this book with you in the field!The new edition also has updated nomenclature for species that the bird expert powers-that-be keep changing on us. It also has updated range maps for those species whose ranges are changing. It is printed on a slicker stock than the previous (only time will tell if this is better). It also has a new &quot;quick&quot; index which is handy for locating birds by generic name (crows).But there are some disappointments.1) It is probably 95% a reprint of the previous edition, both with respect to descriptions and (particularly) illustrations 2) The little check boxes to mark off birds you have seen are missing from the new edition -- surely that was an oversight(?) 3) They did not correct the one thing that was a true weakness of the previous edition, that the range maps are small and rather difficult to interpret. How much easier it would be if the US state borders were overprinted on these little range maps (or for that matter Canadian provinces and Mexican states)???But of course, it is still our favorite -- if you have only one bird book, and you want to carry it in your pocket, this is the one to buy."},{"Title":"A Guide to Field Identification: Birds of North America","review":"How they can sell this book at such a low price is beyond me. Lots of quality here.Look at the cover with the buntings: it's not just some recycled art from the interior, but a specially painted picture just for the cover. This is part of the value that the authors offer you.More importantly, the illustrations really capture what the birds look like in real life -- to my mind better than other paintings in guides and a thousand times better than photos -- and the text is clear and to the point.Sections that showcase winter plumage of gulls or peeps or that illustrate the heads of warblers or sparrows have the page numbers right next to each picture so you can just whip over to bird in question if you need more information.I especially like the fact that the range maps are right next to the bird's picture so you don't have to thumb to some inconvenient map index the back of the book only to find that the bird is never present in your area. Everything is right there to help you make a quick identification."},{"Title":"A Guide to Field Identification: Birds of North America","review":"There are bigger and more expensive bird guides but none pack as much information into such a portable, easy to use, inexpensive book as this. I've used it as a casual birder for several years. Among my favorite features are the taxonomic indicators (blue squares and circles indicating Order, Family and Sub Family or Genus), little bits of natural history (that some advanced guides assume you already know) and comparison silhouettes. I recommend this book to anyone wanting a first bird guide."},{"Title":"A Guide to Field Identification: Birds of North America","review":"I birded with this book for years, not replacing it until 1983 and the arrival of NatGeo. Unfortunately, the two 'updates' it has undergone in the last twenty years are barely cosmetic, and the book is now embarrassingly outmoded even for beginners, who would be much better served by Sibley or Kaufman.The thorough criticisms in Rich Stallcup's \\"Birds for Real,\\" which appeared as a response to the first revision of the Golden Guide, remain valid. There are still a great many birds that will be simply unidentifiable using this guide; there is no excuse, for example, for not having the shorebird plates repainted to include the distinct juvenal plumages of the small Calidris, for example.If you want a one-volume guide for use in the field, choose the Eastern or Western Sibley, the most sophisticated and most informative American field guides available. If your ambitions are more limited, if you are a 'backyard birder' or a 'feederwatcher' or just don't care about anything brown or far away, you will be very happy with Kenn Kaufman's \\"Focus Guide,\\" with its accurate but brief texts and realistic illustrations."},{"Title":"A Guide to Field Identification: Birds of North America","review":"\\"Birds of North America\\" is a truly excellent guide. It may not be the most comprehensive, but it certainly is the most useful. It's probably the all-around greatest birding field guide out there. The illustrations are very well done, and the size of the book is easily manageable. This book is detailed enough to accomodate all but the most demanding and professional birders, but user-friendly enough to not overwhelm the amateur.I must say however, that the new St. Martin's Press re-printed is a travesty. I luckily have the 1983 printing with the original blue cover and the beautifully rendered pages. I've seen the \\"new\\" edition in the bookstore, and like many other reviewers I am very annoyed by the poor quality of the reproductions. The pictures and pages are now faded and off-colour.I've recently been aquainted with the National Geographic bird guide, and I must admit it's a very good guide with pictures that are perhaps \\"sharper\\" than those in the Golden Guide. By today the Golden Guide is also a little out of date, due to many changes to avian nomenclature. However, one thing the NG guide will never match is the Golden Guide's immense readability. The NG guide is too detailed for its own good, and uses highly technical language that simply overwhelms the casual birder. I now tend to carry both books into the field, but the Golden Guide will always have a special place in my heart. I highly recommend it if you can find an old copy of the 1983 printing."},{"Title":"A Guide to Field Identification: Birds of North America","review":"I have used this guide for 25 years.

You DO NOT want this book. I returned my order to Amazon, would not consider owning it. In Introduction it is stated \\"....we have sought to preserve the strengths of the previous editor.\\" The former publisher, Western Publishing (printed in USA) should be gnashing their teeth at this statement.The current St. Martins Press (printed in China) edition is a disgrace as a birders field guide. I have been a hobby birder for 40 years and cut my teeth on the Golden Field Guids since the 1966 edition and replacing my guide with the 1983 printing. The color in these books were superb.The current guide's color is pale and washed out loosing a lot of bird features and badly off-color that an experienced birder would have difficulty in matching their sighting with anything in this book, let alone getting a beginning birder off to an encouraging experience using this printing (China must not understand bird coloration as seen in previous \\"Western Publishing\\" edition.) The bird images are very light so details are lost compared to bird's true colors, the images all seem to have a green tint. --- I've never seen a green (white) bird. The location maps do not have enough background shading to outline the North America map.What a shame to have such a good field guild as the Golden Field Guide bird series reputation ruined by the issuing of this edition by St. Martins Press.

This is a rip off publication."},{"Title":"A Guide to Field Identification: Birds of North America","review":"I've had this field guide in my possession for quite a while. While it does have some good features, I still don't take it along with me into the field. The reason is that I don't have complete confidence in the full-color illustrations. I don't think that any of the illustrations are bad; however, I do find some of them to be fuzzy and unclear. That aside, there are other aspects of this field guide that I like better. This field guide covers all of the birds of North America--regular, casual, and accidental visitors are also included. There's also an informative introduction and a nice section on how to use the field guide. There's an illustration of the topography of a bird with its various parts pointed out. There are two other illustrations detailing the parts of a duck wing. The text information and range maps are on the left page, while the illustrations are on the right page. Habitat backgrounds are used in combination with the illustrations, too, while individual species in varying plumages are also represented. The length of the particular species of bird is shown next to the illustration. The average wingspan of larger flying or soaring birds is also included next to the illustration. Most birds normally seen in flight are illustrated in a flying position. The text information includes the common name, scientific name, abundance, habitat, description, behavior, and vocalizations. Besides the verbal descriptions of songs in the text, songs or calls of many birds are pictured by Sonagrams. There are separate sections that display illustrations of female ducks in flight, hawks in flight, winter plumage of smaller shorebirds, immature gulls, and immature terns. There are also two other separate sections dealing with warblers: one section shows illustrations of only the heads of spring male warblers with and without wing bars, and the other section displays illustrations of fall warblers. Also, another section shows sparrows with and without streaked breasts. This field guide also includes a bibliography and an index. The index of bird species can be used as a checklist for the species identified. A check-off box is situated next to each common-name entry for this purpose. Even though I don't take this field guide with me whenever I go birdwatching, I still find it to be a helpful back-up reference at home when I need to gather some additional information."},{"Title":"A Guide to Field Identification: Birds of North America","review":"I bought this as a gift for my daughter, had already given it to another.

For that reason, I consider it the best of the Chronicles of Counter-Earth series. Certainly Norman never tried anything of this scope, either in terms of the size or the complexity of the novel, and there is a sense in which this is the last Gor book in which Tarl Cabot is more an Earthman on Gor than a true Gorean. &quot;Assassin of Gor&quot; begins with the title character, Kuurus, being hired to avenge the assassination of Tarl Cabot, a warrior of Ko-ro-ba. The trail leads to Glorious Ar where he finds political intrigue in the House of Cernus, agents of the Priest-Kings, spaceships arriving from Earth with new female captives, a dramatic auction of pleasure slaves, a thrilling tarn race, a climatic battle of gladiators, and a couple of intriguing games of Kaissa (the Gorean version of chess).As with the best of Norman's books, &quot;Assassin of Gor&quot; is full of vivid characters. Elizabeth Caldwell is back as Cabot's chief ally in finding out why the House of Cernus wants him dead and how they are involved in the endeavors of the Others, the galactic foes of the Priest-Kings. There is also the return of a major character from earlier in the series and a brief flashback involving the fate of the last egg of the Priest-Kings. However, the depth of the book comes out in terms of the new characters, including Mip the Tarn Keeper, Sura the house slave, the new slave girls Phyllis and Virginia, the young warriors Relius and Ho-Sarl, Scormus the young Kaissa champion and Qualius the blind player, and Hup the Fool (my favorite). We also meet a major supporting character for future Gor novels, Samos the slaver of Port Kar.The emphasis is still on the action and adventure in &quot;Assassin of Gor&quot; more than the Gorean philosophy that would come to dominate the later volumes in the series. Even by this fifth book in the series the principle that only by totally submitting to a master could a woman find true freedom, pleasure, etc., was pretty clear. I never really wanted a woman chained to my sleeping furs, so I tended to ignore those elements, especially as they became a repetitious mantra. For me the best Gor books were those that took the tradition of the Edgar Rice Burroughs Mars books with John Carter and upped the ante on the action. That is why &quot;Assassin of Gor&quot; is the best of the lot and why Norman never really tried to do anything this monumental ever again. In fact, the rest of the series would always suffer in my mind because of how far short the remaining volumes fell of the plateau of &quot;Nomads&quot; and &quot;Assassin.&quot;"},{"Title":"The insects: Structure and function","review":"The following comments were written by graduate and undergraduate members of an advanced class in insect physiology taught Spring Semester 2000.Chapman's book is interesting and covers a variety of topics. It is interesting for learning about how much insects differ between orders. Chapman gives many examples of different phenomena in insects. As a student, though, all the examples and different phenomena make studying from the book difficult and overwhelming. It is useful as a reference, a book to read to clarify topics discussed in lecture. But it is very specific with the examples.Chapman's textbook is comprehensive. It covers all aspects of insect physiology. It has full and updated literature citations for each chapter, which is very helpful for further reading. The language is simple and precise. But it is a little bit conservative and has slight coverage of some hot topics. The coverage favors insect structure and morphology.For me as a student the Chapman text was very helpful, because it is clearly structured and it covers nearly all important fields of insect physiology and structure. The new edition is very up-to-date and gives good examples from recent investigations. It is a bit too focused on research conducted in the US, but this probably reflects the fact that most of the important research is conducted there. The illustrations are very clear and helpful.I used this textbook in an advanced insect physiology class. To be perfectly honest, this book was a minor part of the class for me. I skimmed through it, used it for references, and as a sort of entomology handbook. From my perspective, it was a very complete source of information. At times it was a bit heavy on detail, but the information I needed was all there and clearly stated.This book is not one that is useful to read from front to back. It is an excellent reference book that should be owned by all entomologists. Three or more specific examples are given for each topic instead of a generic example for all insects. This is useful because it gives you the range of known physiology of insects that can be compared to the reader's &quot;insect of choice.&quot;Chapman gives all the details an entomologist needs to know about insects. It may be a bit confusing due to the vast number of insects, but it is a good resource to own and keep. Chapman is very thorough.One of the strengths of Chapman's new edition of Insects, Structure and Function is the wealth of examples. Every section of the book has examples from just about all of the orders of insects, although grasshoppers seem to rule disproportionately. A weakness with all of these wonderful examples is the cumbersome way Chapman places a list of them at the beginning of a section. He intends them to be as authoritative fleet of representatives who give some scale and scope to the subject being presented. They unfortunately end up as a heavy flotilla that diverts the reader's attention from the information sought. There are places in the book where subjects that are usually treated together or that work as a whole system are poorly integrated. Digestion and nutrition are so separately treated (they are in different chapters) that the reader finds herself having to cross reference from section to section to make cogent sense of what nutrients have to do with digestion. Strangely, when Chapman presents the great variety of insect form and function one has a sense of cacophony. Instead of giving us a unity, or even the illusion of unity, of how form and function interact we are presented with vignettes of research. But these vignettes do not provide us with the pretty and easy to get to views that we find on the Internet. We find ourselves lost somewhere in a tome that is more intent on directing our attention to variation than to presenting us with direct descriptions. But then again, how do you argue with the only author in English who has been brave enough to try to make a synthetic analysis of the most diverse group of animals on earth?"},{"Title":"The insects: Structure and function","review":"Chapman's book is a comprehensive and well-written entomology text. Not only does he cover all the basic topics in entomology, he does so in depth.

The hundreds of Greek city-states were highly competitive and warfare between them was common. The Greeks were able, on occasion, to come together to defeat a common enemy like the invading Persians. But these occasions were rare.This short book, The Greeks, is the story of a people, not a conventional history text. Professor Dover describes his work as a handful of pebbles picked up from a long beach and arranged in a sequence of his choosing. His book is not a pedantic historical analysis, but rather a sympathetic effort to understand the ancient Greeks and how they viewed their world.Professor Dover described the early Greeks as \\"resilient, skeptical, cheeky people\\" whose distinctive contribution to Western history was a readiness to ask \\"Why? and Why not?\\" and to expect sane, reasoned, and clear answers. They openly challenged accepted concepts, even their own religious beliefs, although sometimes at considerable risk.The Greeks is comprised of only six chapters. Chapter one places the Greeks in the broader context of the Babylonians, the Assyrians, the Hittites, and the vast Persian empire which emerged around 600 B. C. In the second chapter Dover explores the rivalry between Syracuse and Athens, thereby challenging the conventional Athenocentric view of Greek history.The last four chapters consider Greek sculpture and pottery, poetry and painting, a dramatic play (The Oresteia by Aeschylus), and lastly, philosophy, logic, and reason. I especially liked Dover's examination of The Oresteia. I have since purchased this trilogy - Agamemnon, Choephori, and Eumenides.The Greeks was originally marketed as a companion to a BBC television series by Christopher Burstall and Kenneth Dover. It has remained popular and has often been used as a supplementary college text. My copy, a fourth edition (1995) by the University of Texas Press, includes a mix of color and black and white photos. Christopher Burstall authored the short introduction."},{"Title":"The Jepson Manual: Higher Plants of California","review":"This is an excellent book covering thousands of species of flowering plants of California. The book does contain a brief introduction to keying plants and a glossary of plant terms, but despite these features, I believe that the beginner would find this book difficult to use. It's size and complexity can be intimidating, and without color pictures (which aren't always accurate, but helpful for the beginner) it can be a frustrating experience for the novice."},{"Title":"The Jepson Manual: Higher Plants of California","review":"This book is an excellent botanical key listing a huge number of plants. It is not your average &quot;audubon&quot; guide, since it requires you to key out the plant in question using botanical systematics. Definitely a good reference book, but hard to use casually to find out what that tree is in your front yard!"},{"Title":"The Jepson Manual: Higher Plants of California","review":"This is an excellent guide. Very comprehensive, however you must have formal education in botany and plant ID in order to effectively use the guide to key plants to genus and or species. Not recommended for the average person. Just people who are plant nerds!"},{"Title":"The Jepson Manual: Higher Plants of California","review":"OBSOLETE - Buy the new edition, just published! The revisions have been extensive, not only for species, but certain important plant families have been seriously re-defined.

My only complaint is that the Poaceae section isn't that great. It's also difficult to take into the field, but doable."},{"Title":"The Jepson Manual: Higher Plants of California","review":"This is the bible of California Natives. I have used it extensivly over the last 4 months with my native plant class. While the nomenclature and descriptions require upper division collegiate level command of English, the descriptions are excellent and the information is authoritative. There is an excellent section describing the various vegetation types and regions around the state. Do not expect a book with a lot of pretty pictures, this book is not that type - in fact the plants are pictured in line drawings (very well rendered by the way). It is organized by Family, so that the pines, firs, hemlocks, etc are in the same section of the book under Pinaceae. It is large and heavy - too large to take on a hike in the woods - unless you are looking for a good workout. It works best if used as a reference once you know the name of the plant. Also works well with online sources that refer to the Jepson Project - such as the USDA site. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Jepson Manual: Higher Plants of California","review":"I have this edition of the Jepson Manual and have used it in the field for years. I bought this copy to have a clean and pristine copy for my bookshelf.If I ever tire of it as a source of botanical information, I can always use it as a doorstop."},{"Title":"The Jepson Manual: Higher Plants of California","review":"This former 1993 South Pasadena Public Library copy of The Jepson Manual: Higher Plants of California is a real gem for my personal biology library. It arrived in a timely manner(in time for my plant taxonomy class) and it doesn't look as though it's been opened. Gotta love the Natuaral Vegetation of California distribution map that was still inside it! THANKS!"},{"Title":"The Jepson Manual: Higher Plants of California","review":"If you are buying this book, you are probably a botanist or a student taking a botany course in California. The keys work pretty well, my professor wrote several sections in this book, so he has been able to teach us how to use the book. One of my complaints is the thickness of the pages. The older editions use thinner paper, making it lighter and smaller. This book adds about 2 square feet and 45 pounds to my backpack when I bring it to class."},{"Title":"The Jepson Manual: Higher Plants of California","review":"There is no easy way to identify a plant to species, but if it is in California it is far easier to use this volume than the others. Although it was written in 1925, the line drawings are for me priceless. Be advised that names change in 75 years even if plants do not, you will need a modern flora to reference the old name. HIGHLY recommended, but technical."},{"Title":"The Jepson Manual: Higher Plants of California","review":"I really haven't had a chance to read this book, but what I've seen so far it is very informative. I work for USDA FOREST SERVICE and this book is here at work. The problem is I would like to have one of my own, so I'm now in the process of looking for it at our book store in town. If they do not have it, possibly they could order it for me. If not I will travel to the next larger town to accomplish my mission. I will get this book one way or another."},{"Title":"Zeely","review":"I expect this book, like all great books, means different things to different people. A &quot;different strokes&quot; book - you think? Anyway, I just finished teaching a lesson to my sixth grade class from this book for about the zillionth time over a six year period. Each time, I see more in the book than before. I'm not sure where Mrs. Hamilton was going with this book, but I explained to the class that the more you read it and the more you grow, the more you will see. I never cease to be amazed at Zeely's serenity in the brutal scene of the hog drive (chapter 11) - her compassion and inner strength. In this scene, Mrs Hamilton shows us all something inside ourselves that we are seeking: inner peace in the maelstrom. Thanks for reminding us."},{"Title":"Zeely","review":"As a young African-American teenager going through major surgery, this book was a such a gift that helped me to take my mind out of a semi-private room in a children's hospital, and to exercise my fantasy of being Geeder. Virginia Hamiliton's writing is simple, but powerful; the emotions very realistic and can be taken to heart. Most important, it speaks of differences among the \\"same\\"; the acceptance of the diversity."},{"Title":"Zeely","review":"When I first read this book, I was puzzled and a bit put off by the heroine. But I find, like Mike Johnson, that the more you read it, the more you find. Like Geeder I am mesmerized by Zeely, her beauty, serenity, and her mystery. I am also inspired by the book's emphasis on reality--not realism--that it's good to dream, but you shouldn't lose hold of reality--those pigs. I'm also inspired by the idea that we need to know the truth about our families and our history before we're ready to make up stories. The book is a reminder that we can all be queens if we do our work with dignity and grace."},{"Title":"Zeely","review":"I'm in my late 30's now, but this book still remains one of my favorites from childhood. As a preadolescent I read this book countless times, and found it only became more engaging with each reading. I valued its realness. I often wished I could enter the worlds my books revealed, but this was the most concrete of those worlds with which I wished to engage.This is not an easy book. Hamilton challenges her readers. Still, for children who like to read, this book is terrific."},{"Title":"Zeely","review":"I read this when I was in elementary school and it kept my attention. This was one of the first books I could relate to and visualize the story while reading it. I probably checked this book out four times in our library. I wanted this for my kids to read one day."},{"Title":"Zeely","review":"I would not recommend this book Zeely for many reasons. One reason is because the ending left you in wonder. What ever happened to the Mom and Dad? Also what happen to the Aunt? Another reason was because some parts I didnt get. The whole begining I didnt really follow to well. The last reason is because the story didnt really make sense. If I were you I wouldnt read this book."},{"Title":"Zeely","review":"I would give this book a star rating of two because it's a really boring book. The good points about this book are that Zeely came out better than the others in the town. This book was all about how Zeely was being teased and was talked about because of her color and how tall she was for her age. Zeely's parents both died, so Zeely has moved on to a farm with her uncle. Also Zeely turns out to look like an African American Queen."},{"Title":"Zeely","review":"This book was excellent, not only was it filled with wonderful stories, but Elizabeth(Geeder) kept you on a adventure the entire time. She is filled with stories."},{"Title":"Zeely","review":"The book Zeeiy was a book about a girl and her brother going to see their uncle.The girl's name was Elizabeth and her brother name was John.She changed their names to Toeboy witch was John and Geeder witch was Elizabeth.I like the book because in the middle of the book Toeboy saw a night traveller witch he thought it was friend but it was not a friend."},{"Title":"An Island Apart (Ulverscroft Large Print)","review":"The Lillian Beckwith series are wonderful, filled with warmth and humor. Here is a quote from her first book, The Hills is Lonely.When Lillian Beckwith, a middle-aged teacher in a smoky north of England town, was ordered by her doctor to take a complete rest somewhere in the country, she advertised in a suitable magazine. Among many tempting offers came this letter from a Hebridean crofter:Dear Madam,Its just now I saw your advert when I got the book for the knitting pattern I wanted from my cousin Catriona. I am sorry I did not write sooner if you are fixed up if you are not in any way fixed up I have a good good stone house and tiles and my brother Ruari who will wash down with lime twice every year.

She is not thatched."},{"Title":"Special Children, Challenged Parents: The Struggles and Rewards of Raising a Child With a Disability","review":"Usually when I review a book, I'm looking for one that's reader-friendly (a quick read, written in understandable language, and offering practical ideas). By that definition, this book may not fit. Is \\"Special Children, Challenged Parents\\" written inunderstandable language? Yes. Does it offer practical ideas? Definitely. Will it be a quick read? Probably not. You see, Dr. Naseef's book is going to touch your emotions. This is perhaps the most honest book I have ever read on the grieving process of parents struggling to accept and raise a child with special needs. By sharing his own story and those of other parents he has interviewed and worked with, Dr. Naseef discusses why this process is so hard and what parents can do to survive the process and come out on the other side. But perhaps Dr. Naseef's most valuable contribution is his message for fathers. Fathers very rarely fit comfortably into the role of fathering a child with special needs and Dr. Naseef's uniquequalifications as both a father and a psychologist have given him rare insights to help other Dads facing this challenge. This may not be an \\"easy read\\", but if you're a parent struggling with your emotional responses to your child -- it is definitely a \\"must read\\"."},{"Title":"Special Children, Challenged Parents: The Struggles and Rewards of Raising a Child With a Disability","review":"This book is a good, basic book outlining the grief process and other major common emotional issues in raising a child with a disability. However, as the mother of an autistic child who is with her child 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, I can't help but wonder about the authenticity of the author's personal experience \\"parenting\\" an autistic child, as his own autistic child has been institutionalized for a huge segment of his life while the author went on to have more children and a very normal homelife. It feels to me like the man \\"skipped out\\" on the real experience of raising his autistic son himself and elected to become a part-time parent to the child, then felt himself capable of writing a book about it. I find it hard to believe that he truly understands the day to day life of a full-time parent of an autistic child, given his own choices, however \\"right\\" they may have been for his son."},{"Title":"Special Children, Challenged Parents: The Struggles and Rewards of Raising a Child With a Disability","review":"I am a psychologist who works with children and families, many of whom are grappling with difficult issues related to a medical condition, behavioral problem, or learning disability. This book provides sound advice written in plain English from a psychologist whose son is autistic. I have recommended Dr. Naseef's book to a number of my clients because of how thoughtfully he combines his own story with a practical guide for parents and others who care for a child with special needs. A wide range of issues are covered, and all are essential. A great find on Amazon- thanks!"},{"Title":"Special Children, Challenged Parents: The Struggles and Rewards of Raising a Child With a Disability","review":"As a parent of a medically fragile child with special needs, Dr.Naseef's book has been a wonderful resource for me, my wife, and our family and friends. The author's experience as a father of a special child of his own and as a psychologist shine through its pages. This book is a must read for parents, teachers, medical professionals, caregivers, and others whose lives are touched by a child with special needs. Full of practical strategies for coping, from the initial grief to working effectively with medical and educational professionals, to staying together as a family. It's not easy explaining to our friends and family how we stay positive while faced with so many challenges -- Special Children, Challenged Parents has been a great help to us and the people who are close to our son."},{"Title":"Special Children, Challenged Parents: The Struggles and Rewards of Raising a Child With a Disability","review":"Robert Naseef clearly understands the complex range of issues that accompany raising a special child. He is a gentle father and husband, and he interweaves the story of his own son's battle with autism into the lives of others he meets and counsels along the way. He offers plenty of good advice here about how to maintain one's sanity, health and marriage while still doing all one can and should for one's special child."},{"Title":"Special Children, Challenged Parents: The Struggles and Rewards of Raising a Child With a Disability","review":"This is a terrific book that will help a parent move through the stages of adjustment to their child having special needs. It acknowledges the grieving process that most parents experience, while giving parents some things they can do to help them move towards a temporary acceptance of the situation. It introduces parents to the idea of meeting their child where they are and helping them grow to their greatest potential, rather than trying to \\"fix\\" the child and make him/her \\"normal\\". It also talks about the behavioral issues some kids with special needs have and encourages a parent to try to understand why the child is displaying the behavior instead of simply reacting to the behavior. It even moves on to talk about how a child with special needs effects the parents as a couple and the more typically developing siblings. In short, this book is a comprehensive discussion of all the difficult and wonderful things of having a child with special needs. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Special Children, Challenged Parents: The Struggles and Rewards of Raising a Child With a Disability","review":"Although this was a tough one to get through (at times, pretty depressing), as an inclusion teacher, I really appreciated this book. Naseef provides an excellent balance between stories from his own experience as a father of a child with a disability and advice and suggestions from his career as a psychologist specializing in working with parents of children with disabilities. Definitely a must-read for parents coming to terms with the news that their child has a disability, as well as for educators and other professionals working with these parents, as it is so important for us to understand what they've been through and what they've had to deal with."},{"Title":"Special Children, Challenged Parents: The Struggles and Rewards of Raising a Child With a Disability","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone with children even those without special needs. Dr. Naseef tells of his experience as a parent as well as a therapist. It's one of those books that when you read it you catch yourself thinking \\"I thought I was the only one who felt that way\\". I would also recommend seeing one of Dr. Naseef's lectures or looking up his webpage oneline."},{"Title":"Pearl Buck's the Good Earth (Barron's Book Notes)","review":"From the moment you open this book and begin chapter one you are hooked. The way Pearl Buck describes the characters and setting you can perfectly picture them in your mind. When meeting the farmer Wang Lung, you see his love for the land from the beginning of the book. When Wang Lung goes to meet his chosen bride O-lan, Pearl Buck shows the thought process of men and what they feel is beautiful in a woman. From describing the binding of the feet and how Wang Lung is greatly disopointed with O-lan and her seemingly large feet. Pearl Buck shows how faithful O-lan is, being alone during birth and getting back in the feilds the same day to help Wang, even on her death bed O-lan is faithful to Wang. Pearl aslo disscusses the value of men and women children and how Wang took pride in his boys and shame in his girls.When there is a great famine in the village, you can feel how poor these people were and how they struggled to survive, even leaving thier land to go find food. The protagonist and antagonist are clearly dipicted, with Wang Lung struggling with himself and society. The most disturbing part of the book is when Wang Lung meets Lotus Blossm and she becomes his mistress. The luxeries he gives her over O-lan because she has small feet and hands is discusting. The way Pearl Buck shows how men felt about women and how they were just property and nothing else, and the way he breaks O-lan down and treats her like trash because of her feet. The way Pearl shows how he comes and fluants the affair in O-lan's face is absolutly heart wrenching. The way Wang Lung climbs the social ladder and eventually moves away from his land, shows how money changes everything but can never change the persons soul. Throughout the book Wang always returns to his land, even on his death bed he returns to the Good Earth, the land where he built his foundation, the land where he built himself. The ending isn't as satisfying as the rest of the book but, it gives good meaning to the title of the book. This is a extrodianary book, that dipicts social status in China, a woman's value in life, beauty and ugliness, money, religion, love and friendship. I don't know what more you could ask from a book."},{"Title":"Pearl Buck's the Good Earth (Barron's Book Notes)","review":"Chief is gay. Oh yea horrible book notes because it did not mention details in the plot of the good earth."},{"Title":"Sardinian brigade","review":"\\"W.W.I novels\\" is a phrase that usually evokes Hemingway, Remarque, Graves, Blunden, Sassoon... but there are many other outstanding writers who fought in that catastrophic war and survived and came back to tell us. Emilio Lussu, an Italian anti-Fascist politician and essayist, does not belong to the group of the celebrated anti-war writers (he is a sort of local hero, quite popular in Italy, but neglected in the Anglo world), yet he should be put with the classics. His ironic, destructured, sometime grotesque, sometime almost absurdist memoir-novel deserves to be included in the list of the Great W.W.I Books. The original title is \\"Un anno sull'altipiano\\" (A Year on the Asiago Plateau), and it refers to the time spent by the Sassari Brigade (the \\"Sardinian Brigade\\" of the English title) on the Asiago Plateau, where some of the fiercest clashes between Italians and Austro-Hungarians took place. The experience of mountain warfare with the legendary Sassari Brigade (a.k.a. The Red Devils, or \\"Dimonios\\") made Lussu understand the atrocity, the madness and the uselessness of war. And that is what the book is all about--which is a lot, in this our time.Lussu's dry, corrosive prose is an uncanny harbinger of masterpieces to come, such as Heller's Catch-22 or O'Brien's Going After Cacciato. Luckily English-speaking readers can read it again: on the Amazon.UK website there is a new edition on sale which is cheaper than this. (The book has uninterruptedly been in print in Italy since the 1940s, but has for a long time been out of print in the States.)"},{"Title":"Kicking Your Holiday Stress Habits","review":"Well, this is a tiny little book, about 3\\" x 2\\". It goes from page to page, listing a bad thing about \\"holidays\\" (although it seems obvious almost immediately that by holidays they mean Christmas) on one page, and a good thing on the facing page.The only thing is, the things they list from page to page were, to me, obvious, and not very instructional.Then, at times, there are places where you are to answer a question they've posed by writing a little list in the book.Each time they do this, they start the list for you, rather than just having a \\"for example\\" at the end of the question, which is how you can tell it's \\"about\\" Christmas, as their lists usually relate to that holiday. It turned me off that they began the list each time, as their likes, thoughts, etc., did not match mine, but if I continued it felt as if they were, by default, part of my list, i.e. intrusive. Is this book to be about me, or the Tubesings?And I was particularily bothered by their \\"starter\\" list to answer the question, \\"As you think over the past year: What experiences are particularly memorable?\\"Their first answer? \\"Mike's suicide.\\"Now, I'm sure everyone out there wants to contemplate suicide at Christmas. Not exactly, right? Besides, knowing someone who was a successful suicide, I really don't like having the memory randomly thrust upon me by a book that should be discussing de-stressing. And, as I said, were I to fill in my own list there,as I'm clearly supposed to, their friend/realtive Mike's suicide would become a default part of my list.The back cover states that, \\"This book is a holiday gift to you-\\" Some holiday gift.I think the book is a gimmick-ie little book, and not really valuable for helping re-invent the holidays.But, I'm sure the Tubesings won't mind a review such as this, as, towards the end of the book, they gave me \\"permission to feel.\\""},{"Title":"Start Your Own Wedding Consultant Business: Your Step-By-Step Guide to Success","review":"The book goes in great detail of every aspect( financial work,alliances with certain business, all the little odds and ends for your business ) of starting the business, really really informative if you are serious of starting your shop or service."},{"Title":"Start Your Own Wedding Consultant Business: Your Step-By-Step Guide to Success","review":"Very informative.

Many of the items are just briefly touched on, so I will want to do more research on the internet or from other books, but at least this book gave some direction on where to start. It tailors some of the aspects of starting a business directly to the weddings industry, including ideas for continuing education, advertising and marketing within the industry both to clients and becoming known with the other vendors.

It gives you insight into the lives of the cast and crew and how the episodes come about. Very detailed, I especially liked the cast interviews. Well worth a purchase if you are into Voyager."},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager: A Vision of the Future","review":"I bought this book based on the reviews and they were right. This book is great! The photos alone are worth the price. If you love to read behind the scenes stories and are a Star Trek fan to boot, you will thoroughly enjoy reading this book. It gives you the insider's view of the making of the series to the point where you feel as if you were a part of the production."},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager: A Vision of the Future","review":"No one's going to buy a book about the making of Voyager if they don't like Voyager, so it's understandable that the writer refrains from any criticism. Yet he adopts the tone that Voyager is unrivalled high-quality drama and whether you believe him or not it rankles enough to make you wince through even the really interesting sections on the making of the show's pilot film. There's also a peculiar habit of trying to force a structure to the book by leaving bits out from the beginning and throwing them in at the end which you might live with if there were an index. Poe is a name in Star Trek circles because he wrote The Making of Star Trek (under a psuedonym) but where you can excuse the poor journalism of that book because he was new and fresh, thirty years later you feel he should have improved."},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager: A Vision of the Future","review":"This book must have started as a snapshot of the events leading to the creation of Voyager, culminating in a busy weekend of filming shortly before the pilot aired. At some point it drifted off course, adding a final chapter from the conclusion of the second season. Then, like V'ger from Star Trek 1, it collided with an unknown force that pushed publication back until the fourth season, adding hasty references to Jeri Ryan. What's left is a mess.The good news is that the pre- and first-season information can be interesting. I didn't know that Chakotay's character was based on Moby Dick's Queequeg. The best part of the book is its account of Genevieve Bujold's disasterous day-and-a-half of filming as Captain Janeway, particularly when she was to launch the new shop for the first time. \\"...(R)eaching the point where Janeway gives the 'Engage' command ... Genevieve solemnly walked over to the chair, sat down, folded her hands in her lap, closed her eyes, and said in a small soft voice, 'Engage.' Stunned silence.\\"The bad news is most everything else. The book is copyright Paramount Pictures, so you know there isn't anything negative about anyone who was still on the payroll. The author's deification of the executive producer is particularly creepy: \\"Complex, driven, with an unquenchable thirst for perfection, Rick Berman is precisely what Star Trek needs. It is highly unlikely that anyone else on the planet would be willing to devote the extraordinary amount of time and energy required to do what he does.\\" No one else on the planet? Really?The reader gets to meet the crew the same way we meet game show contestants -- who they are, how they got here, and a sentence of two about family or hobbies. We get that over and over again; there are a lot of people in the crew. There's also some sanitized behind-the-scenes info about call sheets and costume designs and exactly what sets are on what stages.In between there's a lot of filler with the author pontificating on the affect of the Star Trek franchise on society, usually expressed in awkward sentences. \\"One example is the subject of diversity -- a hot topic only recently discovered by cultural and sociological pundits and politcos of every persuasion. Yet, one need only look at a single episode -- any episode -- of The Original Series (now more than thirty years ago) to see the evidence of diversity in action on the bridge of the Starship Enterprise.\\"In sum, this is an early history of Voyager as put together by a high-school yearbook committee, with some nice pictures, pleasant information, writing of erratic quality, and a disappointing amount of insight into what happened. If you really miss Voyager, well, here's that yearbook."},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager: A Vision of the Future","review":"As a fan of Star Trek Voyager, I found this book to be an incredible glimpse into how the show was created. Mr. Poe has done a wonderful job of exploring the &quot;how's, why's, and almost's&quot; of this often underrated series. After reading it I felt as if I actually was part of the Voyager creative process, that is how invitimg the authors writing is. A must have for the Voyager fan."},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager: A Vision of the Future","review":"A wonderful look behind the scenes of a great show.

I liked seeing the construction pictures of the bridge and other areas of the ship. I also enjoyed seeing the list of actors who play background extras most ofted. (TARIK ERGIN plays Lt. Ayala)"},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager: A Vision of the Future","review":"This is a book that probably should have been released in 1995, soon after Voyager started. I don't know why it was delayed until 1998.A Vision of the Future thoroughly documents the step-by-step creation of Voyager, from the first inklings of a plan for a series to follow TNG, through the initial broadcast of the first episode \\"Caretaker.\\" Poe does a great job of showing just how seat-of-the-pants the creation of a TV series is, from adjusting to last minute cast changes (and hair changes), to having to deal with directives from on high that force a guerilla re-structuring of a story already in production, because the number of commercial breaks has suddenly been changed.We get to follow Poe, doing what we'd all have loved to do: wander around backstage without getting accosted by set security. We can vicariously talk to the crew putting everything together and find out the preposterous hours they work, see how things get put together behind the scenes, and find out why this or that thing was done the way it was. It really puts a human face on what can all too easily be looked at as a monolithic studio making just another piece of The Franchise.If I'd had this book early on in the series run, I'd probably have been significantly more forgiving toward Voyager than I was at the time. (I've since become rather more fond of Voyager than my initial reaction back then would have suggested... Maybe I'm just getting old?) Perhaps Voyager would have gotten a bit more warm welcome from the fans if this had been available on time. It's tough to say.The book being released three years into the series did allow the author to add a brief look at the addition of Seven of Nine to the cast and the effect that had on things, but that's really just an aside, not even a full chapter. As I mentioned, this book is really about the creation of Voyager the series, and Caretaker specifically, and it's extremely effective at that.(I also quite like the scattering of set blueprints that are reproduced in the book. After seeing the layout of the corridor set for example, it's somehow bizarrely entertaining to see how the cast keeps walking past the same sections again and again even in a single conversation -- and the fact that I never noticed it before speaks volumes about the quality of set design and cinematography!)"},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager: A Vision of the Future","review":"Very interesting. Photos are wonderful. Entertained my curiosity about Star Trek&quot; Voyager. However, several times I looked for an Index, yet there is none. I would have also liked the book to be a little more organized."},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager: A Vision of the Future","review":"This book was an enjoyable, easy read. Don't let the title (or even a brief thumb through) fool you...this book is not about the show, as an ongoing entity. Poe will extremely briefly mention something that occurs in the 4th season; he has a small section on 7 of 9 and her addition to the show. However, this is only a few pages in a large volume. The vast majority of the book is about the process getting the Voyager pilot on the screen. It talks about the very early preproduction meetings with Rick Berman, Jeri Taylor, and Michael Piller, and how the three of them honed the idea, and moved it forward. It talks in much detail about the designing of the Voyager sets, as well as the model of the ship itself, the computer graphics, casting, shooting, etc. I found it to be an interesting, entertaining read, however I expected it to talk more about the series itself, not to be virtually all a &quot;making of the pilot&quot; book. Be aware that is what this is. Don't let a few pages on 7 of 9 and a photo that includes her fool you."},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager: A Vision of the Future","review":"If you like endless detailed descriptions of people's offices, their small working areas at Paramount and all the minute production details explaining how this series got off the ground then this book is for you. If you want to know about all the people who are involved with Voyager from the top brass to the two security people on the lot then this book is also for you.If you're interested in the DRY, nuts and bolts of making a TV series then this is for you. Not my cup of tea I'm afraid."},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager: A Vision of the Future","review":"For Voyager fans, this is the book that goes into sharp detail about the production aspects of the television series Star Trek: Voyager and all the people that made it happen.Poe does a great job of taking you through the various departments, people, and cast and what they experience in trying to meet deadlines, pressures, and problems of producing a weekly TV series. There are lots of good stories, a bit of humor, and an eye for detail that explains lots of the questions Voyager fans have.The major downside to this otherwise excellent book is the author's incessant habit of revealing important story plots and incorporating spoilers which totally destroys plot elements for those who have not yet seen the episodes. Granted, big fans have already seen the episodes but there are people who are new fans and have not yet experienced all of the shows.This is highly irritating, to me as I am one of the new fans, and the disregard and poor judgement of the author brings down the fun of the book. This situation could have been handled more adroitly if some forethought was applied, but alas, what is done is done.If you want to find out about the mechanics of how Voyager is put together, this book does this and more. But if you are a newbie to the world of Voyager, be careful in how you read this as certain plot elements will be gratuitously be given away when you least expect it and spoil certain episodes for you."},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager: A Vision of the Future","review":"When you finish reading this book you see the trek world with a diferent point of wiew; it change you in a way you can only understand when you read this book. the book take from you the mystical way you see Star Trek, but &quot;he&quot; give you back a sense that you are a better human being."},{"Title":"Star Trek Voyager: A Vision of the Future","review":"it's the best startrek book i have read since they started to publish them."},{"Title":"Women of the English Nobility and Gentry 1066-1500 (Manchester Medieval Sources)","review":"I found this book to be a very helpful collection of documents for understanding the life of medieval women.

This is quite simply one of the most important books I have ever read. I had been reading Krutch's nature books one at a time over many years. This representative and highly readable collection brings it all together! Great book."},{"Title":"The best nature writing of Joseph Wood Krutch","review":"Joseph Wood Krutch was a popular naturalist/humanist whose writings throughout the early and mid-1900's helped give Americans a moral compass as they faced wildlife and wilderness areas increasingly under threat of eradication. He wrote at a time society was standing at a crossroads - with blithe destruction of the environment going off in one direction - and increasing awareness of the interconnectedness of the environment reaching off in the other direction. Krutch helped steer us down the road of saving grace. However, much remains to be done, and Krutch deserves to be re-discovered and widely read again.The essays in this book, largely from the 1950's and 1960's, do contain a few archaisms that would either be considered politically incorrect now, or that we have a refined understanding of now. For example, Krutch does occasionally refer to tribal people as \\"primitives.\\" Then he rather haphazardly refers to Europeans as having \\"inherited\\" this land from \\"the red man.\\" The abrasive, old shoot-\`em-up movie designation of \\"red man\\" aside - Krutch was writing too quickly here to catch the obvious solecism of the word \\"inherited.\\" Native Americans hardly made a peaceful bequest of the land to Europeans.Finally, although Krutch certainly would not endorse any Intelligent Design philosophy, he harbors a somewhat outdated, pantheistic animosity against Darwin's Theory as being too mechanical and too insistent upon survival of the fittest through combat \\"red in tooth and claw.\\" Many naturalists, foremost among them Stephen Jay Gould, have spent pages correcting our impressions on this point. Darwinian survival is now understood to only rarely entail bloody combat. More often, survival is just a matter of the creature with the slight adaptive advantage leaving more offspring. The advantaged creature wins by making love, not war.However, the archaisms here are minor compared to the overall, urgent wisdom of Krutch's observations. Some of his opinions seem to come right out of today's headlines. In an essay written in 1961, he deplores how our economic system has come to be based on our having to consume more and more resources in order to fuel growth and maintain material prosperity. He writes, \\"If, for example, people are urged to go into worrisome debt to buy a new automobile, not because they have a need for it, but because automobile workers will be out of a job and lead the way to economic collapse if the unneeded automobiles are not bought - does that not suggest that we've reached a point where men exist for the sake of the industry rather than industry for the sake of man?\\"Krutch furthermore points out how our economy's dependence on growth has caused us to help promote an often particularly destructive form of consumerism around the world. He tellingly points out that whereas missionaries used to invade other countries, labeling the natives \\"pagans\\" in need of the Bible - now industrialists invade other countries, labeling the natives \\"undeveloped\\" and in need of more consumer goods.His essays contain many other telling analogies and turns of speech. He coins the word \\"mechanomorphism\\" to take to task those who are at the other end of the spectrum of \\"anthropomorphism.\\" Whereas the latter perhaps commit the error of attributing too many human characteristics to animals - the \\"mechanomorphists\\" make the more serious error of assigning all creatures only a capacity for mechanical, automatic, instinctually invariant response.In addition to such stunningly apt insights, Krutch has included many quiet personal appreciations of wildlife among these essays. He talks about the amazing synchronicity he observed between the arrival of the Pronuba moth and the blossoming of the yucca. He tells about the intelligence he witnessed firsthand among the society of mice who found their way into his desert home. (I only wish he had made this essay longer and continued the chronicle of his mouse family.) He makes the reader see some of the beauties of the Grand Canyon anew, and he gives some interesting geologic detail about how that natural wonder was created more through a \\"rising\\" of the land than through a cutting down of it.Krutch is a definitely a man for all seasons whose essential wisdoms have stood the test of time and make for good reading, anywhere - anytime."},{"Title":"The Silver Anniversary Murder: A Christine Bennett Mystery (Christine Bennett Mysteries)","review":"I've been following this series since \\"The Good Friday Murders\\" and while this latest book is not as good as some of the earlier books it's far from a bad book. There's no way the reader could guess \\"who did it\\" based on the clues given early on but everything came together in the end. The one criticism i do have is it would have been nicer if Sr. Joseph played a bigger role in the story. Next to Chris she's my favorite charater."},{"Title":"The Silver Anniversary Murder: A Christine Bennett Mystery (Christine Bennett Mysteries)","review":"This review is not specific to this book, but to the entire series. If you read the books in order of publication, you can't help but get caught up in the personal life of Christine Bennett. You have to admire her ability to reason out things that happened in the past to solve her mysteries. As someone who attended Catholic schools my whole life, I really relate to her relationship with Sr. Joseph. I wish Lee Harris would write faster so that I could read more of her books."},{"Title":"The Silver Anniversary Murder: A Christine Bennett Mystery (Christine Bennett Mysteries)","review":"Enticing, with interesting twists that kept me avidly reading and guessing up to the end. But I don't give it more than three stars because I agree with other reviewers that you have to suspend reality a lot to read this book. The investigating police officer and even Chris's husband were violating law enforcement ethics and possibly jeopardizing the case when it comes to trial by allowing Chris access to crime scenes and sharing case information with her. Also I thought Chris lowered her own ethical and moral standards in this book by withholding information because the daughter asked her to do so. And why was Chris so gullible that she would travel all over the country with someone that she barely knew? The basic premise of these Chris Bennett Brooks stories is getting worn out - she isn't the ex-nun, housewife/mother, and part-time teacher any longer. She's really now a private investigator, so why not remake her into that role?"},{"Title":"The Silver Anniversary Murder: A Christine Bennett Mystery (Christine Bennett Mysteries)","review":"When you need to suspend belief beyond any reason in order to read a book, you know you're in trouble. And that's what this series has become...a suspension of belief.Not only do the police encourage the civilian Chris to solve their cases, but they enable her by providing her with all their information. Even her husband, a NYC cop, encourages and assists her. They let her enter crime scenes with them, they give her names and addresses of witnesses so she can interview them, they allow her access to all their evidence, they inform her when new information comes in. Her husband supports her as she withholds information and evidence from the police, and as she leaves her five-year-old son behind to fly around the country chasing clues. Even the victim's daughter gets in on the act, refusing to talk to the cops, but telling her story to and teaming up with a complete stranger with no ties to law enforcement or her family, who was called in by her parents' landlord simply because she stopped by to ask him questions about them a few days earlier. And of course we get our dose of Sister Joseph with her cryptic clues, which always enable Chris to suddenly come up with the solution to the crime.Having Chris be a housewife/mother/teacher no longer works. If she's going to continue to be involved in cases, then the author should make her a PI or send her to the police academy. You have to suspend so much belief where her involvement is concerned that it ends up taking away too much to make the stories enjoyable.The author has a gold mine on her hands with her new Manhattan series, so perhaps it's time to let Chris and Jack ride off into the sunset and concentrate her efforts on Jane Bauer."},{"Title":"Secret Places of the Lion: Alien Influences on Earth's Destiny","review":"You need to be already familiar with esotericism to read and appreciate that, but for those who are ready, it is of good value.

Also, though one may feel different, we are not alone, and we never have been, life after life."},{"Title":"Secret Places of the Lion: Alien Influences on Earth's Destiny","review":"George Hunt Williamson was a very strange character indeed, and this is one of his first books, originally published in 1958, and having been kept pretty much continuously in print ever since. Any trip to a used book store will turn up several earlier paperback editions.Williamson basically retells a portion of the history of ancient Egypt, and recites the mythology of the Old and New Testaments, but reshuffles most dates (where there are dates) by up to 1,000 years and presents the whole story as the continuous adventures of about six different characters, continuously reincarnated, most of whom start out in the imaginary Theosophical Lemuria.At the bottom of every other page, Williamson notes that \\"records will soon be discovered\\" to confirm the details of his story, but is fairly coy (if not completely reticent) about where he himself got those details which he recites without reference or source. Actually, Williamson was pretty handy with a Ouija board, and I suspect his \\"boarding sessions\\" (as he called them) were the main source of the \\"plot\\" of the present volume. Every once in a while, Williamson mentions the (imaginary) monastery of \\"The Brotherhood of the Seven Rays\\" near Lake Titicaca in Peru, as invented by mid-1950s flying saucer cult leader Marion Dorothy Martin. Not coincidentally, Williamson was a follower of the cult, and I suspect some details here are owed to Martin, not to Williamson's imagination. At least one of Williamson's later books was written under the pen name of \\"Brother Philip,\\" described as a supposed member of the monastery. The \\"ancient astronaut\\" or \\"space god\\" theme later popularized by Von Daeniken is continuously present within the story, yet not ever a major part of it.For those familar with the lore of pseudoscience, the best thumbnail description of the book is that it's a deconstruction of the Old and New Testaments based largely on Theosophy. It's also completely valueless for any imaginable purpose... even as merely an example of imaginative fiction. Like many 1950s \\"ufoological\\" books, it's a volume of which one can say, \\"What hath Madame Helena P. Blavatsky wrought?\\""},{"Title":"Secret Places of the Lion: Alien Influences on Earth's Destiny","review":"We all love to hear endearing stories about mythic struggles that, after overcoming the hardships, that everything turns out happily ever after. In other words, a fairy tale. Sprinkle in some very ancient history, hidden secrets, and your favorite characters like Jesus, and you end up with this book.My concerns with this book are simple. With so much purported detail from so long ago *where* was this history written down for the author to transcribe it for us? I mean there are details in here that are more in depth than your evening news report. How should these details have been passed down through history? Where are the manuscripts, cuneiform, or other forms of transmission of all this detail? And this material does not indicate it was channeled which would not make it any more verifiable.From my own reading and direct work in the exploration of past lives there is one thing that is common and the most typical past life. That is that they are ordinary. Extraordinary individuals are very rare and even they were mostly ordinary people, with unremarkable lives, except for the brief intrusions of fate upon them when they left their mark upon their time and our history.These are the further fallacies or fictions that you would have to buy into the appreciate this book:- That the persons and events depicted in the book are somehow historically true- That what happened to someone in their own context of distant past means much or has applicability, if anything, to your current experience- That any depicting of sacred principles (e.g. the 'vibration' of the river Jordan being necessary for Jesus' baptism) and your reading them is somehow like picking up magic coins during the playing of a video game.- That somehow having knowledge, but not being able to apply it, to live and breath it in your daily life, is meaningful.This same author calls himself 'Brother Philip' and wroteSECRET OF THE ANDESwhich is also filled with implausible 'facts'. We can appreciate him as an author of curious diversions but not as some adept who was truly sharing secret knowledge. And I'm not saying that George was being bad, dishonest, or deceptive. Many people appreciate his writings. However, he is showing a very common tendency to search for truth outside of one's self rather than from the inside. (The author was heavily influenced by Adamski's to the distraction of much of his seeking. Like Adamski he began to go amiss claiming educational certifications which he did not in fact possess.)Real sacred/secret knowledge is not about the supposed facts of history. The real sacred knowledge is how do you live as a genuine human being in harmony with all of life as much as you can. Extending the realm of your compassion in every moment. How to be a real human being and love everyone is the real sacred secret of life. And that ability to love makes you a Puma-Runa, or [royal] Lion Person.Or if you just like fiction, don't know much about metaphysics, and have time to spend, curled up sipping your favorite beverage this might be an ok book. But if you are looking for some secrets, as the books title parlays, you will not find much here."},{"Title":"Secret Places of the Lion: Alien Influences on Earth's Destiny","review":"Look, I'm as open minded as anyone, and very interested in alternative theories to religion and creationism, but this guy just takes it too far. While there are several good points he makes, that are believable, there are a ton more that aren't. I could possibly buy into the reincarnation bit, but the suggestions he makes are absurd. For instance, he states that John the Baptist in the New Testament, was actually two DIFFERENT reincarnated souls, including Elijah. Ok.... if you buy into him being Elijah, that's one thing, but there's no way I can believe that two different souls \\"swapped\\" bodies while they were alive!! There are several things like this out of place, and the guy is REALLY preaching at you with all of this information through the ENTIRE book, trying to get you to believe it. While some of it may be true, (and probably is), there's so much that's over the top that it's a struggle to read. If you like laughing at some of his allegations, then by all means read it. But if you're serious about finding out ancient truths and solving mysteries, I'm sure you've already read better than this. Chariot's of the Gods is much better and more believable."},{"Title":"Creating Web Graphics for Dummies","review":"Book Review for AAUG CommuniqueTitle: Creating Web Graphics for DummiesAuthors: Bud Smith & Peter FrazierPages: 312Publisher: Wiley Publishing, Inc. 2003Price: $24.99Web: www.dummies.comPhone: 1-800-762-2974Pro: The eye-catching yellow covers of the For Dummies books arewidely acknowledged to maintain a high standard of excellencewhen it comes to their how to books and Creating Web Graphicsfor Dummies is no exception.Con:The book's back and forth between the world of Microsoft and Apple's way to create great graphics for the web I found distracting at times.Rating: 4.5 MooseReviewer: Penelope WellsGraphic design authors, Bud Smith and Peter Frazier recently producedCreating Web Graphics For Dummies.

Ronald Reagan has been the US President for just over a year. Approximately 125,000 Cubans emigrated to the US 20 months before, in the Mariel boatlift. The international community is still immersed in the Cold War. However, the reader's focus is drawn to a narrower world, that of Lourdes, a Havana 16-year-old. She is in the terrible throws of adolescence - raging hormones, insecurity, anxiety, confusion. Her skin is too dark, she is too skinny, her hair is too frizzy and she will never attract a cool boyfriend. In order to maintain a mature outlook on her turbulent life, and focus on what is really important to the community, not just herself, she tries to live-up to the revolutionary standards of her hero, Che Guevera. An idealist, Lourdes fervently believes socialism makes a better life for all, and thinks no one is oppressed under Fidel's leadership.Lourdes Torres comes from a privileged family. Her father, Dr. Rafael Torres, is a respected professor of Political Economy of Communism at the University of Havana and a Caucasian, of certified Spanish descent. Although revolutionary Cuba has done much to eliminate racism, it is still rampant throughout the country. Before the revolution, there was virtual segregation, and although the situation has improved, and all have equal rights, the color of one's skin still matters. White is best. Then light brown, \\"cafe con mucho leche,\\" and on down the color scale until it reaches darkest brown or \\"black.\\" There are all kinds of combinations and permutations and subtleties, which I won't go into here. The point is that skin color does matter.Because of her father's position, Lourdes leads a sheltered life. The family is allowed to shop in special stores, go on occasional vacations to beach resorts and stay for a week at a hotel, eating all kinds of food - as much as they want. They live in a nice house, (una casona), in the Havana suburbs, and even have the option of buying a new car. Lourdes' paternal grandmother, Granma Gloria, from Galicia, Spain, was a lady before the revolution and still maintains certain airs. She adores her son and granddaughter, but has little affection for her dark-skinned daughter-in-law. Barbarita, Lourdes mother, is the daughter of a poor black woman, Granma Ines, who practices Santeria, an ancient African religion where the old gods, \\"orishas,\\" are still worshipped in the form of Catholic saints. Both grandmothers' religions, Catholicism and Santeria are counterrevolutionary and not practiced in the open. Lourdes is conflicted about this, and other differences between the old ways and the new. She does strive, with intensity, to be a good revolutionary, like Che, and longs to be accepted into the Young Communist League.She is sent, along with her classmates, to a state-run work-study program in Pinar del Rio, called School-in the Field, to work in tobacco fields. For the first time, Lourdes, an only child, is exposed to large numbers of kids her own age, boys and girls, in a live-in situation. And she learns much more about life than tobacco cultivation. She compares revolutionary slogans she always believed, (\\"Man Is More Than White; More Than Mulatto; More Than Black! Men Die But The Party Is Immortal! Homeland Or Death!\\"), to real life in the real world. Her romantic idealism is contrasted with the grim reality of the hot sun beating down on her aching back, bug bites, not enough food and long hours at monotonous work. She begins to see the flaws in her perfect society, flaws not unique to life under capitalism.Teresa de la Caridad Doval, born and raised in Havana, now a resident of New Mexico, really gives the reader an accurate glimpse of life in Cuba in the early 1980s. At that time I visited Cuba on business and her descriptions and characterizations ring true. The prose is uneven and the novel's pace has its slow moments, but overall I enjoyed the story. I would recommend \\"A Girl Like Che Guevara,\\" especially if you are interested in life in revolutionary Cuba.JANA"},{"Title":"Girl Like Che Guevara","review":"This is a very well-written and structured novel that depicts the cuban reality in a very interesting and intelligent way. I could not put it down!"},{"Title":"Girl Like Che Guevara","review":"With a title like A Girl Like Ghe Guevara, I have to admit, I had high expectations. Unfortunately, the book did not live up to them. At one point, I found myself saying, \\"Okay, I'll give it 50 more pages, and if it doesn't get better, then I'll stop.\\" Luckily, it did get a little better and I was able to settle in and to finish the novel.One thing that I did like was that it gave me an opportunity to see Communist Cuba from the point of view of a young niave Cuban girl, and that was interesting. Somehow Lourdes (the main character) was able to remain fairly positive considering everything that she saw and endured. That was a nice testament to the resiliance of the teenage spirit.In all, I think once I accepted that the book wasn't going to be what I had expected, I was able to enjoy it.On a more positive note: the characters were well done (though some too stereotypical) and the author did a great job in depicting the other-than-ideal society in which these people lived."},{"Title":"Girl Like Che Guevara","review":"\\"Doesn't the sky look bloody?\\" one of the teachers asks as the school's extended stay in the School in the Fields begins. It's just one of the many masterful ways that Doval flirts with magical realism in her book - in fact, the whole story has an intense, almost dreamlike quality that sets Lourdes and her classmates firmly in the campo, where \\"spirits\\" might be the ones perpetrating the petty thefts and the \\"Mother of the Water\\" lurks at night. The parents are gone, and the teachers willing to \\"pretend they didn't notice\\" many things (when not participating in them) - so it's the adolescents themselves whose voices dominate as they flirt, gossip, bully, work, and survive in their arduous rite of passage in 1982 Cuba. Lourdes, the sensitive and intelligent protagonist, tries to make sense of it all, and comes to many conclusions that complicate her ideas about the world beyond the camp. A fantastic read."},{"Title":"Girl Like Che Guevara","review":"In Havana, Cuba during 1982 high school students were required to put in time in the Tobacco fields as part of their learning and as service to the communist regime. A Girl Like Che Guevara follows the life of Lourdes Torres from her sixteenth birthday through her four month term (January - April) in the School-in-the-Fields Pinar, del Rio camp.Lourdes is growing up in a country where two worlds seem to be colliding (communism and US commercialism). She learns her dreams of being part of the young Communist League and trying to be like her hero Che Guevara, a Marxist revolutionary and Cuban guerrilla leader, are not as easy as she thought they would be.A Girl Like Che Guevara shows the hierarchy of being a teenager from a Cuban perspective. The author, Teresa Doval, calls her book, a little dirty piece of life in Cuba. She's right. At one point I thought the camp should be called Sex-in-the-fields. There's a lot of abuse, via bullying and food rations to go along with the dirt. Like the dirt Lourdes describes while she stitches away her days in the sewing shacks: \\"a film of dust covered our lips while our stomachs growled with repressed hunger.\\"Lourdes' job involves sewing the tobacco leaves onto dried sticks. This was considered the women's work while the boys worked in groups picking the leaves and finding the perfect sticks. Hundreds of students were supervised by a few teachers, some reliable and some not so reliable.The transition from child to young woman is not a new theme but to read about it in the confines of post revolution Cuba is. Cuba has suffered a rich history of upheaval and to witness the growth of a little girl into a woman during the harshness of this back drop is endearing and educational. I really had no background on Cuba, Che Guevara or tobacco fields. It was an eye opener. Teresa handles it beautifully, with respect and without attempting to deliver a history lesson. I was lost on some of the political references but it didn't take away from the story.Racial politics is everywhere. Lourdes fantasizes about being as white as the women in the Russian magazines she reads. Other strong themes are family, loss, friendship, religion, culture and community, as well as sexuality. Homosexuality is frowned upon by the communist party but Lourdes suddenly finds herself in love and yearning for her bed buddy.I was annoyed by the continued \\"Fat\\" Olga descriptions after the initial introduction. Fat Olga this, Fat Olga that. There was more to Olga than being fat. Sometimes I stumbled on the mingled Spanish and English but mostly I enjoyed Teresa's visions of life at camp.This is an entertaining story and a look into an interesting culture, often ignored. I recommend reading it. Reviewed by M. E. Wood"},{"Title":"Girl Like Che Guevara","review":"I absolutely loved this book!

These systems include: cable stays, trusses, space frames, geodesic domes, columns and walls, beams and slabs, frames, catenary cables, tents, pneumatics, arches, vaults, shells, and folded plates.The theory and behavior of each system is presented using extensive illustrations, familiar analogies, and model demonstrations, followed by building case studies. These numerous case studies were selected for their integration of structure and excellent architectural design as well as their suitability for demonstrating the unique behavior of a specific structural system.Finally, a chapter on structural layout describes a step-by-step methodology for integrating structure into the design process at the earliest stages using schematic framing plan diagrams, a system selection matrix, and design charts for preliminary member sizing.Features include: 79 case study buildings, 32 model demonstration of structural principles, end-of-chapter summary of terms, 179 citations in bibliography, 503 illustrations drawn by the author, and 42 charts for preliminary member sizing."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"Gary Jennings was an author known for his great historical novels, based on enormous and thorough research, very sexually active characters, developed in a level that few writers can master, and unusual situations brought to light by an uncommon and skillful style of writing. I think \\"Aztec\\" is his masterpiece, but \\"The journeyer\\" and \\"Raptor\\" are not that far behind.While reading \\"Aztec\\", I was totally transported to the \\"one world\\", back in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries of the christian era. Mixtli was a great character. His life was a great life. Jennings's readers were so appaled by his tale that they were left wanting more. Almost two decades later, their wish was granted. Of course, to be better than \\"Aztec\\" was a nearly impossible task, and not even Jennings was able to do it.In \\"Aztec autumn\\", a sequel of sorts, Mixtli briefly appears, but the main character this time is Tenamaxtli, one of Aztl&aacute;n heirs, who have to cope with his land being invaded and ruled by the spaniards. Tenamaxtli has revenge boiling in his heart, and he will conceive many plans to make the white smelly devils go back to where they came from.The book starts well enough, and for a time I thought \\"Aztec autumn\\" would be as great as \\"Aztec\\". But this book lacks the presence of many of the great secondary characters that peopled its predecessor. Tenamaxtli is interesting enough, but he's surrounded by cardboard characters. Many of them appear only briefly. The subplots are also not very great. Many reviewers complain that some of those subplots are sorry excuses for overrated sexual experiences; I don't entirely agree with them, because I understand that sexual scenes were a very strong part of Jennings' writing style, but this time those scenes were not as greatly written as the ones existent in his three masterpieces. Also, the ending in \\"Aztec autumn\\" seems very rushed, as if the author himself got tired of his book and just wanted it to be over.But when we're dealing with historical fiction, there are not many authors that can deliver a fantastic book like Jennings does - Noah Gordon and Ken Follett come immediately to mind. To go back to the One World / New Spain in the 1600s one more time was worth the reading. That's why this book deserves a 4-star rating.Grade 7.2/10"},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"Aztec Autumn suffers, like many sequels, by comparison to its predecessor, Aztec. One has the strong impression that the author knocked off this tome for one and only one reason: money. While the previous novel was impressive for the obviously immense research done to complete it, Aztec Autumn relies on implausible plot twists, magic, and the author's obvious prejudices for its effect. A fatal flaw is the author's choice of a mass murderer as a hero; any reader with a sense of justice begins rooting against the &quot;hero&quot; soon into the novel. Still, there is a certain amount of history interspersed with the author's prejudices, and fans of Aztec may want to read this mercifully short book just to get it out of their system."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"If I could pick 3 1/2 stars I would have.I enjoyed Aztec Autumn. It is not one of my favorite books and I don't think it is quite as good as Aztec. Reflecting on the that statment, how many sequels can claim to be as good as the original? There was something about Aztec that I find unplaceable. A sort of je ne sais quoi that Aztec Autumn unfortunately lacks, and while it does not make up for it, the book tries its hardest to by filling up every instant with action. With both this book and its predecessor, the endings left me thrilled yet high and dry at the same time. My only complaint of this book as an independant book is that, like Aztec, it is somewhat unbelievable, not so much in its greatness but in the characters' greatness. It is a good book, but not Mr. Jenning's best by far. If you haven't read Aztec read it and if you haven't read Raptor, then well, read that!"},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"Well, the Spanish Conquerers of Old anyway.Another great book by Gary Jennings, and though it did not grip me as much as Aztec did, I did really enjoy it.In the second installment of the Aztec series, Jennings follows Mixtli's son thru the now almost conquered Aztec empire, and although we all know the outcome of that I still deep down kept wishing that Tenamixtli somehow would magically change history and kick those spanish conquerers out of what is now Mexico.In typical Jennings style the book is at times extremely violent and sexually graphic, but is very well written and researched. If you loved Aztec, you'll enjoy this one as well."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"Gary Jennings' AZTEC was a stunning epic of blood and gore - a fascinating study of the fall of the Aztec empire told in first person from an &quot;eye witness&quot;. Unfortunately, this much awaited sequel, AZTEC AUTUMN, is not as well thought-out as the first book. The story is formulaic in the now familiar Gary Jennings style (see JOURNEYER and RAPTOR) - the hero loses his virginity at an early age; experiments with incest; brags about being uncircumcised; and has sex with first - the great love of his life (who always dies) and secondly - with the second great love (who always dies). I'm sorry but I loved Jennings' JOURNEYER and AZTEC, but it's hard to forgive the blatancy of his formula in AZTEC AUTUMN - the roots are showing! Clearly AZTEC AUTUMN is just a retread of the far better earlier book - but is sorely lacking in a re-write or two to make the reader overlook how systematic is his formula."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"In Aztec, Jennings came close to producing a modern prose epic,a panoramic picture of an infinitely interesting, sadly vanishedculture. Aztec Autumn, unfortunately, cannot measure up to the earlier effort. If Jennings had had more artistic sense, he wouldn't have released it, but there were probably so much pressure from his publishers and his literary agent that he couldn't help but try to cash in on his earlier success. The most telling weakness of this novel is Jennings' reliance on gratuitous sex scenes to keep the story moving. This device was beginning to wear on me in Journeyer, but by this stage it is beyond banal, and I am by no means a prude. He was simply running out of ideas, so he succombed to the Harold Robbins school of best-sellers. If you want to read a truly dumbed-down version of Aztec (one of the greatest &quot;reads&quot; of all time) fork over your money for this one."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"I have always loved historical fiction, and &quot;Aztec&quot; is the best novel I have read. It sent me on a quest for all Jennings' works, two of which I purchased used as they are out of print (&quot;Raptor&quot; and &quot;The Journeyer&quot;). I truly enjoyed &quot;Aztec Autumn&quot;, but it lacked the depth of &quot;Aztec&quot;. Still, I suppose it is a must for &quot;Aztec&quot;-lovers.I learned from this site that Gary Jennings died on February 13, 1999. Does anyone have any information about his death? I was truly saddened to hear about it and I can't believe that there won't be any more Jennings novels to follow &quot;Aztec Autumn&quot;."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"AZTEC is the best historical novel I've ever read. Thus, AZTEC AUTUMN can't possibly match it. But it comes pretty close.The shortcomings: it doesn't cover the same sweeping segment of history that the first one does...it's wedging a story into the middle of the story we were told in the first book. It treads some of the same ground, particularly when it comes to lurid sex. The first book was packed with sex too, but, dare I say it, those scenes had a bit more context. THe ending is not entirely satisfying, but part of that is because history didn't exactly turn out all that satisfying either, if you're a fan of the Aztecs!The pluses: The action and battle scenes are bigger and better. We get to see the Aztecs get some revenge, finally. (The book mostly follows an effort to drive out the Spaniards.) And it's always great to visit with familiar and much-loved characters.I highly recommend the book, but ONLY, ONLY, ONLY if you've read the first one."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"AZTEC AUTUMN is a sequel to Gary Jennings' earlier novel, AZTEC. Even so, it stands alone. The primary character of the first book makes his only appearance, at his execution, in the first chapter of this one. From that point, the story is told from the viewpoint of the burned heretic's son, an Aztec prince from an area not subjugated by the Spanish. When he learns of his true identity, the prince (Called Juan Britanico because his Aztec name is too difficult to spell) vows to wipe the Spaniards from the American continent.Most of the book is concerned with Juan's adventures in preparation for leading his revolution. The actual revolution, in terms of battles and such, is left to the very end. As such this is more the story of a man's life instead of a war chronicle. We learn the joy and concerns of Juan and his people. Along the way, we also learn something of the native cultures of the Americas in the generation that lived through the conquistadors.This is an entertaining book, if somewhat graphic in terms of sex, cruelty and violence."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"I must confess I am mystified by the negative reviews of this book. Yes, there's sex, violence, sex, gore, sex, historical research galore, and . . . oh, yes, some sex, too. But the book has so much more than that.First of all, it's based, very loosely, on historical fact. There really was a rebellion against the conquering Spaniards, led by a native from Aztlan named John the English, and yes, it very nearly did succeed.The rest is fiction of course, and full of the kinds of in-your-face native culture descriptions that were so delightful in 'Aztec,' complete, as before, with incest, human sacrifice, fantastical myth, bloody warfare, and lots of graphic sex of all sorts. But isn't that why you read it?!?'Aztec' was great, but it did have it's weaker moments. First, the constant interruptions to show the Spaniards' reactions to the narrative got a bit old after while. Second, the supposedly mature narrator seemed very immature in his delight in scandalizing his listeners. Third, the story sprawled all over the place, covering as many different types of settings and cultures as possible-- there wasn't any central core thread of plot to carry you through. And fourth, the reason for telling the story is rather suspect-- would the Spanish King really want to know all the gory details of the lives of the natives prior to his conquest?'Aztec Autumn' improves on the original in all these respects. There IS a central thread of story to string it all together-- the story of an imaginative and moving, if failed, rebellion. There are no scandalized listeners. The narrator does not delight in shock. The interruptions are fewer and less intrusive, and this time they actually make sense in terms of why the story is being told at all.To summarize then: tighter, more focused storytelling; more sensible framework for the narrative; an even stronger basis in historical reality. All this without sacrificing the 'guilty-pleasures' aspects of the presentation.This sequel is BETTER than 'Aztec,' which is saying a lot."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"Gary takes you through the life of Tenamaxtli, from being the son of a renowned governor, to the invasion of the Spaniards, to the uprising he led and his massive army of people from all over The One World.

Really amazing book, I could not put it down! I highly recommend it"},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"Perhaps it took to much time to write another chapter in the ancient Aztec's life, but I think this book and the original one: Aztec, are a very good way to learn more about the Aztec history. This book provides a lot of information of the culture, traditions, religion, behavior, strengths and weakness of the ancient Aztecs in a very understandable way. Also, it let the reader understand the reasons why any culture would try to stop a foreigner attack, even if that means loosing their own life. Written simply and in a novel way, it's easier to read than a History Book."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"Despite it's drawbacks, this is still a good book for those who have read Aztec and want more. If you have not read that book, don't bother with this one. First the bad news. It isn't written in the same lush detail as the first book. This is probably due mainly to the fact that it is a memior of a person written while he was in the middle of directing a revolution. Obviously he is not going to take the time explaining stuff we should already know. Also, the author insists on putting in the same incestuous/homosexual explorations that were in the other book. These ideas are by no means repugnant to me morally (I favor them), but it's a bit boring to sit through the same type of things in two differnt books. It also tends toward political correctness. Now the good news. The first shocking revelation was satisfying to me (although I probably should have expected it). It is entertaining to see how the Indians learn about the technology of the Europeans. It has some interesting battle scenes. And we learn more interesting day-to-day stuff."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"The story is continuation of The Aztec by the same author. The style and content are also similar to the previous novel. Those interested in the Spanish incasion of the Americas will find this novel interesting and full of information which may be new to them.

Sure, it is interwoven with Nahuatl language, and Spanish and Pore and Yaki -- Mexico, both pre- and post-Conquest was and still is a colorful patchwork of languages and cultures. Jennings plunks you right down in the middle, semi-confused and awash in the action at hand.It is not Jennings' best book. Hard to top The Journeyer and Aztec. The ending is a bit rushed and abrupt. But it IS pure Jennings - the rich color, the sex and violence and emotion...all there. It is not so 'multi-dimensional' that one is disturbed greatly by it or is shaken in one's own beliefs.

Depending on your point of view, the relative absence of the strong sexual content in his earlier books may or may not be a good point.As usual, Jennings' frequent gratuitous use of unfamilar words gets in the way of the story.

I was blown away by the quality of the narrative, and fondly remembered it as one of my favorite books of all time. Recently, I was looking for something to take along to read during an extended vacation, and I remembered this great book. Researching it on Amazon, I was delighted to find that Gary Jennings had written a sequel, and I ordered both Aztec and Aztec Autumn. Aztec was as wonderful as I remembered it. This book stunk. It was apparent that Mr. Jennings had expended his store of ideas in his first novel, and merely dusted some off and recycled them again for this one. Illicit sex with a close relative again? Really? Adrift at sea in a boat? Really? The whole \\"Island of the Women\\" thing, in which the main character introduces the entire female population of a manless island to the joys of sex, reads like a Penthouse Forum fantasy. I almost quit reading when the author has a key character, who is apparently the still living ghost or apparition of the woman who gave rise to the Mexica hundreds of years earlier, die in such a way that her body instantly ages and then dissolves into the ground in a scene reminiscent of an Indiana Jones film. In my opinion this pushed the book out of the historical fiction genre and into the fantasy realm, which is not my favored read. I pushed through to the end, but this book is in no way worthy of its predecessor. Do youself a favor and preserve the memory of the achievement that was Aztec. Don't read this book."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"As I am sure is true of most readers of Gary Jenning's book, \\"Aztec Autumn\\", I was led to this sequel by having read and found myself captivated by \\"Aztec\\", his first volume in a series of novels about the Aztec Empire from pre-columbian times to the Spanish conquest and subsequent decades. While Aztec Autumn was a fairly well researched and interesting story, I did not find it as engrossing as its predecessor. The plot is a bit more of a strech and less based on reality. Nonetheless, there is much to learn in this novel. It is based on a flimsy footnote of the history of the times but the lead character is an interesting and determined Aztec leader who wants to recapture his land and restore the empire's greatness. His values are otherwise questionable but he represents the Aztec mentality well. He assembles a grand army which takes most of the book. We meet some of the various characters and subcultures of the area along the way and the narrative moves along well. It is less credible, however, than \\"Aztec.\\"If you are also an admirer of Jennings, you will probably enjoy this novel. Putting aside its leaps and its somewhat overstretched happenings, it does give one a picture of the time and it does introduce us to several interesting characters.

This book becomes boring in parts and there are some Spanish phrases that need to be translated for us non-Spanish speaking readers - and I'm not talking about common Spanish words/phrases.

Does that help to sell books?The book is definitively below the standards set by his previous work."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"A rather decent read but definetly not up to the standards set by Jennings' first novel Aztec (which was excellent.) Autumn is no equal or sequel to Aztec because unlike its predecessor Autumn lacks character depth and you feel less emotionally connected (you don't cheer for its main character Tenamaxitl quiet as much as his father Miaxtl)to the story becuase its quiet predictable as to how its going to end. Tenamaxtli's plot to run the Spanish out of Mexico seem ridiculous since, thanks to common knowledge and History, they never really left. The story is not terrible though and its still delightful to read about the Aztec culture and how Mexico was in its early days. I would recommend for those who loved the first book to read Aztec Autumn just because it gives you a since of how Maxitl's spirit lives on in his son and how the Aztecs' culture did not disapear but instead blended into the new white society. So in the end i must say this was no waste of time but not as big as an addiction as the infamous novel Aztec."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"This book was such a disappointment after Aztec. The story was predictable and silly; the plot was thin, dialogue thinner. In one representative portion the hero is shipwrecked on an island of nubile, female pearl divers who are annually raped by traders-- the hero introduces them to the pleasure of his \\"tepuli\\". You get the picture. After the tour de force we read in Aztec this book was trivial and silly."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"I have to say that I was extremelly impressed by Aztec. The book was a gift from a friend! This is a gift that I will certainly hold dear for a very long time. Although Aztec was awesome Aztec Autumn was intriguing. In reading the book I cried for the pain that young Mixtli felt at the death of his father the symbolism for the death of the One World. It is almost too coincidential that the Spanish burned the accused the same way they burned the cities and villages that they conquered so not to leave a single trace of the One World behind. But Mr. Jennings is a remarkable writer that takes the ashes of the past civilization and actually gives, it, its past form/richness. He is absolutely brilliant, because although this is fiction it's almost too close to the actual history of Mexico. I've indulged in history, and he does an excellent job in putting the history of Mexico and the seductive story of Mixtli together. I only hope that he continues the share the glimpse he has found into the past of the country we now call Mexico. Believe it or not if you mention pyramids people still only think of Egypt, but Mexico can bost of having the largest pyramid in the world. Please continue to share these wonders with the world!!"},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"- - - * * * MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS * * * - - -Now let me tell you, I think this was a great book, and a good plot for a sequel, the already fallen Aztecs rising to drive away the Spanish... excellent.The way the story was written I found to be nice, as some sort of diary just like the prequel. But I really didn't liked the ending...The problem is that the story was told in some sort of way that you can see every step of the army being built and making open war to the Spanish, but some place on the last 6 pages everything went through the toilet... I mean, the climax, the thousands of Aztecs going to attack Aguascalientes, and in 10 lines or so the hole of the Aztec army is defeated and the Spanish win... I found that to be a pretty hasty ending, not as in the first one... and you start wondering \\"Did Gary Jennings was really so eager to get rid of writing this story that he just finished it as fast as he could?\\"... \\"The Aztecs marched to the city but it was a trap, we fought, but lost, and the only survivors were me and some Yaki doctor... THE END\\"The fantastical trait was also a downer... what made the first one so great was the fact that you could believe it happened, but in this one you meet G'nda K&eacute;, a Yaki woman that when she happens to die, she appears to have been alive for thousands of years... also, a woman called Pakapeti, who is pregnant, but although you are never told what it is, you can infer that it is some sort of monster... that just took away all the illusion of reality to this story...Also, you see Tenamaxtli living many episodes lived by Mixtli, his early virginity loss, the incest, getting lost in the sea...It was a good story, the last 20 pages are the downside, but it still was a pretty enjoyable book..."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"Most people have been saying that Aztec Autumn isn't nearly as good as its predecessors; even the reviewers that sort of like it only reccomend reading it after reading the first book, Aztec.Well, I came across Aztec Autumn before I had even known that it was a sequel. In other words, I (unknowingly) did exactly the opposite of what the previous reviewers said, and it certainly worked out - I loved it.It's full of sex, gore, violence, and so on - everything that people loved in Aztec is just as present in Autumn (some, of course, would say it is just a retread - I hadn't tread the first time). Reading Aztec illuminates a bit of the beginning of Autumn, but Autumn certainly, for me, stands alone. Reading Aztec later made *it* seem a bit of a retread, not this book.But there are other ways in which the sequel is better than the predecessor, even if you read it second. The Aztecs battling back is much more satisfying than their one small, short-lived victory in Aztec. Not only that, the ending is much better, much more *mature*. To wit:*************I resented and resisted the aliens among us. But, over time, I have met and admired many of th ese aliens--the white Alonso, the black Esteban, the padre Quiraga, your mulata mother, Rebeca, and finally you, dear daughter, who commingle so many different bloods. I realize now--and I accept--I am even proud--the YOUR lovely face, Veronica, is the new Face of The One World. To you, and to your sons and daughters and to The One World, I wish you all good things.*************It's not really uplifting, but not exactly depressing - certainly it's *interesting*. There is a new face emerging, that of Latin America. It's not European, it's not Native American. That is the true legacy of Cortes's battles and Motecuzoma's failures, and that makes Aztec Autumn a much more lasting book than its predecessor.Especially if read first. :-)"},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"This book would never have been published had Gary Jennings been alive to prevent it. It is obvious that someone controlling his papers--notes, outlines, partial writing of a projected novel--sought to make money out of his incomplete work by completing it for him and doing a miserable job of it. Jennings himself was so meticulous an author in every regard that he would have been embarrassed to have his name associated with this piece of trash.It is to be hoped that someone else, someone up to the task, was hired to use Jennings's papers to create Aztec Blood."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"After savoring Aztec, this sequel was a far cry from the original. The story is very well developed but ends very abruptly and sadly. It is worth reading AFTER reading Aztec but is not one of Jennings best works. It is almost as if he is writing along with gusto and, all of a sudden, &quot;badda boom- badda bing&quot; he decides to finish it. So many questions are left unanswered with no real possibilty for a sequel (well maybe just one!!!) but it seems very unlikely but, who know knows??!! I enjoyed the book and do recommend reading it. To ponder over a sequel you'll just have to read it and decide for yourself. This book has many surprises!!! Enjoy"},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"On August 27th., 1998, I was leaving Chico, Northern California, to drive South to Los Angeles and San Diego, and my friend ,Rich, mindful of my tendency to read, (and follow) maps as though still in the southern Hemisphere, proffered some advice. I should he said, drive South, and stay on anything that said South, but that if the road sign began speaking to me in Spanish, I would have gone too far and should turn back.I thought he was joking, of course, but next day, when I was unable to get anything other than Spanish-type music on the car radio, I began to think about the Spanish influence on the area I was driving through. And when I saw Raymond Jennings' new book in the Manhatton Beach bookstore, released as a mass-market paperback just that week, I bought it, of course, to carry further South still, and I read it with pleasure back home in Australia, bringing to it, now so much more extensive a background schema than would have been possible before I sojourned in the USA, revelling in the familiar placenames and geographical features, marvelling at the origins of customs still practised, never dreaming, of course, that this was to be Jennings' last book, that his literary career would end so abruptly with his death on February 13th this year.Jennings' best known work, I feel sure, will probably remain the blockbuster, widescreen &quot;The Journeyer&quot;, surely the ultimate in travel reading, with Jennings, himself proving no slouch in the itchy-feet department, retracing Marco Polo's wanderings extensively for the novel, just as he was to join several different circuses to properly research &quot;Spangles&quot; and explore remote corners of Mexico for the Aztec novels, even including maps of &quot;The One World; New Spain,&quot; that the reader might more easily obtain reliable bearings.As with all Jennings' books, the reader is gripped not so much by the plot, though this is always authentically plausible, as by the synthesis of unfolding events, the skill with which Jennings creates and blends incidents and occurences authenticated by vividness of background description and characterization. As with the works of Joseph Heller, some scenes in each novel are so brilliantly painted, so horrific in cruel detail that we retain them forever in mental snapshot. With no effort whatsoever, I can recall in detail the fate of the young servant in &quot;The Journeyer&quot;, and the dwarf couple in &quot;Spangles&quot;...and the beloved teenage daughter in &quot;Aztec&quot;.And &quot;Aztec Autumn&quot;, while perhaps a more mellow sequel, has, still, its share of bloodthirsty history as the Spanish colonization presses relentlessly on despite pockets of opposition and rebellion. Yet we are seeing, too, that these white usurpers begin to bring enlightenment, benefits, even stability to these lands where warring families have plotted and schemed, where violence has been a way of life, and even the Gods are cruel, their priests jealous indeed! We sense an awareness from our central character, who begins his story at the age of 18, that the newcomers have something positive to offer his people, even though, at first, his eyes cannot see so clearly the grey tones through the black and white lenses of youth .But viewpoints change as maturity sharpens our inner vision, and, by the closing of the story, the dying old man can reflect on a long lifetime of survival , of dramatic changes, of deeds accomplished and lessons learned.....and, at the end, find the New Land good.And on his last night, , the old man dictates his summing up, an epilogue that Jennings could not have known would be his own last word on the great hybrid society America has become:**********************************************&quot;...Yes, let me just say one thing more, and please put it at the end of your chronicle. Our Mixton War is lost, and rightly so. I should never have begun it. From the day of your Grandfather Mixtli's execution, I resented and resisted the aliens among us. But, over time, I have met and admired many of th ese aliens--the white Alonso, the black Esteban, the padre Quiraga, your mulata mother, Rebeca, and finally you, dear daughter, who commingle so many different bloods. I realize now--and I accept--I am even proud--the YOUR lovely face, Veronica, is the new Face of The One World. To you, and to your sons and daughters and to The One World, I wish you all good things.&quot;***********************************************Vale, Raymond Jennings and thankyou..This last book has not let you down....!"},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"For anyone who read Jennings' AZTEC, don't bother with AZTEC AUTUMN. It's a pale, formulaic imitation of the gorgeous original. My three-star rating is based on Jennings' success at detailing the everyday lives of his 400 year old subjects for us. But his insistence on detailing various sorts of sexual experimentation has grown a little thin. Again (as always - see RAPTOR, AZTEC, etc.) his hero's great loves die. And the ending seems to meet the needs of today's political correctness rather than ring true. After the atrocities visited upon him, his family, and his people, how could the hero embrace a &quot;multi-cultural&quot; rather than Indian-dominated, world? Jennings needs to revisit his original AZTEC to be refreshed on how to tell an enjoyable, believable story."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"Anyone who loved Aztec as much as I did will only be dissapointed in AZTEC AUTUMN. The charachters are shallow and familiar, the story rushed and not nearly as impressive or believable as AZTEC. I had to re-read AZTEC to renew my feelings about Jennings lost after reading this book."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"This sequel may not be as good as the first book, but it comes close. As before, I could not put it down. The account of the failed aztec revolution against the spanish, one generation after the events in the first novel, is a very well told tale. This guy is a master, and if you read the first one, you cant miss this one."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"Aztec was one of the most entertaining and engaging books that I have read in the last few years. The story was gripping, the characters were somewhat believable, and it was a real page-turner. Aztec Autumn, on the other hand, was completely dissapointing and sort of felt like it had been strung together by a computer program which pulled out elements of Aztec and then strung heavy-handed plots around them. Very little in Aztec Autumn seemed surprising or inspiring, and the narrative voice did not capture my attention the way it did in the original. It's hard to tell if a sequel like this, actually written by the author, is worse than one of those sequels written after the author died, by some hopeful writer obsessed with making a quick buck. One of the things that was great about Aztec was that it told a finite life story, but this book just dragged the story on in an unoriginal manner."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"Aztec was a superb piece of literature. A great ride through the life of the Aztec nation. Aztec Autumn lacks the personality and depth of it's prequal. The final chapter is the biggest let down. It is just a narration of what should have been the biggest battle of the book. I agree with several others who have reviewed this book, sequals just don't carry the same passion as the original."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"and the astounding first book, Aztec, i bought this book and amazingly finished reading it.Aztec Autumn should have been called Aztec winter since most of Jennings masterfull artistry has not only numbed but one would venture say has been frozen.Whereas in Aztec we find Mixtili the hero that one can identify with, while in Autumn the hero has few of the noble albeit violent traits and can actually be considered as probably the dumbest and luckiest of the Aztecs.It almost became omical while reading of his simplistic plots to kill Spaniards the idiot invariably was found out and usually foiled.And darn if there wasn't also an abundance of man hating women in this crowd of strange characters ... Quite unlike the Aztecs and totally missing from the first of Jennings books....Ok so I paid my dues in forking over the bucks for this book but Jennings the next one you publish I'll be a lot more carefull"},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"not quite as good as the original aztec but worth the read.aztec autumn tells the story of a young man named tenamaxtin who plans to fight the spanish and kick them out of the land they supposedley conquered.its a book of gore, sex, and murder but done better than most books with these ingredients.first read the original aztec then read this one."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"After I read Aztec, I was like WOW.. So I instantly bought this book. I started reading it and put it down.. I was not impressed.. Perhaps I expected too much... A year later I read this book in one week. It was an okay book, but seemed like it was done for money! Aztec was brilliant, this was just ok!"},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"If you read &quot;Aztec&quot;, then you know how brilliantly Jennings wrote his story, which was interwoven beautifully with extensive character background. This applies not only to the protagonist, but to many other individuals floating in and out of his life. &quot;Aztec Autumn&quot; has only a smattering of this, as well as the technique involving a &quot;what goes around comes around&quot; motif, with characters and events coming back to bite Mixtli in the, well, you know. It's probably due to the brevity of the book itself that disallowed it, but I would think a writing style as successful as the one used in it's predecessor was greatly missed, and was sorely needed. I, too, enjoyed &quot;Aztec&quot; and &quot;Journeyer&quot; (haven't gotten to &quot;Raptor&quot; yet), and I was looking forward to diving into &quot;Aztec Autumn&quot;. The &quot;5&quot; rating says that it had the right elements, but it needed more of the right elements (character development, length, intertwined storyline, etc.)"},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"I loved this book. It was the first book of this author I have read, and I will definitely read more of his work. Although it reminds me of the book River God, Aztec Autumn is not as vivid. A great read for people who love history and a great plot. It reveals the horrors inflicted on native peoples by the Spanish conquistadors, and helps you see it from there point of view."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"Aztec by Gary Jennings is a great book. It is a book that renewed life into my reading interests. It is a work of fiction based on facts. It is of course dramatized, yet some of the drama are in fact theories of how things came to be for the Aztec or rather Mexica. There is a quote from the The Los Angeles Times about the book which should always accompany any mention of it: &quot;Anyone who reads, anyone who still lusts for adventure or that book you can't put down, will glory in AZTEC.&quot; I read the sequel, it did not compare, but still I love it. I am waiting for part three and sadly the last to come out soon, and I expect to find joy in it. For me it is beyond a literary level of appreciation, but that of a person from that culture that appreciates scholars working to interpert what they feel my people or any other have lived. He is one of those exceptions in which is reached the soul of a people and just made it 'work' a little to entertain all. Read AZTEC!"},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"If you've already read &quot;Aztec&quot;, there is no need to read this book. If you haven't read &quot;Aztec&quot;, and are intimidated by its length, then &quot;Aztec Autumn&quot; may be the book for you.&quot;Aztec Autumn&quot; covers much the same ground as &quot;Aztec&quot;: the natives' puzzled reaction to Christianity, the Spanish conquerors failing to live it up their stated ideals, obligatory sex scenes which show how the natives innocently enjoy pretty much anything consensual. Though a sequel to &quot;Aztec&quot;, &quot;Aztec Autumn&quot; adds little to the original story.Gary Jennings seems tired in this novel. There are occasional flashes of his story-telling skills which enliven the story, but by and large, Mr. Jennings seems to be going through the motions."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"As the second book in the Aztec series, \\"Aztec Autumn\\" pales a little in comparison to the epic \\"Aztec\\". It is still very well researched, and it carries the story well in the early days of the Spanish conquest. It just isn't quite as engrossing as \\"Aztec\\". I still enjoyed Jennings's extremely well researched realism and the lead character in this book, Tenamaxtli, is still an interesting character. He just isn't Mixtli. That's probably the danger in creating a character as brilliant as Jennings did in the first book.I still recommend this book. I think it is much better read back to back with the first book in the series. Turning the last page of \\"Aztec\\" then opening the first page of \\"Aztec Autumn\\" is worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"Gary Jennings does an excellent job of combining many events from Aztec history into an entertaining story. This book would be a good starting point for anyone interested in Aztec history to get an overview of events that they can then \\"Google\\" for more information and surf \\"Amazon\\" for books by notable history writers for in-depth facts about the actual events. As a novice history lover, Gary Jennings' books have proven helpful to me in understanding the general events and provide a scaffold for me to pursue the historical books that are often less entertaining, tend to focus on a single or few events or lives, and at times may be a bit ponderous. Amazon: I love what you are doing showing not only the star ratings but the number of people who have rated the book. When there are just a few ratings I am always wary that they are friends of the writer or publisher just fluffing up the ratings. Please try to include the major library organizations' reviews whenever possible as they are both professional and relatively unbiased."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"It's said that everyone has one good novel in them. In Jennings' case this may have been \\"Aztec\\". Certainly, \\"Aztec Autumn\\" isn't nearly as good. It's almost as if he's run out of ideas and is trying too hard. An example is his use of sexual scenes and discriptions. He overdoes it and they are neither interesting nor titillating.It is possible that Jennings' other novels are better but I, for one, will never know. \\"Aztec Autumn\\" killed my interest in reading more.Ron Braithwaite author of Mexican Conquest novels, \\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\""},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"Book was a fairly good read, however, Jennings seems to be trying to recapture the success of his earlier book, &quot;Aztec&quot;, rather than create a new and original story. At times it seems as though both characters are the same person, rather than father and son. The new character, Tenamixtli, seems to be just an updated version of his father, Mixtli, from the original Aztec. Jenning should have made more effort to give Tenamixtli his own unique personality.All in all, the book was entertaining, but lacked the character developement that made &quot;Aztec&quot; the page turner that it was."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"Jennings combines the mastery of storytelling with rock-solid research to present the aftermath of the world of Mixtli as presented in his masterwork, Aztec. Perhaps this book does not present the depth of the previous work, but that can be found in the previous work, and this book continues the story beyond (just beyond) the life of Mixtli. I was (and I hate to use this word) spellbound and wished it were longer."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"This book was a gift for my husband. He had a copy of it that he loaned to our daughter, but wanted to re-read it again.

Also too much detail on sex for a book that I wanted mostly for the historical facts."},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"This is another fine novel by Gary Jennings. Very well researched with an exciting story that picks-up where \\"Aztec\\" left-off. Jennings is certainly a master story teller!"},{"Title":"Aztec Autumn","review":"I'm mainly writing this review in regards to the many, many typos I found in the Kindle edition. Don't know if the original book is scanned and the errors come from poor scanning or what, but it was difficult to read this book because of the typos. I've noticed this in other Kindle books, but this one seemed to have an extreme number of typos. Not sure what can be done about it, but it should be looked into.The book itself was good, not nearly as complex as Aztec, but still a good read."},{"Title":"When I Was Old.","review":"Georges Simenon, as everybody knows, was a Belgian who went to live in Switzerland. Well, that's about what I knew of the fellow before reading this interesting partial autobiography. I think it says somewhere at the beginning that he had intended not to write about himself ever, but that some event involving a child of his changed his mind. Whatever the reason, this look at part of a writer's hectic life is not without interest.Simenon lived in a mist of rumour and legend. Of course, this was largely of his own making and he does little to correct matters in the book. Although known as something of a, to put it politely, lover of women's company, he does not go into this Paris Match side of things at all. Instead, he lets us see a bit of the inner man, or what a clever writer may be selling to us as such, and, all the criticism of him after his death notwithstanding, I for one felt that I got somewhat closer to the enigma. It was almost as if he was saying (in about 1963) that he wasn't such a bad fellow after all.There is much of interest to anyone wondering about the author of Maigret, but precious little about Maigret himself. Just some tedious details of how he could write a novel a week and live rather handsomely without even getting tendinitis. It's hard to know how you can take Georges Simenon seriously. He led a charmed life in many ways, and his famous temper (like that of Peter Sellers) and love of womankind if not mankind, made him a force to be reckoned with. In \\"When I Was Old,\\" we get a glimpse of the man who held millions in thrall for so many years. It's worth the look."},{"Title":"The Trespasser","review":"Neither this nor other books by Lawrence in this Kindle edition have real page numbers, as amazon says they do, not on my K3!"},{"Title":"The Trespasser","review":"Had some beautiful prose, but was excessive at points.

It was one of those rare books that makes me say &quot;That's why I want to be a writer.&quot; I said to myself at the time I was going to write the author a letter and tell him how much I liked it, but I never did. So this review is sort of saying it. Good job. A quiet, but very moving book. I read his two Viet Nam books later and thought they were also good. He should be more recognized than he is.

I read the hardback of Lost Highway, but I'm looking forward to receiving my Vandalia Press edition. I'm a true West Virginian girl at heart, but Currey's work is more than Geographically-centered fiction - it speaks to all hearts everywhere. You can hear the music of the Still Creek Boys in his words, and the haunting discord of family unrest is the top and base notes."},{"Title":"LOST HIGHWAY.","review":"Currey returns to print! I've loved all of his work, and he's been silent too long. Just ordered the new version of Lost Highway and it looks great! Online rumors are that this version includes some new material that was cut from the original book. At last, Currey gets his voice out from under the big publishers.Don't overlook this master of prose. Pushcart and O. Henry winner, Currey's voice is a powerful force in the world of literature."},{"Title":"LOST HIGHWAY.","review":"Richard Currey wrote a phenomenal novel about the man, Sapper Reeves, who wanted nothing else than to play the banjo. Reeves, a West Virginia native, travelled all over rural America playing his banjo with his two fellow band members, Estin and Leonard. The group, known as the Still Creek Boys, played at bowling alleys, firehouses, schools, and local bars throughout the United States. Sapper spent most of his nights sleeping in a Chrylser with his band members while his wife, Riva, and son, Bob, remained in West Virginia. Sapper's band recorded an album and played for a national show but did not earn enough money to make ends meet, so Sapper eventually had to give up his dream ... for a while. Sapper's family life took a downturn and he turned to the bottle, but eventually he came back to music. At that time, Sapper's domestic situation improved but Bob voluntarily left for Vietnam, never to return the same.Currey is a phenomenal writer. I am not particularly a fan of country western music and did not think that I would like a story about a traveling banjo man. However, I really enjoyed this book. Unlike most authors, Currey can tell a story with very few words. I admired that some chapters were only one or two paragraphs, but these chapters told in so few words were often the most meaningful. Currey has an uncanny ability to narrate the natural beauty of rural America while telling the story of a man with seemingly simple thoughts that yearns to play the banjo. I highly recommend this book and am looking forward to Currey's next novel."},{"Title":"LOST HIGHWAY.","review":"Musicians' lives don't always make the transition into the written word gracefully in either biography or fiction--maybe because the story of getting from one gig to the next isn't all that enthralling.\\"Lost Highway\\" tells the tale of bluegrass musician Sapper Reeves, who in a vintage Chrysler rides the 1940's backroads of West Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee with his compadres, the other two 'Still Creek Boys'. Though he's a wizard with the banjo, his band can't catch a break and seems destined for obscurity.Richard Currey is a truly fine writer, excelling in detailing the epiphanies of Sapper's small town life. For example, there is a wonderful scene in which Sapper awakens one night as a winter blizzard is moving in, and goes to rouse his son so that they might together savor the beauty of the snowfall in the quiet, resting town.All of the book, in fact, seems to exist in a protective bubble of nostalgia. Scene after scene is as perfectly drawn as the period piece illustrations that Gary Kelley designs for \\"Rolling Stone.\\"The romance of Sapper's life is the same as that of a minor league baseball player who never made the big leagues. It's the beauty of an obscure dream. Sapper's life is so compressed and idyllic that subplots about his marital problems and his son's eventual misadventure in Vietnam do not resound enough to provide a real conflict. Without real tension, the book is a pleasant cul de sac, a visit to the past and the magic hollow where music originates --- light years beyond what Robert Waller could do, but lacking the gravitas of a major novel.Three-and-a-half stars."},{"Title":"LOST HIGHWAY.","review":"Incredibly poetic prose. The way Currey writes, the book flows gently but insistently along like a slow country stream. It's a very in depth look at the life and times of a musician. I found myself turning the pages as if I was reading some kind of action/thriller novel. Currey never pushes the story, and it seems as if it all simply unfolds. Great read, and interesting view of the hard life of a musician."},{"Title":"Create Your Own Hedge Fund: Increase Profits and Reduce Risks with ETFs and Options (Wiley Trading)","review":"The newest craze in investment publishing involves something about \\"hedge funds.\\" These mysterious investment vehicles (to the unsophisticated public) are seen as the investment of choice for the \\"rich\\" investor looking for outsized market gains, or a reduction in risk.The author seemed to be taking advantage of this when he titled the book. In actuality, there is nothing more here than a basic (and I do mean basic), primer on Exchange Traded Funds, and basic options trading strategies (covered calls and short puts).The first few chapters involve wasted pages on Modern Portfolio theory, the advantage of index funds over mutual funds, and the benefits of ETF's over traditional index funds. Anyone who is knowledgable enough to be interested in hedge fund strategies (ie. statistical arbitrage, relative value, market neutral, etc.) will find nothing here that he or she doesn't already know.The second half on trading options on ETF's is similarly light on any interesting information. Much basic information on covered calls and short puts is covered. It wouldn't be unfair to call it simplistic.Unfortunately, the author did not discuss the important concept of implied volatility when discussing writing strategies on ETF's. This makes certain option strategies, that normally are equivalent, less than equal when used on an ETF.The book correctly states short puts are equivalent to covered calls, when the puts are secured by cash. If you are going to buy 500 shares and write 5 calls, it is simpler to just sell 5 puts, and hold cash to back them up.But the author neglects to mention that options on indexes often trade at what is called an IV skew. Out of the money calls on ETF's are generally underpriced, while the puts are overpriced. This makes short puts backed by cash superior to covered calls on an ETF. But Lord help you if the market gets caught in a huge sell off, or implied volatility increases.There was no discussion of identifying when it is prudent to sell options and when it is wise to remain unhedged. It didn't address the various follow ups to covered call/short put strategies when the stock moves adversely.If you know absolutely nothing about ETF's, and options trading strategies, then you might find this useful. If you are looking for information on hedge fund techniques, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Create Your Own Hedge Fund: Increase Profits and Reduce Risks with ETFs and Options (Wiley Trading)","review":"The market has always intrigued me. However, following the advice of well meaning, financially secure friends never brought me the success I sought. It turns out that it's much harder to pick winning stocks than I expected. Even the mutual funds I owned were disappointing. \\"Create Your Own Hedge Fund\\" really opened my eyes with insight and clear step-by-step guidance in teaching me a profitable, yet safer, way to invest.The best two skills I gained from this book were: How to build a portfolio and how to make money using one rather simple strategy. This book gave me the necessary confidence to take control of my own finances and provided compelling reasons for doing so. I learned that ETFs (exchange traded funds) are much less expensive to own than what Wolfinger calls 'traditional mutual funds' ...and, on average, make more money.Wolfinger clearly outlines exactly how to use ETFs and options - a topic that had always scared me. His detailed explanation of how options work convinced me that options are indeed doable. I was also pleasantly surprised to discover that I've been using \\"options\\" for years - rain checks at the grocery and auto insurance policies are both essentially options. And the best part - another surprise to me - is that options actually lessen risk. My chances of losing money are now less than they were before.The author skillfully enables his readers to understand the rationale behind trading decisions with a multitude of examples that make the lessons come to life.The book also contains useful background information, references and statistics to support the author's ideas. I tried it, and so far, it really works. I make my own decisions now and am happy with the results. Don't be afraid - if I can do it, so can you. As Wolfinger says, I feel like I'm running my own small fund."},{"Title":"Create Your Own Hedge Fund: Increase Profits and Reduce Risks with ETFs and Options (Wiley Trading)","review":"This book covers the basics of this strategy very well; however it contains way too much filler information, and not enough substance. The author treats the reader as a novice to the market; but in reality no stock market novice would even begin to understand this strategy - therefore the author misses his target audience!In my opinion, it is good entry entry-level reading for the market beginner who wants to understand the basics of a hedge fund; however it is not for the seasoned trader demanding greater insight in to a leading-edge strategy."},{"Title":"Create Your Own Hedge Fund: Increase Profits and Reduce Risks with ETFs and Options (Wiley Trading)","review":"Another excellent and clear book from Wolfinger, continuing his string of winners. We know nobody wins ALL the time (never forget that, and manage your risks very wisely), but this tack is nearly as foolproof as it gets, for the novice, like me. Loved it."},{"Title":"Create Your Own Hedge Fund: Increase Profits and Reduce Risks with ETFs and Options (Wiley Trading)","review":"Mr. Wolfinger has an excellent understandng of the Stock Market, Funds, and Options. His use of language is perfect. He presents the difficult process of trading clearly. He has put the use of the old standard trading strategies into a fresh perspective. His approach is one that is useable by the \\"seasoned vet\\" or the \\"newbie\\" to trading. I read this book from beginning to end in one setting. I trust his strategy."},{"Title":"Create Your Own Hedge Fund: Increase Profits and Reduce Risks with ETFs and Options (Wiley Trading)","review":"Hedge funds have been in the news lately. Since for the last few years, some have done very well. So it's quite a hot topic. Also true of ETFs, which have proliferated. Wolfinger's title invokes both, in an attempt to attract as large a readership as possible. Alas, the title is somewhat misleading.The text gives next to nothing about how hedge funds tend to operate. Instead, it is mostly about explaining what ETFs are, and why you might want to own them. One key reason, as furnished by the text, is that you can then write (i.e. sell) covered calls on them. This increases the short term income you can garner from owning an ETF.Commendably, the author does not recommend buying of options. He says, correctly, that on average, this is a losing game. It is reassuring to read this, for it means that the book is not one of these breathless tales about how to make money quickly.The explanation of options could have been made 20 years ago. It is fairly limited; meant for a reader with little previous experience in finance. The only truly new material concerns describing ETFs.The author's strategy is conservative. But in its own way, also limited. To the extent that an efficient market exists for the pricing of the underlying stocks in an ETF, then the covered calls will be priced fairly accurately by Black-Scholes. But if there is an unexpected upside, then your ETF will be sold when the call expires in the money. While if there is an unexpected downside, you retain your ETF and get the call income to reduce your losses. The problem is that if you do this method long enough, you relinquish the unexpected gains. And you end up holding losers."},{"Title":"The Power of Fantasy: Illusion and Eroticism in Everyday Life","review":"A wonderful book regarding the mental aspects of fantasy and the reasons we need to add it into our lives. From bedroom activites to on the street, this book covers all aspects of the psyche in regards to fantasy. I would reccomend this to anyone who does role-playing, or has a interest in the subject. It's also a great tool to spice up the bedroom or dungeon(depending on your lifestyle)."},{"Title":"Lights on Orot : The Teachings of HaRav Avraham Yizhak HaCohen Kook","review":"Rav Kook is the greatest Jewish thinker in the last 200 years. He is the one who most understands the spiritual crisis of the modern Jew. The book \\"Orot\\" (Lights) is one of his most important works. Here he explains his views on the role of \\"Am Israel\\" (the Jewish people) in bringing G-d's message to the world. He explains the importance of the return of the Jewish people to its historical, Biblically-mandated homeland in Eretz Israel (The Land of Israel). Unlike some other religious Zionist thinkers who generally look at Zionism's role as simply facilitating the \\"ingathering of the exiles\\", Rav Kook shows in this book that the inherent holiness of the land mandates that the Jewish people settle and develop as much of it as possible, and not simply satisfy themselves with a small community residing on a small fraction of its divinely-mandated boundaries. A strong Jewish life, in all its manifestations, spiritual, economic, military, scientific in the whole Land of Israel will benefit not just the Jewish people, but its Arab neighbors and all of mankind as well.Rav Kook's writings are generally difficult for the novice reader, even someone who is fluent in Hebrew. Rav Samson's translation into English and his cogent explanations of the text makes part of this classic text available to the wider Jewish world, just when it needs it the most, as the Jewish world confronts doubts among parts of the Jewish people (both religious and non-religious) over the Jewish people's very rights to Eretz Israel in addition to a violent onslaught by non-Jews against the Jewish nation. I also recommend Rav Samson's continuation of the translation of \\"Orot\\" called \\"War and Peace\\" where he deals with vast historical trends and wars that impact the Jewish people and its redemption."},{"Title":"The Damned Engineers","review":"Janice Holt Giles spent 5 years researching and writing this book. When it was finally published in 1970, it was immediately acclaimed as one of the better titles published on the Battle of the Bulge. Now, over 30 years after it's initial publication, this superb work still holds up. She accomplishes the impossible here. She manages to convey the closeness of a military unit as well as the fearful atmosphere that shrouded the Ardennes in the early days of the battle. It's like there's something personal happening here.And well it should. The author's husband was a member of the 291st Engineer Battalion, so she had a personal investment in her book. She unfolds her story carefully, and as the story progresses, the impossible becomes more a reality and soon, these men, who were trained to build, not to kill or destroy, are thrown into the line in what would seem a vain attempt to derail the seemingly invincible German juggernaut. Yet despite what would seem an overwhelming assignment, they succeeded. They brought Hitler's ambitious offensive to a thudding halt by guile, tenacity and just plain guts.When you read this, you'll get to know the men of the 291st and soon you'll see that they're not only a unit, but a family as well. This is Mrs. Giles' achievement. This book is out of print, but is definitely worth seeking out. Read it. Enjoy it. Treasure it. I certainly will."},{"Title":"The Damned Engineers","review":"My father, Frank Hayes, was in the 291st Engineers and fought in the Battle of the Bulge. Growing up, I was never much impressed with that fact and was certainly uninterested in reading Janice Giles' book, although we had several copies around the house. In 1990, the news was full of the 45th anniversary of the end of the war and I was a 31-year-old mother. I finally developed some interest in our heritage as Americans and read The Damned Engineers. How the book made those men come alive! I lived their tensions, the twists of the development of the battle, the anquish they felt over the Massacre at Malmedy, and the comradeship. I even recognized some names from family Christmas cards, just then actually getting to know the men. Thank God I read this while my father was still alive and I could thank him! I laughed and cried and felt so proud. Everyone should read this book, ESPECIALLY if you think that you are uninterested in WW II. Then go thank a veteran of any war."},{"Title":"The Damned Engineers","review":"I have recently obtained a copy of the book; my grandmother has had a signed copy and note from the author. Today it is held in an heirloom like status within my family. My grandfather, Fred Chapin is mentioned throughout, with particular emphasis on laying explosives and blowing the bridge that the author sites as being a key to ending the war. It was not until my grandfather's death nearly twenty years ago that his war time story, \\"pants part\\" and all had been told to me by my grandmother. Only now as a history teacher do I understand the importance and tragic results on ordinary people that were left behind to reorganize their lives. This is not an easy book to read, but sheds light toward those that fought the Battle of the Bulge. Men who were asked to fight what would later become known as \\"the good war\\". There was a definite reason besides my age that my grandfather never chose to speak of this around me. It is my belief that he was not proud of what had taken place."},{"Title":"The Damned Engineers","review":"This is definitely great material.

THE UNITED STATES AND CHINESE MILITARY AVIATION, 1929-1949","review":"Xu has written a very valuable book for students of the air war in Asia in the 1930s. I wish I'd had a copy in front of me when I was writingFlying Tigers: Claire Chennault and His American Volunteers, 1941-1942. Not only is Xu a native reader of Mandarin and Cantonese, but he spent years ransacking the various archives in the United States. (The research began as a doctoral dissertation, but continued well beyond that.) The result is a study unmatched in English of the American role in Chinese aviation during the 1920s, 1930s, and early 1940s.Alas, the book is very hard to find and priced out of sight. Even the Kindle edition (available on Amazon) is beyond the reach of most people interested in this subject. I recommend inter-library loan, which is how I acquired my copy.Though Xu is a fluent writer of academic English, he is not well versed in military aviation, and his references to actual warplanes and aerial combats are often confused and sometimes just plain wrong. This is inevitable when contemporary documetns (themselves often written by people without technical knowledge) are used without applying a filter of prior information. Still, \\"War Wings\\" belongs on the shelf of every serious student of the Sino-Japanese War and the American Volunteer Group.Blue skies! -- Dan Ford"},{"Title":"Fearless Loving","review":"I found fearless loving to be a powerful new way of looking at loving.

She can guide you along your path to loving in a way you never thought you could, but always wanted to. The most poignant truth for me is that everyone is innocent.

This book will help you with understanding any type of love and how to do it best! She never coaches you to be someone you're not, and even highly discourages behaving as if you were playing a game. She teaches you how to test your prospective partner, or current partner so you can hear what they're not saying (which is more insightful than what they are saying).

In his eloquent novel, Mr. Brown transcends others with intelligence and overwhelming evidence of his subject of the half-breed in history and literature. As a writer of historical fiction, I often merely peruse subjects. But Injun Joe's Ghost has stopped me in drop-dead fashion. Who could breathe with these blasted spirits traipsing about? I love this work because it crystallizes my own vision, and lets me take off onto the trail of the lost dime novel.The two book I wrote led me to connections about racism and I traveled about the nineteen twenties and thirties. Looking for the roots of eugenical superiority--with nazis about everywhere, I knew I had to go back through history once more. I may need two, three years to write my own half breed and howdy doody, but I know Mr. Brown wrote an inspired, Pulitzer Prize novel that, astoundingly, has not been properly reviewed. I don't understand how this is. This novel, out for what; six, seven years has not found a welcome audience? It should be required reading in its own course in American history. Anyway, that's the truth, but I may have to cut the ears and nostrils of the intelligentsia(that's an image in Tom Sawyer) to win a few converts. Scouring Amazon, i was sad not to see more books about this subject from Mr. Brown. He is just too good to be silenced."},{"Title":"Injun Joe's Ghost: The Indian Mixed-Blood in American Writing","review":"Harry Brown is the most intelligent human being I have ever witnessed in my entire life.

I first noticed this through the work of Joseph Needham. I went to an excellent lecture of his with the unforgettable title &quot;The Pre-Natal History of the Steam Engine&quot;. The Chinese had many of the precursors to the steam engine but didn't put them together. I've seen this rise of western technology attributed to Christianity in western cultures but never in a very convincing way. David Noble has convinced me. In the first part of the book he shows the explicit influence of two passages in the Bible, one from Genesis and one from Daniel. It is an academic style of writing. You've got to want to read it but its worth it. I wanted to know much more in depth about the role of the monasteries in developing technology. I found myself looking up the origin of Benedictine liqueur (from an apothecary in a monastery). When it comes to the present day the book is weak. He dwells on the religious views of current or recent scientists. Since most of the American population is theist and attends church its not surprising that scientists also espouse religious values. To make a great point out of this is redundant. After reading this book I wanted to go further but was disappointed to have my appetite so whetted but not yet satisfied.

Nevertheless, it is worthwhile and well-written; though I gather than some, from its reviews, have had some problems with its difficulty and subject matter.This is meant, I think, to be a popular book rather than an academic text. The author has his story-line and sticks too it fairly well: as with any 'popular' book, if you dig from one discipline into its minutia, you're going to find flaws and biases.

He provides a good overview of religious motivations for scientific and technological progress from medieval times to the American space program and Human Genome Project. Especially inspiring to these researchers and inventors have been apocalyptic expectations and the impulse to recreate the original relationship between God and humans in Eden. However, the book suffers in the last chapters as Noble examines modern research in genetics, artificial intelligence, space flight, and nuclear weaponry, and the author's thesis that religion is inciting dangerous developments in these fields is a weak one."},{"Title":"The Religion of Technology: The Divinity of Man and the Spirit of Invention","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend, who is a clinical psychologist. As soon as I began reading it, I felt very strongly that I would not be able to accurately evaluate it without input from people knowlegeable in science and technology and, perhaps more ominously, I did not want to continue reading it without access to this perspective.I asked my book group to read and discuss this work. The group consists of three research chemists, one chemical/technological lawyer, two teachers, and one artist. The resulting discussion revealed flaws in Noble's narrative which I believe non-scientifically oriented readers should be aware of.All readers in my group agreed that the book was hard to follow unless one came to it bringing some background information to the chapter topics. One of our group had worked in the Human Genome Project and knew some of the people discussed by the author, while another had some knowledge of the evolution of early Christianity. Both readers felt the author's bias in these areas.On the whole, my group of readers felt that Noble wrote this book with a thesis to prove and was willing to extract, delete, and filter information out of context to support it. A propos of that, the scientifically-oriented members of the group were critical of Noble's lack of &quot;scientific method&quot; in approaching the topic he had chosen. They felt he ignored achievements of science motivated by humanitarian concerns and which achieved the desired results in favor of inflammatory scare tactics tending to overwhem and thus convince the non-scientific reader of the invidious presence of ignorance, compromise, and corruption.As to the author's emphasis on religious beliefs as justification for scientific/technological pursuits, the scientific members of my reading group disputed Noble's characterization of scientists' motivation as essentially fundamentalist religious in nature. The practicing scientists concurred that their commitment to research came more from a stance of profound curiosity on the nature of things than the usurpation of God's creative work that Noble asserts as scientific motivation. This is not to say that these scientists did not have a sense of awe and extreme respect for what they might encounter in their research. Their statements were, for me, an antidote for the scary, cavalier attitude that Noble proffers in his book as being typical of today's scientific community. There are, albeit perhaps a minority, scientific/technogical people (or those in other fields) who do not pose a threat to the natural creative order of things.Other criticisms were an annoying excess of shallow name and publication reference dropping, which I must sadly dismiss as typical of scholarship in the 1980s and 90s.In conclusion, the feeling was that Noble could have done a much better job with his ideas than he did in this book."},{"Title":"The Religion of Technology: The Divinity of Man and the Spirit of Invention","review":"I read The Religion of Technology: The Divinity of Man and the Spirit of Invention by David F. Noble for a college course called Philosophy of Technology. I read this book in the context of the required reading of other philosophers such as: Bill Joy, Raymond Kurzweil, Douglas Kellner, Don Ihde, Jacques Ellul, Hans Jonas, Martin Heideggar, Albert Borgmann, and Arnold Pacey.Noble's writing style reminded me of reading an encyclopedia or a \\"collective biography\\" - it focused on the lives of several individuals with a connection among them. He provided the name of an influential person, their time period, a brief description of what they did, and maybe a quotation or two.Though fascinating, I think this book can be intimidating if you lack some background knowledge on the European philosophers that Noble mentions in the book. To fully appreciate the metaphors that Noble highlights, I think you also need a good understanding of the four books of the Bible - Genesis and three books of prophesy: Ezekiel, Daniel, and Revelations - otherwise his arguments won't seem very significant. I am a Christian, so was impressed with the extent of Noble's knowledge of specific scriptures in the Bible, but it didn't seem like Noble himself is a Christian, as he refers to \\"Christian mythology\\" (p. 103) and \\"so-called born again fundamentalists\\" (p.109). He has obviously read up on major Christian leaders - I was surprised to find William Tyndale (p.43), Billy Graham, and Jerry Falwell mentioned (p.109) in the book. Usually when Christianity, especially Creationism, is brought up, Charles Darwin is usually brought up as well, but not so in this book, evolution did not make an appearance. I was surprised too that Galileo, Isaac Newton, and Thomas Edison, were discussed, but there was no mention of Albert Einstein - I think Einstein was a pretty important guy to leave out. Other well-known historical figures that appeared in the book include: Christopher Columbus, Mozart, Benjamin Franklin, Henry Ford, Neil Armstrong, Adolf Hitler, and Karl Marx.I feel like Noble presented history in a rather \\"cut and paste\\" fashion, which I think detracts from some of his credibility and can be sited as a weakness in his methodology. He used a lot of ellipses in his quotations, which I myself use sometimes, but the result seemed choppy and a bit suspicious. I realize that he was trying to move quickly through about 1,000 years of history, pointing out key individuals along the way, and to include full quotations would have probably been unrealistic. Still, I was uncomfortable with the excessive hodgepodge and serious risk of statements being taken out of context - for example, I looked up footnote #14 from page 110 and discovered that the quote was compiled from statements the speaker made on three separate pages.So, while I did find the historical details and comparisons to Christianity interesting, this book read a lot like a timeline, and I'm not sure I agree with where it is projected as going."},{"Title":"The Religion of Technology: The Divinity of Man and the Spirit of Invention","review":"This book traces the origin of the Internet and the attitudes of its developers to Protestant theology and its antecedents in Christianity.

The drive in northern Europe for technological enhancements to life derives from this.A book that offers an interesting insight on Noble's ideas is 'Collective Intelligence' by Pierre Levy. This book examines the social impact of Internet technology and proposes a set of ideals that should be used to guide a society using it. Levy tries to show how his set of ideals would obtain the most benefits from society from this technology. An interesting part of the book occurs when Levy compares the mode of live in an Internet society with that derived from Catholic ideals. He recounts mediaeval Catholic philosophy on the means by which God's insight creates the world. God can exist by his contemplation of his own existence since he is the essence of all things and out of his contemplation springs angels which can contemplate their own existence but need other things to exist. There are 10 ranks of angels each created either by God's or the next higher angel rank's contemplation of themselves. The contemplation of the lowest rank of angels creates our world.The nub of this is that the world is top down. The ideal is at the pyramid of existence and goodness derives its meaning from the top. Levy contrasts this with the new conception of the Internet as shown by Noble. The lowest rank which is our world can create a new world above it. In this case, it is the lowest level of connectivity of the Internet. This new world is good in so far as it enables the inhabitants of our world to flourish. The lowest levels in cyberspace can create higher levels of existence with no limits on the number of levels which corresponds to the ranks of angels. Goodness flows up these levels from the real world in direct contrast to Catholic theology.These two books support each other. Levy offers this Internet world as an ideal and contrasts it with the Catholic ideal. Noble examines it as an historical process and notes its derivation from Protestantism.These are two very interesting books well worthy of attention."},{"Title":"The Religion of Technology: The Divinity of Man and the Spirit of Invention","review":"Review of \\"The Religion of Technology: The Divinity of Man and the Spirit of Invention\\" by David F. NobleLet me open on a personal note. Bear with me as I tell this story. This book, among many extreme/profound books I've read in the past 5 years (ACIM; Cancer and Faith; Love Does Not Condemn; DU; The Conscious Universe: Part and Whole in Modern Physical Theory; Master of Self-Realization; I AM That; Dasbodh; Mindful Universe, and Joyful Cruelty for starters) is one that actually shook me up the most. It made me question my spiritual findings over that time over and above the spiritual confirmations in all of the above works listed (save for Joyful Cruelty, which book also asked me to dig deeper). My spiritual finding? We are \\"Edenic\\" not \\"Adamic\\". This book shows how my spiritual \\"finding\\" isn't new, is wrapped up in the pursuit of absolute and perfect knowledge, has contributed to the technological advancements produced by our species and, much to my chagrin, may have contributed to the subject-less void of objectivist metaphysics.This book brings forth an over 1000 (1000 CE - 2000 CE) year history of our species singular pursuit of spiritual perfection as foretold in the Book of Revelation. I was forced to ask, \\"Am I just an \`apocalyptic millennianist'?\\" This thought did not sit well with me, as my spiritual (accidental) apocalyptic pursuits include having belonged to a modern-day, apocalyptic, dooms-day cult (Church Universal and Triumphant from 1987-1989) with predictions of the end of the world down to building fall-out shelters; stocking up of arms and munitions; the whole proverbial enchilada. Although, I was no longer an active member at this time, all of the above is very troubling, if not informative, to say the least.I bought this book at the Finger Lakes Outlet mall in Waterloo, NY about a decade ago. I've been participating in on-line Amazon forums since late 2008. Recently, after reading literally 1000's of posts between atheists and theists and their debate of matter vs. mind; and, which comes first, to which is real and which isn't; I recently had the thought, \\"I want to be able to download my thoughts into my iPod.\\" This is an AI theorists dream, probably a modern Christian's nightmare, yet, as this book makes clear, the two are joined at the proverbial hip in an incessant pursuit for eternal life.Here is a post from an Amazon thread entitled \\"Be the Love Wherever you are\\". I made this post sometime in 2012:\\"\`I wanted to touch on something near and dear to my heart: Downloading thoughts to my iPod. I Bing'd \`downloading thoughts to my iPod' and got the following three links:Apple - iTunes - Everything you need to be entertained.How Do I Download Music to My iPod? | eHow.comMy thoughts about Zune vs. iPod -- Scobleizer\\"Then I added \`AI technology' and got this:\\"Zabaware - Giving your computer the power of thought...\\"I download the freeware program Ultra Hal.\`\`Zabaware is a company that aims at giving your computer the power of thought.

There is an overwhelming amount of evidence in the Bible that this is true. What would it mean to only know the father? To me this means that mind would see the world in its originally created form before the Fall. That's right, we're talking Eden here. We are talking a new heaven and a new earth of Revelation 21:1.\\"Redemption in Christ is timeless (even if there will appear to be a physical [read \`cosmological'] redemption *in time*). *Seeing the son allows one to see the father* (\`If you have seen me, you have seen the father'; \`for when He shall appear, we shall see Him as He is, for we shall be like Him').\\"This timelessness is not easy to appreciate. Eden isn't easy to return to. The main difficulty in returning to Eden appears to be the mind of a believer who actually puts the return into a future moment. This isn't limited to Christians, but any thought with this content in any human being. Timelessness (or \`Eternity') is available, well, timelessly (\`eternally'). The difficulty (or the reason why this thought of a future moment to come is held in a mind) simply revolves around the apparent fact of the lack of spirit as the dominant mode of existence. The story of the fall into denser and denser forms of matter (being cast out of the presence of the Lord in the Garden), would contradict the availability of that presence.\\"The redemption in the blood of Christ, eternity and the nature of God as present in His creation allows a sliver of timelessness to enter the mind. If this seed of light is planted in the soil of the soul, watered and given sunlight, perhaps what I say will be allowed to take hold inside and a return to Eden not so crazy after-all.\\"I've had this \\"Edenic thought\\" building up for years now. It dawned upon my mind (probably first time I read of Eden in Genesis which would be sometime in 1979) that of all the books on earth, one of them actually tells the story of a time when two figures were with God, in a garden, communing with the supposed Source of creation. The garden's name is Eden, of course. It hit me sometime in 2009 that we should all return to this state of affairs! And, borrowing from the end of that Book, why not bring heaven to earth? So, after this thought took hold in me, it has been with me ever since and guided my thinking in my earthly spiritual pursuits and daily affairs.A person, whose Amazon Pen Name is \\"5m(E6-Q9)d4,\\" responded to my return to Eden post given above as follows:\\"The return to Eden is impossible. One cannot unlift the veil. The point is not to return to naivete and ignorance, but to experience oneness with God. Revelation 22:14 -\`Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city.' Those who desire to return to the garden will forever remain outside the walls of the city.\\"Here is my reply to \\"5m\\":Your post, in reply to an earlier post on Sep 29, 2012 5:53:25 AM PDTLast edited by you on Sep 29, 2012 10:29:32 AM PDTNova137 says:5m,I went to the basement yesterday morning before work to get a suitcase for my wife. She needs to pack in preparation of the arrival of our grandson (due tomorrow!).I found this book on my book shelf, \\"The Religion of Technology: The Divinity of man and the Spirit of Invention.\\"I began reading it yesterday. This morning I finished Chapter 1. Before that, while my wife was making coffee and, after getting the morning paper, I read your post. I began to respond and saved my draft response to Word (this post isn\`t that one!).We went upstairs to enjoy our coffee and read. Chapter 1 was just what I needed as it contains similar reflections about religion, technology and science that concern me.But, that isn't the point of this post. The point of this second reply to you comes from the content of Chapter 2 which directly reflects our present discussion!I will quote the whole of what I've read so far in Chapter 2, the latter part reflecting your quote of Revelations directly, the early part reflecting my post about the return to Eden:\\"While successive generations of monks dedicated themselves anew to the recovery of mankind's divinity, their pious efforts lacked any tangible record of cumulative accomplishment. With the identification of the advancement of the useful arts as a means toward that exalted end, however, their striving gained concrete expression, and hence enduring evidence of their progress toward perfection. The development of technology now gave some assurance that mankind was indeed on the road to recovery. Accordingly, technological invention was duly incorporated into biblical commentary and thus Christian history.\\"At the same time, beginning in the middle of the twelfth century, there emerged from within the monastic world a radically renewed millenarian conception of Christian history, a dynamic and teleological sense of time which would profoundly excite Christian expectation and accelerate the technological development that was now bound up with it. For Augustine, historical time, the tiresome and tearful tenure of fallen man, was homogeneous and unchanging; the resurrection of Christ was a sign of promise, to be sure, but history offered no other indication of movement toward a restoration of perfection. Only God knew the agenda, which was hidden from man; if any correlation existed between human events and divine purpose, it could never be known. The new millenarian mentality changed all this. An elite revitalization and reinterpretation of early Christian belief, it situated the process of recovery in the context of human history and redefined it as an active and conscious pursuit rather than a merely passive and blind expectation. Moreover, it broke the divine code about human destiny, about the true relationship between the temporal and the transcendent, thereby offering both evidence of past progress and guidance for the future. The recovery of mankind's divine likeness, the transcendent trajectory of Christianity, thus now became the same time an immanent historical project. As a result, the pursuit of renewed perfection--through myriad means which now included the advancement of the arts--gained coherence, confidence, a sense of mission, and momentum. This new historicized millenarianism was to have enormous and enduring influence upon the European psyche, and it encouraged as never before the ideological wedding of technology and transcendence. Technology now became at the same time eschatology.\\"The Christian notion of the millennium is based upon the prophecy of the Book of Revelation, the last book of the bible (known also as the Apocalypse of St. John), which was itself derived from ancient Hebrew prophecy. In his vision, John of Patmos fore-tells a thousand-year reign on earth of the returned Messiah, Christ, together with an elite corps of the saintly elect. In effect, this last book of the bible is a return to the first book, Genesis, only now with happy ending. Here the fate of the Fall is reversed, the curse is lifted, and a redeemed mankind is permitted to return to paradise, eat from the tree of life, and regain Adam's original perfection, immortality, and godliness.\\"\`Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works . . . To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God . . .\\"\`And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred and forty four thousand, having his Father's name written on their foreheads . . . . And they sung as it were a new song before the throne . . . . And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new . . .\\"\`And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that he is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son . . . .\\"\`And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life . . . . And there shall be no more curse . . . .\\"\`Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection . . . . They shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.'\\"Thank you, dear reader, for your patience. Now to the body of the review more properly:No work has shook me up like this one. It has made me take stock of my place in the pantheon of spiritual seekers, asking me to reduce myself and humble myself as never before. A work that does that, in my experience, is a work of the spirit made new again.The work begins by describing technologies evolution from the \\"mechanical arts,\\" and continues through the centuries, introducing one player after another, all seemingly falling under the same apocalyptic spell of achieving the same knowledge of the workings of nature (and, thus, the workings of the mind of God) that *must have existed in the Garden with Adam before the Fall of Man.*Here is a quote from the book, page 15:\\"The new view of the useful arts, as distinct, dignified, divinely inspired, and of value for salvation, was first fully articulated in the ninth century, in the work of the Carolingian philosopher Erigena. By this time, the increasing attention given to the various technical arts and crafts by medieval observers had culminated in the coining of a new generic term, the \\"mechanical arts,\\" to denote all of them collectively as a distinct category of human activity--the forerunner of the later terms \\"useful arts\\" and \\"technology.\\"From page 17:\\"The arts, Erigena wrote, are \`man's links with the Divine, their cultivation a means to salvation.'\\"Everyone in this book is in on this tie of the mechanical arts and its potential to take dominion over the earth. A picture is painted in such a way that the players all seem to be in on the idea. The author's religion of technology can be described as painting a picture of man's pursuit for technological innovation and understanding of the world as almost exclusively done by believers, of various cloths, and, more importantly, believers in what the author calls a \\"prelapsarian\\" knowledge of God. This term comes from millennianist thinkers throughout the ages (dating back to at least the 900's) whose sole goal is to: 1. Understand and subdue nature; 2. To, once again, think like Adam, prelapse (before the Fall).The author puts the locus of the beginning of this philosophy of paradise on earth at Joachim of Fiore, a 12th - 13th century \\"mystic, a theologian and an esoterist.\\" According to one site he was \\"the most important apocalyptic thinker of the whole medieval period, and maybe after the prophet John, the most important apocalyptic thinker in the history of Christianity.\\"He introduces character after character: St. Augustine, Hugh of St. Victor, Joachim of Fiore, Roger Bacon, Franciscans, Columbus, Agrippa, Durer, Francis Bacon, Rosicrucian's, Milton, Lewis Mumford, Boyle, Newton, Priestley, Faraday, Maxwell, Babbage, Franklin, Freemasonry,Let me introduce some of these characters to give, you, the potential buyer, a taste of what's in store should you decide to make a purchase today:Augustine and the BenedictinesIn the first chapter, entitled The Divine Likeness, the author introduces the fact that in the first Christian millennium, religion and technology were not viewed as compatible. A quote from St. Augustine's The City of God offers the evidence:\\"Quite apart from those supernatural arts of living in virtue and of reaching immortal beatitude which nothing but the grace of God which is in Christ can communicate to the sons of promise and heirs of the kingdom, there have been discovered and perfected, by the natural genius of man, innumerable arts and skills which minister not only to the necessities of life but also to human enjoyment...in saying this, of course, I am thinking only of the nature of the human mind as a glory of the mortal life, not of faith and the way of truth that leads to eternal life....\\"The Benedictines \\"eventually turned their religious devotion to the useful arts into a medieval industrial revolution...\\" By investing them with a spiritual significance, the Benedictines lent a new dignity to the useful arts...\\" \\"In monasticism especially, the Christian pursuit of this renovation of the image-likeness of man became a collective rather than a merely individual compulsion.\\" \\"If the spirit required the corporeal, in this new view, the corporeal was in turn spiritualized, and mater became linked with the transcendent.\\" Pages 14-15.Hugh of St. VictorIn Hugh of St. Victor, a devout Augustinian, we see an early transition from Augustianism (defined in this work as seeing technology only in man's fallen state, e.g., Hugh saw the making of clothing as the first act of the Fall, thus equating cloth making with it), turning toward the useful arts as a means of obtaining the restoration of perfection, mankind's divine likeness restored.Joachim of FioreIntroduced as he is considered the greatest apocalyptic in all of Christianity. He sets the standard of millenarianism that sets the vision for all future apocalyptical visionaries as his is \\"the founding prophet of this renewed expectation.\\" Page 24.Roger BaconA Franciscan who \\"inherited the new medieval view of technology a means of recovering mankind's original perfection, Bacon now placed it in the context of millenarian prophecy, prediction, and promise. If Bacon, following Erigena and Hugh of St. Victor, perceived the advance of the arts as a means of restoring humanity's lost divinity, he now saw it at the same time, following Joachim of Fiore, as a means of anticipating and preparing for the kingdom to come, and as a sure sign in and of itself that that kingdom was at hand.\\"\\"At the same time, Bacon believed, following the tradition of Erigena and Hugh of St. Victor, that the arts were the birthright of the \`sons of Adam,' that they had once been fully known while mankind still reflected the image of God, that they had been lost because of sin but had already been partially regained, and that they might yet be fully restored, a part of the recovery of original perfection, through diligent and devout effort.\\" Page 28.Franciscans & ColumbusBacon was a Franciscan. He promoted the useful arts directly for the purpose of restoring the divine image-likeness and \\"as preparation for the millenarian redemption of humanity.\\" Most Franciscans, however, promoted the useful arts indirectly in hopes of converting the rest of humanity over to Christianity. Here is the author in his own words: \\"If some Franciscans promoted the arts directly, like Bacon and his Catalan successors, most did so indirectly, through their primary evangelical mission, the conversion of all races to Christianity. According to biblical and Joachimite prophecy, particularly the book of Revelation, such worldwide conversion was a necessary precondition for, and unmistakable indication of, the coming of the millennium.\\" Page 29.The author notes at the bottom of page 29 that the need to convert the rest of the world led to the spirit of exploration, \\"including geography, astronomy, and navigation, as well as shipbuilding, metallurgy, and, of course, weaponry. \`The striving to fulfill prophecy on a cosmic or global scale was a major stimulus to travel and discovery, from the early Franciscan missions into Asia to Columbus' Enterprise of the Indies,' historian Pauline Moffitt Watts has noted.\\" Many more examples are given in support of this thesis of exploration, invention and conversion.This takes us to the end of Chapter 2! Whew! Quite a lot in just two chapters. Chapters 3-7 lead us to Part II. Part I is titled \\"Technology and Transcendence\\". The chapters of Part I are titled, The Divine Likeness; Millennium: The Promise of Perfection; Visions of Paradise; Paradise Restored; Heavenly virtuosi; The New Adam; The New Eden. These should tell the potential buyer much about the rest of the content of Part I.What of Part II? It is titled, \\"Technologies of Transcendence\\". The author relates the atom bomb, the space race, artificial intelligence and genetic engineering as the technologies of transcendence. Calling upon such a famous literary figure as Jules Vern and as notorious a socio-political-scientific figure as Werner Von Braun.The beginning of Part II, Chapter 8, entitled \\"Armageddon: Atomic Weapons introduces another Bacon, that of Francis Bacon. And on and on this work goes to cover the Rosicrucian's, Milton, Lewis Mumford, Boyle, Newton, Priestley, Faraday, Maxwell, Babbage, Franklin, Freemasonry, to NASA and the U.S. Government itself.I do not like the fact that a reference in this book can be tied to as many as 4 separate works (as it does in reference 42, page 193 and 5 separate works (as it does in reference 20, page 220). I feel (I don't know this) that the author is putting two and two together and sometimes getting 5. That is, he skews the content of the references into pointing to a religion of technology where none exists.Having said that, I can't prove my assertion either (I don't have the time). I suggest that you purchase this book today and come to your own conclusions.Make a purchase today."},{"Title":"The Religion of Technology: The Divinity of Man and the Spirit of Invention","review":"As some other reviewers have said, Noble crosses a vast expanse of history in this slim volume, and it seems that the intimidating density of information presented would have been less so if the historical sections had been more expansive and less list-like; overall the effect is rather rushed, even truncated--1000 years is a long time, and to cover it in about 300 pages is nigh on quixotic.This book is certainly interesting, and the portions on the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and the detailed history of Freemasonry, are especially strong, and his connection of the efforts of AI researchers to the ancient ideal of parthenogenesis is a lovely observation. But the final chapter and the conclusion are disappointing: they both collapse into the standard party line among postmodern critics that all but demonizes scientific inquiry and bemoans the ideology of dominance over nature while never proving why nature's subordination to man is in fact a bad thing. The conclusion is as such vague in the manner typical of such critiques--technoscience is of course the big bad wolf in the forest, but the contributions that technoscience has made to the lives of not only Westerners but many throughout the world are conspicuously ignored. His thesis suggests that if scientific motives were divorced from religious ideals then science would take a more practical, and less lofty, direction, but this seems to unfairly assume a level of uniformity among members of the scientific community that very well may not exist.I enjoyed this book and would read it again; however, it becomes frustrating to read treatise after treatise on technoscience that does little more in the end than rehash the typical postmodernist critique of scientific inquiry as little more than another one of the hegemonic patriarchal West's grand narratives."},{"Title":"The Religion of Technology: The Divinity of Man and the Spirit of Invention","review":"Amazing how I could use the title &quot;Religion of Technology&quot; and counter Noble's thesis. Key to understanding this book is to grasp the milieu in which Noble writes: he wishes to utilize historical critical methods in deconstructing the evolution of technology. Fascinating idea, and his ideas are intriguing; but he is misguided. The key problem lies in the Cartesian dichotomy of spirit vs. body.Noble argues that the spirt-man, through Christianity, emboldened western culture to utilize technology for salvation. One glaring defect in this argument is his inability to explain how Christianity departed from Augustine's view of man's sinfulness to Joachim's view that mankind could obtain perfection through his own efforts (technology). Unable to explain this, Noble's premise splutters on, lacking the foundation to prove his thesis that the spirit-man is behind technology. In reality, the body-man is the catalyst of technology.The body-man is best portrayed as Goethe in the 19th century. Herald of romanticism, Goethe wrote with ease and genius -- a true creative artist who seemed to instinctively acheive greatness. The cry of romanticists was &quot;get back to nature.&quot; Ironically, these body-people whose love of instinctiveness and the natural (Nature) fell into the trap of defining successful living as fulfilling 'bodily' desires. The delicious irony is that right around this era of romantacism western society underwent its captilistic industrial revolution. Fastforward to the neo-romantic movement of the 1960s. Here we have free love, drugs, etc. true body-orientation. Interesting how the decade of greed (80s) came around from these same '68ers'. Further, these 68ers created the capital to usher in an intense period of technological growth (contrast this to the earlier generation supporting NASA, and how bored we are with what NASA does now compared to Sony Playstation 2).Approaching the excessively long-winded, I will conclude with this: the body, not the spirit, is behind technology's latest thrust (19th-21st century). Unfortunately, Mr. Noble could not step out of the 'modern' condition to grasp the greater reality behind technology. We've believed the myth of the jock (body) vs. nerd (spirit), thinking this is reality. Harmonizing body with spirit, something which hasn't been done since Descartes, will provide the proper understanding of technology. I'm still waiting for a great book on technology."},{"Title":"The Religion of Technology: The Divinity of Man and the Spirit of Invention","review":"God's words finally revealed for those who are called"},{"Title":"Successful Flea Market Selling","review":"Too bad this is no longer available.

Its companion book, by the same author, covers the history of Chinese Art to 1620. The third book in the series has not been published yet (2010 update: it is out now).The text uses pinyin transliteration throughout, a big plus since this is what is used in mainland China today; for example, it makes things easier if you plan to travel to see some of the objects described.The shortcomings, however, are significant. First of all, the location of the objects illustrated is not always stated, nor is this information provided in a separate list. Second, the style of the writer is appaling! Sentences are so twisted, they sound like a machine translation from Chinese! I had to read sentences twice or three times to figure out their meaning. The editors of the series should really have invested a lot more in revising the language for clarity.Last, the book does not seem to pay much attention to the implications of recent archaelogical discoveries.I would suggest Michael Sullivan's \\"The Arts of China\\" to the non-specialist looking for an introduction; the volume in the Oxford History of Art series seems very good too."},{"Title":"Trouble in July","review":"Sheriff McCurtain has a problem. It appears that a negro boy has been accused of raping a white gal. White folk in Flowery Branch can't allow that to happen and so a lynch mob forms. In times of crisis such as this the sheriff does what is politically correct; he goes fishing. This time McCurtain finds himself the fish on the hook who just can't get away no matter how hard he tries.In this masterful piece of literature, Erskine Caldwell unravels before our eyes the pathology and terrorism of lynching in the south. No one could do a better job for Caldwell is a white southerner who grew up in an environment in which lynching was a common form of entertainment. Trouble in July goes deep into the psychology of what makes common white men into brutes and those who work for them into victims.Like many men McCurtain finds it easier to ignore what is going on rather than try to contain the trouble. The more that he tries to wash his hands of the affair the worse it gets. Those in power see the political and economical ramifications of the act and call on him to jail the accused. After all,McCurtain is their political puppet to be manipulated at will.Such an intriguing drama exposes the hypocrasy of the law and shows how fear can make even the most honest of men betray their basic values of justice. Fear reduces the \\"negro\\" community into one that becomes terrorized and beaten into submission. Fear allows the upholder of the law to allow things to get out of hand merely because he wants to be voted into office next year.Although the characters are simple; their motives, thoughts and values are complex as they struggle with their consciences in carrying out their heinous acts of cowardliness. You have laid out before you the ugliness of a system that dehumanizes everyone involved. The foreward by Bryant Simon in this edition gives us the background which gave rise to this novel. According to Simon, the author has made a significant transition in his work by revealing the south's racism in a straightforward manner. He doesn't hold back the punches.Caldwell has given us a masterpiece about American Terrorism at its zenith in the United States. You will be repulsed, angered, and yes, fearful as you follow the crowd. Our author won't let us become mere voyeurs. We become the lynch mob, the negroes, the soiled politicians and all that is sick in southern terrorism. Read this outstanding work, feel the terror and learn about overcoming the mob psychology in your life. I was deeply moved by Trouble In July and you will too."},{"Title":"Trouble in July","review":"Written after the enormous successes of 'Tobacco Road' (1932) and 'God's Little Acre' (1933) and the critical and popular failure of 'Journeyman' (1935), Erskine Caldwell's 'Trouble In July' (1940) is an earnest but listless novel which addresses the lynching of Negroes in the Deep South. Taking place during the period in which it was written, the novel is neither a black comedy burlesque like 'Tobacco Road' nor an example of the more private, pseudo-surrealist fiction Caldwell produced with 'Journeyman' or some of his many short stories of the era.Instead, 'Trouble in July' attempts and fails to achieve a finely poised balance between realistic fiction and a kind of Keystone Cops comedy. But pointed exaggeration at every level was Caldwell's forte, and the novel, which was written with difficulty over a period of several years, is redundant, flat, predictable, and anticlimactic, despite the piling up of several reoccurring cinematic plot devices, such as the worst possible person walking in the door or phoning at the absolute worst time.In Chapter Six, heavily put-upon sheriff and protagonist Jeff McCurtain conceives a plan to escape his duties by inventing a threatening posse of masked bandits, only to find himself held at gunpoint by an identical gang in reality.'Trouble In July' features several politicians who are only concerned that the lynching, which they see as inevitable and acceptable as long as it reflects \\"the will of the people,\\" not turn public opinion against them, a sheriff's deputy whose great joy in life is \\"hunting possums between midnight and dawn and tracking down runaway Negroes at every opportunity,\\" vigilante gangs for whom the routine killing of blacks is the umbrella answer to most of life's problems, a religious zealot who is outraged that bibles depicting Christ as a black man are circulating in the Negro community, a signature-gathering campaign to \\"send all the Negroes to the country of Africa without delay,\\" a black character, the object of the lynching, who is little more than a wide-and-wild eyed caricature, and, among other Caldwell stock characters, a fifteen year-old uneducated white girl with an inordinate appetite for sex and attention.'God's Little Acre' used a similar formula, but that novel, Caldwell's best, was fraught with tension and conflict, and, as a result, contains one of the most suspenseful and poignant climaxes in all of American literature. Perhaps due to the seriousness of its subject, Caldwell's creative exposition in 'Trouble in July' is cautious to the point of being half-hearted, and as a result, the novel, which is never quite believable on any level, creeps and crawls tentatively towards its conclusion rather than galloping confidently ahead."},{"Title":"Trouble in July","review":"Sheriff Jeff seems to not have a mind of his own. His only thinking was to keep his position and politics. Author did attempt to show small kinder side to him. The rest of the characters in the book were lunatics but descriptions were great. At times I became so angry I thought I may have to stop reading this book. I did continue on. It many be a fiction story but this really did happen. I have always been intrested in this time period and thought I would have liked to live then. I don't think I would have made it long. I would have been shot for fighting for human rights. What is a political lynching!!! This is the second I have read by this author. I think all the many authors I have been introduced to through my kindle. I never would have chanced buying them or even finding them in our small town library in Northeast Pa. I love it.

The tragedy of Southern race relations after Emancipation is allegorized in the lynching of a young black man for the rape of a white sharecropper's daughter.The closest thing to a main character is the Sheriff of the county, Jeff McCurtain. McCurtain is convinced to \\"keep the lynching politically clean.\\" Representing the political powers of the inter War South, McCurtain is afraid to stand up to the people in the name of the law. As he tries to avoid contact with the lynch mob, he also seeks out a Black man who he considers \\"harmless\\" and therefore shouldn't be mixed up in the whole lynching.Characters represent the three commonly thought views of Black Americans held by Southern whites at the time. The rich landowner wants the sheriff to catch the suspected racist, so as life can get back to normal and other blacks will keep working his plantation. The catalyst of the incident, a politically involved woman who may be sleeping with the pastor, is circulating a petition that all blacks should be rounded up and sent back to Africa. Yet the third is a man in the mob who is against the petition:\\"The best way is just like I said. String one of them up ever so often. That'll make all of them keep their place. Hell, if there wasn't no more niggers in the country I'd feel lost without them. Besides, who'd do all the work if the niggers were sent away?\\"Caldwell appears to have his finger on the pulse of white social-economic view of black Southerners. Like the helots and the Spartans, the backward stagnant economic system of the interwar South is based on white Southerners keeping black Southerners in virtual economic servitude.\\"Trouble in July\\" is the most real of Caldwell's novels in his \\"cyclorama\\" that I have read yet. The allegory is not too far from the tree as the almost surreal characters in \\"Tobacco Road\\" and \\"God's Little Acre.\\" However, it does not have the full emersion in the world of the sand hills that the other two have. One almost expects the end where McCurtain begins to question his own actions during the story.All in all I find it not a great work. Its subject matter is more important to the modern reader than some of Caldwell's other works as he like Ida B. Wells, throws the Southern view of civilization upon its head. Additionally, it reminds us why the words of people like Kelly Tilghman, the Golf channel anchor, and Bill O'Reilly (declaring he would lynch Michelle Obama if there was evidence) are so dangerous. People are quick to join mobs and the law is slow to challenge what seems the will of the people even if it is against the very things we stand for."},{"Title":"lily and miss liberty","review":"I have to read 40 books for my Children's Lit class and my daughter had this book in her room, so I thought what the heck.

Jackie was a tall (6'2\\") charismatic writer and performer built like a linebacker whose crazy antics and complex drag persona transcended even the insanity of the Warhol crowd. She was a drag queen whose couture consisted mostly of shredded gowns, wigs sprayed with Raid, and a noticeable five o'clock shadow. She wrote camp-drenched plays with titles like Glamour, Glory, and Gold and Vain Victory: Vicissitudes of the Damned that garnered good reviews even from the New York Times. She shot amphetamine and heroin, blew firemen in New York's back alleys in exchange for cigarettes, and alternately enchanted and terrorized friends and acquaintances with her demented diva routines that included \\"rearranging\\" (trashing) their apartments and drinking all their wine. She's probably best remembered today as the most sophisticated member of that holy trinity of Warhol trannies featured in the 1971 Paul Morrissey film Women in Revolt. (The others were glamorous Candy Darling, who died of leukemia at 25, and snaggle-toothed queen Holly Woodlawn, last seen prancing through West Hollywood.)Author and filmmaker Craig Highberger knew Curtis very well in her heyday and has cobbled together an intriguing biography entirely from interviews with her friends. Superstar in a Housedress, which comes bundled with a DVD of Highberger's excellent film of the same name, is a breezy, often hilarious look at a uniquely uncategorizable personality and the New York homo-art underground typified by the wacky Warholians of the 1960s and \`70s.Curtis, as she was usually called, was raised mostly by her granny, Slugger Annie, a bar owner who liked to \\"wear\\" seven yapping Chihuahuas in her cleavage. Curtis did her best to top that. According to witnesses like Penny Arcade and Lily Tomlin, she staged endless, very public weddings with grooms who might or might not appear. She faked suicides to friends who dutifully donned mourning veils even though they knew she was just dramatizing. Typically, she'd appear at a fundraiser for the Kidney Foundation and start screaming things like \\"Eddie, my kidneys are killing me!\\"Curtis's flirtations with fame are well documented here - friendships with Tomlin and Harvey Fierstein, writing a play that would be Robert De Niro's first stage appearance, guest-starring on the sitcom Rhoda. But she never quite rose to the status of household word, which seemed to bother her less and less as she drifted into amphetamine-fueled fits and heroin fogs. Her actual death in 1985 at age 38 was almost anticlimactic, but Superstar in a Housedress, a phrase she used about herself, will make some readers (not all!) wish she were still here to liven things up."},{"Title":"Superstar in a Housedress: The Life and Legend of Jackie Curtis","review":"That's a quote used in the movie. And now one of my top 3 favorite quotes to be used forever after.There was so much to like about this person and movie. Jackie was a phenomenal character. She/he was iconic in the strongest sense of the word. Total belief in herself and her plan (mad though it was at times) and such charisma that all around her believed in her and themselves as much as she did. She altered paradigms.This particular subculture fascinates me to no end and it is covered well in this DVD. It's classic David and Goliath except David's gotta push it by wearing a dress. I couldn't respect that in-your-faceness more if I tried. I wish I could better convey what I mean. And it's not a movie about sexual preferences. No agenda is forced on you in any way. It's just completely unique.The fact that this is a documentary and these things really happened and these people really did exist as they did, simply adds to the magic of this movie. Of course, many of those people are still with us and told their tales within. And most of them are extremely interesting as well. It covers more than just Jackie. The world Jackie became famous in is explored in depth as well.Just as a comparison, it is like the Grateful Dead shows. Nothing like this will ever happen in this way ever again - nothing this new, different, odd, and perfect just for what it was, and it's tragic if you think you may have wanted to be part of it in some way, witness it, but didn't. And if you did, you're breathing the rare air."},{"Title":"Superstar in a Housedress: The Life and Legend of Jackie Curtis","review":"Today we take gay, lesbian and transgender people for granted. What we don't realize is that in the late 60's and 70's when people were focused on Vietnam that it was truly revolutionary for someone to throw all care about gender perception to the wind, go out into the world and be oneself. But Jackie Curtis was a groundbreaking performer who changed the world the same way Andy Warhol changed art. It is easy to understand why they were soul mates."},{"Title":"Superstar in a Housedress: The Life and Legend of Jackie Curtis","review":"Yes fierce, fearless and fabulous! The dvd? What a buy!Go back to that Warhol era in New York. Just wish I could have seen it with my own eyes. This book and dvd just about does that! I fell over with Jackie C............."},{"Title":"Superstar in a Housedress: The Life and Legend of Jackie Curtis","review":"Who is Jackie Curtis? The question is not a simple one, not even to Curtis, an artist who used his own personality and body as an artistic media, reinventing them so often that it became extremely difficult to know exactly who, if indeed any one, existed under the various guises and facades.In a factual sense, Jackie Curtis was John Curtis Holder Jr. (1947-1985.) Raised in a tough area of New York, his father was a sailor, his mother a b-girl, and his grandmother a somewhat notorious bar-owner. Although there is no certainty, it seems very likely that he suffered from several mental issues, most particularly ADD and bi-polar syndrome; whatever the case, he fueled his personality with a mixture of drugs and alcohol and somehow managed to crack the Andy Warhol circle. Warhol had a knack for surrounding himself with extreme personalities, and the hot-house atmosphere suited Holder: in a burst of creativity, he assumed the persona of Jackie Curtis, poet, playwright, singer, actor, and drag queen from absolute hell.SUPERSTAR IN A HOUSEDRESS, a combination of book and DVD, is Craig Highberger's attempt to peel back the various layers of Holder's personality both as a human being and an artist. What he finds is often very unattractive, for both Holder's art and life are reflective of a remarkably extreme lifestyle: the simple truth is that Holder scraped along on a mixture of personal charm, theft, and what might be called disposable sex, never terribly concerned about the damage he caused to others, much less to himself, and prompting a mixture of outrage, pity, and amusement at almost every turn. But while he broke up the contents of friends' homes, he also broke up notions about what art could be. I don't use the comparison lightly, and I do not believe Holder possessed the same degree of talent, but in many respects he calls to mind the French poet Arthur Rimbaud, whose extreme gifts and behavior provoked similar reactions in Europe in the late 1800s.Curiously, the only way to obtain the documentary on DVD is by purchasing the companion book. Both are quite fine--Highberger knows his subject and is remarkably successful in arranging interviews and comments to create a thorough and in-depth overview--but of the two it is really the DVD you want; the book is essentially a supplement. Recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Superstar in a Housedress: The Life and Legend of Jackie Curtis","review":"If, like me, you ran across the book 'Superstar in a Housedress' while looking for the documentary of the same name, it may have taken you a few minutes to figure out that buying the book is, apparently, the only way to get the DVD.Yes, this is the full, ninety-plus minute release of the DVD available for rent from Netflix and other rental venues. How the choice was made to market the film as a \\"companion piece\\" to the book, without (as far as I can tell) releasing it as a stand-alone purchase, I dunno. I hope it will be released separately in the future, since the current marketing format, I'd think, would tend to lessen its circulation to a wider audience.Not that there's anything wrong with the book: it's a compendium of reminiscences by people who were close to Jackie. Some of the material repeats what's in the film, and some fills in gaps in backstory that 90 minutes can't provide, such as details on the life and death of the remarkable (and remarkably messed-up) Andrea Feldman. Still, a nice chunky paperback book of commentary in a boxed DVD set might have been a better way to sell the package, which is truly a good one. It's just that the DVD overrides the book in its excellence. There's no good reason why the book needed to be published in hardcover; it's really liner notes for the DVD.And then there's the strange, spooky, *sealed* envelope that the DVD itself comes in. Glued furtively into the back of the book, there's a lengthy disclaimer proclaiming in no uncertain terms that you MUST NOT OPEN THE PACKAGE (\\"Simply return the sealed package.\\") if you think that the DVD might in any number of (enumerated) ways ruin your life. Talk about user-friendly!But the good news is -- once you get over the fear, and open the potentially-deadly \\"package\\", you find that after all it's just an ordinary DVD, and a great one, at that. Densely packed with interviews, historical stills, film clips, and even a fair amount of very early videotape, this documentary is a detailed and very loving portrait of one of the most defiant gender-bending artists in the history of gender-bending and the stage itself.The past several years have seen the release of the Paul Morrisey/Andy Warhol films on DVD, and that's brought these previously hard-to-get-at movies to a new audience. This in turn has increased curiosity about the Warhol scene in the 60's, 70's, and later; and that period is increasingly interesting, as civilization lurches inexorably (or so it seems) toward a dessicated, triple-filtered, don't-drink, don't-smoke cultural puritanism.What was going on in New York in the 50's, 60's, and 70's transformed the American culture. A whole lot of the sexual freedom that we have today, whether it's embraced or bemoaned by whatever faction, comes from the crazy explosion that was the 60's and 70's. There's no shortage of information on the cultural revolution that happened then, but there's also no end to what can be added to it. This story about Jackie Curtis is no small addition.As a smart kid escaping the wilds of Connecticut who started hustling the streets in NY at 16, I knew a number of the people in this film peripherally, and for the most part they were the people who informed my perception of what life was all about. There was a communality, and a total lack of hierarchy (but for a few bitchfests) and everyone was welcome; I think, in retrospect, that this was what the hippieness of the 60's led to: a kind of a hybrid of the rejection of popular culture with the co-opting of it. At the time, the most visible manifestation of pre-packaged pop culture that could be harvested was the Hollywood star system of the 30's and 40's. Jackie Curtis was hip to this, but also added a Dada-style twist to it. Warhol became the catalyst, but what 'Superstar in a Housedress' demonstrates is that he couldn't have done the things that he (or rather, Paul Morrisey, working under his aegis) did without girls like Jackie, Candy Darling, or Holly Woodlawn (whom, I have to say, is looking absolutely GREAT in this doc, and QUITE the polished lady.)This is an absolutely essential documentary for those interested in the period, its quirks, and its consequences. But moreso, it's a great tribute to the unbridled, mad creativity of Jackie Curtis, who should never be forgotten. Hopefully, this DVD (and its companion piece, the book) will help assure that.Also -- at the time of this writing, the book and DVD are pretty consistently available from housing_works_bookstore @ Amazon at a cheap price. Housing Works supports homeless people affected by HIV/AIDS in New York City, so purchasing from them is a win-win thing. They got my order to me very quickly and in perfect condition, so what could I do? I ordered another one from them right away. Somebody's getting it for Christmas. Don't know who yet. Somebody who will have been REAL good this year!Seriously, though -- if you're interested in the history of the NY art scene in the period, this is very much worth buying."},{"Title":"Superstar in a Housedress: The Life and Legend of Jackie Curtis","review":"A fascinating remembrance of a unique artist who could seemingly change sex on a whim. Andy Warhol's quote early in the film: \\"Jackie Curtis is not a drag queen. Jackie Curtis is an artist , a pioneer without a frontier.\\" says it best.Recalls the Warhol era in New York City which saw wide artistic experimentation in art, underground theater, and experimental film. The film includes archival film and video shot in the late sixties and early seventies and hundreds of photographs. Most interesting is the look inside the apartments of about two dozen interviewees in New York and Hollywood, including surviving superstars Holly Woodlawn and Joe Dallesandro, many obscure artists and famous people like Lily Tomlin and Harvey Fierstein.The book has a lot of material not in the film including scenes from all of Curtis's plays, and interviews with many more colleages and friends of Curtis.

Thank you Mr. Highberger for providing a most interesting and sincere look into Jackie Curtis.The format was so nice, to hear from so many people who were close to this incredible person really gave me a better idea of who Jackie was and how she lived. I have had the opportunity, as a transsexual entertainer, to travel the country and meet many transgendered performers. They obviously do not get the press or opportunity they deserve. This book is a fitting tribute to a person who helped shape todays theater and bring attention to gender expression.Jackie was obviously a genius who in many ways helped to shape the character of what we know Broadway play to be, and from the off off Broadway level. He/she lived the street life and was a very real person, on a real level facing the challenges life on that level brings regardless of the day to day persona she would take on.The book/CD focuses on commentary from her friends and aqauintences and whether from a gay/trans or straight perspective, Jackie Curtis was the epitome of living life as one's own self and creating from the most sincere inner feelings in the face of great odds. Many exerpts of her plays, notes and writings are included to give the reader a more intimate view of Jackie and the person within the personna, whether that be Jackie, James Dean or some other form of self expression.Obviously she can be an inspiration to those who strive for individuality and to leave a positive mark through their works regardless of her tragic finality.I would highly recommend viewing this documentary and reading the book as well for anyone interested in life, humor, love, tragedy and the very real Star that Jackie Curtis was."},{"Title":"Superstar in a Housedress: The Life and Legend of Jackie Curtis","review":"Into the pantheon of well-documented overtly demented gay lives goes that of Jackie Curtis, thanks to the adept and thorough Craig Highberger.

Analysis of the program's content focuses on that perspective to the exclusion of all others, and detailed examination of the original scripts is confined primarily to the first two years of &quot;Amos 'n' Andy.&quot;Ely therefore fails to discuss in any detail the evolution of the characters and their relationships beyond 1929 -- and this is perhaps the book's greatest flaw, given that the characterizations and the dramatic sophistication of the program evolved substantially between 1929 and the mid-1930s It's unfortunate that Ely shortchanges this period of the program's history, as it in fact coincided with the peak of the program's popularity, and in my view an understanding of the evolution of the characters during the 1929-35 period is essential to an understanding of the series' appeal. (I have, in fact, read all of the scripts for the first decade of the series as part of my own research into &quot;Amos 'n' Andy's&quot; history.)While Ely occasionally draws conclusions regarding the program's content that are contradicted by a detailed reading of the original 1930s scripts, and sometimes tends to over-interpret in his examination of public reaction to the program, in general his account is balanced and thoughtful, and his research into the African-American response to &quot;Amos 'n' Andy&quot; presents the definitive study of this aspect of the series.Ely also deserves much praise for avoiding the self-indulgent deconstructionist jargon which tends to dominate current academic studies of popular culture -- his book is a rare example of an academic work which is both scholarly and extremely well-written. I'm very pleased to see the book is back in print."},{"Title":"Adventures of Amos 'N' Andy: A Social History of an American Phenomenon","review":"There are few phrases in the English language as divisive as &quot;Amos 'n' Andy.&quot; It is frequently a euphamism for humor at its most racist and simplistic. Yet could a program based on little more than a handful of stereotypes be able to thrive on radio for more than 30 years? This book answers that question by putting &quot;Amos 'n' Andy&quot; into perspective, through the evolution of the program, its roots in the minstrel shows, and its context within its own time. Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll, the white creators of the program, are portrayed quite fairly in this book, and their motives are also presented in a fair way. Their goal was not to offend, though inevitably they did, but rather to entertain. This book shows how the core characters were portrayed in their own circle, the mythical Mystic Knights of the Sea lodge, and how they were portrayed beyond that inner circle, as the characters would intermingle with other blacks, and also whites. Also worth reading is the efforts by the Pittsburgh Courier and a few other black newspapers to boycott the show as early as 1931. More interesting, is how those attempts stalled, only to regain momentum 20 years later, with the advent of the television version. The phenomenon of &quot;Amos 'n' Andy&quot; is more complex than it would seem, as it tells us more about American society and racial relations than perhaps any othe program ever. This book is not just about &quot;Amos 'n' Andy,&quot; but rather about ourselves. And for that, it should be a must-read. I was able to finish this book in two days it was so engrossing."},{"Title":"Adventures of Amos 'N' Andy: A Social History of an American Phenomenon","review":"History, well-researched and engagingly written, is as fascinating as the greatest fiction, if not more so. Melvin Ely combines a professor's concern for factualness with thorough, ground-breaking research and a novelist's way with narrative into an unfailingly entertaining work that is also of great and lasting academic, social and cultural importance. Ely has delivered a fascinating show business yarn with absorbing insight into human nature, sometimes noble, often naive, and occasionally downright repugnant. While not afraid to add an edge of attitude or a clear point of view when he chooses, the author still eschews easy answers and the predictable pedantics and prejudice of an ideologue of any political persuasion. With subtle surety, and never a trace of condescension, Ely ultimately shows us ourselves--good, bad and ugly--in an absorbing saga of American life and culture."},{"Title":"Adventures of Amos 'N' Andy: A Social History of an American Phenomenon","review":"Writing about race, specifically about the black race, in American entertainment is a dicey business--at best.Then, not unlike a latter-day Alexis de Tocqueville or even Gunnar Myrdal, along comes Melvin Patrick Ely. Mr. Ely has written a well researched, passionately dispassionate analysis of the origins of the entertainment industry's racial miasma.He takes us back to minstrelsy; on to the advent of radio before networks; then into the networks' formative years when an iconic show ruled the ether: &quot;Amos'n'Andy&quot;. He informs us that even in 1930 blacks vigorously, if ineffectually, protested the show.Mr. Ely has deconstructed more than a few of the racial myths that even today swirl around the &quot;Amos 'n' Andy&quot; radio program. He has eloquently put into context the television episodes and the NAACP's reaction to them.He is objective and he is clear. Be forewarned, however, that this is not a coffee table book. It is written at 2nd to 3rd year undergraduate level, ie the book is not unlike a history text book, and all that that implies.But it is, above all, lucid. And highly recommended."},{"Title":"Adventures of Amos 'N' Andy: A Social History of an American Phenomenon","review":"At a basic level, this book is a detailed, well-researched history of America's longest running (1929-1960 on both radio and television) comedy show. Ely does a fine job of describing the factors that led to the show's great popularity and the successful efforts of its creators, Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll, to maintain that popularity.At a more sophisticated level, however, the book provides an intimate view of one of the great political events of this century, the American Civil Rights movement. Because Amos \`N Andy was the only nationally popular series prior to 1960 featuring black characters, and because its creators and principal actors were both white, the show repeatedly drew both praise and criticism from the press and various organizations seeking to promote their own political agendas.Ely describes in detail how Gosden and Correll went to great lengths to keep the show from being viewed as racist, yet in the long run they failed. As he points out,! that failure may have caused the major networks to shy away from shows featuring black performers and delay their introduction into television for another 20 years.Having listened to Amos \`N Andy on the radio as a child and subsequently watched it on TV, I like many other white Americans, was dumbfounded when the NAACP decided to attack it for being racist. For me at least, Gosden and Correll succeeded in their objective of establishing their characters as human types, not racial types. Sapphire was the spitting image of my best friend's mother, and Algonquin J. Calhoun came to typify every crooked lawyer (Is that redundant?) I later had the misfortune to meet.Unfortunately, Ely touches only peripherally on the black sitcoms of the 80s and 90s (e.g., \\"The Jeffersons\\" and \\"In Living Color\\") which I (and many other Americans) personally found to be racist.Despite dealing with a highly emotional topic, Ely has produced a lucid, objective and thought-provoking work! . His shortcomings consist of his failure to take into consideration the effects of the other great events of the period (the Great Depression, World War II, etc.) and his seeming assumption that all Americans cared about the Civil Rights movement. In fact, I think that more people (both black and white) cared more about putting food on the table and raising their families well."},{"Title":"Adventures of Amos 'N' Andy: A Social History of an American Phenomenon","review":"...is the lead sentence from Melvin Patrick Ely's Personal Postscript of his social history of this truly unique American entertainment phenomenon. I grew up at the same time as Ely, and this TV show was part of my upbringing, when I was the ages of 7 through 10. I don't particularly think that it shaped some things in me for the rest of my life, but it was such an anomaly, and perhaps just that one fact stayed with me throughout. Black people were simply not part of my existence. I grew up in an all white suburb of Pittsburgh. It was a middle class existence, without servants or maids and certainly not au pairs. Blacks weren't in the schools. There were in \\"downtown,\\" but that was far away, an adventure, rarely visited at that age. They weren't on TV, not as sports announcers nor in beverage ads. There was just this one show, and it was only composed of Blacks, and like so many others of my age, that is how we learned \\"what these people were like,\\" adopting like many others, the exaggerated expressions of the Kingfisher. You are simply too young to ask why they are not in other places; this is your only window into that world.So Ely has done a tremendous service to an age group raised on this entertainment phenomenon. Furthermore, he managed to address the many politically charged and controversial aspects of this show in a dispassionate and objective manner. As he says in the postscript, this \\"...for years has been hidden from view for fear that a second look will inflame emotions and upset our comfortable view of ourselves.\\"Among the many surprises in this history was that the show started out in radio, and it was two whites, Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll who played the parts of the Blacks, and earned the remarkable sum of $100,000 per year during the Depression. These two actors had their origins in the vaudeville era, wearing makeup of cork-black in a racist caricature that featured Jim Crow. For thirty-five years the show provided that window into what purported to be black life and personality. When the show went on TV in the early \`50's, the whites were replaced by real-life blacks (imagine that!) and Amos was played by Alvin Childress and Andy was played by Spencer Williams Jr. Nonetheless, the show was dogged from the beginning with charges of racism, and unbeknownst to me, the leader of these charges was the Pittsburgh Courier newspaper, starting from 1931. Eventually it was swept away, by a consensus that reached across the political spectrum, and the show \\"...became the ultimate metaphor of whites' casual contempt for blacks, its very name a synonym for mindless prejudice.\\" In the campaign against the show, the future Supreme Court Justice, Thurgood Marshall, when he was Special Counsel for the NAACP, said that \\"...we should stick to our guns that Amos N Andy and everything like has to go...\\"Ely provides a careful and thoughtful analysis of the characters, and certainly for the time, it belied much of the charges of racism, though there were some overt stereotypes. It took until the mid-80's for a real \\"replacement\\" show to come along: The Cosby Show! The author discusses the efforts in show planning to avoid similar charges, and this included a portrait of Frederick Douglass in one of the teenage daughter's bedrooms, while another daughter wanted to go to Paris, in part, because that is where Richard Wright and James Baldwin had gone.For those of us of a certain age, this is an excellent, balanced, informative, insightful 5-star read on a slice of our American cultural heritage."},{"Title":"Adventures of Amos 'N' Andy: A Social History of an American Phenomenon","review":"This book provides a great, well written, social study of a forgotten slice of american history. Although the book over-emphasizes certian things, and leaves out or under-emphasizes other things, this book was an enjoyable summer read."},{"Title":"Cracking the SAT II: English, 1999-2000 Edition","review":"I used the Princeton Review book to help me review for the SAT II: Writing and SAT II: Literature. Overall, I thought that the PR made sure to get all bases covered for the SAT II: Writing, which is basically grammar. The review was not bad at all, and allowed me to point out pretty much all the types of grammatical errors presented in the Writing exam. However, I felt that the author was rather frugal in giving the readers enough exercises, and found myself reviewing the same exercises over and over again to learn a certain aspect of grammar (typically, for one type of mistake you'd only have ONE exercise). I found myself going online, reviewing resources from the PSAT Writing section, etc. etc. Basically, you cannot use the book by itself--you probably need some supplements, some of which just take some time to find online or elsewhere (collegeboard.com, and I'm sure there are a lot of resources on the internet for grammar rules). Nonetheless, I made the very best I could of the book and was able to manage an 800. And yes, the PR is KNOWN for being extremely gimmicky in their techniques--take it with a grain of salt, because the author practically imbues the book with these so called ingenious techniques.As for the Literature section, don't even look at it in this book. The whole review basically consists of looking at a few passages and answering very basic questions on theme, voice, tone, literary devices, etc. To be quite honest, the Literature test is extremely demanding and I'm sure that doing the PR's exercise failed to help me one bit. In order to be thoroughly prepared, one should be a strong English student overall..."},{"Title":"Cracking the SAT II: English, 1999-2000 Edition","review":"TPR has once again defended its impeccable reputation. It has created a great book with the most review in the shortest amount. Not only does it teach you the grammar you need to know, but it teaches you how to deduce the answers. Plus, it includes the Literature section. Its much better than any of the other review books: Barrons, Kaplan, and Arco. However, I have noticed one error in the tests, but otherwise, it is good. P.S. Despite its review on the back, it lacks the explanations to the answers."},{"Title":"Cracking the SAT II: English, 1999-2000 Edition","review":"I am sorry, but I have serious objections to the Princeton Review manner of creating study guides. While some attention is given to actually reviewing the material that is on the test, much information is dismissed as unlikey to appear on the test and therefore unnecessary to remember. Princeton Review bets on statistics of what material is most often tested when deciding what it will teach you.Likewise, and more importantly, the Princeton Review encourages students of its book to rely on chance and statistics in regards to guessing multiple choice answers. Princeton Review teaches the students the techniques that are most likely to help them and, on the side, teaches the material that is most likely to be essential. Well, that which is most likely is not the case 100% of the time. While some suggest that tests are so unlikely to have three questions in a row with the same answer that a student should be overly skeptical if he or she finds his or her self marking three questions in a row with &quot;B&quot;, the fact is that I have taken many tests and many times have I had the same answer for four or even five questions in a row. I got these questions right because I did not doubt my answers based on some test-taking techniques I picked up in the Princeton review but because I had learned enough of the material to be confident.The English AP book is slightly better than other Princeton Review study guides in the amount of actual material it presents to you, largely because of its helpfully organized vocabulary section. Still, the book is not enough to prepare fully for these tests. Since the book does include information and practice test for bothe the Language and Literature tests, it is a reasonable value for the money and deserves a slightly higher rating than a book with comparable quality but only one test covered might."},{"Title":"Cracking the SAT II: English, 1999-2000 Edition","review":"This book is detailed and gives the necessary info do to well on the SAT II subject test.

It offers almost no new information, and its selection of practice tests can at best be labeled poor. Basically, Princeton chose the tests that it felt reflected the points illustrated in its book, but in doing so did not cover the full spectrum of information needed to ace the SAT II exam. I would not reccomend buying this book, even in conjunction with another. It is just not worth it."},{"Title":"Cracking the SAT II: English, 1999-2000 Edition","review":"This book allows you to get a good general grasp for the sat II writing.

I have been reading Furst's excellent literary novels of espionage and I was curious to read works by other authors he recommends. Furst is often compared to Eric Ambler and Graham Greene, whom I've read. But what would Furst himself select? &quot;A Coffin for Demetrios&quot; is the first selection and there's one from &quot;The Quiet American&quot; by Graham Greene, but many of the other selections are unexpected and riveting. The only one I had read was the Ambler. I ran out and bought &quot;The Quiet American,&quot; but I'm also going to read &quot;Tremor of Intent&quot; by Anthony Burgess, &quot;Under Western Eyes&quot; by Joseph Conrad, &quot;Ashenden&quot; by W. Somerset Maugham (probably the most intriguing selection in the entire anthology), and &quot;The Tears of Autumn&quot; by Charles McCarry. In his introduction Furst notes that the date of publication is important for each selection because they are essentially political novels, tied to and shaped by a particular place and time. I was struck by the variety among these selections and although I had my favorites, I was sorry when each ended. The anthology is not a substitute for the full-length novels, but rather provides an overview of the genre and serves a guide for further reading."},{"Title":"Book Of Spies: An Anthology Of Literary Espionage","review":"This is a collection of excerpts from novels by 11 different authors. Contrary to the title, they are not all about spies. Some are about revolutionaries, at least one about wartime resistance, and one is about two men stranded on a road at night in Vietnam. The point in time is not always clear. The stories are in no particular order by chronology or subject, but are simply in alphabetic order by the authors' last names. The writing quality is mixed and some are skimable. Some seem to have too much background color and not enough story. I think the collection could have been much better considering the literature available.

However, since childhood I have been fascinated by the chemical elements. I suppose this is similar to the fascination for prime numbers, Platonic solids, or elementary particles.I suspect there are many others \\"out there\\" sharing this fascination. If so, and you are interested in any of the following, this book might be for you:1) why are most elements metals? 2) why are there so few liquid elements? 3) why are there no gaseous metals? (Well actually there is: hydrogen) 4) why is there an island of super-dense elements centered about osmium? 5) why is carbon unique in that it is the progenitor of a vast family of compounds (the subject of organic chemistry)? 6) why do carbon's two nearest neighbors, silicon and boron, not have similar empires? (Silicon does have an empire -- rocks! -- but it is obviously quite different)7) what makes \\"heavy metals\\" heavy, and why are they so toxic? 8) why is there virtually no technetium in the Earth, though it is a relatively light metal, and not a member of the \\"heavy\\" radio-active series? 9) why is deuterium virtually a distinct elements (rather than just a form {isotope} of hydrogen)?The book is \\"friendly\\" enough so as not to intimidate non-specialist, but at the same time it contains sufficient details and technical information to interest the expert. A special asset is the grouping of elements according to the periodic table. The mysteries of the transitions elements are especially well covered.The book is enhaced by excellent graphics.The price, while high for say a novel, it quite reasonable for a technical book.Happy browsing!"},{"Title":"Chemistry of the Elements, Second Edition","review":"Greenwood and Earshaw is an excellent inorganic chemistry text as well as a valuable reference for the chemist or geochemist. Their systematic treatment of the elements by group within the periodic table makes for a coherent treatment of periodic properties.Besides the almost encyclopedic coverage of element chemistry, they cover the sources and uses of the elements and their compounds, making the chemistry much more relevant to everyday life.This is a good text for a university level inorganic class, but has enough general information that would be digestable for lower level students as well. An excellent resource for chemistry instructors at all levels."},{"Title":"Chemistry of the Elements, Second Edition","review":"Before I got a copy of this book I was always intrigued by the references to it in other texts. It does indeed have many interesting things in it. Some of the material it covers I have not seen in any other text.With that said however, this book is not really all that suitable as a standalone text for a course. It is missing too much descriptive chemistry and coordination theory to support an inorganic course. It is written at too high a level for a general chemistry course. It just doesn't seem to fit well anywhere.It has a great deal of information, arranged based on periodicity, especially in the areas of terrestrial abundance and industrial chemistry. Chemistry of the Elements repeats very little of what is covered in Cotton & Wilkinson's Advanced Inorganic and is well worth having to supplement that text.I enjoy reading this book, but I doubt I will ever use it exclusively for a course.

I didn't. Along with such kind of historical details, Greenwood and Earnshaw's book contains a great deal of information (data, tables, graphs, etc.) about the elements of the Periodic Table and their corresponding compounds. The material is logically organized in 31 chapters, which are followed by 7 appendices (1341 pages!).

My only complaint, once you correlate it to its intended audience, is that it does speak authoritatively more often then it should for such a speculative topic (e.g., it claims that we can expect that most intelligent species should have a humanoid template which is, to say the least, a debatable position).Be that as it may, I would certainly recommend it if you want to introduce a child to the topic or if you know of a child that is already interested.

I read this in two days. Was very sad to see it end."},{"Title":"After the Parade","review":"Well, it was good that I was able to pick up a story that was the last of the series and go with it. Sometimes if you read a series out of sequence, you're lost and disheartened. But this was easy to step into.Its the story between a half Cherokee war hero and his wife, a red headed writer of Westerns. Seems they were miscommunicating on the death of their child. He shipped off to war and she would never forgive him---or would she?It seems a theme for Garlock to have an obsessed dude running around through the story. He provides the suspense in the end.After reading several of her books, I can say that that part and the everpresent some-woman-is-getting-beat-by-her-man is starting to make me uninterested. I don't know how her faithfuls put up with it. Maybe this is teaching her readers that if you're abused and reading romances, its time to leave him.Or maybe its to educate the readers on how much abuse is out there. Whatever the case, its present in all the stories I've read.Back to Kathleen and Johnny--well, this romance seems to drag on through the book. Not much happens in the meantime until she gets kidnapped by the obsessed dude.The highlight was the post-war stuff and the usual period detail prevalent in Garlocks stories. After reading \\"House on a Hill,\\" which was so good, this was a bit of a let down. But go for it anyway!"},{"Title":"After the Parade","review":"I have read many , many books in my life . After the Parade was the absolute best book I have ever read . Johnny and Kathleen had so much depth . It is a book of how love can endure even the worst of circumstances . I could not put this book down , And , I have read it over and over ."},{"Title":"After the Parade","review":"I read all four books: WITH HOPE, WITH SONG, WITH HEART and AFTER THE PARADE and while all had good story lines, they weren't great--Just simple country stories about country families. Loves that break up/then make up; bad guy in town/ bad apple or two in the family/ etc. etc. Nothing that made me want to turn pages, but an easy read while waiting in an office for an appointment.I don't understand all the great reviews. These books could have been combined into one book and you still wouldn't be turning pages!"},{"Title":"After the Parade","review":"This turned out to be a suspense Historical Romance which I found refreshing. I enjoyed reading the book so much that I had a hard time putting it down to go into the doctor's office!I believe that you could read this as a single book without having read the three prior books because I had read them months ago and forgotten the plots!!! It was a delightful read. My only reason for not giving it five stars was the use many times of bad words and God's name in vain. I don't usually oontinue reading books I find these words in but I did this one as it was good and overlooked those words. I hope Ms. Garwood realizes a good book can be written without use of such language."},{"Title":"After the Parade","review":"I did enjoy this book -- but it's not one that I'd go back and read again. It was great knowing more about what happened with the Henry's and their friends. And I think the little &quot;surprises&quot; that Ms. Garlock placed at the end of each of the stories in this series is just wonderful! But I just didn't feel for the characters in this story the way I did in the previous ones. And though the book was very well written, I didn't particularly care for a couple of the back stories."},{"Title":"After the Parade","review":"i am a big fan of the second world war periode so i was very exited about this book.i think it's the first time where i hate a hero so much i wish the writer had killed him!i do not understand what Kate saw in him !!!!! he was stupid and whiney .if you love a good WW2 book try \\"the blue bicycle\\" from deforgesAVOID !"},{"Title":"After the Parade","review":"I enjoyed the whole series. After finishing the first three books and reading the preview, I couldn't wait for After The Parade. But I was disappointed. I do not think that there was enough written telling of their relationship. I thought that it could have been so much better."},{"Title":"Adversaries Walk Among Us: The History, Nature, And Removal Of Possessing Demons And Spirits","review":"Not much to say that hasn't been said in the review above by Dr. Ciprian. John G. Livingston is on the cutting edge of his kind of shamanic work, extremely intelligent and a real teacher's teacher. I am grateful for his research, techniques, and his very presence. People who carry much light can be very suseptible to problems of a darker nature, _especialliy_ in our current times of great change and upheaval....thus someone of John's expertise can really come in handy."},{"Title":"Adversaries Walk Among Us: The History, Nature, And Removal Of Possessing Demons And Spirits","review":"The author cites Sylvia Brown as a resource, which is a questionable resource in and of itself considering there are whole websites dedicated to what a fraud she is, but Sylvia Brown doesn't even believe in demons. This makes me question the author's research abilities."},{"Title":"Adversaries Walk Among Us: The History, Nature, And Removal Of Possessing Demons And Spirits","review":"While this author titles his book demons and spirits, he admits that many of these are \\"attachments\\" which are likely other than demons... and may be just a fragment of someone's soul. If that sentence doesn't entice you, nothing will! It is an interesting book, worth reading by everyone in the psychic/mediumship business. However, although I found some valuable insights, I hope someone is going to write about this without the basis in Christianity. The author admits this is much older than Christianity, even the removal of such. He wants to quibble over the \\"right\\" way to remove them. I hope someone writes another book that includes other entities as well."},{"Title":"Adversaries Walk Among Us: The History, Nature, And Removal Of Possessing Demons And Spirits","review":"I did not find this book something I could take seriously in terms of demons or how to get rid of them. I felt it was more new age tenets meet science fiction with the author claiming to travel to where demons are made to get answers that explained their existence and I felt it was self-indulgent. I also felt it wasn't very well-researched. It seems he chose a few writings on demons to agree or disagree with and came up with the rest himself."},{"Title":"Adversaries Walk Among Us: The History, Nature, And Removal Of Possessing Demons And Spirits","review":"I have been doing this work since early March as a client. I have had personal experiences both from myself and from other healers with the content in this book. If you had asked me before I read this book, and before having things removed from me if this is real I would have said NO. When you go through John's book and read it you will probably feel fear. This not something that we talk about in ever day society. In fact, about 8 out of 10 people will have attachments, this book is great for understanding that. I have been blessed to work with John, as well as other students of his both on a healing level, and teaching level. This is truly amazing stuff. I am thankful that John has had the privilege to share his story and book."},{"Title":"Adversaries Walk Among Us: The History, Nature, And Removal Of Possessing Demons And Spirits","review":"The author made it all up. He's obviously disturbed and none of his claims are backed by evidence. Then again, he does claim to be a an exorcist so I'm not surprised."},{"Title":"Adversaries Walk Among Us: The History, Nature, And Removal Of Possessing Demons And Spirits","review":"Livingston's book offers intriguing insight into the concepts of shamanism, spiritual dimensions, and human behavior. It is a worthy read for folks who like to think outside the box, and provides interesting food for thought about what makes human behavior \\"bad\\" from an otherworldy prospective. If you like shamanism, ghost stories, entities, excorcism tales, etc., this is a great read. It is a practical take on a sometimes impractical \\"other\\" world."},{"Title":"Adversaries Walk Among Us: The History, Nature, And Removal Of Possessing Demons And Spirits","review":"The man is a quack. He uses his \\"magic pendulum\\" to tease the answers out of his subjects. He swings the pendulum purposefully in the manner needed for the answers he wants. This is so he can suck in another victim to pay for his fake treatments. I wish people would learn to think for themselves and not be sucked in by this junk."},{"Title":"Adversaries Walk Among Us: The History, Nature, And Removal Of Possessing Demons And Spirits","review":"I absolutely agree with the other reviews listed. This is an amazing book! I went into this book with my own personal reservations and opinions on the subject matter. John has clearly opened my eyes to many different avenues of thought I had never imagined possible. His words are powerful and so easy to understand - you can tell this was written from his heart. I find the history and the methods discussed to be entrancing and this book was a quick read for me - I could not put it down. I must admit, it was a personal journey for me, as some of the things discussed were disturbing to me - I am so grateful to have worked through my own fear to receive this wonderful teaching.I had the honor of meeting John at a recent seminar. He is a skilled and gifted shaman and lightworker. His knowledge is top notch in his field and he holds the energy of ancient wisdom. I highly recommend him as an author and healer."},{"Title":"Adversaries Walk Among Us: The History, Nature, And Removal Of Possessing Demons And Spirits","review":"I came upon this book because of a patient of mine. I am a spiritual person and have an open mind but I also need to see physical results to believe in something. A young woman that I was treating for several chronic problems went to a shamanic healer by the advice of a friend. When she returned to my office she looked like a different person. The shamanic healer used the techniques that are written about in John Livingston's book. I am interested in these types of things because of experiences I have had and I quickly found a copy of Adversaries Walk Among Us. It was a very interesting and exciting read.John Livingston gives experiences of his shamanic journeys and case studies of working with his clients as well as the history of spiritual de-possession or exorcism. He also gives histories of the various spirit entities and what they can do if they are infecting a human host and how to remove them (although there are warnings that you should be experienced in shamanic healing before trying this). John also mentions other books to assist in becoming more knowledgeable about this subject.John's book opened my eyes to reasons of why some people have major obstacles in their lives whether it is health, relationship abundance, etc. He also inspired me to read more books on shamanic healing and I am thankful for that."},{"Title":"Adversaries Walk Among Us: The History, Nature, And Removal Of Possessing Demons And Spirits","review":"This book is a dangerous trap for those wanting to be free of demons. Some of the advice is true, but it is mixed with sorcery and Biblical errors. I have personally found that remembering a good 20+ verses, reading the Bible daily, praying and THEN fasting (praying and fasting) will kick out every and all demons. This book is too much drama and \\"technical\\" knowledge that always comes from a false teacher."},{"Title":"Hare and Tortoise Race to the Moon","review":"Wow, do I disagree with School Library Journal's review where it says this is not a necessary addition to a collection! Obviously that librarian does not read aloud to children very much! I have shared this title with over sixty schoolchildren and it never fails to elicit cheers. It goes beyond the moral of \\"slow but sure\\" and extends into the theme of friendship, a subject of interest to every child. The illustrations are bold and snazzy. Overall, this book was a real pleasure to share with primary children. I hope there will be more by this author/illustrator. if this debut is any indication, he's really headed for the stars!"},{"Title":"Hare and Tortoise Race to the Moon","review":"I am a mother of a five year old boy and three year old girl and this book was great for the both of them. My son loved the race and space theme. My daughter loved the whimiscal illustrations. They both loved the words like Vroom, putt-putt, slowpoke, and of course superduper. Best of all they realized even though they were in a race trying to beat each other to finish they cared for each other. I think the Aesop's fable of staying focused is right on course with this modern retelling to reach children. We loved it -illustratons and story!!"},{"Title":"Hare and Tortoise Race to the Moon","review":"One of the few books my two boys will sit quietly through! Aside from that, the illustrations are incredible...and it's written in a way that is simple enough for a 2 and 3 year old to understand, yet fun and conversational enough for me to look forward to reading it to them. If only Oliver Corwin had more similarly illustrated Aesop's Fables that he has chosen to re-tell."},{"Title":"Hare and Tortoise Race to the Moon","review":"My grandchildren loved the storyline and the illustrations. Very clever of the author to take an aseop tale and create such an ingenous contemporary version. The moral of the story, friends are so important, sends a great message for kids. My husband and I also thought the illustrations were delightful. Can't wait to send Mr. Corwin's next children's book to our grandkids. Hope he has another on the drawing board soon."},{"Title":"Hare and Tortoise Race to the Moon","review":"My 16 month old daughter is still too young to appreciate the story line of this book, but she really gets into the illustrations, which are excellent. Actually, these pictures would make a fabulous coloring book (take note, Abrams!) Older kids will also get a big kick out of the sound effects and fun wording of the text!"},{"Title":"The Revelation of Saint John (Black's New Testament Commentary)","review":"The first edition came out 1966 and the second in 1984, the year he died. G B Caird is a well-respected NT scholar and was Dean Ireland's professor of exegesis of Holy Scripture, Oxford. At the time he wrote the first edition he thought he was swimming against the tide, but in fact he is pretty main stream. He was influenced by A M Farrer, but that is no bad thing. While scholarly, it is very readable, not much Greek and very few footnotes. He did his own translation from Greek to English, my only quibble is that he uses 'lamps' instead of 'lampstands' in 1:20, this difference is important because Jesus is the lamp (21:23). He tends to deal with a section at a time but verses are indicated and key words are in bold. It is not exhaustive or over-detailed and occasionally he has little to say, but when he has something to say he is worthwhile listening to. For the student this would not be my first choice (try Osborne and Mounce), but if you already have a good working knowledge of Revelation you will enjoy Caird's thoughtful commentary, get it while it is still in print.Note: Among 7 recent (1997-2005) scholarly commentaries on Revelation Caird is the fifth most cited author. Caird's commentary has now been superceded by Ian Boxall'sRevelation of Saint John, The (Black's New Testament Commentary)"},{"Title":"The Mobility of Workers Under Advanced Capitalism","review":"This is an absolutely fabulous text for understanding Dominicans in the United States. Hernandez uses a historical-structuralist approach for understanding Dominican immigration, which I found an important corrective in a generally celebratory literature that ignores real social problems confronting immigrants of color. Hernandez takes race seriously and does an excellent job with her data. The book is well worth the investment if only for the data, although I'm comfortable asserting that Hernandez is exemplary in her race-class-gender analysis among immigrants of color (Dominicans) in NYC. An absolute REQUIREMENT for any serious engagement of Dominicans in the United States."},{"Title":"The Noisy Book","review":"This book is captivating! The child can't wait to find out what sounds Muffin hears. (Muffin is a little dog who temporarily has a bandage over his eyes).

Geography (Paperback Twocan))","review":"We are homeschoolers who bought this book along with Geography Crafts for Kids and the Complete Book of Geography to use as our geography curriculum. This book has a lot of advanced concepts and activities based on CARTOGRAPHY, it is not meant for teaching political maps (like specific countries, rivers, geographical features). I chose this book because it is thorough, teaches maps in an interesting and meaningful way, and is activity based. Perhaps the best part is that I am learning along side my kiddo, in a subject that I would not typically find very interesting! There are a couple of paragraphs of information about the concepts explored by each project, and it is generally enough but we have also supplemented with library books. It is recommended for ages 11 and up, but my kiddo is an advanced 9 year old. There are a couple of projects in this book that we will probably skip or save for when he is older. I would say this book would work great for ages 8 and up but plan on adult supervision/collaboration. There are certainly activities that even younger siblings could participate in. The book is thin, but it is still chock full of great ideas. If you are a homeschooler, I could see this book taking at least an entire semester. Since there is no \\"look inside\\" Ill list some of the activities: Scale drawings, Grid drawings, Symbols, Contour maps, mapping sea and sky, city maps, latitude and longitude, early maps, route maps, surveying, plotting, making your own maps, 3d maps. Great book!"},{"Title":"Chevrolet Corvair Photo History","review":"This book is very enjoyable for any Corvair enthusiast.

Addictive, hard to put down story about a family of werewolves with many plot twists and very interesting characters. A compelling love story with lots of sexual tension and very sensual love scenes. Susan Krinard has a great gift for story telling and a sparkling imagination. A perfect read that I'm always looking for but very rarely find. Can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Touch of the Wolf (Historical Werewolf Series, Book 1)","review":"I was anxious to read this book as I am a paranormal fan. It is certainly different from her other werewolf books which deal with the descendants of Braden and Cassidy. This book is setting the stage for a long and satisfying relationship between the reader and the characters in the books I feel sure Ms. Krinard will write about Bradens sister and brother, Cassidys brother and maybe even the other werewolf clans!! Please, please, pretty please! Sometimes the first book in what promises to be a series is strangely unsatisfying unless you don't start reading them until they are all in print. Not so with this one. It is whole and complete in itself as it deals with the life of Cassidy Holt, a strong young heroine and her growing relationship with Braden, who becomes her husband. It even goes farther than the &quot;I do&quot; which sometimes leave us wondering how they progressed. Cassidy changes Bradens life and alters his focus on the Cause without changing it. I wondered in the middle what would happen and Ms. Krinard surpised me with the strength and fervor of Cassidys life. I recommend this highly as an enjoyable read. Thank you Ms. Krinard! Please write many more stories about these werewolves."},{"Title":"Touch of the Wolf (Historical Werewolf Series, Book 1)","review":"I cried, laughed, grew angry and wistful while reading this excellent book about werewolves and the ongoing trials and tribulations of trying to keep their people alive and pure. Braden and Cassidy are great characters and the fact that Braden found he could love his &quot;Cause&quot; and have Cassidy was FANTASTIC! I am impatiently going to wait for the sequel and TWIN's lives to unfold. My thanks to Susan Krinard for a great book. I am a lover of wolves so this book was especially close to my heart!"},{"Title":"Touch of the Wolf (Historical Werewolf Series, Book 1)","review":"I really loved the plot, the heroine is a werewolf who is unable to change, the hero is leader of the werewolves, carrying out a werewolf breeding program to concentrate the blood of his people and save the race. How painful it must have been for him to prove his dedication to &quot;the Cause&quot; by promising the woman he cares for to his brother as part of his duty, because he was thought to be infertile. Spellbinding.Yet I wasn't wholly satisfied. Most werewolf tales take place in the wilderness. Susan's other werewolf tales are no exception both contemporary tales taking place in the Americas. This story took place in Victorian England, I could have been truly different, but wasn't. Besides being the leader of the werewolves, Bradon is the Earl of Greyburn, a peer of the realm, there was so much potential there. Consider the irony of greedy human debutant's setting their caps for the enigmatic and handsome earl, while his sole focus is making sure none of his people breed with humans. By making all the major players, hero, heroine, siblings, even the villians werewolves the author isolated them as surely as if they were living in that vast American wilderness. The remaining two stories in the series return to the American West, though still in historical time period. I feel like an opportunity was missed here. I would still recommend the book and will certainly purchase the others. ~L.

Many times, I found myself thinking about the book. Couldn't wait to pick up the book once I left work each day.I found the characters very colorful. You can relate to each character's personality.

Why couldn't he somehow get back his eyesight in some bazar situation?I truly enjoyed reading this book and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Touch of the Wolf (Historical Werewolf Series, Book 1)","review":"I have always been a fan of Susan Krinard, especially with her bent towards writing stories about the paranormal. TOTW did not disappoint me. Braden and Cassidy's story was well written and a delight to read. Ms. Krinard goes out of her way to strongly define her characters, giving the readers insights on why they behave they way they do. (And not just our hero and heroine, she sets up the stage for Braden's sister and brother's story too.)Although Cassidy might start out too trusting and innocent for my tastes, her character does grow and learn from life. Many times writers miss character development and that makes for a stale story. The time and thought that went into Braden's character development is obvious. The struggle Braden goes through for the length of the story is at once heart wrenching (we all know that deep down he wants to do what is right, its just defining what \\"right\\" is) and frustrating (damn his grandfather anyway). It's hard to have such a strong character become vulnerable.I have but one criticism of the book. This is a story about werewolves, their relevance in society, their laws and mores, their ethics, their hierarchy, basically their very existence. Although we get some feeling of this through the choices Braden must make as leader, I did not feel like I really got to know the werewolves themselves. I got the feeling that seeing them as werewolves was almost peripherary to the story (except maybe for the climatic end scene.) There was very little changing from human form to werewolf form. It was always there on the outside of the story but never really made it to the inside. Overall, keep up the great work and I look forward to the next story."},{"Title":"Touch of the Wolf (Historical Werewolf Series, Book 1)","review":"The first Krinard novel I read was Prince of Wolves, and I promptly ordered the rest of her backlist because I loved it so much. I was thrilled to discover that each novel she's written is as wonderful. There are some authors whose work you read and the story lingers in your mind for days afterwards: the characters are so real, the plot so engrossing, the sensual chemistry so HOT, between a hero-to-die for and an intelligent, courageous heroine. Susan Krinard is that kind of author--she writes a book you just can't seem to put down and when you do you're already reaching for her next book.Touch of the Wolf is fantastic! Read anything by Sue Krinard and treat yourself to a magnificent escape into a romantic, paranormal fantasy that only Ms. Krinard could write so well."},{"Title":"Touch of the Wolf (Historical Werewolf Series, Book 1)","review":"&quot;Touch of the Wolf&quot; by Susan Krinard is a powerful and well-written paranormal romance that will leave readers craving more from this talented author. Vibrant characters, lush English settings, and a strong plot combine to create an affecting tale that will stay with readers long after the book comes to an end.Braden Forster, the Earl of Greyburn, has dedicated his entire life to &quot;The Cause&quot; - restoring the purity of his werewolf - or loups-garous - bloodline. Raised by a cruel grandfather, Braden was brought up to believe that his only reason for being was The Cause. For years Braden has searched for the lost branch of the Forster family, hoping to find his distant cousins and restore them to The Cause, but to no avail.Cassidy Holt, the distant cousin Braden is seeking, is the half-human daughter of a werewolf mother, born and raised in America. Orphaned at the tender age of seven, before her mother had a chance to teach her how to be loups-garous, Cassidy was taken in by her human father's brother, Jonas. Life with her human aunt and uncle was always unhappy for Cassidy, who was constantly aware that she was unwanted and feared. For years Cassidy dreamed of finding her mother's family in England, a family who could teach her all about being loups-garous. Cassidy finally strikes out on her own, and with the help of an old friend of her mother's, travels to England.Upon arriving in England, Cassidy is drawn to the scent of her own kind, and ends up on the doorstep of Braden Forster. Braden cannot believe his luck at finding Cassidy after all these years, and immediately decides that she will be an appropriate wife for his brother, Quentin. But Cassidy isn't what Braden expected her to be, and her refreshing combination of naivet&eacute; and courage begins to break down the walls Braden has built around himself. Cassidy finds herself undeniably drawn to Braden, and bravely stands by him even while he tries to push her away.Past betrayals have left Braden scarred both physically and emotionally, and he is not eager to open himself up for that kind of hurt again. But Braden's emotional barriers are no match for Cassidy's gentle persistence, and she begins to show him that there may be a Cause even more important than preserving the werewolf bloodline - the Cause of Love.&quot;Touch of the Wolf&quot; will sweep readers away into Victorian England, and keep them captivated. Krinard skilfully absorbs her readers into the lives of Cassidy and Braden, making their trials and triumphs palpable. This wonderful story of love and redemption is a truly satisfying read. So buy this book today, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Touch of the Wolf (Historical Werewolf Series, Book 1)","review":"TOUCH OF THE WOLF is a pedestrian effort. The story - about an American werewolf who goes to England to find her family - is choppy, with holes here and there in the plot, quotes way too much poetry, and is cast with characters who aren't that interesting. The heroine, Cassidy, is not very endearing - she's irritatingly nave (my eyeballs are rolling right now) and is way too desperate to find love. She also fixates on Braden right from the start, though I don't know why exactly, other than he is the first werewolf she meets. I thought Braden was more flushed out a character than Cassidy or his two siblings. His handicap was promising, though there seemed to be a lot of moments in the book where, superhuman senses aside, the author seemed to forget he WAS handicapped. The story also seemed to suffer from moody melodrama and a need to make a secret out of EVERYTHING. I understand that TOUCH OF THE WOLF is the first of a trilogy, the other two books following the stories of Braden's siblings (an annoying ice queen named Rowena and a cowardly trickster named Quentin). I'm not quite sure I want to bother with their stories. The reason I read TOUCH OF THE WOLF is because I adored TO CATCH A WOLF, which is about Cassidy's brother, Morgan. I'm pretty disappointed that Cassidy's story was so dopey. Oh well.Update as of Jan 4, 2005: I just read a young adult novel called BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE that dealt with many of the same topics as TOUCH OF THE WOLF, including real-life issues such as fitting in, dealing with the loss of family, etc., as well as werewolf issues like determining the leader of the pack and the rules associated with breeding/mating. I have to say the teen book, BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE, was a lot more sophisticated than TOUCH OF THE WOLF in every respect and was a much more engaging read. BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE was shorter and set in modern times with a angst-filled heroine and, while it didn't have the full-blown love scenes found in a romance novel, it had a sexually-tense love triangle that was fun and exciting to read about."},{"Title":"Touch of the Wolf (Historical Werewolf Series, Book 1)","review":"First in series of werewolf family set in Victorian England.

Marilyn, The Regency Lover's Cafe"},{"Title":"Touch of the Wolf (Historical Werewolf Series, Book 1)","review":"For the most part, I really enjoyed this book. Krinard makes werewolves real and serves up emotional tension with a backhoe. Braden is a complex hero, and not always heroic, but he recognizes his errors and grows as a character. Cassidy remains somewhat innocent throughout the book, but that's part of what appeals to Braden; plus, the hurt and betrayal that strike at her innocence are beautifully rendered, making the reader hurt, too. Her need to be belong is palpable. You can feel the heightened tension when the werewolves are together and challenging each other. There are moments when the book falters (for example, Bredan's fall into his grandfather's outlook and behavior is never fully explained), but it serves as a thorough introduction to the Forster family. The love scenes are the weakest part, and Krinard's euphemisms are so laughable as to almost be more uncomfortable than crass words. Sometimes the exposition is too long or slow, but once the action begins, it moves with good speed."},{"Title":"Touch of the Wolf (Historical Werewolf Series, Book 1)","review":"Cassidy Holt, of half werewold blood and half human, was orphaned at a young age and is sent off to live with her cruel relations of her fathers in the Wild West.

When Braden finds out that Cassidy is his long lost distant cousin, he is surprised and instantly puts into plan that she marry his brother, Quentin, to further strengthen the werewolf bloodline. Cassidy only has eyes for Braden but will Braden put behinf his dark past in order to accept and love Cassidy who is immensely attracted to.Susan Krinard is one of my favourite paranormal romantic authors. She really brings to life her characters and fills each chapter with passion. You can really believe that there exists werewolves amongst us humans. You are also drawn into the descriptions of London and the English countryside. Susan Krinanrd states that she has a passion for nature and this really translates into her description of the forests and animals, which inhabit them. This book is highly recommended along with her other werewolf books.Lealing"},{"Title":"Touch of the Wolf (Historical Werewolf Series, Book 1)","review":"I just bought this book this morning.I was soon totally immersed in the lives of Braden, Cassidy ,Mattias and the rest of this lovable cast. This book makes an exciting continuation to her previous werewolf stories... or should I say prequel. Susan Krinard has a knack for creating very real characters that you can empathize with.Her imagery makes you feel like you are right at scene watching the action unfold. I can't tell you how many times I started talking to the characters out loud when they did something absolutely clueless. All in all , if you love a well constructed book with a heavy dose of fantasy get this book ."},{"Title":"Touch of the Wolf (Historical Werewolf Series, Book 1)","review":"I Love this book.The story of Braden Forster and Cassidy Holt.Braden learns that Love can be just as important as the Cause of preserving the werewolf race.It kept me reading late into the night I am glad to finally to read a book with a great ending. The good thing is that there are two more books in the trilogy"},{"Title":"Touch of the Wolf (Historical Werewolf Series, Book 1)","review":"Susan Krinard has created real magic in Touch of the Wolf. Braden and Cassidy lived and breathed for me, and the story kept me awake nights long after I'd finished reading it. But even that pales beside this novelist's special gift. Seemingly without effort, Ms. Krinard creates the willing suspension of disbelief. And for readers, it just doesn't get any better than that.Read this book. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Touch of the Wolf (Historical Werewolf Series, Book 1)","review":"I have read both of her previous books on wolves of the manly kind and loved them. I haven't read this one yet and am really really looking forward to it. She is a great author. Terri."},{"Title":"Touch of the Wolf (Historical Werewolf Series, Book 1)","review":"I enjoyed this book, but it was pretty slow in many places. Toward the end, it was quite exciting. But the first half of the book seemed to go over the same material repeatedly. It needed to go faster. IMO, there was also not enough action. It was mostly Braden telling himself over and over that he had to uphold the Cause and couldn't have Cassidy. It just went on too long."},{"Title":"Touch of the Wolf (Historical Werewolf Series, Book 1)","review":"This book was brain candy. It was well paced and just interesting enough to keep you going, but didn't require any effort to read. There were weak moments and moments of serious eye rolling (the over use of poetic quotes for example became tedious and lost impact). The character, Braden, the male lead was well done. He was the best developed and the only really developed character in the book. His handicap was a bit of a twist right off the bat. It was slid in so easily that I found myself stopping and going, \\"What? He's what?\\" and flipping back a few pages to review. The weaknesses she \\"tells\\" us about in Braden, would have been better \\"shown.\\" But still he is the most interesting of the characters in this book. The female lead, Cassidy Holt, is over the top naive and innocent... and sorry, but no girl from the old west who hearded cattle and worked a ranch is this innocent and naive.The biggest complaint in this is that it is the pinnacle scenes for a romance novel (nudge, nudge) that fall absolutely flat. The romantic tension is done well as it builds, but during the culminating moment, the writer's cliched and even down right silly analogies and vocabulary pulled me out of the moment and hand me giggling. One can use petals as a simile as in \\"soft as a petal,\\" but one should never use \\"petals\\" as a euphemism for a body part. It is simply silly.All in all it's a nice pleasant read. A nice curl on the couch with a cup of tea or coffee and forget about the outside world book."},{"Title":"Touch of the Wolf (Historical Werewolf Series, Book 1)","review":"I can't give a rounded synopsis of this book because I only made it half way through. The book itself has a good premise, but the characters lack dimension and depth.Cassidy has hidden strengths and a certain amount of vulnerability that at first endeared her to me. However, by the middle of the book, she hadn't grown up or expanded her personality.I'm a huge fan of the Laurel K Hamiltons/Katy McAllistars of the world and between books I go exploring for new Authors. I'm sorry to say Susan Krinard doesn't make my list as a must read."},{"Title":"Touch of the Wolf (Historical Werewolf Series, Book 1)","review":"This book has it all, romance,suspence and surprises all around.

Her father's brother took her in reluctantly and fearfully. Her mother and brother were werewolves and she is one also, athough she has yet to change into a wolf. Her mother wanted her to go to her werewolf family in England, but her uncle forbid it. When she is old enough, she travels to San Francisco to her mother's best friend and together they go to London to search for Cassidy's family. Her family is the powerful Greyburn Forsters, headed by Braden, Earl of Greyburn. The Earl has carried on his grandfather's Cause to preserve the werewolf bloodlines and the newly found Cassidy is to be a part of this. He plans to marry her to his brother Quentin, but finds that he wants her himself. When he finds that she cannot change her marries her, thinking that he is sterile anyway, so her half breed status won't affect the bloodline. Cassidy changes his family and the Earl in ways they never thought possible.This was another engrossing read by Ms. Krinard. The characters and story are so vivid that you almost believe that there are really werewolves out there. A very good and quick read."},{"Title":"Touch of the Wolf (Historical Werewolf Series, Book 1)","review":"This is a book about werewolves. I enjoyed the fact that these characters were struggling with the same things every human deals with. Love, pain, loneliness, feelings of duty and honor. The main characters, Branden, the head of the family, has devoted his entire life to the Cause, which is restoring the purity of the bloodline. He has put his whole life force into this and so he is shaken when the heroine, Cassidy, a half human, enters his life. She is searching for her people and is over joyed to be a part of his family. There are many things which she must learn and he finds himself teaching her and falling for her even though he is struggling to keep her at a distance. She on the other hand has completely embraced her feelings for him. I enjoyed this book and will be reading the sequels. I can't wait to read Quentin's book."},{"Title":"Touch of the Wolf (Historical Werewolf Series, Book 1)","review":"This book is a must read.

Braden Forster, Earl of Greyburn, leader of his clan, has pledged his entire life to restoring the purity of his clan's werewolf blood. He has vowed to make his people strong again and will allow nothing or no one to deter him. Raised by a cruel grandfather, he has become a hard, cold man who will allow nothing to prevent him from restoring his clan's werewolf line. He believes the survival of his race depends on him. For years, he has been searching for a cousin believed to be residing in America. A young woman who possesses a pure wolf bloodline that is linked to his family's heritage. Cassidy Holt was believed lost. Her mother was loup-garou. Her father was human. When she was six years, her father ran off and never came back, leaving her mother to raise her. Once her mother dies, her father's brother, Jonas, claims her and takes her off to his farm in New Mexico. She knows Uncle Jonas doesn't really want her, that he is afraid of her. Yet she has no choice but to go with him. Through the years, Cassidy carries the dream deep within her soul to someday find her mother's family. She is desperately aching to be with family who could love her and teach her how to be werewolf. She knows that somewhere in England her true family waits. With help from her mother's friend, she goes there. One fateful night, she suddenly encounters Braden Forster. Possessing such power, he immediately knows that she is loup-garou (werewolf). When she reveals her name, he feel a sense of triumph that he has found the lost Forster branch. He is determined to restore Cassidy Holt to the Cause - to purify his clan's bloodline. Yet Cassidy is not quite what he had expected. She is attracted to Braden's brooding sensuality and the pain she glimpses deep within his green eyes. She bravely confronts the wall of coldness he has encased himself with and awakens feelings he has long thought dead. But a past betrayal has hardened any tender emotions he might have had. He is so afraid to love again. It is Cassidy's love that allows him to finally see. The only Cause in life is not to preserve his werewolf clan. It is to love . . . . Touch of the Wolf is a powerful love story. A very strong hero who is scarred, physically and mentally by a past betrayal. And so very reluctant to allow any tender emotions to touch him. He tries to remain cold and aloof but Cassidy's uncompromising love finally allows Braden's wall of coldness to crumble. You will not be disappointed by this book."},{"Title":"Touch of the Wolf (Historical Werewolf Series, Book 1)","review":"Susan Krinard has a beautiful writing style. Her books are meaty and always contain complicated characters who really draw you in. Touch of the Wolf, the beginning of her new historical werewolf trilogy, is no exception. For me, the love and laughter lover, this book weighed in a little too heavily on the angst side but still comes recommended to those of you who prefer a dark, brooding and outwardly cold hero (until the heroine breaks down his barriers). It's rich with description and is a book that you can easily lose yourself in. I'm anxiously awaiting the next one."},{"Title":"Touch of the Wolf (Historical Werewolf Series, Book 1)","review":"I really loved the plot, the heroine is a werewolf who is unable to change, the hero is leader of the werewolves, carrying out a werewolf breeding program to concentrate the blood of his people and save the race.

To me, this is a marvelous idea.I've noticed below that some of the criticisms of this book center around the fact that there wasn't enough room to fit in the story, the romance, and all of the details on werewolf daily life that readers would like to know.

The larger human population was assimilating the Werewolves through marriage. Each subsequent generation contained more impurities in their blood. By 1860, Tiberius' Cause is working as the Werewolves are closer to saving their breed. That year, his grandson fourteen-year old Braden attends his first meeting.At the same time in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, seven- year old Cassidy Holt worries about her future with the recent death of her beloved mother, leaving her an orphan. In a letter addressed to a friend, but not mailed, Cassidy learns that the English Forster family is kin. However, her father's brother Uncle Jonas arrives and takes the little girl to live with him on his New Mexico farm.Fifteen years later, Cassidy travels to England to seek her family. Upon arrival, Cassidy senses a peer in Braden, now the head of the Cause. Braden's obsessively believes that the means do not matter as long as the end results in the loups-garous being saved. Braden also tries to destroy his growing attraction to the naive American Werewolf who is haunting his heart.TOUCH OF THE WOLF is a superb supernatural romance due to Susan Krinard's ability to make readers believe that the Werewolf breed exists. Cassidy and Braden are an interesting pair as they struggle with their growing love and his fixation on saving his people that borders on insanity. Ms. Krinard deserves plenty of accolades from romance readers and all werewolf fans because she makes the loups-garous seem alive and well in nineteenth century England."},{"Title":"Touch of the Wolf (Historical Werewolf Series, Book 1)","review":"The story is attention grabbing yet I felt that it was missing something.

The beginning started off really well. Then, once they got to Grayburn I kept reading and reading hoping something would happen. To be fair the book would have short little bursts of interesting activity, only to get bogged down with repeatedly talking about the characters pasts over and over again; always constantly hinting at \\"past events\\" that made people the way they were. Unfortunately, when the author finally gave the full explanation regarding everyone's past I really didn't care because I was tired of hearing about it. The book had it merits, it just needed more action, less \\"past\\" explanations and to move at faster pace."},{"Title":"Little Pilgrim's Progress: From John Bunyan's Classic","review":"I have read this book aloud to my 3rd grade students each year. The chapters are fairly short, so it's just right for a cool-down time after recess. Bunyan's story is scaled down so that a child can understand it. The moral lessons are great. All the characters are children, so little listeners tend to be more interested. Usually several of my students want to read it for themselves after I have finished reading it to the class. Don't be afraid of Bunyan's lofty story. The author does a wonderful job simplifying the theme of each chapter while staying true to Bunyan."},{"Title":"Little Pilgrim's Progress: From John Bunyan's Classic","review":"During my childhood nearly 40 years ago) I was utterly fascinated by this book. It stood out as one of the most interesting books of my childhood days, and it made an indelible impression on me. (Other favorites were C.S. Lewis' Narnia series, Little Princess, & Secret Garden). But back to Little Pilgrim's Progress: I'm not sure why this book was so intriguing to myself and my siblings, perhaps because the little pilgrem faced real dangers and even death??Well, recently this book came up in conversation -- I hadn't thought of it for years -- and I dug out a copy, and started to read it. Moments later my nearly 6-year-old daughter came up and asked me if I would read it to her. My nearly 4-year-old son also wanted to listen. (I read freqently to my children, and they often are able to enjoy stories beyond their age level, but still I thought this would be too advanced to hold their attention.) But still, I decided to try. Of course, when I read I simplified or explained the language from time to time (some of the wording is old-fashioned). But to my astonishment, my children were absolutely riveted. The chapters in this book are short, and the children kept begging me to read more!! I was especially amazed that my 4-year-old remained totally engaged in the story (there are occasional illustrations, but it isn't a picture book; they were just listening). We finished the Christian part of the book in a few reading sessions over 3 days. (We later read the Christiana story, but the children didn't find it as interesting).Conclusion: I'm not saying that this book would usually be of interest to such young children, but only wanted to comment that it can be a very exciting book and can provide much opportunity for thoughtful discussion with a parent.Oh, I will add one more thing -- shortly after reading the book, one day my son asked if he could change his name to \\"Help\\" (like in the story). And later, he asked if he could be called \\"Greatheart\\". So now we jokingly have added those names to his middle name. Also, after reading the story concepts came up a lot in conversations over the following days and weeks."},{"Title":"Little Pilgrim's Progress: From John Bunyan's Classic","review":"I was given this book, in its first printing, in an old stack of books about 6 years ago by my mother-in-law. The cover was different and uninteresting looking but it had no effect on what was inside the cover. This is the best book I have ever read to my children and they strongly agree. It took us a year to get through it at bedtime, but we all enjoyed it. They were 4 years old and 7 years old at the time, so the age range is much broader than specified. I learned so much from the book and so did they. It is challenging, both verbally and spiritually, and captivating. My children would beg me to read it to them because they couldn't wait to find out what happened to the children in the book. I recommend this book to everyone, both the Christian and non-Christian.

It confronts some of the deepest fears and anxieties that go hand in hand with trying to be a God-fearing, moral human being. Although I didn't realize it at the time, this book provided (and continues to provide) excellent examples of the hardships and sacrifices that result from chosing the moral path in life, and as a result it introduces a view of Christianity that stresses not only redemption, but also the self-discipline and courage that is required to confront the evil around us every day.

It is a magnificent version of Bunyan's classic. In particular what I like is that Helen Taylor doesnt shorten the story as much as others do. She retains a lot of the detail and the encounters that Christian has along the way. This allows a child as they grow to learn many of the valuable lessons for the Christian life which Bunyan intended us to see.There are many children's versions of this which are wonderfully inllustrated - this one isnt, although it has line drawings scattered throughout. But it more than makes up for it in its content. I've purchased another more lavishly illustrated version of Pilgrim's progress to show alongside this one, but actually haven't got round to doing that yet.What Helen Taylor has also done is to retell the story from a child's perspective - it is Little Pilgrim's Progress. It is in essence the same story - just downsized slightly. This makes it all the more easy to read to children.My four year old daughter pleads for me to read to her - not content to wait until next Sunday for the next installment. She wont let me stop and sits wide eyed as I read it to her.Why would I want a shorter version when I get to spend longer reading to my child?"},{"Title":"Little Pilgrim's Progress: From John Bunyan's Classic","review":"Have not finished reading the book to my children, but everytime I do its can you read another chapter?

It makes for great reading at bedtime, and though, being only twenty I have no children, I have found I enjoyed this book a great deal. It details the account of Christian, and later his (in the original book) wife's journey to Heaven (the Bright City). It has been a few years since I've read this, but I've read it four or five times, enjoying it immensely.The central problem (and this complaint is against Bunyan, not Helen E. Taylor) is, although I have read or heard it used to be a common thing back in that time era (1500 - 1700) to name the characters after whatever virtue or allegorical element the author wishes to state. Bunyan takes his allegory, and like Lewis in THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE stop telling the story and beat you with the allegory. (Narnia is one of my favorites, and although I like LWW, it has earned the position of my least favorite Narnia because several things don't jibe with me, or, instead of allowing readers to learn or draw conclusions, Lewis specifically dominates and draws an entirely too explicit comparison to Christianity. It is more personal taste than anything - though I like allegory, if one gets to explicit (like Aslan dying, or, in this book, when Christian sees a picture of King David) the story loses its spell over me.However, this is still a great book. Highly recommended, and if you won't want to wade through the much harder original, adults should go with this."},{"Title":"Little Pilgrim's Progress: From John Bunyan's Classic","review":"Well, I have to admit...

This book shows how hard you must work for God, and that you have to trust and love him with your whole heart, and that has to be your mission and your soul's mission. There is one importance in your life, and that must be the Lord. I also think that a good lesson that the Lord has brought to our attention through John Bunyan is that the Lord will provide even when there are hard times.

The obvious suspect, T.J., swears to his attorney Vicky Holden that he didn't do it, and she believes him. Until she finds out that he's been cheating on Denise for quite some time, that Denise was thinking seriously about divorcing T.J., that his alibi is non-existent. T.J. maintains that his enemies, the people on the rez who want some methane gas drilling sites allowed, killed Denise because they couldn't get to T.J. This is a reasonable possibility, but not first on anyone's list.At just about the same time that Denise is killed, Christine Nelson,the new curator at the local museum, disappears. Is this a coincidence? When her husband comes looking for her, the disappearance becomes ominous; her husband is a very controlling, very dangerous man with powerful friends.While investigating Denise's murder, and trying to protect her client, Vicky Holden uncovers some ties to a local politician. Wyomin Senator Jaime Evans is getting ready to announce his bid for the presidency. Evan's grandfather was married to an Arapaho, Bashful Woman. She was killed during the photographing by Edward S. Curtis of a staged attack on an Arapaho village. The Indians portraying the attackers were convicted of killing Bashful Woman, and hanged. Since then, some descendants of Bashful Woman's father, Chief Sharp Nose, have died; their deaths have not all been from natural causes, the murders have not been solved.Wife of Moon is a very well-written mystery. Margaret Coel has written seven other books in this series. This is the first one I've read. There is obviously a lot of history between Vicky Holden and Father John O'Malley; while not knowing that history made me curious, it did not detract from the story. The plotting is tight. The characters, even when not particularly likeable, are believable. I know about half-way through the book what the key to the story was, but not how it would be used, or where it would take me. The interweaving of the back-story (from 1907) and the current events was seamless. The historical details in the author's note at the end were interesting, and relevant.All in all, this was a thoroughly enjoyable read. I will add Margaret Coel's series to my list of \\"Stuff I Want to Read\\", and see if my local library has The Eagle Catcher in their collection. I suggest that if you haven't already read Coel, and you like contemporary mysteries set in the southwest, with Native American protagonists, that you do the same."},{"Title":"Wife Of Moon","review":"There is a skill that Margaret Coel has that is priceless; she has the ability, at times, to leave the reader with a great sense of loss. I'm not talking about that loss that one sometimes gets when a book has become so much a part of your life that the real world becomes disappointing... Margaret Coel creates another sense of loss. There is that sense of having lost almost everything through greed and injustice and all you have is your dignity. It must be like that at times for the American Indians. Their world was taken away, they were treated like subhumans, abused and victimised. Some of them lost hope and became alcoholics, shiftless, aimless.... others, somehow, held on to their dignity and survive.A hundred years ago, during a reconstructed attack on an Arapaho village a murder is committed. Three men are accused and executed. Today an Arapaho woman has been murdered and another woman, the curator of a museum, has gone missing. Out of this scenario Margaret Coel has created a tale that ranks amongst her very best."},{"Title":"Wife Of Moon","review":"I bought this to put on my grandmas kindle I bought here for Christmas, only problem was the Kindle links to a e-mail and when I tried downloading it it wouldn't install under my e-mail because the kindle was registered to her.

Not the books fault but Kindle makes it a pain."},{"Title":"Wife Of Moon","review":"Another good book. You really cannot go wrong when you pick up one of her books. She always satisfies."},{"Title":"Wife Of Moon","review":"I've read several of Coel's Native American-themed mysteries featuring Arapahoe attorney Vicky Holden and Jesuit Priest John O'Malley. If you live in the West, or just like the West, these books are a must, as Coel, a Coloradoan by choice, does much to evoke the weather, colors and feel of the high plains. All of the mysteries are set in Wyoming's Wind River area, including the large Indian reservation there. In this outing, two mysteries, one present-day, and one set at the turn of the 20th century, come together, and before all is said and done, 6 Indians are murdered, three in the name of a twisted and prejudicial justice. Old photos that have recently come to light may hold the images of Bashful Woman's true murderer's identity. Unfortunately whomever owns those glass plate images today is in danger of also being killed, hired by a mercenary of one of Wyoming's most influential ranchers/politicians, who also happens to be running for president. Despite much bloodshed, the two mysteries are nicely melded together, and the very likeable characters of Father John and Vicky are the glue that makes it all stick; their deep and abiding passion for each other, forbidden by the church that Father John finds himself questioning more and more, serves as a good foil to another romantic character, attorney Adam Lone Eagle, who has serious designs on Vicky, but whether or not his intentions are personal or professional is left up in the air. Coel tells an interesting story, set in an interesting part of the country that is remote enough that not many people really know about it, and yet mysterious for that very remoteness. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Wife Of Moon","review":"A reconstruction of plains life for an 1907 photograph by Edward Curtis was used as a mask for murder.

This is my favourite book so far, and I still have two or three more to go. I love Father John O'Malley. He is so real that I can't help going through all his angst with him. Vicky is a good character too. This book has non-stop tension from beginning to end. It actally starts in October 1907 and Coel weaves back and forth from then to the present day. When an historic photographer's works are shown at the Wind River Museum, Father O'Malley has no idea that these pictures would wake up a sleeping terror that has lain dormant for almost 100 years. Vicky and Father John are drawn into a web of terror and a cover-up that is incendiary as it was in 1907. Of course there are more dead bodies along the way, but Father John and Vicky stick with it until they discover the truth of what happened on the reserve in 1907. This books was riveting, and I just couldn't put it down. Can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Wife Of Moon","review":"The premise and the plot are interesting and engaging. The writer, however, must have attended one of those awful workshops where they proselytize \\"show not tell\\" - about the most misused advice there is - with the predictable result that her characters pluck, swivel, gulp, freeze, like they all have nerve disorders, and spend most of their time not looking at each other. There are also some very elementary errors, like grabbing a menu off a podium. And a few holes in the story, like: If you were desperately investigating a particular person's recent activities, and if you found that this person had intensely scrutinized an old photograph, even to the point of getting a magnifying glass for it, and then got all excited and offered a huge amount of money to have it ... would you give the equivalent of \\"hmm. thanks. bye\\" and then leave without looking at it?AUDIO: Another murder-by-narrator. Oh, spare us from this reader! She's a very poor actress, and poor with voices and accents, overacts unbearably, especially during sensitive moments. She often has no sense of the characters' personalities, or of the point of what's being said, and is often gratingly shrill. Sometimes so awful I was embarrassed for her, as when one of the Arapaho elders inexplicably develops a thick Irish accent. Worst of all, she acts out everything like \\"sighed,\\" \\"drew her breath in,\\" \\"took a gulp of air,\\" \\"small laugh,\\" \\"big guffaw,\\" \\"choking laugh,\\" \\"stutter,\\" -- aack!

There is even a some flying sparks as Vickie and Adam decide to open a law firm together and between Father O'Malley and Vickie, although neither one of them act upon it.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wife Of Moon","review":"A century ago, an Arapaho woman was killed while a photographer staged a Native American raid at the reservation. Three Indians were convicted of the crime and put to death. In the present day, an exhibition of the photographer's work is being held on the Arapaho reservation. When the museum curator vanishes, and another Arapaho woman is killed, Father John O'Malley and Arapho attorney Vickey Holden both believe that there must be a connection. Of course, the connection might just be an Indian with a wandering eye.Author Margaret Coel introduces a rich set of suspects. Could T. J. Painted Horse have murdered his wife for the insurance money? Or could irate Indians--or rich businessmen killed her in an attempt to pressure T. J. to back off of his efforts to prevent exploitation of the methane reserves under the reservation? Then there's the scary husband of the museum curator. An ex-CIA agent, Eric Loftus has killed before--and seems to have an unhealthy obsession over his wife.Coel gradually unfolds the mystery, using flashbacks to 1907 and the first murder to let the reader know more than the protagonists and up the suspense. Coel's writing keeps the story moving along and the reader engaged throughout. The Native American setting and the historical details add interest. I would have liked to see a more satisfying ending to the story, but what was for me a downbeat end is certainly in keeping with the background to Coel's story."},{"Title":"Wife Of Moon","review":"Margaret Coel writes an intriguing mystery which is based on the photographs which Edward Curtis took of the Plains Indians in the early 1900's. Curtis recreated battle scenes by hiringIndians to dress like their forefathers and relive scenes from the past. During one of these photo sessions an Arapaho woman is shot and killed. Her Anglo husband testifies that he saw three Indians murder his wife. With this as a background, the book shifts to the present-day Wind River Reservation, where an Arapaho woman is found dead. Father John O'Malley and Arapaho attorney Vicky Holden discover a connection between the Curtis photographs and the recent murder. Their investigation threatens a politician who is running for Senator and who advocates mining the natural resources on the reservation. As usual, Vicky and Father John grapple with their feelings for one another as they attempt to solve the murder and to do what is right. This is an altogether satisfying mystery which gives the reader a look at history and a feel for the Arapaho culture."},{"Title":"Wife Of Moon","review":"The murders begin in 1907 on the Arapaho Wind River Reservation when photographer Edward S. Curtis convinces the Indians to reconstruct a village and have warriors attack the tribe. During the shooting with blank bullets, Bashful Woman, the daughter of Chief Sharp Nose, is killed by a real bullet. Her Anglo husband Carston Evans testifies that he saw the Indian Thunder kill his wife and his two Native American friends were adding him in the attack. His testimony was enough to convict and hang the trio.In the present, Denise, a descendant of Sharp Nose is murdered and her husband J.T. Painted Horse is the FBI's number one suspect until he is tortured and killed by men who were looking for something on the same night Denise died. Christine, the curator of the Arapaho Museum, disappears and her home is ransacked. Lawyer Vicky Holden and Father John O'Malley investigate the homicide from different directions, but reach the same conclusion. Vicky tries to convince the authorities who she believes is behind the murders while Father John tries to protect the last remaining witness.Through the use of flashbacks readers learn what really happened on that day in 1907 and how justice was thwarted. The Arapaho still seek justice for Bashful Women in the present but they are up against high powered politicians who will use any means at their disposal to erase the proof of what happened almost a century ago and they will kill anyone who has knowledge of that event. WIFE OF MOON is an exciting who-done-it that will appeal to fans of Tony Hillerman and David and Aimee Thurlo thrillers. Margaret Coel provides a deep look at the Arapaho culture wrapped around a fabulous mystery.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Wife Of Moon","review":"WIFE OF MOON (Margaret Coel; Berkley Prime Crime) continues the distinguished Wind River series that follows the interlocking lives of Father John O'Malley and lawyer Vicky Holden. Two mysteries almost a century apart interweave across the storylines, but the strongest mystery here is the relationship between John and Vicky and their futures. Will she star a new life with her new lawyer love interest? Will the Jesuit powers above Father John whisk him away and take the reservation mission in a new direction? The evocative use of language is as compelling as ever in Coel's work. Reading her, I often have to go to my window to make sure I'm still in Pennsylvania and haven't somehow been magically transported to Wyoming. She keeps me on the edge of my chair, wondering what will happen to these two people and how she has managed to get me to invest so much in them. I'll definitely be back to find out when her next Wind River mystery appears. One for my Agatha nomination list."},{"Title":"Wife Of Moon","review":"I find life among the Arapaho as she describes it infinitely fascinating, and wish she would spend more time on that than she does. She's very good in her description of the setting, also, and I can easily imagine myself on the Wyoming Reservation.This is the umpteenth book in the series (10th?) in which a Jesuit priest (who is with the St. Francis Mission) and his friend, an Arapaho attorney, solve mysteries on the reservation. The plot in this series is two-fold (turn of the 20th century and early 21st century) and revolves around an old photograph by Curtis on display in the mission's museum. The photo depicts a staged attack on a phony Arapaho village. In the course of shooting that photo, a woman was killed, so some chapters describe the events around this historic murder, while others describe some present day crimes that appear to be linked to the Curtis photographs in some way. A woman is murdered and her husband is the chief suspect, but on the same night, the newly-hired curator at the museum disappears. Then there's the visit from the Senator who may be declaring himself as a candidate for President -- how does that tie in?Coel is an excellent writer, although she makes some blunders that a fact-checker or good editor could help her with. Like all the other states, for example, Wyoming has two senators, not a sole representative in Washington, and it is highly unlikely that a person who has only been curator for a month would have had time to mount an exhibition, particularly one that involves borrowing materials from another collection. These things take years, not weeks.So -- I think perhaps Ms. Coel is under pressure to keep turning these best-selling books out and that's a pity, because this is quite a good book in other respects. Coel is a great story teller. I'm also happy to see that the unrequited love theme between the priest and the lawyer is being downplayed."},{"Title":"Wife Of Moon","review":"Wife of Moon is the first I've read of Margaret Coel's novels, and I'm going to read her earlier ones. In Wife of Moon, Father John O'Malley and Arapaho attorney Vicky Holden set out to clear T.J. Painted Horse, one of the most prominent and opinionated men on the Wind River Reservation, of the murder of his wife, Denise.O'Malley and Holden discover that a display of old photographs on display on the reservation may be tied into Denise's death. In 1907, photographer Edward S. Curtis visited the Wind River Reservation to capture the Arapaho way of life. A murder, for which three Arapaho were executed, occurred when Curtis staged an attack on a village. O'Malley and Holden must not only delve into history, but filter the faults and frailties of the people around them to discover who caused the present, and past, killings.Coel's characters stay with the reader after the last page. Their problems are believable, and lead them to make flawed decisions, sometimes with miserable consequences. And we care about these people. Though the reader may figure out who the \\"bad guys\\" are, the danger around O'Malley and Holden will keep the pages turning.D.T. Atkinson"},{"Title":"Wife Of Moon","review":"Margaret Coel has a new fan. This is the first Coel novel I have read and I truly enjoyed it. Coel deftly weaves the murder of an Arapaho woman in 1907 to a present day murder of another Arapaho woman. In 1907 Edward S. Curtis captures the murder of Bashful by her White husband during a stagged attack on an Indian village, but the evidence remains hidden for nearly a century. When a Wyoming Senator, the grandson of that long ago White man, wants to make his bid for U.S. President Curtis's pictures become important enough for him to kill for, and that he does by killing a direct descendent of Bashfu in order to keep the truth hidden.Despite the obvious history between Coel's key characters; Attorney Vicky Holden and Priest, John O'Malley, the reader does not need to know about it to have the story make sense.There are some disappointments in Coel's writing. For example, the Wind River reservation is comprised of Arapaho and Shoshone, not just Arapaho, and there was not one mention of the Shoshone. There is no Arapaho County in Wyoming, but there is one in Colorado where Coel is reported to live. More detail to the traditional and contemporary lives of the Arapaho people would have made the book that much more interesting. All in all it was a good read."},{"Title":"Wife Of Moon","review":"Margaret Coel's skillful depiction of a historic fact conjured alive as fiction in WIFE OF MOON makes for a page-turner. Set on the Wyoming Wind River Reservation, Coel's novel is rich in Arapaho culture, language and lore. Her word paintings of Arapaho people, both past and present, bring them alive with artistic reality.In 1907, when the Arapahos had moved from small tipi villages to the larger reservation, Edward S. Curtis arrives to photograph warriors raiding the peaceful settlement. He has to stage the event because the families no longer live in tipis of former days. Three warriors, dressed in full battle regalia, ride down a steep slope into the village and launch the staged attack. Stunned silence in its aftermath reveals that the raid has been deadly. Live ammunition, not blank rounds, has killed Bashful Woman, daughter of a Chieftain. Prairie justice demands a hanging.The scene shifts to the Wind River Reservation of today. Father John O'Malley is the mission pastor, a tall, red-haired picture of his Irish background, tenured here and unwilling to pass the responsibility to his new assistant, Father Damien Henley. His people need him. His path crosses that of Vicky Holden, an Arapaho attorney originally from the village who represents T.J. Painted Horse after the man's wife, Denise, is found dead. Suicide seems likely, but murder surfaces in the investigation.To complicate matters, the mission is host to a powerful senator's entourage in the days following the grisly discovery. T.J., as tribal councilman, has led protests against the recovery of oil from coal reserves on Indian land, in opposition to the Senator's views. The Mission's museum is showplace for an exhibit featuring Curtis's photographs from the 1907 raid on the village. But the new museum curator, Christine Nelson, has vanished, along with her Range Rover.Father John consoles his parishioners, relatives of Denise and T.J., while Vicky searches for answers. The two join as old friends to solve the increasing problems cropping up on the sleepy reservation.Coel's descriptions propel people into events with urgency, and she paints vivid word pictures across an October 1907 time line, weaving the scene into brilliant autumn hues of today's story. At times she is redundant with setting descriptions, a small deduction from her unique storytelling ability. For Margaret Coel followers, WIFE OF MOON is a pleasing addition to her Wind River Reservation series.--- Reviewed by Judy Gigstad"},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"When one has read many of the great and wonderful works of Mr. Vonnegut, this book leaves one cold.

Usually honest, often brutally so, Vonnegut works this book into a crecendo of cheesiness. What had potential to be a genuine classic like &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot;, &quot;Dead Eye Dick&quot; and &quot;Slaughter House Five&quot;, became nothing more than a cheap commentary on the human race with a sappy 'love thy neighbour' quality.

Vonnegut's usual rapid-paced prose and intense dialogue is largely absent in this somewhat preachy novel about wealth and charity. Though there are a few interesting scenes which may save the story from total failure, both the plot and main characters remain underdeveloped throughout most of the book. This was the first (and hopefully will remain the only) Vonnegut book I have ever struggled to finish."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"To paraphraze Winston Churchill, if you don't weep over Vonnegut's acclaimed social satire at 20, you have no heart. If you still weep while re-reading it at 35, you have no brain. By masterfully portraying the abyss between the \\"dirt-poor\\" and \\"filthy rich\\", wittily arguing that the latter are far more useless than the former, Vonnegut only casually mentions the fairly well-washed millions in between; the ground on which the demarcation lines are blurred, and his personal rules of humanism are frequently set aside in favor of garden-variety street smarts. Vonnegut's trademark quirky characters, vivid style, and tight, beautifully wrapped up plot are, as always, very useful weapons in his emotional blackmail: if you don't see the world on his terms, if you take neither side, be ashamed of yourself!

Nothing about this book could be considered excellent, nor original. The alleged wit of Vonnegut makes no appearance in this bit of tripe. The only somewhat redeeming facet of this book was the fact that everyone in it was useless: the Senator who obvioulsy bought his way into politics, the absent-minded heir to a fortune unearned even by his father, and the helpless souls of Rosewater, IN.

The message of the story is beyond cynical. The economic classes exist for a reason, and even though wealth being handed down to subsequent generations may seem unfair to most, it is the way of life and should be respected as such. This book carps on an issue that is just totally unfair to those who work hard for what they have, and they should most certainly have the right to pass it down to their sons and daughters. Doesn't posterity mean anything here? Maybe not. I do agree that the rich deserve to render a small amount of their wealth to the lower classes, but only through a fair taxation system.In an ideal world we would have more Mr. Rosewaters, mad with philanthropy, giving away their wealth as if the money would never end. Unfortunately, that's not how it is. That being the case, all of us should not hate those who have just because they don't lavish the have nots."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"After greatly enjoying some Vonnegut sci-fi, I was perhaps looking for the wrong thing with this book. It is a weird story about a nutty millionaire, who is in danger of losing his money to an assembly of the sleaziest twits you could possibly imagine. While there are many very funny asides, such as his love of Kilgore Troustian conceptions or the characterizations of the evil guys (one's posterior is \\"luminous when wet\\"), the plot is weak and far-fetched. For example, Rosewater's grandfather built his massive fortune by buying companies in accordance with their acronyms from the Bible's text! That is too silly to be satire. Moreover, Vonnegut's laments about the coldness and brutality of American capitalism are sentimental and even ignorant. He seems to have an obsession with rich people and money.Not recommended."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"Though a fine book, and at times laugh-out-loud funny, it doesn't quite live up to the high standards established by other works by Vonnegut. God Bless You Mr. Rosewater focuses on the titular character of Mr. Eliot Rosewater, a wealthy son of a congressman, with a sizable pension and large estate he is set to inherit. Despite his extraordinary wealth he spends the majority of his time focusing on philanthropy, while imbibing large quantities of alcohol, and alienating his wife. The plot revolves around the machinations of a lawyer who is attempting to prove that Eliots behavior proves he is insane, and therefore not an appropriate executor of the Rosewater estate.The novel suffers from the introduction of a multitude of characters which ultimately play no part in the resolution of the story. Despite being two hundred pages it takes the book several chapters to really get going and it feels like Mr. Vonnegut reused many of his wisdoms in cobbling together God Bless You Mr. Rosewater.

A very entertaining, quick read."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"..just as a sum of honey might properly be a leading character in a tale about bees.\\" This is the story of Eliot Rosewater, the money he has been entrusted with, and his sanity, or lack thereof. It is also the story of America, capitalism, and its sanity, or lack thereof. As expressed by Vonnegut's alter ego, Kilgore Trout, \\"The problem is this: how to love people who have no use?... if we can't find reasons and methods for treasuring human beings because they are human beings, then we might as well... rub them out.\\"This gradual effacement is the story of the residents of Rosewater County, Indiana, and the difficulty of loving them is the problem faced by Eliot Rosewater, and Kurt Vonnegut. These lost and lonely soles, consumed and regurgitated by the relentless appetite of American capital, are difficult creatures to love, indeed. Eliot Rosewater found a way, while Vonnegut was always conflicted between love, despair, and contempt (\\"sons of suicides seldom do well\\").This is Vonnegut at his most sardonic and contemptuous, the schizophrenic humanist and misanthrope. Thankfully, this is Vonnegut at his most socialist, and most of his venom here is directed at the ruling class: \\"Slurp from the Money River...slurp as much as you want, but try to keep the racket of your slurping down. A poor man might hear.\\"\\"P.S. Who really runs this crazy country? These creeps sure don't\\""},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"Vonnegut was required reading in High School many years ago, and I got hooked. He's a great writer, and, at least in my opinion, God Bless you Mr. Rosewater is one of his best. The writing still comes across as fresh, and the social commentary is surprisingly topical for us today. If you haven't read any Kurt Vonnegut, start with either this, or Slaughterhouse Five, I'm sure you will go from there!"},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"I've read a few books by Vonnegut and this one might be my favorite. This was a fast read, great satire, very funny. I loved the characters, especially the titular Mr. Rosewater."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"Eliot Rosewater was the scion of an extremely wealthy family- his grandfather had even married a Rockefeller. Eliot stood to inherit control of the vast family fortune through the Rosewater Foundation (a legal entity constructed to shield that fortune from taxation.) But then Eliot went off to WW2 to become a highly decorated Captain of combat infantry. He served with men from all walks of life. Oh yes, he also accidentally bayoneted a 14-year old non-combatant, and afterwards tried to throw himself under a truck. After this he was never the same, much to his rich and powerful family's distress. While he did come back to graduate from Harvard Law and assume control of the foundation, he started behaving...irrationally. He started to actually use the money to HELP people! He also started drinking, wandering, and visiting volunteer firehouses- among other eccentricities.Eventually, he ended up in Rosewater, Indiana- a depressed backwater that his family had long ago used up and abandoned to found the beginnings of their fortune. He found the people there to be without pride, without hope, without work. So he opened up an office over the liquor store in order to help anyone who needed his help. The sign on the door said simply, &quot;Rosewater Foundation: How Can We Help You?&quot; So Eliot Rosewater, philanthropist, poet, volunteer fireman, Harvard graduate, and drunk proceeded to help any and all that came to him for help.Needless to say his family could not allow such insanity to continue. Why even Eliot's psychoanalyst came to the conclusion that Eliot was a pervert. The nature of his perversion being the fact that he had channeled all his psychic energy into bringing Utopia to earth for all those in need. What could be more abnormal in modern, capitalist society?This is my absolute all time favorite Vonnegut novel- and I have read them all.Oh yes, it also offers one of the best descriptions of the absurdity and injustice of the class system in the U.S. As one of the characters asks, who does run this crazy country? These cr**ps sure don't."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"There was something in Vonnegut's first rush of books that is lacking in his later novels. Although I enjoy his later books and for the life of me I can't say what this mystery quality is, whatever it is it tends to elevate even his minor books into affairs that are far more memorable than they tend to be. Maybe because the themes and images he's using here were new to him and he was still comparitively young . . . I don't know. It's not for me to say. This novel has a simple premise and a simple plot and moves unsurprisingly from point A to point B and yet I still have an incredibly enjoyable experience reading it, even though I finished it basically on my lunch break over the course of maybe an hour and a half. The premise then is that Eliot Rosewater has a lot of love to give to the world and spends most of his time doing very nice things for people who are almost pathetic enough to not deserve it, simply because he was born rich and feels he has a lot to give to the world. A lawyer, meanwhile wishes to prove that he is insane and has it in him to make quite the case. The book basically waffles back and forth between the lives of the various people Eliot helps, the comically depressing lives of some of these people, a little Rosewater family history and the lawyer's attempt to gather information on Eliot's apparent insanity. All of these pieces don't cohere into the great whole that his absolute best books (like Slaughterhouse-Five) do, but the pieces themselves are great fun and Vonnegut's humanity has never been as apparent here. It doesn't have the grim central event like the bombing of Dresden to put everything in context but somehow he manages to make the book moving and hilarious at the same time. The plot of course is slight and it's a fairly direct book, though the ending is about as abrupt as can be (and is mentioned in a later Vonnegut book I think, fortunately I forgot about it). This won't ever be regarded as one of his classics but even a minor work by an author working at his peak is worth another look and while the rewards here may not be as grand, they're simple and pleasant in their own small way."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"Just as most of Vonnegut's novels follow a single character through a series of semi-plausible episodes, so does 'God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater'. However, unlike the others, this story does not rely on science fiction. Rather, it focuses on one man's struggle to affirm his sense of self against great odds. Seems like an appropriate theme in a society increasingly concerned with style and ignorant of substance."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"This book is a rather interesting one, with a fair dose of humor and philosophy. This is the first book by Vonnegut which I've read and I found his writing style easy to read and very entertaining and witty. I can't say I agree with his economic philosophy - I tend more toward capitalism than socialism - but I appreciate the unique way he put his ideas across. The titular character, Eliot Rosewater, is in charge of administering the family fortune with power to do whatever he wants with it. At one point in his life, he decides to abandon the trappings of a rich lifestyle in favor of a more modest one. He moves to a backwards county home to lots of people labeled as worthless by upper society. While there, he offers to help anyone in need however he can, whether it includes providing money or other types of support.While the people in need are very grateful to Eliot, most outsiders seem to look on his actions as evidence of his insanity. Eliot seems to be an alcoholic, but that bothers his father and others far less than his concern for the welfare of strangers. It's clear from Vonnegut's portrayal of Eliot's critics - his father and others each have their own issues - and the way they voice their criticisms that he's firmly on Eliot's side. Who wouldn't be - he's just a regular guy using his inheritance to help out the less fortunate. I find it interesting how Vonnegut seems to be pushing for people who can to help out the less fortunate, rather than having the government handling it. This approach to socialism is quite different - it's voluntary and individual. Even more importantly, Vonnegut makes a case against class distinction. The people Eliot helps need simple recognition as human beings and emotional aide even more than money. Too many people are like Eliot's father - too aloof and snobbish to give common people a second thought."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"Now that I have been writing book reviews on almost everything I read, I feel compelled to write at least a few words on this incredible novel of Kurt Vonnegut's - of which thousands of reviews have been written already.I kept having to check the publishing information to make sure that it was written 46 years ago and not 46 minutes ago. Some of the concepts are so prescient as to seem almost spooky. (Or perhaps that means they are timeless...but caught up in today's crazy political spectrum, I am going with the prophetic angle.)\\"Thus did a handful of rapacious citizens come to control all that was worth controlling in America. Thus was the savage and stupid and entirely inappropriate and unnecessary and humorless American class system created. Honest, industrious, peaceful citizens were classed as bloodsuckers, if they asked to be paid a living wage. And they saw that praise was reserved henceforth for those who devised means of getting paid enormously for committing crimes against which no laws had been passed. Thus the American dream turned belly up...\\" Can anyone say Wisconsin in 2011?And, \\"An even more instructive motto, in the light of history made by the Noah Rosewaters, might be: Grab much too much, or you'll get nothing at all.\\"I tore through this book, amazed not only by Vonnegut's amazing social commentary, but also by the small pauses of quiet beauty he describes, scenes of a country that was and might not be much longer. \\"That's such an American sound, you know? School out and the flag down? Such a sad American sound. You should hear it sometime when the sun's gone down, and a light evening wind comes up, and it's suppertime all over the world.\\" So descriptive...I can see and feel the scene exactly.I must thank my aunt again for what turned out to be one of my best birthday presents...a book that seems one written in the past but most applicable for our tenuous present. If only we had an Eliot Rosewater to save us, to realize the unjust reality he describes that so many Americans now live in.\\"...fright about not getting enough to eat, about not being able to pay the doctor, about not being able to give your family nice clothes, a safe, cheerful, comfortable place to live, a decent education, and a few good times? You mean shame about not knowing where the Money River is?\\"\\"The what?\\"\\"The Money River, where the wealth of the nation flows. We were born on the banks of it - and so were most of the mediocre people we grew up with, went to private schools with, sailed and played tennis with. We can slurp from that mighty river to our hearts' content.\\"Because even in a land where there is the theoretical chance that a person can become \\"self made\\", what matters now more than ever, is how close one was born to that magical Money River."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"With \\"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\\", Vonnegut takes on the sordid issue of class. The main character, Eliot Rosewater, has inherited vast wealth, but feels lost and adrift until he moves to a small town and spends all his time giving \\"uncritical love\\" and money to the depressed, disenfranchised locals. His behavior completely mortifies his elitist Senator Father and psychologically troubled princess wife. It also allows a greedy young lawyer ammunition to have him declared insane; the only way possible to get his hands on part of his fortune.If recent studies have shown that rich people are no more intelligent (at least in terms of IQ) than poor people, this is something that Vonnegut clearly knew decades ago. It's clear from this novel that he believed that the \\"haves\\" and \\"have-nots\\" were usually separated by little more than luck; usually involving being born into the right circumstances. Eliot's father subscribes to the conventional American wisdom that hard work is all it takes to succeed. Eliot's idol, Science Fiction writer Kilgore Trout, has a more ambivalent point of view. The reader is left to make their own conclusion."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"Okay, so God Bless You... may not be the the best thing Vonnegut's ever written, but Vonnegut on an off day is still well worth reading. This book has all his trademarks, from biting social commentary and blazing satire to dark humor and quirky characters. It's a speedy read that will make you both laugh and wince by turns. Don't make it the first Vonnegut book you read -- for that, I'd suggest Slaughterhouse 5 -- but if you're a fan give it a whirl."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"In \\"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\\" Kurt Vonnegut (one of my favorite authors) takes on the class system, capitalism, and philanthropy to splendid, wickedly funny -- and hopelessly accurate -- effect. It is the tale of the Rosewater family, which has amassed a fortune totalling $87,472,033.61 and devised an elaborate foundation to protect their money from the American government that would try to tax it away from them. Through meaningless acts of \\"charity\\" (such as loaning expensive art to a museum for an exhibition, and then taking it back) the foundation ensures that the Rosewater fortune will always be firmly controlled by the Rosewater family. Trouble brews when an ambitious young lawyer decides to prove that the current foundation head, Eliot Rosewater, is crazy so that an estranged cousin can take over -- getting the lawyer a nice chunk of the family fortune in the process. This will not be so difficult to do because Eliot has been doing the unthinkable since taking over the foundation from his Senator father: he has been using it to do actual charitable work. You see, Eliot suffered a breakdown after accidentally killing three innocent firefighters (one a mere fourteen years old) in Europe during WWII. Desperate to atone for his mistake, Eliot has returned to his hometown of Rosewater, Indiana to make a difference in the world. Within a year he has spurned the wealthy families in town who aspire to his company and come to be revered by the impoverished townsfolk as a saint. He helps anyone who needs it -- in one instance he has an abusive husband arrested, then turns around and hires him a lawyer when he can't afford one on his own. To the world at large these are the actions of a man who has totally lost his mind. But has he?Vonnegut masterfully navigates the reader through the saga of the Rosewater clan and the novel's themes with only one stumble to be found in the all-too quick ending. The rest of the book forgives this mistake. You can't go wrong with Vonnegut, and in \\"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\\" the remarkable author is at his satiric best."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"Eliot Rosewater is giving away his money (and love and attention) to deserving people... and some maybe not so deserving. This proves he is crazy. Hence the subtitle \\"Pearls Before Swine.\\"That's the setup in this minor Vonnegut novel. Eliot has no illusions about the quality of the people he sometimes helps or how far his help will go. But he insists that the world would be a better place if everyone gave a little something to each other. This in turn sets Eliot up for a confrontation with a lawyer and his Senator father as the family fortune is threatened because Eliot can be proven insane. After all, he's giving it away. He must be crazy. Kilgore Trout comes to the rescue with his usual comically inverted (and yet somehow truer) morals.This isn't Vonnegut's best but it is a pleasant and gentle novel with a bit of a moral and some good comic moments. A nice read."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"&quot;God Bless you, Mr. Rosewater&quot;, is one of Kurt Vonnegut's greatest books. It is based around Eliot Rosewater, a warm hearted, eccentric millionare, and presendent of the Rosewater Corporation, a incredibly rich foundation that is passed along from father to son. He abandons the high life in NYC, and moves to Rosewater County in Indiana, his family's home. Eliot begins to help the poor people (which is all of Rosewater County) with their personal problems, and soon becomes the &quot;father&quot; of them all. A lawyer, seeking the Rosewater fortune for himself, sets out prove that Eliot is insane. I won't tell you the ending, but suffice to say that it is excellent. Vonnegut shows us thatmoney isn't everything, and a poor person from Indiana is just as important as a Senator from New York. A matchless book."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"This isn't one of Vonnegut's best, but like every other Vonnegut book I have read, it is extremely entertaining and fun to read.

However, the line between \\"insane\\" and \\"saintly\\" is very blurry...As with most Vonnegut, the \\"plot\\" is the weakest element, and one reads the work for the dark humor and social insights. This is especially the case here, where things fall apart at the last chapter in (to me) a most unsatisfactory and unsatisfying way. Given the number of 5-star reviews, others are much more forgiving about this.Not KV's best, but not his worst, either.

Upon his death, I vowed to read him. Finally five years later, I finally tried this one, primarily because it was a book at hand.As to its being almost 50 years old, it holds up well. One reason is that there are no direct references to the Vietnam War or the Civil Rights movement to date it. There is an openly gay character who is naturally woven into the story, which is unusual for the time. The theme is even more relevant now that what was once the 10% has become the 1%.The novel began with a great satire. Somewhere in the middle the satire was no longer subtle. Perhaps it would be a better short story, or an even shorter novel. The ending was unsatisfactory, almost as though Vonnegut didn't know exactly how he wanted to end it.I'm not sure where or how this fits in with the Vonnegut oeuvre, but it didn't meet my expectations for this writer.

Eliot Rosewater has no ulterior motives; he just wants to make people happy. GBYMR proves Vonnegut has range, as he can swing from the gloom of &quot;Slaughterhouse V&quot; to the bright outlook presented by GBYMR: That people really do have the capacity for good."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"Eliot Rosewater could be someone you know. Though caught up in a family struggle of money and power, Rosewater himself wants nothing more than to read the science fiction novels of Kilgore Trout and be a volunteer fireman. Here, Vonnegut uses his great skill of detailing characters to bring this tremendous, lovable character to life. In the background, of course, are the usual life-problems which bring a tinge of dark humor and a sometimes muddling subplot about Rosewater's money which surround him in his life. A gratifying, and greatly humorous experience"},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"In one of his last books, Vonnegut imagines a meeting with Eugence Debs, American socialist.\\"As long as there is a lower class, I am it it,\\" Debs once said, \\"As long as there is a criminal element, I am of it. As long as there is a soul in prison, I am not free.\\"Vonnegut had to report to Debs that people \\"snicker and snort\\" at that quote today. But they reacted the same way, Vonnegut implied to Debs, to the Sermon on the Mount.And so, Mr. Rosewater, leading messiah of \\"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater,\\" was snickered and snorted at. Of course, Vonnegut made this snickering and snorting funny. He also made it touching.Read \\"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\\" to see Christ's message clarified by Vonnegut; to see him sadly observe how this message in received in today's America--land of the ridiculous and home of the insincere."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"This book, which has been touted as a &quot;brilliant satire on almost everything&quot;, is, in fact, one of Vonnegut's second-rate novels. It is perhaps his most pessimistic, cynical, darkest book of them all. It's also different from the majority of his work in that it is fairly straight-forwardly written; it doesn't jump around on narrative detours like most of his books do. The story is told in fairly linear fashion. It is certainly a good book, and a nice, quick read (like all Vonnegut, it has that indescrible weird factor - not suspense, in the typical fashion - that keeps you reading it); it's just that it doesn't have that Great Underlying Moral like his best books do. The book's main character is Eliot Rosewater (undoubtedly a familar persona to Vonnegut fans), and he gives in this book - to everybody - what seemingly no one is willing to give these days: unconditional love. In turn for this, he is spit on by the world. This book says, in typical Vonnegut candor, Help people; you won't be appreciated for it, and you will probably even be ridiclued, but do it, anyway. It also says, Most people don't deserve help - they are worthless, useless, and stupid - but do it, anyway. Also, this book is a sharp-toothed satire of the American welfare system. Vonnegut's view of welfare echoes mine: it was a good idea to start out with, but its usefulness has passed. People who don't need it are milking it shamelessly, and the time has come to drastically re-organize it, or dispense with it alltogether. Vonnegut also tackles the issue of inherited wealth, and all forms of riches you earn by birthright, or other similar cirumstances, without actually earning yourself. Of course, this inevitably raises the subject of Communism. This book has a lot of interesting ideas, and points, but they are never brought together into that single, incredible cohesive whole, like they are in his best books. Certainly, it is a worthy read for fans; others, however, would be wise to start elsewhere."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"Out of all Vonnegut's novels, this is by far the best. One reason is that there are no sci-fi trappings, no silliness about time travel or aliens, nothing but a real study of American history and the impact of wealth and greed on the ideal of democracy. While short and exceedingly easy to read, the book feels like an epic narrative, since it sweeps from the very rich to the very poor, from the battlefields of the Civil War to the modern sailing playgrounds of the very rich. It feels much longer and richer than it is in terms of page count alone.For the first and last time, Vonnegut takes the time to outline a realistic setting,Rosewater County Indiana, and observes the effects of poverty there with all the power (but none of the sentimentality) of John Steinbeck at his best. At the same time he cuts back to New York, writing about the rich Rosewater clan and the wealthy families of Pisquontuit with all the power (but none of the sentimentality) of Edith Wharton. Last of all, he uses a brilliant series of flashbacks to describe America's tragic fall from the courage and carnage of the Civil War to the squalor and self-indulgence of America today. The Civil War sections alone are unique in Vonnegut's work; he captures the horror of the casualty rates without in any way denying or shying away from the ideals of the Union Army. He writes about the civil war with all of the power (but none of the sentimentality) of Southern apologists like Charles Frazier.Eliot Rosewater is an ideal American hero,and a fascinating foil to Billy Pilgrim in SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE. Both are All-American guys. But where Billy is an average Joe, Eliot is a scion of wealth and privilege. Where Billy is a ninety eight pound weakling, Eliot is a sailing and tennis champ. Billy is a one-dimensional anti-war propaganda device, (too \\"pure\\" to acquire even the most basic military discipline) while Eliot is a much-decorated officer who fights well and suffers as only a brave man can.The greater power of Eliot Rosewater means that the stakes are much higher. Unlike Billy Pilgrim, Eliot is not a passive weakling but a crusader who sacrifices wealth and privilege to help the poor. His warmth, gentleness and paternal concern for the less fortunate are rendered with tenderness and humor. Vonnegut creates a convincing modern day saint and gives him a real experience among fully realized victims of modern America.As always in Vonnegut, the few flaws in the book all involve women. Eliot's wife Sylvia is flayed raw again and again as a spoiled socialite who simply can't muster up the gumption to stand by Eliot's side. Vonnegut apologizes for her -- but with a sneer. He never seems to have realized that not all women are as fragile and treacherous as his own mother, who, as he never gets tired of telling us, abandoned him by committing suicide at an early age. By the same token, Fred Rosewater of Rhode Island, Eliot's distant cousin, is rendered as gentle and long-suffering, while his wife Caroline is a one-dimensional shrew. Vonnegut can't get away from an instinctive hostility to women as women, as if the mere biological condition of womanhood were some sort of moral weakness.His social criticism, as bracing as it is, often suffers as a result. For example, in the Rhode Island section, he feels like lashing out at the rich, so he writes (quite memorably) \\"four fat, stupid, silly widows in furs were laughing over a bathroom joke printed on a cocktail napkin.\\" Hell of a sentence! Sounds like Joseph Cotten in SHADOW OF A DOUBT. But what does it really mean?What's odd here is that Vonnegut is attacking the rich, only it seems he only means women. And what he hates about women is that they know about sex? That they enjoy sex? That sex exists? That somehow wanting sex killed off the men folk? As Thackeray's Becky Sharp puts it, he leaves women under the weight of an accusation that is, after all, unspoken.Still, this is the one Vonnegut book that really has the feel of a fully accomplished novel, a genuine American classic. It has moral depth and epic scope that he never achieved again."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"Vintage KV. An excellent yarn that occasionally moves along a bit slowly and with somewhat of a predictable outcome.Every town should have a Rosewater and yet we are most assured that for every Rosewater there is the plotting scheming lowlife lawyer in the weeds.In the end, right triumphs over the system.Def worth the price."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"&quot;God Bless you, Mr. Rosewater&quot;, is one of Kurt Vonnegut's greatest books. It is based around Eliot Rosewater, a warm hearted, eccentric millionare, and presendent of the Rosewater Corporation, a incredibly rich foundation that is passed along from father to son. He abandons the high life in NYC, and moves to Rosewater County in Indiana, his family's home. Eliot begins to help the poor people (which is all of Rosewater County) with their personal problems, and soon becomes the &quot;father&quot; of them all. A lawyer, seeking the Rosewater fortune for himself, sets out prove that Eliot is insane. I won't tell you the ending, but suffice to say that it is excellent. Vonnegut shows us thatmoney isn't everything, and a poor person from Indiana is just as important as a Senator from New York. A matchless book."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"'God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater' is a novel about conflicting social viewpoints, specifically, socialism vs. capitalism (although, to be fair, I would have to say ultra-capitalism, considering the vast wealth of all the people involved). I am a huge Vonnegut fan, and although this book was good, and had many quotable lines, it was missing a key element that most Vonnegut stories have in abundance: a plot. There is no actual plot here, nor is there really a resolution. The psuedo-plot follows the attempt by Eliot Rosewater to use his inherited vast fortune to help the less fortunate, while his father attempts to bring him back into the fold (start using his money for what it was intended, making more money), before an opportunistic lawyer from the firm that handles the Rosewater fortune declares Eliot insane, thus putting the money in the hands of another branch of the Rosewater family. In reality, the book is mostly a social commentary centering mostly on debates/arguments between Eliot (the \\"socialist\\") and his father (the \\"capitalist\\"). What I found really amazing in the book, is how it illustrates the genuine fear that the rich have of any type of socialism, not because it threatens their vast wealth (that is pretty secure), but because it runs contrary to the way they believe things are supposed to be, the most extreme type of social darwinism. The rich in this novel don't consider the system to be unfair and they don't consider themselves \\"lucky\\", in fact, they look at the fact that they are rich as proof that they actually ARE better than everyone, and that their fortune is actually given to them in a divine manner, as if God himself chose them to be rich and above everyone else. Most of the characters in this book, especially the Rosewaters, are all on the extreme side of their coin, probably not reflecting any sort of reality, but it does make the book fun to read. Who will like this book? Only Vonnegut fans probably, or anyone that wants to see capitalism and the rich portrayed in the worst possible way."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"GOD BLESS YOU MR.

Instead of a large invisible rabbit, Eliot chooses as his soulmate science-fiction writer Kilgore Trout, who becomes a sort of imaginary best-friend to Eliot, and, like Harvey, only asserts his actual presence at the end of the story. The book is better than the play (or the James Stewart movie, for that matter), but it is not one of Vonnegut's best.

Years since I read Vonnegut and it is time to read more. The storyline takes you in and Kurt's writing style created the appropriate intimacy. A very nice read."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"Though this is not quite his best or most complex work, I enjoyed this novel for many reasons. First, it does lean heavily towards a Socialistic viewpoint. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. The novel is a thinly veiled critique towards capitalism and a sadly poignant look at the future of the impoverished. One man makes it his life's goal to help out the unfortunates using his money and position. He is then considered mentally unsound by those who are in positions of power and authority.The book is well written in typical satirical Vonnegut style. The novel is not as compelling or deep as Slaughterhouse Five or Cat's Cradle, but it is an enjoyable, top notch work by itself. If one didn't have an entire body of Vonnegut works to compare this to, it would stand out as a very good novel by itself (hence my four star rating). Just compared to other Vonnegut novels it is slightly lacking."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"Vonnegut's humanism and compassion for our frailties is as fresh and relevant now as it was decades ago when this sensitive, funny, and insightful book was written."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"God Bless you Mr. Vonnegut because only you could still be this good in what remains one of your lessor books.Ostensibly the story of 87 million dollar plus inheritance, this book tells the tale of a man and a family beset by the duties of wealth.On the one side we have Elliot Rosewater, the young heir who disdains personal use of the money to devote in service of others. Instead of a hair shirt, Elliot drinks constantly, wears dirty clothes and sleeps in the makeshift office of his own Rosewater foundation from which he disperses periodic grants of money to the needy.On the other side, we have Senator Rosewater, Elliot's father, who's fosuced more about on what the money can do for him. Senate, a place in society, a concern for producing priviledged and dominant decendents so he can better the value of the Rosewater name.We feely oddly uncomfortable to the extent we empathize with the Senator and chagrin at the son.And in the end we wonder at Elliot's actions. How do or don't they ultimately service his father's ends?Regardless of these issues, Vonnegut is always good reading but for first time Vonnegut readers I would probably suggest Slaughterhouse Five and Cat's Cradle in that order. Read him when he was being really really deep instead of just deep."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's book, God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater is about money, power, and greed. The main character, Elliot Rosewater has abandoned his amazing lifestyle in New York to try an experiment of the human soul. He is a drunk, fat, dirty, and rich. He has a lot to give to the world and spends his time doing nice things for people, yet these people are so pitiable, they don't deserve it. Not everyone is happy with Eliot's work. Lawyers try to find him insane and unable to use the family fortune. The books switches between the lives of people Eliot helps, the depressing lives of some of them, the lawyers attempt to find Eliot insane and some Rosewater family history. Vonnegut makes you question Eliot's insanity or his overly niceness to the very end. It also questions the class system in America. The book has its funny moments. Overall it was an alright book and I recommend it if you want a quick, humorous read."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"Vonnegut is one of those genius writers that you can't help but love. \\"Slaughterhouse 5\\" was my first venture into the realm of Vonnegut, but I have to say that I think I enjoyed this tale much more. Perhaps because the topic is closer to my heart, or perhaps I was able to identify more closely with the characters, I found this novel to be both thought provoking and utterly hysterical.The short synopsis - The heir to a ridiculously large family fortune would rather spend his days helping the poor and destitute than attending the large social gatherings which his family feels he should prefer. Naturally this means that he is insane right? His family and one rather unscrupulous attorney seem to think so. They begin their plans on having him declared mentally incompetent, but he may have a trick or two up his sleeve.I often find that I have to be in the right mood to read through a Vonnegut book, for some reason this one gripped me and I was done with it in less than 2 hours. The characters were hysterical, slightly caricaturistic and over the top, but entirely identifiable and comparable to someone we all know. This entire tale is a treatise on capitalism, money, redistribution of wealth, and the question of selflessness vs insanity. If you like Vonnegut, then this is already on your list. If you haven't encountered Vonnegut, give this book a try for an amusing look at true satire."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"There are similarities between the theme of this book and Nick Hornby'sHow to Be Good. It's hard to tell if they come to different or similar conclusions. Hornby suggests that one person or even one family is not able to fix what needs fixing in the world singlehandedly and shouldn't try; one should instead try to keep oneself functional and have much more modest ambitions as regards altruism. In this book, Vonnegut uses satire and exaggeration to point out the \\"craziness\\" and yet the necessity of loving others unconditionally, even when there seems to be little to love about them, or when there are some very good reasons for withholding love, e.g. alcohol addiction or a criminal record. Both deal with the basic question of what attitude we should have toward people in need whose acquaintance doesn't seem to promise us any personal advantage.I originally chose this book because of a New York Times article - it was about deodorant use, and it cited this book as describing a country where odors, thought to be society's biggest problem, were finally eliminated by eliminating people's noses. I found it an interesting premise and kept reading and reading to find it, but it didn't turn up until almost the end of the book, as a half-page summary of one of the science fiction books the protagonist had read. Ah well, at least I found it, and I ended up reading a book I probably wouldn't have picked up or even known about otherwise.I give this book four stars first because it felt quite disconnected, jumping from one incident and set of thoughts of a certain character to another. There are paragraphs with profound insights that I enjoyed and agreed with, e.g. about the value and drawbacks of imperfect human life vs. boring ethereal perfection (disguised as a novel the protagonist was writing), or the part about language teaching on planets that had previously used only mental telepathy (from a book by a science fiction writer the protagonist likes), but these bits seemed to be thrown in simply because the author found them worthwhile and had no other handy place to put them. Maybe they were seeds of ideas that Vonnegut didn't have the time, motivation or adequate material to develop into whole books.Second, for a long time I was wondering where the story would go, and why what I was reading at any given moment was worth getting through. I suppose in the end it did all contribute to the final point Vonnegut wanted to make, but you have to wade through quite a bit of frivolousness to get there. The book is short, but the silliness prevented me from sticking with it too long in one sitting - I mostly had to take it one or two chapters at a time then put it down for a while.I think _Rosewater_ was worthwhile, though, and if you're a Vonnegut fan, and/or enjoy philosophical farce, you might like it too."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"Although it's probably destined to wallow in the monolithic shadows of Slaughterhouse-Five and Cat's Cradle, God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater is a superb novel and an easy gem (albeit a relatively minor one) in the Vonnegut canon. At heart, it's a sharp, satirical, and darkly funny portrait of American capitalism at its worst, and a genuinely engrossing tale of one man's attempt to change things for the better.The man in question is Eliot Rosewater, a drunken volunteer fire fighter and renegade philanthropist. He's also the privileged heir to a massive family fortune and the President of a charitable organization that was established by his family as a thinly veiled tax shelter. After an eventful stint in the Second World War, Eliot decides to use his vast wealth in order to help people. He moves to a desperately poor town named after his family, and makes it his mission to unconditionally love and support every human being that asks for his help. When his family learns that he's actually using a charitable organization's funds to carry out acts of charity, he's declared everything from irresponsible to insane. Soon, his wife is divorcing him, his father is on the verge of a nervous breakdown, and a conniving lawyer is carrying out a devious plan to take a chunk of the Rosewater fortune for himself.In Vonnegut's hands, this disturbingly realistic premise becomes the ideal framing device for his own razor-sharp commentary on class, wealth, greed, politics, love, and the ever-elusive American Dream. The story is told with plenty of characteristic dark humor and sly sarcasm, balanced by a genuine affection for humanity and an oddly graceful ending.It's not his best novel- the story does drag in a few places, and there is a notable lack of focus- but its still an excellent work. Get this if you're a Vonnegut fan."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"This is perhaps the most underrated piece of American fiction in the last 50 years. Much more complex than a traditional anti-affluence screed too often attributed to this work, it's drives right at the heart of what women and men are good for, whether we, all of us, are productive, are lovable. Also entertaining but read it for what it has to say about what to do with the 90% of us who are generally unproductive (both rich and poor!)."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"Mark Twain, Orwell, Houellebecq, Vonnegut. Without a doubt some of the best social science out there was not produced in Ivy League schools but out of cranky typewriters in a basement (well, Vonnegut was in Cornell). From the first devastating sentence on (money and honey) this book is a direct indictment of inherited wealth and the so-called \\"free-enterprise\\" system. For Vonnegut innovation and creativity are not related to acummulation, but stealing is. Vonnegut shares with Thorstein Veblen (cited on the text) his admiration for people that really do productive things, and mixes it with the sadness of somebody who knows what is going to happen to those people in the \\"service economy\\". The end of the book seems abrupt, but is very sweet and rewarding (\\"yeah!\\" I screamed). By the way, please note that the baddest character in the book is not the rich and conservative senator but the lawyer trying to steal his way into riches. So true."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"I just finished this book, and I absolutely loved it. This was the last Vonnegut novel I hadn't read, and it was definitely a great summary of themes and beliefs he expresses in his other novels.To that end, I wouldn't recommend it as a first Vonnegut read. It's almost an essay about his views on the madness of capitalism in America.It's a great novel, no doubt, with a very satisfying ending. But if you've heard about Kurt Vonnegut and you just want to try it out, try \\"Slaughterhouse Five,\\" \\"Hocus Pocus,\\" \\"Cat's Cradle,\\" or \\"Mother Night.\\"You really can't go wrong with this amazing author, but \\"God Bless You Mr. Rosewater\\" might come off as a bit preachy if you don't know what you're getting into.That being said, it is still a great novel.

This classic by Kurt Vonnegut holds up really well. I found myself smiling and laughing out loud many times as I went through this fast paced page turner. However, it is not just the comedy in the book that grabs one. No it is the story itself and how relevant it is to what is going on today in the world of corporate greed, slimy politicians and the sad age of Supreme Court's false decision to make corporations \\"people\\" under Citizens United.

Meanwhile, the scion attempts to live as authentically charitably as he can. As one might expect, the issue is the scion's sanity.Mr. Vonnegut's writing here is typically quick and darkly humorous. Untypically, though, the target of his disdain doesn't appear worthy of the attention. Vonnegut takes on the industry/universe surrounding old unearned money/power and more-or-less effectively savages every component - including the recipients of the charity. Few sacred cows, however, are slain in the attack. Indeed, the book strikes me as almost rote - delivering exactly the characters and interactions one would expect from a satire of the old-monied. As my \\"star rating\\" shows, I don't find this to be a bad book or uninteresting, but it's not the quality of most of Vonnegut's other work. If you're starting on your Vonnegut, save this one for later."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"For me this wasn't on the level of Breakfast of Champions, Sirens of Titan, Cat's Cradle, etc but it was still very enjoyable and thoroughly Vonnegut.It's a quick read, and worthy of an afternoon or two beneath a tree."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"God Bless you Mr. Rosewater is a challenge to fight for social justice and to support the humanist motto if \\"God da-n it, you've got to be kind.\\" In his classic opening sentence, Vonnegut says \\"A sum of money is a leading character in this tale about people, just as a sum of honey might properly be a leading character in a story about bees.\\" Vonnegut uses skittish plots and a variety of curious characters to lay out a picture of America that is becoming more stratified by money and access to power. As the main character, the ill-begotten fortune is given a birth (original accumulation by Noah Rosewater who sent a substitute to the civil war, allowing him to stay home and make millions in the war effort) and a death (Eliot's surprise decision at the end).Pisquontuit, Rhode Island and Rosewater County, Indiana are the principle settings for the book and both are everyday small towns comprised of wealth and poverty. Vonnegut describes the inhabitants of each as \\"The lives led there were nearly all paltry, lacking in subtlety, wisdom, wit or convention - were precisely as pointless and unhappy as lives led in Rosewater, Indiana.\\" The stratification of wealth is most poignantly illustrated in his depiction of Pisquontuit, where Fred Rosewater intermittently enters the drugstore that has the coffee shop for the rich, then the news store that has the coffee shop for the poor.Although America's rich have devised laws to propagate their wealth untouched through the generations, you can still gain access to the \\"money river\\" by becoming a \\"slurper.\\" Norman Mushari, young lawyer, learned in law school that, \\"just like a good airline pilot should always be looking for places to land, so should a lawyer always be looking for situations were large amounts of money were about to change hands.\\" Hence comes the plot line. Eliot Rosewater is the heir to the $87,472,033.61 Rosewater fortune. To make sure he gets his dibs, Mushari wants to prove that Eliot is insane thereby redirecting the money river to a distant cousin, Fred Rosewater, in Pisquontuit.Besides Elliot Rosewater and Fred Rosewater, the third important Rosewater is Senator Lister Ames Rosewater. Clearly, he personifies the idea proposed by the subtitle \\"pearls before swine.\\" Similar to Ebenezer Scrooge prior to his visits from Christmas ghosts, Senator Rosewater represents the attitude of the aristocratic rich that social programs and wealth reallocation initiatives are frivolous because we should not waste good things on people who will not appreciate them.In usual Vonnegut style, the reader is clearly and repeatedly presented the theme of the book in no uncertain terms. Early in the book, he writes \\"When the United States of America, which was meant to be a Utopia for all, was less than a century old, Noah Rosewater and a few men like him demonstrated a folly of the founding fathers in one respect: those sadly recent ancestors hadn't made it a law in the utopia that wealth of each citizen should be limited. This oversight was engendered by a weak-kneed sympathy for those who love expensive things, and by the feeling that the continent was so vast and valuable, and the population so thin and enterprising, that no thief, no matter how fast he stole, could more than mildly inconvenience anyone.\\"Again, later in the book, Kilgore Trout has this to say in reference to Eliot's apparent capricious financial support of his neighbors' needs: \\"Well... what you did in Rosewater County was far from insane. It was quite easily the most important social experiment of our time, for it dealt on a very small scale with the problem whose queasy horrors will eventually be made world-wide by the sophistication of machines. The problem is this: how to love people who have no use?\\""},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"Eliot Rosewater is a fat and mediocre minded do-gooder. What makes him extraordinary is that he has the means, through the Rosewater foundation, to dole out money to anyone who requests a bit. In his home town of Rosewater, Indiana, where he has returned like the prodigal mad citizen, he ignores society, purchases an enormous fire alarm, bankrolls the fire company and personally answers 24 hour calls over two telephones- one for assistance and the other for fire emergencies. He has different composures, voices and rules for each. The cranks who phone him for money are old drunken, ugly spinsters, none too clean or honorable town 'handymen,' and his father, the famous Senator Rosewater; whom seeing his son, shrieks at God, for having handed him this vale of tears. Elliott drinks too much, cannot father an heir and has driven his otherwise loving wife to a arsonist's breakdown. She torched the Fire Company.Eliott has no grand plan of philanthropy, not even a cause, unless the volunteer firemen and their work count. He has a quasi Buddhist detachment from hatred as well as wealth and status. Plenty of people, especially the evil Norman Mushari, are out to filch his millions and crucify his reputation in the meantime.The book examines the Rosewater mutation whereby every couple of generations, a male is born with no aspiration. No desire to scratch and claw or otherwise greedily grasp power from others.Vonnegut's thematic puncturing of capitalism, European fatuousness and the nature of success and failure is showcased with the also unseemly nature of the non-wealthy and unsuccessful. Mushari goes face to face with the God of most of Vonnegut's cosmology- Kilgore Trout, science fiction writer. The book is part of the canon of this icon of an author and as such, I recommend it highly to one and all. The time when I first read it, was a time when I still found drunks a riot and even the smallest attack upon the status quo enormously satisfying. We are no longer that naive and yet the lessons and the funniness of just about everything can never be dated."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"This book has all the makings of a classic Vonnegut text. However, it lacks depth, and the plot never really thickens. By the end of the novel, I was asking myself, &quot;Wait, how did we get to this point in the story?&quot; The overall idealism which is used to give character development to Rosewater takes away from the reality of the situation. The novel does have rewarding characteristics, but I do not think this should be the first book by Vonnegut that one reads."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"What a fantastic book!

I strongly recommend this book to reluctant cynics and others looking for a witty, well written novel about the nature of human beings."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"Others have described the plot of this book quite adequately; I'd just like to add my own personal thumbs-up! I've read only one other Vonnegut book so far -- Breakfast of Champions -- but I'm already a big fan! Vonnegut is brilliant at tweaking the establishment in a blatant yet subtle way. And I love his sense of place -- places he's spent time in: Indianapolis, rural Indiana, New England. This book was a joy to read, and I'm looking forward to reading more of his books!"},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"This Kurt Vonnegut novel looks at Eliot Rosewater, a rich eccentric who decides to make the world (or at least his town) a better place. Rosewater is rich, drunk, blessed with a social conscience, and he sets out to help improve the lives of the lonely, the ignored, and the losers in the town of Rosewater, Indiana. For this philanthropy Rosewater is seen as insane or close to it. The story looks at both Mr. Rosewater and some of the people whose world he brightens. The book is a bit depressing at times, but contains a powerful message and quite a bit of critique at greed, hypocrisy and other human frailties. Some may note the similarity of two names (Rosewater, Roosevelt) who believed in helping people. This novel doesn't have quite the power of Vonnegut's top works like SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, but it's an entertaining read."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"I have only read a few Vonnegut books, and this is definately my favorite. It shows how greedy modern man is. Mr. Rosewater is ungreedy with his money, and because of this he is labeled insane and unfit to control his assets. A great book and I reccomend it to all Vonnegut fans."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"I thought Vonnegut wrote a great story about how greed clouds your vision. It is a very original story, and I thought it was both funny and sad. I thought it was funny how when a man was not greedy with his wealth, and handed it out freely, the hero was lebeled insane and locked up. I recomend this book to any Vonnegut fan."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"A very heartening story about the life of somewhat regular people. That is, not extravagent. Although very eccentric, but that's what one expects from KV. The story is pretty strong, and very funny along the way. Not a good first-time read from Vonnegut."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"I've been through most of the Vonnegut collection, and this is one of the better ones. The thing I love about Vonnegut, is he creates all these peripheral characters and Trout sci-fi plots that are such wonderful ideas in and of themselves. I wish he would explore them more fully. I especially would have liked to read more about Lila. Well, I guess it goes to show you good ideas are a dime a dozen."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"I would have to say that this book is one of the best Vonnegut books ever. This book releases a message to all of its readers. It has a strong story line and the characters are not all that different from our friends and our family. This book honestly changed the way that I looked at life and I would recommend the book to anyone and everyone. Take a chance and read it. This book has all of the elements that you could ever want: Humor, Satire, Irony, Sadness, and resolution. Long live Mr. Rosewater!"},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"I just finished reading this book for the first time since I was in college - and I am 43 now. It is much different than I remember it. Being a book about money and distribution of same, it is natural and right that I would see it much differently now, after being emeshed for years in the workaday capitalistic world, than when I was an idealistic college student. However, having said that, I wonder how much of the book REALLY is about money, and how much of it is really about pride, humanitarianism, and being a friend. Elliot Rosewater simply wants the world to be a better place. He does not really deceive himself into thinking that money itself is a cureall - he seems to understand that charity, in and of itself, is not the answer. Self respect and holding one's head up is. Is Elliot really crazy? Heck, yes! But just because he's crazy does not mean that all of his ideas and thoughts are insane. Like most of Vonnegut's books, this is a fable - you could pick it apart all day if you like on the facts and the contradictions - but that would not diminish it. It is a fine fable, and contains many truths. It's a good book."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"This book is truly a pearl. This work and &quot;Slaughter House Five&quot; are the two anchors of my Vonnegut collection. As I began to collect his books, I was like an avid junkie who couldn't wait to get her next wry-wit fix from Mr. Trout and company. I have gone through 2 copies of &quot;God Bless you Mr. Rosewater&quot; after being worn out from many re-readings but no matter how tattered &amp; torn, I still have them -- tape, notes in the margins and all! My collection, all in paperback, is one of my prized posessions that I hope to share with my child as my mother had done for me. You will enjoy this work and if it is your first experience with Vonnegut, what a treasure you have found!"},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"Vonnegut gives us an excellent commentary on the dichotomy of social hierarchies, as well as making us laugh out loud. He conflicted the drunk with all the money and the runty lawyer who wants to swindle him out of it. We can see that there are factions within factions and utterly wealthy men who still have hearts in this fictional world adorned by the ideas of a very inventive Mr. Kilgore Trout. Volunteer firemen, fishermen and senators all in one little book. Classic Vonnegut."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"I can understand why a lot of people might not like this book. It is a complete thrashing of the American system of Free Enterprise, so if you buy into social Darwinism (Republican?), you may find this book offensive. I am reading this book for the fifth time and I can tell you that it is the best book I've ever read. Rosewater is my favorite character Vonnegut has created. If you are open minded enough, this book could have quite an impact on the way you want to live your life. Due to our current political situation here in the US, there has never been a better time to read this book. Buy it and read it immediately. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"The strangely logical and materialistic style of Vonnegut, where mundane detail leads to astronomic conclusion. Half comic and half serious. A fun read.."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"\\"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\\" is indeed, as many reviewers have said, Mr. Vonnegut's most blatantly socialistic book. However, it is also quite obviously his most Christian. The text's protagonist, Eliot Rosewater, is nothing short of a benign Jesus figure. Numerous biblical references throughout the text are used as corollaries to Eliot's life and the plethora of those references make Vonnegut's point pretty obvious for the reader.This text is less plot driven than many of Vonnegut's other works, but its themes and importance I think are far superior to many of his better written novels. The first 100 pages or so can be a little dull (not normal in a Vonnegut text) and the slow start is something his readers may not be used to. However, the text does build to what I think is a wonderfully written and executed conclusion.Two highlights of the book are Eliot's baptism \\"sermon\\" for two twin boys that he is asked to baptize. Eliot has no religious titles or significance, so he just speaks to his hope for the boy's futures, ending with a simple and profound statement, \\"God damn it, you've got to be kind.\\" Another excellent moment in the text is a biting letter written by an orphan named Selena who is serving as the maid in a rich household. The letter is written to the man who runs the orphanage that she came from, and it has the bite and sting that can only come through the eyes of a child. Vonnegut is at the top of his game in these sections.Further highlighting the idea of Eliot as a Christ figure Vonnegut has Eliot well aware that those he helps are ingrates at best, and almost all are undeserving of his generosity and love. It is a great strength of the text that \\"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\\" freely admits that the people who need the help the most are often the most undeserving, and the acknowledgement of that is a great strength of the book.The most blatant Christian references, and I think the most powerful parts of the text, start on page 264 when Vonnegut has his go to character (Kilgore Trout) explain what Eliot was attempting to do by helping anyone who asked, regardless of the circumstances. The 6 pages where Trout \\"explains\\" the \\"experiment\\" are worth the price of the book alone. They are stunningly simple and beautiful. I was trembling with joy as I read them. It is really nothing less than a secular Sermon on the Mount.I won't ruin the end of the book here, but Vonnegut completes the obvious Christ archetype with Eliot in a manner that is unexpected, true to the character of Eliot, and perfect. And then Vonnegut in that way of his stops writing, it is over, the end. The rest is up to you. Very few novels make me think about my obligations to others in this world, this book did. It has stuck with me, and will. And for that I say God bless you, Mr. Vonnegut!"},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"Some of his books are terrific. This one is an extended short story. The theme is clear and the characters are well drawn, as usual. This is a minor work from one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"Like all Vonneguts, this is a pretty great book. It was not as good as \\"Cat's Cradle\\", but it was pretty close. If you finally want to know about the mysterious life of Eliot Rosewater who is one of the two people in the world to ever read Kilgor Trout, you have to read it."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"Although not quite up to the level of Breakfast of Champions, which is among my favorite books of all time, God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater is still a breathtaking, amazing, humorous read. In fact, after I finished it I was inspired to grab another of Vonnegut's works, Welcome to the Monkey House.Kurt Vonnegut's unique ability is to look at different aspects of the world around us that we take for granted as being \\"normal,\\" & then point out the absurdity of it all. In this book, one among several ideas that he takes aim at which many take for granted in everyday life is class distinction, and the huge effect it can have upon one's life: to have won the genetic lottery of being born rich. But what makes the main character, Eliot Rosewater, really strange is that he chooses to personally use his vast, family fortune to help people from his small, hometown of Rosewater, Indiana that the modern world has largely rendered without hope, use, or purpose. He does not just throw money at these people's problems, although he is not above doing just that. Humorously, he runs a dingy foundation located above the town liquor store all by himself, with a hotline written by hand in every phone booth throughout the city. That way, in between drinking himself into oblivion, he personally deals with all of the rundown inhabitants' problems, big & small. He is essentially an eccentric saint: a fat, disheveled, drunk, Harvard graduate with all the money in the world, who just wants to help people.Thus, an ambitious lawyer sets out to steal the family wealth by proving Eliot's selfless actions to be insane. Vonnegut once again pokes fun at what society deems \\"normal\\" behavior and how many regard being motivated purely by self interest as being the only rational course of action. As usual, Vonnegut introduces a number of strange & memorable characters, while keeping the reader laughing throughout. Kurt Vonnegut's unique take on the world is truly timeless & never seems to grow out of date, despite the fact that the book was written in 1965. Take a peek into the world of Vonnegut and come away knowing a little more about reality."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"I couldn't help being slightly disappointed with this one. I suppose one of your favorite authors will sometime let you down a little. It's still a good read, but considering he has so many other better books, this isn't essential Vonnegut, unless you are a big fan and want to read all his novels. It's true what everyone says about Vonnegut though, he is very addictive. Once you get into him you will want to read all of his work.That said, the book goes everywhere in all directions, one minute you are interested in what happens next, and then the book just goes off on something else and for a little too long. I enjoyed reading about Elliot's encounters and conversations with the people of Rosewater, but I wanted more. I enjoyed reading about Fred Rosewater, but it was almost too little, too late. And another big problem was that Vonnegut brings in a couple useless characters and talks about them and a past situation when we could be reading more Eliot or Fred. I know it's very Vonnegut and I understand the connections with the message, but it wasn't all a good thing with this one.I suppose Vonnegut said all that he wanted to say in this book, but I would have read more if it was there. It's a short, light read, and although it is preachy, it's still an honest and moral take on society and life, just don't expect it to be as good as, \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" or \\"Mother Night.\\""},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"\\"Laughter and tears are both responses to frustration and exhaustion. I myself prefer to laugh, since there is less cleaning up to do afterward.\\" Kurt VonnegutOn a mission to prove that Eliot Rosewater is legally insane, an attorney named Mushari is investigating Eliot's life, relationships, and actions. Between Eliot's strange relationship with his French wife, his drunkenness, and his overwhelming generosity, one can't tell if Eliot is insane or the world around him is insane.Vonnegut captures with great skill Eliot's sarcastic ideas and extremely dark, but funny jokes. At one point Eliot reads about the bombing of Dresden and his reaction is an expected outcome to the story and representative of Vonnegut's personal confrontation with one of the most important incidents of his own life.As Vonnegut writes in: \\"A Man without a Country\\": \\"Humor is an almost physiological response to fear.\\", the scattered stories of Eliot's interactions with the world describe the world's craziness with a loud laughing fear. \\"God bless you Mr. Rosewater\\" is another fabulous book by a gifted writer."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"Next to Breakfast of Champions, this is my favorite Vonnegut book. I found myself laughing, shaking my head at the absurdity of the book and how it correlates to the ideals we live with. It makes a bold statement, but does so in a subtle way. It lets the reader make connections and Vonnegut steers the reader with skill and precision."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater","review":"Mr. Vonnegut has put forth a great piece of literature that binds together the worlds of poverty and gross wealth in a study on what makes human beings worthwhile or worthless and the make up of the architect of man.This novel is a collage of introspection and lessons. Using religious allegory, Vonnegut shows that human beings are only human-- whether poor or rich. His god figurine, when all sculpted by the end of the book, shows the reader a view on the creator of man: entropic on the surface, yet acutely set in his ways of good, even after the denouncment of him by his people. Take this view however you wish.Vonnegut's god is all of us: rich, poor, filthy, crazy... the list goes on. And Vonnegut raises the strange question: Was God crazy for producing mankind?This novel is thought provoking, entertaining, and enlightening.

Powell had made the journey already a few years before, so the second voyage was less pure exploration and more science; the crew included Almon Harris Thompson (called affectionately &quot;Prof.&quot; throughout), a professional geographer who also happened to be Powell's brother-in-law. With several boats and men of widely varying experience, the expedition sailed the Green river (thought at that time to be the upper Colorado) to its junction with the Colorado, and the Colorado itself as far as the middle of the Grand Canyon. Swirling rapids, maggotty food, blistering heat, sudden blizzards beset the adventurers, who still though it all made their geographical, geological, and ethnographical observations which resulted in (among other things) the first maps of the four corners region and the Grand Canyon (reproduced in the book).While wild adventure, humor, and a real sense of the Old West permeate the book, there is a certain sadness, too. The Native Americans whom Dellenbaugh encounters are people clearly already defeated -- fearful, distrusting, sad. We catch glimpses of the Navaho trying to accommodate themselves to the new reality of white (especially Mormon) settlement, creating new networks of trade focused on growing frontier towns. But the seeds of the end are planted already in the irrigated fields of the Mormon settlers, and sometimes it seems as if the natives knew this too. Also, the topography through which the explorers travelled has now partly vanished behind the dams that have ruined Glen Canyon and other stretches of white water and canyon scenery. No one can now do what Dellenbaugh and his companions did; the sense of loss hovers unintentionally about every page.Dellenbaugh was a keen observer (though perhaps a bit naive) with a talent for making even the monotony of running rapid after rapid spellbinding. One does feel that he may have veiled some of the conflicts that must have arisen in two (non-continuous) years of isolation, though if so this trait is refreshing in a world where we now expect everyone to tattle on everyone else. Every now and then just a shimmer of impatience with one of the crew seeps through. But the real hero who emerges from this book, somewhat surprisingly, is not the leader Powell -- the young Dellenbaugh seems never to have gotten close to him -- but rather the Prof., who rises to every challenge with decency and humaneness, and of whom Dellenbaugh seems to have been genuinely, and for good reason, in awe. Like Powell he is buried in Arlington Cemetery. He deserved that honor, but where he lives is in the pages of this book."},{"Title":"A Canyon Voyage: The Narrative of the Second Powell Expedition down the Green-Colorado River from Wyoming, and the Explorations on Land, in the Years 1871 and 1872","review":"The narrative is wonderful. Dellenbaugh's account of the expedition is very descriptive and entertaining. He has an excellent sense of humor and really captures the excitement and the beauty and the drama, as well as the ordinary, everyday events.Be careful, though, about which edition you buy. I was very disappointed to find that the Fili-Quarian Classics Edition was missing all the illustrations (though the captions and the complete list of illustrations are inexplicably included). Also, the index is completely wrong. I'm not sure why the publisher bothered to include it without correcting the page numbers, since it's worthless. It's amusing that the biggest, most catchy font on the cover says \\"High Quality Paperback\\" and \\"Affordable & High Quality Paperback Book Edition\\". Also, this edition is huge--11 x 8.5 x .6 inches. Nothing you'd want to take on a trip. A much better choice, as I found out later, is the edition put out by the University of Arizona Press, which includes all the original photos and drawings, the index that actually matches the book, and is a nice portable size--8.4 x 5.4 x .9 inches.

This book recounts the expedition of a dozen or so men who spent two long summers running the Green and Colorado Rivers from Green River WY to part way through the Grand Canyon. During the intervening winter, they split into smaller groups and explored the high plateaus northwest of these rivers.Beyond braving dangerous river rapids and the elements and terrain of the backcountry of the plateaus, the explorers also crossed paths with potentially volatile Native Americans time and again.While the book reads a bit dryly at times (\\"we made camp having gone 10 miles with 13 rapids, running 10 and portaging 3\\"), it also provides plenty of compelling text for those with any interest in the area.I enjoyed following along using Google Earth and its provided photos as I tracked the progress of the expedition. There is plenty of discussion of the River as well as of nearly daily climbs to \\"gain a view\\" of the surroundings, and understanding the terrain helps make the story real.Here is a USGS website with the actual photos (many stereo) from the expedition--these are very cool and they include a couple great photos of Major Powell's chair affixed to his boat as well as photos of Glen Canyon and Flaming Gorge (now underwater):[...]"},{"Title":"A Canyon Voyage: The Narrative of the Second Powell Expedition down the Green-Colorado River from Wyoming, and the Explorations on Land, in the Years 1871 and 1872","review":"Dellenbaugh often found it difficult to uniquely describe particular parts of his journey down the Colorado River, but still managed to make the story interesting."},{"Title":"A Canyon Voyage: The Narrative of the Second Powell Expedition down the Green-Colorado River from Wyoming, and the Explorations on Land, in the Years 1871 and 1872","review":"If you are into tales of strenuous adventure this is a super book.

He studies the methodology and content of the documents of Catholic social teaching, generally understood as comprising twelve papal letters beginning with Leo XIII's 1891 encyclical Rerum novarum, two documents from Vatican II, and two pastoral letters of the United States bishops. He contends that the fundamental basis for this body of teaching comes from an anthropological perspective that recognizes both the inherent dignity and the social nature of the human person--thus do the church's teachings on political and economic matters chart a middle course between the two extremes of individualism and collectivism. The documents themselves tend to downplay any discontinuities with previous documents, but the author's systematic analysis reveals the significant historical developments that have occurred over the course of more than a century. Although greatly appreciative of the many strengths of this teaching, he also points out the weaknesses and continuing tensions in Catholic social teaching today. Intended for scholars and students of Catholic social ethics, as well as those involved in Catholic social ministry, this volume will also appeal to non-Catholic readers interested in an understanding and evaluation of Catholic social teaching."},{"Title":"The Dastardly Murder of Dirty Pete","review":"I thought this book was fun to read.

If you like this, seek out Barry Hughart's _Bridge of Birds_; Number Ten Ox's native village once had a similar problem. :)\\"The Great Fire\\" - Nobody could quench it, because it was inside cousin Marianne - she's staying until October, and going out on dates every night. Father says he'll have been in the cemetery for about 130 days then...\\"The Great Wide World Over There\\" - Cora, who always wanted adventure, has spent her life in the valley, going to town only twice a year. Illiterate, she can't escape through books. But now her nephew's coming to visit.\\"Hail and Fairwell\\" - Willie looks 12, but he's 43. This isn't a variation on \\"Jeffty Was Five\\"; his mind is normal. While he can get by, he can't settle anywhere for long...\\"Invisible Boy\\" - Charlie's staying with Old Lady while his parents are away. But she likes having him around, and sets about using witchcraft to keep him.\\"I See You Never\\" - Mr. Ramirez left Mexico City for San Diego a little over two years ago. He's built a life for himself - a good life, by his lights. His landlady even believes that a good workingman has a right to get drunk once a week if he likes. There's only one problem...\\"The Meadow\\" - That's only what it used to be. Then the movie producer came along, and said, Let there be Paris! Let there be Constantinople! And lo, hundreds of cities came into being. On the outside, it's a movie set. To the night watchman, it knocks the 'real' world into a cocked hat.\\"The Murderer\\" - He's being interviewed by a shrink: the victims are yakking machines: telephones and the like. This used to be SF...\\"The Pedestrian\\" - A companion piece to _Fahrenheit 451_. The writer walks for pleasure every night, so the cops have picked him up as a suspicious character.\\"Powerhouse\\" - The woman, riding with her husband through the desert to her dying mother, never needed religion. During a great storm, they take shelter at a powerhouse in the desert. Bradbury explores the nature of faith and being alone a little, here. A quiet story, but richly textured as most of his work is.\\"A Sound of Thunder\\" - Time Safari, Inc. advertises that if you name the animal, they'll take you hunting. After all, what difference could it possibly make to history - whether a dinosaur died a natural death or from a bullet, a few million years ago?\\"Sun and Shadow\\" - A fashion photographer, trying to use a picturesque cracked wall as a backdrop, encounters Ricardo Reyes, who objects to his neighbourhood's poverty being treated as a stage set. A gem.\\"The Wilderness\\" - Leonora and Janice are facing their last night on Earth. Tomorrow they catch the rocket, to meet their menfolk on Mars."},{"Title":"The golden apples of the sun","review":"_The Golden Apples of the Sun_ (1953) is a collection of 22 vintage stories by Ray Bradbury. Sometimes when reviewing a colection of tales, I have said that \\"none of the stories are stinkers\\". This phrase is technically true here, but it misses the point. The truth is that all of the stories are classics. Every one of them is a gem.\\"The Pedestrian\\" depicts an encounter between the last, mild-mannered individualist and the last beetle-shaped police car that stabs him with \\"a fierce white cone of light\\" (11). Leonard Mead \\"stood, entranced, not unlike a night moth, stunned by the illumination, and then drawn toward it\\" (11). There is a subtle connection between the moth and the beetle. Once the last nonconformist is gone, there will be no further use for the police car. All of society will be blandly conformist.\\"The Murderer\\" satirizes another element of such a society-- our infatuation with machines. It was fantastic back in 1953. But I fear that we have already arrived in this nightmare world:Three phones rang. A duplicate wrist radio in his desk drawer buzzed like a wounded grasshopper. The intercom flashed a pink light and click-clicked. Three phones rang. The drawer buzzed. Music blew in through the open door. (62)The title story is about a spaceship scooping up a load of plasma from the surface of the sun. Other writers, such as Chales L. Harness and Theodore L. Thomas, have dealt with this scenario. But I know of of none who have done it with Bradbury's poetry:For now there was only the sun and the sun and the sun. It was every horizon, it was every direction. It burned the minutes, the seconds, the hourglasses, the clocks; it burned all time and eternity away. It burned the eyelids, and the serum of the dark world behind the lids, the retina, the hidden brain; and it burned sleep and the sweet memories of sleep and cool nightfall. (165)\\"A Sound of Thunder\\" is the classic tale of T. Rex, big game hunters, and time travel. Other writers have imitated this story, spoofed it, revised it, or reinterpreted it. But nobody who knows anything at all about science fiction has ignored it.Another dinosaur appears in \\"The Fog Horn\\". But in this tale, we are meant to sympathize with the lonely monster. McDunn, the lighthouse keeper, says of it: \\"It's gone back to the Deeps. It's learned you can't love anything too much in this world\\" (8).Another love story (which also ends sadly) is that of young Cecy, \\"The April Witch\\". Cecy is so charming that each time I reread the story, I wish in vain for her happiness.Other stories include two Chinese fables, \\"The Flying Machine\\" and \\"The Golden Kite, the Silver Wind\\"; a story of murder and manic obsession, \\"The Fruit at the Bottom of the Bowl\\"; a Martian chronicles tale, \\"The Wilderness\\"; two stories of race relations, \\"I See You Never\\" and \\"The Big Black and White Game\\"; and a Hollywood tale, \\"The Meadow\\". I wonder if this last one was inspired by Bradbury's days working with the stop-motion genius Ray Harryhausen on sf movies.Each story is illustrated by Joseph Mugnaini, the artist who was born to illustrate Bradbury. Do not, do not, do not pass this one by."},{"Title":"The golden apples of the sun","review":"Ray Bradbury's \\"The Golden Apples of the Sun\\" short stories have been around for quite a while. Bradbury is Bradbury, a gifted man with an extraordinary imagination, the lyrical writing skill of a poet, and the magic of a master story teller. His stories pull you intuitively into his worlds and carry you along to achieve what Hemingway advocated for fiction writers: that they become a part of our experience.This hardbound edition is unusual in the way that it is beautifully bound. The silver and lime green cover and jacket design repeat within the text where the book title and the capital letters at the beginning of each story are colored the same green. Not a big deal, but nice.And two of the stories are repeated at the end of the book in the form of plays, duplicated exactly in the form Mr. Bradbury typed them (like photocopies).Highly recommended, easily worth the money, and then some."},{"Title":"The golden apples of the sun","review":"I like Ray Bradbury, but I must confess I wasn't real impressed by any of these stories.

I suppose at some point (probably after his death, unfortunately) the entire Moebius library will be published properly, but until then it would be nice to see just this one volume of Arzach available again.

Although William Cobbett's newly republished book was first printed in 1856, it contains many observations contemporary gardeners will find both salient and wise. AG is divided into several sections: laying out gardens, managing hot beds and green houses (which will be of interest to those living in cooler climates); and propagating and cultivating all sorts of plants. Cobbett includes annotated plant lists covering vegetables, herbs, fruits, and flowers extant in the Northeastern US in the 19th century. In addition to cultivation tips, he includes descriptions of potential plant uses such as eating hops as a side dish or making wine from grapes.Newer gardeners may find Cobbett's book challenging because it mostly lacks illustrations, contemporary nomenclature and/or Latin terminology. However, Cobbett humanizes plant cultivation and encourages the new gardener with sage advice such as foiling those \`vegetable devils' dock and dandelion by eating them as greens. Although some of Cobbett's plant references are a bit archaic, such as \`Clove' or \`Cowslip', a good reference book informs the reader that the first is a type of Dianthus akin to the Carnation (sometimes called \\"Pinks\\") and the second may be what moderns call Pulmonaria.I have find Pollen's gardening series appealing because these \`historical' books allow me step back in time and observe how \\"organic\\" gardening and gardeners carried on in earlier days. Cobett's book is set in 19th century America-the halcyon days before the onslaught of super bugs that gargle with DDT, ravaging diseases, and genetically modified Frankenstein plants brought to you by large agribusinesses that constantly battle with natural processes. William Cobbett understood that real gardeners respect Mother Nature."},{"Title":"The American Gardener (Modern Library Gardening)","review":"\\"The American Gardener\\" seeks to capture the history of gardening. This is a new edition of the original book that was first printed in 1856. It contains many observations that come from a time when gardeners may have been more in tune with their enivronment. This book details how to lay out gardens, how to manage hot beds and green houses and how to propagate and cultivate many varieties of plants.Cobbett includes annotated lists of plants - vegetables, herbs, fruits, and flowers of the Northeastern United States in the 19th century. He includes descriptions of how plants can be used and prepared for eating. The books weakness is its lack of illustrations, and contemporary nomenclature. Still, Cobbett's sage advice rings true.As a long-time gardener, I find this series interesting - a sort of passport back in time where I can observe how gardening was done before there were so many chemicals."},{"Title":"The American Gardener (Modern Library Gardening)","review":"There is nothing William Cobbett wrote, in his long and checquered career that was less than brilliant. A gardener on English estates from childhood, he knew the earth, from top to bottom, as well as he knew the political natures of his fellow man. Often sued for libel over his anti-Royalist pamphleteering, Cobbett took refuge in America, more than once, I believe. He was astonished to find that the knowledge of the land possessed by the average colonist was so abysmal that they often had no greens from the end of cabbage and spinach plantings in the early winter, until the appearance of wild nettles and dandelion greens in the late spring. With his usual sense of rightness and immaculate organizational and work habits, he set about changing that.\\"The American Gardener\\" was his contribution to the flourishing of the American colonies and her peoples. Within its pages, is information still invaluable to any one interested in truly organic gardening and living a tasty life off of the grid. In the same vein, \\"The English Gardener\\" and \\"Cottage Economy\\" will also provide endless insight into the time and effort it took the average man to provide food for his family's table before the advent of the \\"Super Market\\".When I was a child in England, our green grocer's name was Reggie. In reading Cobbet, I at last have some insight into where the immensely flavorful vegetables in his big wicker basket originated; modern food production is, afterall, barely older than I myself. In the pages of Cobbett is found the precursor of my grandmother's Victory Garden. And, perhaps, for the fortunate reader, a well drilled pathway back to simpler times and tastier foods.The English Gardener (Bloomsbury Gardening Classics)"},{"Title":"The Chessmen of Mars (Large Print)","review":"Let me first start by saying that I was a little hesitant in reading this book. I really enjoyed the first three books and found John Carter to be a very likeable hero, maybe one of the greatest ever! I enjoyed reading the fourth book because Cathoris was basically a younger version of John Carter and was already a big character in the second and third book; someone I could relate to. Then finding out that neither of them were going to be the protagonists in the fifth book, I was a little turned off and wasn't sure that I would get the same feeling of fulfillment from reading the previous books.Shame on me for thinking that Edgar R. Burroughs couldn't deliver. Though Gahan of Gathol is no John Carter or Cathoris, I found myself enjoying his character. He was witty and a pretty good swordsman.Definitely a book that you need to read. Especially if you enjoyed reading the previous books. Well, guess it's time for the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Chessmen of Mars (Large Print)","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughts has me hooked.

My husband laughed and said it's great for a teenage boy. I started reading anyway. It is pretty dated in our time of space exploration and accumulation of more data than we can probably ever process. However, teenage boys and contemporary sophistication aside, I kept turning the pages in this qiuck read. It's pretty much plot and romance, its issues and themes sort of cliche by our standards but not perhaps in its time. Basically I thought it was lots of fun and imaginative. I also enjoyed coming across probable precursors of components of today's films and stories. For instance, the chess game with live and very real combat reminded me of a similar scene in a Harry Potter movie, only in the book both black and white sides are armed men.I enjoyed this so much that I downloaded the rest of the books in this, the John Carter, series."},{"Title":"The Chessmen of Mars (Large Print)","review":"Loved the series and though it was written so long ago, it is still a great book to read.

Although superficial at first, Tara in time grows up and becomes a very interesting heroine. Unfortunately her coheadliner in the book--Gahan, Jed (king, not prince) of Gathol--is a shallow, impulsive wussbag who falls in love with her as soon as he sees her and spends the rest of the book obsessing over her. While Gahan does engage in some great feats to save the Princess, he is too stupid for the reader to really identify with. (Hello! If everyone seems not to see you after you've just walked into a walled city when you're clearly not one of the locals and are being surreptitiously marched into a prison, it might be time to rethink strategy for entering the city.) Despite the clod of Gahan as hero, though, Ghek the kaldane more than counterbalances him and provides a freshness and zest to the narrative it would otherwise lack. The game of jetan is well described and intriguing, as is Manatorian culture. While he does become likable by the end, Gahan is a major irritant in the story. Had he been someone I could identify better with, I'd have given the book five stars. Four seems appropriate though, given the other narrative strengths."},{"Title":"The Chessmen of Mars (Large Print)","review":"I downloaded the book so that I will have something that I may want to read.

An adolescent daughter who has everything a young woman could wish for, including an arranged marriage on the horizon with a nice guy. Well, you can see where this is going. Princess Tara decides that having it all isn't good enough for her, so she has a tantrum and storms off. No, literally storms off when her solo flight gets caught up in the storm of the century. An enamoured prince sees his opportunity to push Tara's affianced out of the picture and races after her. Tara gets enslaved with a possible invitation to be the guest of honor at a banquet held by a race that has unusual tastes in slaves, the Kaldanes.The Kaldanes... focus on things of the mind rather than the physical, and are the heads of another species, the rykor.After escaping this threat, Tara and her hero stumble into the hands of a tribe of red men who specialize in jetan, the chess of Barsoom, with a refuge from the Kaldanes in tow.Fighting, intrigue, treachery, heroism, concealed identities, and a happily ever after. First rate adventure from Barsoom.\\"The Chessmen of Mars\\" has two firsts; humor and philosophy. The refuge from the Kaldanes demonstrates a warped sense of humor that just tickled me, but it is the first real effort at humor I've observed in ERBs Mars series. And prior to this book, ERB offered little philosophy more than \\"big sword, good; fair fight, good; bad guys, bad\\". In this one, he discusses the merits and drawbacks of pursuing physical and intellectual excellence, and the need for balance in life and personal development.Despite the effort at intellectual stimulation, I enjoyed this one at least as much (if not more) than the previous Mars books.E.M.

(\\"Gohooh-OOLLLLL-EEE\\" and \\"PIE-yull!\\") What DO Gomer Pyle and Edgar Rice Burroughs have in common? Here it is; you don't remember Gomer unless you are my age or older (baby boomer) and most of you don't remember Burroughs. Or didn't read him. So science fiction authors have been flagrantly mining Burrough's best book for simply decades and it still is going on.This book is RICH in ideas, images, creative notions, science fiction achievements and has been the inspiration for \\"homage\\" by many of the greatest sci-fi and fantasy authors I can name. So I am going to do name some names, and then give you a sample of the prose from the book, so you know what to expect when you read it.Madeleine L'Engle stole IT for her superb \\"A Wrinkle in Time.\\" IT is in here. The goal of the Kaldanes is to make a giant brain to control the planet. A subterranean control brain--ah, didn't the Original Star Trek swipe that in what is arguable the WORST EPISODE EVER (Spock's Brain.)The symbiotic Kaldane and Rykor--these spidery nasty heads were used in a different form by several authors, including Heinlein who made them into the Puppet Masters in the book by the same name, converted to humps on the back but quite similar in notion. And The Borg Queen of yes, Star Trek (Next Generation) pops her head onto a replaceable body. Hmmm. Where have I seen that before?Even J.K. Rowlings makes use of monster chess in \\"Harry Potter\\"--and we find that the high point of \\"Chessmen is the game where live chess pieces fight for the princess and pieces duel each other to the death.So if you love sci-fi and fantasy, you just HAVE to read \\"Chessmen\\"--possibly Burroughs' best Mars book. Just beware that the 1920's prose is a bit dense--an example:Often he clambered over the body of a fallen foe to leap against the next behind, and once there lay five dead kaldanes behind him, so far had he pushed back his antagonists. They did not know it; these kaldanes that he fought, nor did the girl awaiting him upon the flier, but Gahan of Gathol was engaged in a more alluring sport than winning to freedom, for he wasavenging the indignities that had been put upon the woman he loved; but presently he realized that he might be jeopardizing her safety uselessly, and so he struck down another before him and turning leaped quickly up the stairway, while the leading kaldanes slipped upon the brain-covered floor and stumbled in pursuit.\\" (One sentence.....!!!)Basically, the spoiled princess Tara of Helium spurns a lover, gets lost, ends up in a terrible place (the Kaldanes' domain), gets rescued while being fought over by handsome heroes and damnably handsome but gruesomely vile foes.

We are now introduced to the daughter of Dejah Thoris and John Carter. Second in beauty only to her mother. Tara, Princess of Helium, is a bit of a brat who normally gets her way. When the storm comes up and the winds don't listen, the child starts to learn a couple of valuable lessons. We are also introduced to yet another species of Barsoom, along with a game called jetan. Jetan is very similar to earth's game called chess.I think the excitement and adventure continuing in this book is great! I really enjoy the way the story unfolds, and the descriptions used throughout the series. I read a lot of books. I will cherish my opportunity to read these books again and again. I do not tire of the constant change in scenery and characters as described by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Since each book has introduced new species, as well as new areas of Barsoom, I find each book to be a new adventure.I find these books to be highly entertaining. I can, perhaps naively, imagine the landscapes of Barsoom as described. I do, however unlikely, dream of the possibility of instant travel.

As the previous book featured Carthoris, John Carter's son, as the main character, The Chessmen of Mars features his daughter Tara as she is held against her will by the hideous head-people the Kaldanes. Eventually she is rescued by a warrior who won't give her his name (because they met months earlier and Tara rejected him, but doesn't realize this is the same man.) As they trek towards civilization the are caught in the clutches of a lost society that uses living people in the martian version of chess as public entertainment-where people fight to the death. Will they escape?As always, there is the classic damsail in distress theme with lots of swordfighting. A little slow in the first part while Tara is held captive by the Kaldanes, but it's a big improvement on the previous novel Thuvia: Maid of Mars. I definately recommend this."},{"Title":"The Chessmen of Mars (Large Print)","review":"\\"The Chessmen of Mars,\\" Edgar Rice Burroughs' 5th John Carter novel out of 11, first appeared in serial form in the magazine \\"Argosy All Story Weekly\\" from February to April 1922. It is easily the best of the Carter lot to this point; the most detailed, the most imaginative, and the best written. Carter himself only appears at the beginning and end of the tale. Instead, our action heroes are his daughter, Tara, who gets lost in a rare Barsoomian storm while joyriding in her flier and blown halfway across the surface of the planet, and the Gatholian jed Gahan, who goes in search of her. In the first half of this novel, Tara and Gahan wind up in the clutches of the kaldanes--bodiless brains who live in a symbiotic relationship with their headless \\"rykors.\\" One of these brains, Ghek, befriends the couple and tags along with them for the remainder of their odyssey. Ghek is a wonderful character, touching and fascinating and amusing all at once. In one passage, Ghek gives us some very interesting philosophy regarding the relationship between mind and body. In the second half of the book, the trio is captured by the hordes of Manator, and Gahan winds up fighting for Tara in a game of Martian chess, or jetan, a game in which real men are used in lieu of pieces and fight to the death for possession of squares. The jetan sequence is extremely exciting and detailed, and a knowledge of chess is not necessary for full enjoyment. One need not be a chess buff to appreciate the detailed moves that Burroughs gives us. \\"Chessmen\\" is, as I mentioned, very well written for a Burroughs novel; even, dare I say it, poetically written in spots. The action is relentless, the standard of imagination very high, and the denouement extremely satisfying. It is a near masterpiece. Why only \\"near\\"? Well, as is usual with these books, there are some problems....As in the previous Carter novels, these problems take the form of inconsistencies and implausibilities. At the book's beginning, Burroughs, who has just been told this tale by Carter himself, writes that \\"if there be inconsistencies and errors, let the blame fall not upon John Carter, but rather upon my faulty memory, where it belongs.\\" He is excusing himself in advance for any mistakes that he might make, and well he should, because there are many such in this book. I, however, cannot excuse an author for laziness and sloppy writing. Saying \\"excuse me\\" doesn't make for good writing. Just what am I referring to here? Let's see.... Tara, in several spots in the book, refers to Tardos Mors as her grandfather, when in actuality he is her great-grandfather. The Martian word \\"sofad\\" is said to be a foot; but in the previous book, \\"Thuvia, Maid of Mars,\\" an \\"ad\\" was said to be a foot. Tara, in one scene, smites Ghek on the back of the head. Gahan is watching this fight from a distance, and sees her hit Ghek in the face! In the game of jetan, the thoat pieces are said to wear three feathers; but in the Rules for Jetan at the book's end, they are said to wear two. This book is based on events told to John Carter, conceivably by Tara, Gahan and/or Ghek, and yet scenes are described in which none of those characters appear; thus, they could have had no knowledge of these events described. This, I feel, is a basic problem with the book's structure. Besides these inconsistencies, there are some things that are a bit hard to swallow. For instance, that Gahan could fall 3,000 feet from a flier in the middle of a cyclone and, freakishly, survive. It's also hard to believe that Tara does not recognize Gahan when he comes to her rescue, and fails to remember where they have met, until the very end of the book. In addition, I feel that the character of Ghek is underutilized in the book's second half. It might have been nice to see the old boy loosening up a bit, as he got more in touch with his emotions, Spockstyle. Anyway, all quibbles aside, \\"Chessmen\\" is a wonderful piece of fantasy, one that had me tearing through the pages as quickly as I possibly could. It is an exceptionally fine entry in the John Carter series."},{"Title":"The Chessmen of Mars (Large Print)","review":"The Chessmen of Mars is the fifth book in the &quot;Mars&quot; series written by Edgar Rice Burroughs. This book focuses on Tara of Helium, John Carter's daughter. Strange creatures who play deadly games of martian chess decide to use her in one of their live games.

I disagree.I will cite two examples as to why &quot;Chessmen&quot; is Burroughs' best work in this series.[1] You can hardly conceive of a more ghastly creature than a spider-being who lives as a parasite on headless human bodies, but that is a perfect description of Ghek the Kaldane, one of the central figures of the book. Burroughs takes this repulsive monstrosity and makes him such a loveable character that you cannot help but like him.[2] Burroughs not only wrote a good yarn, he wrapped his tale around a striking boardgame that he had invented--jetan, or Martian chess.It's no real trick to invent a chess variant. There are thousands of them, and most of them are rubbish. What is so singular about jetan is that it is a good chess variant. I read &quot;Chessmen&quot; as a child, and after reading it, the first thing I had to do was make a jetan set and play the game. I whiled away several enjoyable hours with the game. John Gollon, a noted authority on chess variants, had a similar experience when he was writing &quot;Chess Variations.&quot; He thought he'd include a chapter on jetan for some comic relief, so he made a jetan set and played a few games. He found jetan &quot;quite good--very playable and interesting.&quot; He then pronounced jetan &quot;not a mere novelty, but ... a respectable game.&quot;These two singular achievments (Ghek &amp; jetan) are not the only details that make &quot;Chessmen&quot; so enjoyable. Gahan of Gathol (aka Turan the Panthan) makes for a satisfying hero, and Tara of Helium fills the bill quite nicely for a damsel in distress.The heros are noble, the villians are wicked, the cause is just, and the action is nonstop.

Originally published serially in &quot;Argosy All-Story Weekly&quot; in 1921 and in hardback the following year it is arguably one of ERB's most imaginative stories. This reputation rests on two things. The first is the relationship between the Kaldanes &quot;heads&quot; and the headless Rykors who are the &quot;descendants of exceedingly stupid humanoid creatures bred by the Kaladane over eons for strength, health, beauty and microcephaly.&quot; True, this makes no sense from an evolutionary standpoint, but it is one of the more imaginative parasitic relationships in science fiction history. The second is jetan, the Martian version of chess, which is usually played on a 10 x 10 game board of alternating black and orange squares in the cities of Barsoom, but in the city of Manator is played with living pieces in a giant arena. Of course in the living version of the game a moving piece is not guaranteed a square but has to fight for it.The framing device for &quot;The Chessmen of Mars&quot; is told by John Carter, Warlord of Barsoom, on a visit home to Earth to see his nephew (rather remarkable given how long it took Carter to get back to Barsoom after his first adventure). Over a game of chess Carter tells of jetan and the adventures of his daughter, Tara of Helium, in Manator.

The novel opens with the two of them dancing at a royal function in Helium. She has her eyes set on Djor Kantos, sons of her friend's best friend, but he is interested in somebody else. When Gahan declares his love for her, Tara throws a fit and we know these two are meant for each other. Taking her flier on an unadvised flight during a Gale, the princess ends up blown across Barsoom and as happened with both her mother and her sister-in-law, her hero has to track her down and effect a rescue.The combination of the Kaladanes jumping from one Rykor to the next with the jetan game to the death is quite captivating. For many readers of ERB's pulp fiction yarns &quot;The Chessmen of Mars&quot; is a favorite and while it has the standard hero rescues beloved plot that is a Burroughs staple it is layered with all this interesting stuff.

Thuvia was the first fully capable of Burroughs' Barsoomian heroines, but Tara of Helium despite her petulant and child-like attitude comes across as one of the strongest and most winning heroines of early 20th century fiction.She is equally matched by the courageous and totally dedicated Gahan of Gathol, a jed (prince) from a remote land who falls madly in love with Tara and throws all away to win her love. Tara and Gahan traverse half of Barsoom as they seek to win their way back to Helium, and all the while he poses as a lowly panthan (mercenary) because the haughty Tara has so many forgotten suitors she cannot even recognize him.The most imaginitive parts of the story take place in the land of the Kaldanes, bodiless heads which worship only intellect, and in the barbaric land of Manator. The Manatorians prey upon their neighbors, including Gahan's own land of Gathol. Tara's cold facade of indifference slowly melts away as Gahan braves peril after peril to save her from the clutches on powerful warlords, and all the while he believes she wants nothing to do with him.The best scene in the book comes when Gahan takes on one of the greatest swordsmen in Manator by playing a deadly game of Martian chess for possession of the princess of Helium. And once the action begins in the arena, it doesn't stop until the last page. By the time Tara confesses her true feelings, the reader is assured that Gahan is really getting a prize and not a pouty spoiled princess. Both characters show a lot of growth and resourcefulness in this story. It's well worth the money in any format."},{"Title":"The Chessmen of Mars (Large Print)","review":"Conventional wisdom has it that the first three books of Burroughs' Martian series, &quot;A Princess of Mars,&quot; &quot;The Gods of Mars,&quot; and &quot;The Warlord of Mars&quot; form an excellent trilogy and all the rest of the Martian tales are quite poorly done in comparison.

As with most of Burroughs' fantasy novels, this one revolves around a love story. Burroughs' love interest is passionate, but &quot;clean&quot; in language and not objectionable for youths with an enthusiasm for adventure and fantasy.Burroughs always has a surfeit of what Aristotle called &quot;invention.&quot; His stories are wildly imaginative, and at times, very original. His monsters are really scary, his villains are wicked as sin, and his ladies, who the book's hero tends to rescue, court, lose, and rescue again, are downright stunning in beauty. His female characters are also surprisingly &quot;modern.&quot; They are spunky, peppery, and have a mind of their own. Surprisingly, both the protagonist and the heroine emerge as pretty well realized characters, despite the action packed plots which leave little room for any sort of formal &quot;character development.&quot;If this particular book has a shortcoming, it may be too many chapters wandering through secret tunnels and subterranean passageways. Some of this is okay, but after 150 pages of this, the reader begins to get cabin fever.A good read.

It was written in 1922, but in 1996 a Kaldane action figure along with other Mars, Pellucidor and Tarzan action figures came on the market assocated with Tarzan, the Epic Adventures, etc. I enjoyed the character of Ghek the Kaldane so much during my college years that I have used it as my nickname and handle in the modem world since 1981. Storyline: Carried away in a great storm, Tara is lost on mars with but a slim dagger to guard herself...only to fall into the hands of the strange Kaldanes who happen to consider human flesh a delicacy (when nicely fattened up, of course). Also visited is Manator, where the dead are preserved as lifelike statues and where Jetan (martian chess - rules for play are included in the book) is played with living warriors contesting for possion of a square when a move is made. George Lucas admits that 1/3 of the inspiration for Star Wars came from the Books of ERB, especially the Mars series and in Robert A.

It still has Johanna Reiss' intuitive, touching writing style, but fails to explain what becomes of the characters decades later. It instead depicts only about a year in their lives, in which a few eventful but rather unimportant things happen. It also leaves many questions unanswered that were presented and dwelled upon. I cannot imagine understanding or enjoying this book if I had not read its predecessor, &quot;The Upstairs Room&quot; first. The short introduction provided would fail to adequately aid someone who had not previously read the latter to understand the depth and humanity of this saga. I am pleased to say, however, that it is well written, sad yet strangely joyous, and thoughtful; all the qualities that give a book the potential to be a good one. If you are looking for Annie's complete life story post war, it will be fairly disappointing, but if you are merely interested in what occurs immediately afterward, this book is ideal."},{"Title":"The journey back","review":"After reading &quot;The Journey Back&quot; I am more aware of the hardships, dangers, and deprivations Jews and others went through after World War II. The story takes place in Holland, and its about what happens to the members of a Jewish family after the war ends, and they return home. The main character in the sotry is a thirteen-year-old girl named Annie de Leeuw. She and jer sister Sini might have been killed if it weren't for the Oostervelds, the courageous family who hid them for three years. The other main characters are Annie's father and her oldest sister Rachel. When Annie returns home she finds that her family no longer knows one another. Her mother is dead; her father is distracted. Her sister Sini tries to make up for lost time by going dancing every night, and Rachel has changed her religion to Christianity. Another important character in the book is Magda, Annie's stepmother. No matter how hard she tries, Annie cannot seem to please her. To Magda, Annie is the most imperfect girl in the entire universe. She criticizes Annie's clothes, hair, manners, and about everything else. For this reason I think Annie's conflict is man vs. himself since she has to built a new life for herself. I like the book in general, though the end was a dissappointment since it didn't give details about what would happen to Annie and her family. I wish the author would explain things better, and not just leave some conflicts unresolved, like in the case of the mean stepmother. My predicitions for the future of Annie's family are that the stepmother will always be mean, and Annie will have to get used to her new life. I give the book four stars. Like I already said the end needs some work. I still think it's a very informative book, and it helped me learn more about Worl War II."},{"Title":"The journey back","review":"This sequel to THE UPSTAIRS ROOM continues the story of young Annie, slightly lame, and her older sister, Sini, who have spent three years in hiding with a kind Gentile family. Now the war is over and they are all free to live together as a Jewish family in Holland, to pick up the shattered pieces of their lives after Nazi persecution. But nothing is that simple, for they are not quite the same people. The pre-War status quo can never be recreated after years of suffering and humiliation.It is hard for Annie to leave the warm farm family who took them into their home and their hearts. Why does she experience so many conflicting emotions now that she is Free? Reluctance to leave her country haven; Despair over the endless quarrels between Sini and their father; Frustration at unsuccessful attempts to please a snobby, prejudiced step-mother. Why should she be forced to leave the family which has provided her with more than physical safety--who renew their offers of love and acceptance just as she is? What does the blended family have to tempt her, now that Sini wants to leave and Annie can not compete with her new sister-in-law?Because the Nazi threat has been removed, the story obviously lacks the intensity and nervous anxiety of its more famous predecessor; the dangers are not life-threatening but soul-disturbing. Annie struggles to fit into a new role, yet her gratitude and childlike feelings are all directed to toward the Past. She was safe and comfortable with her wartime hosts even when the Nazis were suspicious, because she held a special place of love in their home. Can her father ever make it up to her?

Annie and her sister Sini hid in the Oosterveld's house. The Oostervelds lived in Usselo, a very small town in Holland. Annie and Sini grew very close with Johan, Dientje, and Opoe (the Oostervelds).

When everyone was home, including the girls' father, nothing was back to normal. Every night, Sini went out and danced with the soldiers. Rachel became a Christian, and she spent most of her time reading the Bible. Annie's father was always distracted. He sold cows. Sini left to be a nurse in a different town. Then, Ies (Annie's father) decided that Annie needed a mother, not just her sisters. He decided to marry a woman that had lost her husband in the war. She even had a daughter. Ies told Rachel to go to a different town, because she and his wife-to-be were just a couple of years apart, and he said that it would never work. After Ies and Magda (his new wife) got married, Nel (Magda's daughter) went to finishing school. Annie was always home with Magda, which she now called Mother. Annie could never seem to please her. Annie always visited Johan, Dientje, and Opoe too. They treated her like their own family. Magda would not let her visit for a long time, though. One day, she would probably be with them again, and it would be for the rest of her life.I thought that this book was very good. \\"German soldiers. They knocked down the door, stormed in, marching and stamping and shouting to the rhythm of their boots.\\" This was one of Annie's dreams. The author always made Annie scared, and that was what made it interesting. She always thought of the Germans, she was so afraid of them.\\"Later, Johan, later.\\" No matter what happened, Johan was always the first person that Annie called to. When she was afraid, happy, or sad, she would always think of Johan. It shows that Annie always thought of her family first, and her family was Johan, Dientje, and Opoe.I liked at lot of parts in this book. I liked the parts when Annie went to the Oosterveld's house. She would always be happy, and she wouldn't have to worry about any German soldiers trying to kill her because Johan would be there, and she would always be safe."},{"Title":"The journey back","review":"Annie de Leeuw, a young Jewish girl, has been hiding during WWII for almost 3 years with her older sister Sini at Johan Oosterveld's house with his wife Dentje, and Opoe, his mother. Now the war is over and Annie can finally be together with her family!But things just aren't the same at her house, Rachel (Annie's eldest sister) has found a new religion, Sini is out all night dancing, her father is getting remarried, and her mother had died during the war. Annie starts finding herself missing the Oosterveld's...will things work out?I thought this book was a little confusing at times. The plot--returing home--is a little dull also. Though I think the author has good description & her openings have a good start. She keeps you hoping that something good will happen to Annie, and is even a little suspensful.People who might like reading this book would propbably be people who like reading about a persons feelings, or read the first book (which I had not),or just people who don't like reading action books.^_^"},{"Title":"The journey back","review":"This was a very good book so good I want to meet everyone in in it gonna read it again and again"},{"Title":"The journey back","review":"personaly i havent read this book yet but im sure its gonna be great. i love holocaust books but i have never read a story about after the war. i cant wait to read this book and i already rated it 5 stars because i know its gonna be amazing"},{"Title":"The journey back","review":"The return of Annie, a jewish child, to her hometown Winterswijk, Holland, at the endof WW11 after being hidden with her sister Sini in a farmhouse for almostthree years, is one of the most touching stories I have read.I liked \\"The Journey Back\\", which is a sequel to \\"The Upstairs Room\\",for its simple honesty."},{"Title":"The journey back","review":"This book is really interesting as a follow-up to The Upstairs Room.

Now, 4 years later, i read THE JOURNEY BACK. The first couple chapters quickly refreshed my memory of what happened during WWII to Annie, and i feel they would have sufficed as an introduction had i not read THE UPSTAIRS ROOM. this book proves that although a treaty was signed, the war was no yet over for the people involved."},{"Title":"The journey back","review":"The War is over and Annie and her family are safe now. Througout the war they hid in different farmhouses, trying to escape going to the camps. But now Annie has to leave the people she lived with for so long, the Ooostervelds, whom she loves, and go live back in the city. When she gets there she has to see a special doctor for her legs, since she walks crooked, for being cooped up for so long. She goes to a new school, where she is very shy and has a hard time making friends. Her Mother is dead, and her Father remarries a lady that already has a daughter and Annie just can't get along with her. I thought it was very nicely written, and had some very interesting facts in it."},{"Title":"The journey back","review":"Overall The Journey Back was a great book. Although the reading gets somewhat boring after a while you should read through to the end so that you can figure out what you really think of it.

It seems that you don't here enough about the afterword of the holocaust and that is what this book is here to tell you."},{"Title":"The journey back","review":"The Journey Back is an interesting story about how a Jewish girl after hiding for 3 years reunites with her family.

She is learning how to get back to her normal routine. In the begining, this book is a bit depressing but as it gose on she finds new friends and stays in touch with old ones. I think this book is great because the charters are so belivable & realistic. The first chapter or so were boring but then people started coming back from the camps and some didn't. This book is an amazing piece of literature."},{"Title":"The journey back","review":"It seems like many sequels to books about the Shoah are hit-and-miss; sometimes there will be a gripping account of a return to life, healing, love, and a semblance of normalcy, but more often than not it's just an ordinary undistinguished account relating what happened after the War. This book falls into the latter category.Unlike many sequels of this nature, here the immediate family have more or less all stayed alive and are reunited soon after the War ends. Mr. de Leeuw and the three sisters (who appear to each be about ten years apart in age) have been in hiding, not camps or ghettos. They don't bear the same kind of intense and painful scars from that experience as someone who was in a ghetto or camp would. They were in relative safety, and Holland was no Poland or Hungary. Mrs. de Leeuw, while dead, died in the first book in a hospital because she had been very sick for a long time, not because she was murdered by the Nazis. The de Leeuws have lost friends, neighbours, and relatives, but the immediate family has not been split up, nor do they have to spend time in displacement, rehabiliation, or refugee centres, immigrate, trek across foreign lands on their way back to their native Holland, or wait around in agony waiting for word of the other members of their immediate family. They have much less to deal with than other people in post-Shoah sequels usually do. The most serious problems in here are having to get used to living together as a family again, Annie's overbearing new stepmother Magda and Magda's 18 year old daughter Nell, Sini's constant dancing with soldiers at night and her fights with her father over it, and Rachel's conversion to Christianity and the family strife that is causing. Maybe she did have a spiritual epiphany when the family who were hiding her took her to church with them for Xmas services, but it just seems tragic that someone who survived the Shoah, who had to spend those years in hiding instead of living a normal adult life all on account of her religion, would embrace a new religion instead of taking pride in her own religion once she's free to practise it again.It's an interesting story, but really anticlimactic and overly domestic after all which went before. This recounting of what happened afterwards just isn't as gripping as the accounts of people who lost most of their families, didn't return to their native lands, or had it much worse than merely being in hiding in a relatively safe nation-state like Holland."},{"Title":"Dear Tiny Sepuku: One Little Cartoon's Bold and Bewildering Love Advise","review":"I found this book and a Pooch Cafe book at a bookstore in NY recently.

Unfortunately, you get the feeling most of the strips are cranked out the night before they're due ... after a bout of writer's block...and it gets real stale, real quick. In a weekly or semi-weekly comic strip format, it's not so bad...but think of trying to slog through 144 pages of it. After a few pages your brain is numb, your eyes get droopy, and your mind wanders to...The art, too, is so one-note and uninspired that it leaves the bulk of the page white as fresh-fallen snow.When a book engages neither the imagination nor the eye, I just can't offer a recommendation. There are other, better things to do with your time."},{"Title":"Pricing Financial Instruments: The Finite Difference Method","review":"The pricing theory due to Black Scholes and Merton is widely recognized as one of the most significant contributions of economics to practice. There are now many good introductory books surveying the vast literature on the subject. So what is needed is a book showing how to implement various models in practice. The book by Tavella and Randall is the first in what I hope is a series of such books. The authors are well known in computational circles: Tavella is the editor of the highly regarded Journal of Computational Finance and Randall is a Principal at SciComp, a leading developer of software synthesis technology for the finance industry. The authors focus on finite differences, which is an important generalization of the common tree approach, and thus is one of the most widely used numerical techniques in finance.The book's first two chapters introduce the mathematics of financial derivatives in an intuitively appealing manner. For example, measure changes are introduced as a powerful tool without strong demands on the reader in terms of background. Also, linear complementarity is used in the context of valuing American options, again in an intuitive fashion. The third chapter introduces finite differences in the context of the familiar parabolic PDE governing derivative security values. It is in this and the remaining chapters that much useful material can be found. For example, the cell averaging technique in chapter 4 is a very useful device for dampening the error introduced by slope discontinuities which commonly occur in financial problems. The authors also give the first textbook treatment of the important class of pure jump models such as the variance gamma model, which are growing in popularity. The chapter on coordinate transformations gives the finite difference version of what some finance people term the adaptive mesh method.In summary, this book is a must-read for anyone seriously interested in implementing derivative security pricing models. I hope the authors plan to follow up with a more advanced version which can cover such interesting topics as multi-grid, hopskotch, operator splitting, and the like."},{"Title":"Pricing Financial Instruments: The Finite Difference Method","review":"Tavella and Randall have produced a compact, yet complete treatment of finite difference techniques in finance. I met Curt Randall in 1996 when his SciFinance software was in its infancy (though there is currently no connection between us). This software automatically generates C code to solve PDE's. That is an order of magnitude -- maybe two orders -- harder than just writing the code by hand. I inferred that Dr. Randall has a unique understanding of finite-difference methods for solving PDE's. For these reasons, I was very interested to see his book. For a more general treatment finite difference schemes, see Gordon Smith's 1986 book.The mathematical motivations for all the techniques presented are given, with no wasted exposition. I liked the lucid analyses of stability, which many books in finance gloss over. I also liked the mention and partial analysis of a large set of solvers of sparse linear systems. having not followed the literature on jump processes in recent years, I was quite happy to see their treatment as well.This book is all of what it claims to be, and no more. I do not recommend it as a textbook, or as a reference for those not already somewhat familiar with the subject, either from the mathematics side or the finance side. You will not get an explanation of what an eigenvalue or fourier transform is. The Lax Equivalence Theorem is cited, but not motivated or proven. No mention is given of when it might make more sense to use, say, a Monte Carlo scheme to find an option price. You won't find much economics in the book. But you will find a clear, correct, and useful analysis of more or less all aspects of finite difference schemes as they relate to solving contingent claims pricing problems."},{"Title":"Pricing Financial Instruments: The Finite Difference Method","review":"This book approximates the solution of one-factor and multi-factor PDEs that describe derivatives such as barrier options, convertible bonds, Asian options and credit derivatives.Standard finite difference schemes are used. In particular, 3-point centred difference schemes approximate the derivatives in the S directions while Crank-Nicolson (averaging) is used to approximate the t derivative. Stability and convergence of the schemes are proved using the Lax Equivalence theoerem. Special attention is paid to resolving the, by now well known problems associated with the Crank Nicolson method. The workarounds are choosing smaller meshes near discontinuous boundaries, coordinate transformations and choosing the right sampling points.The book is a good attempt (in my opinion) to show how to apply FDM in financial engineering applications. It is probably most useful for those who have already experience of FDM. It is NOT an introductory book.Some of the criticisms are (this is why I give it a 3 star):1. The von Neumann stability analyis technique is only applicable to constant coefficient, linear PDE. It is outdated, better methods being the maximum principle and viscosity solutions.2. The discrete set of equations need to be solved by rather esoteric matrix solvers bacause the authors discretise a PDE in all directions. Using ADI or operator splitting instead lets us solve one-dimensional problem with Tridiagonal LU Decomposition.3. A lot of detail on meshes has unfortunately been left out.4. Using Crank Nicolson only aggrevates the problems in FDM schemes. There ARE better methods out there.5. TYPOS!! for example, equation (4.13) on page 122. The S term is missing.On the other hand, this book is aimed at real-life problems. However, extra detail needs to be added in my opinion in order to make it more accessible to a wider audience."},{"Title":"Pricing Financial Instruments: The Finite Difference Method","review":"Reading this book produced three instances where previously encountered material was explained from a new and different point of view, the clouds parted, and I was bathed in the bright sunshine of understanding. Creation and valuation of hedging portfolios, reduced to their fundamentals, is now far less taxing to the memory. Explanations for the discretization of time and space now render previously mysterious numerical algorithms obvious in their intent. American options discused in a free boundry framework are far more intuitive than in the optimal stoping time approach. As much as I enjoyed the content, the occurence of numerous editing oversights was a considerable annoyance. This was even more surprising when I read the other customer review which indicated that one of the authors was an editor. Editors should be held to a higher standard and so I deducted an extra star!"},{"Title":"Pricing Financial Instruments: The Finite Difference Method","review":"It is a very good book, well written and didactic.

Tracing the jurisprudence of some major legal minds from three different periods in American history, Noonan demonstrates how a preoccupation with LAW as a detached set of rules with a life of its own can lead to the obscuring of the human element in law.Rules are clearly necessary to an orderly society and to the adjudication of disputes between parties, but rules are conceived of in the minds of people and are applied by people to cases and controversies involving people. An overemphasis upon law as a detached science of rules can allow for the creation of rules that obscure the humanity of people who are subjected to them. These sorts of rules Noonan describes as \\"masks.\\" (Masks are to be distinguished from \\"roles,\\" which people assume, but which they are not consumed by.)Noonan's chronicling of George Wythe and (his student) Thomas Jefferson's legal involvements with the old slave codes provides a stark example of how masks have been used in the history of American law. That section was particularly interesting from a scholarly and historical standpoint, as Noonan describes them in all their utter brutishness, proceeding to delve into the (hypocritical) political, economic and social purposes for which they were created.Also interesting is Noonan's analysis of Oliver Wendell Holmes' legal thinking and how that thinking was employed in the U.S. Supreme Court case of American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co. (1909). In this reviewer's opinion, there is greater moral ambiguity in the case of sovereign immunity than there is with chattel slavery, but Holmes clearly employed a mask in the American Banana case. Noonan does a fine job of describing the backdrop to the case and all the major players involved in the litigation.Finally, Noonan discusses Cardozo's masking of the plaintiff in the infamous Palsgraf case from the New York Court of Appeals. This was fun to read, as Palsgraf is one of those cases all law students read in their first-year torts classes.It would probably prove too much to say that this book has appeal for a wide audience. In all likelihood, only those who are seriously interested in legal scholarship and legal history will find it of interest. Much of the analysis takes place at a high level of abstraction. But given that the book is originally based upon a prestigious serious of law lectures, it should satisfy its intended audience."},{"Title":"Persons and masks of the law: Cardozo, Holmes, Jefferson, and Wythe as makers of the masks","review":"Dr. Noonan's book, \\"Persons and Masks of the Law\\" is the best I have read in terms of informing its readers of what really goes on below the surface of what we commonly consider to be \\"The Law.\\" It shows its undersurface, and how it is invariably a question of the personalities and prejudices of those who administer the law. Noonan's mind, and analyses are brilliant."},{"Title":"Defining Music Therapy","review":"Defining Music TherapyExcellent book for students, and all those who want to learn how to conduct sessions of music therapy !"},{"Title":"Defining Music Therapy","review":"This book is really great!

Unfortunately, much of this book is filled with stupid-trying-to-be-funny things. Yes, there are a few good practical ideas, but most sound like they came from bad comedy writers struggling to come up with something funny. As a result, most of the book is filled with really stupid things that are far from funny.Here are some examples of some pages: \\"Muzzle your mutt\\" with a graphic of duct tape around a dogs nose and mouth. Ha ha? Use a wadded up piece of duct tape in place of a silver tooth filling. Ha ha.

The problem of course is quite obvious - it's simply not funny!To put it quite frankly, this is a book written by idiots for idiots.

If Hee Haw and the Red Green Show strike you as high-brow entertainment, then by all means order your copy right now. And what about my calendar?

Indeed, Van Reid's droll storytelling depends upon it.Misdirection and misunderstanding form the strong foundation of the meandering and digressive missions of the League's six members, who gather at the Shipswood Restaurant in the spring of 1897 for one of their regular dinners. They raise their water glasses (prohibition has been in effect in Maine for 46 years) to their only female member, Miss Phileda McCannon, who's making a journey to settle her deceased aunt's affairs. Mr. Tobias Walton, their chairman and the oldest at 48, is a bit subdued on this occasion as Phileda has not given an answer to his proposal of marriage.Joseph Thump, Christopher Eagleton and Matthew Ephram are still in a small state of excitement after nearly running down a tavern keeper named Sparks who could have been Thump's double, but for his workingman's clothing and his high-pitched voice. The youngest member, Walton's faithful assistant Sundry Moss, 23, is the only one who dares to hazard that the crowd of ruffians backing away from the near-accident were pursuing Sparks rather than attempting his rescue.The trio of Thump, Eagleton and Ephram have not seen the last of Sparks. Walking home through an unfamiliar and doubtful part of town, Thump happens to save a policeman from certain death-by-falling-piano, thereby incurring Mrs. Sparks' heartfelt gratitude for preserving her cousin, the perpetrator, from a murder charge.This might again have been the end of it, but the trio, inspired by an incident in a play, determine that the lovely balloon ascensionist, Mrs. Roberto, must be in need of rescuing. Their mission leads them to a house of ill-repute (not that they ever realize where they are) and a run-in with the gang that's after Sparks, from which they escape thanks to Sparks' youngest son and his urchin friend who lead them over Portland's slippery rooftops. Sparks' network of less-than-respectable relatives continues to aid the trio as they seek Mrs. Roberto from Bangor to Dresden Mills, taking up with a large party of hoboes along the way.Meanwhile, Moss, attempting to distract his employer, has taken Walton to visit his uncle in Norridgewock, though they never make it quite that far. The train is delayed in Bowdoinham where Walton is pressed to come to the aid of a glum prize pig. Perplexed by the locals' assumption of his expertise in porcine matters (the reader has been let-in on the misunderstanding), but as willing and easy-going as ever, Walton embarks on a visit to the Ferns, unhappy owners of the depressed pig, where Moss, a farmer's son and a bit more worldly than his fellow Moosepathians, soon susses the problem.With digressions for the furtherance of romance and good acquaintance, Reid piles misunderstandings upon misunderstandings, constructing a hilarious journey through the towns and by-ways of Maine and the social strata of its best inhabitants. It all culminates in a spectacular and chaotic natural disaster, reuniting the League and necessitating numerous rescues and confusion and some wonderfully vivid writing.Lots of local color and history round out the adventure. Reid's prose is playful, witty and dry, as well as eloquent and visual. The contrast between the transparent innocence of the steadfastly clueless trio and the sharp wits of Sundry Moss (think young George Burns and Gracie Allen) is a pleasure, further enhanced by the ready-for-anything calm of Toby Walton. Reid (whose Maine roots go back more than two centuries) leaves us with a tantalizing hint of the next to come in the League's adventures. These books are for anyone who enjoys wit and good-natured storytelling in the Dickensian tradition."},{"Title":"Mrs. Roberto : Or the Widowy Worries of the Moosepath League","review":"I had lunch with Van Reid in August of 2001.

Reid does an amazing job of incorporating late 19th century Maine and its legends into a coherent, if chaotic, yarn. Frankly, I couldn't tell you the plots of these stories if I had to; but the characterizations and descriptions of incidents are sheer joy. If I have a criticism at all of the series, it is that Reid leaves plot lines dangling--with no promise that they will be resolved. Three volumes and twelve years later, I'm still waiting to learn whether Mollie Peer and Wyck O'Hearn ever got back together. It's now been seven years since we last heard of Sundry Moss who was doing some dangling of his own. PLEASE, Van Reid, tie it together and let us move on."},{"Title":"Mrs. Roberto : Or the Widowy Worries of the Moosepath League","review":"How could I have missed this series? I enjoy stories set in this period because my own father was born in 1890; in Kentucky. He was a small-town boy, following the work to Ohio where he and several of his brothers settled.I can picture him being a member of such a club as the Moosepath League and having small adventures such as author Reid depicts in this series of books. My father was not bumbling like most of these characters, but he was witty and funny and would no doubt have led them on even more exciting adventures.Reid paints a vivid picture of a small town of the late 80s ... filled with characters who would make entertaining neighbors. They'd certainly liven up any neighborhood with their quaint, old-fashioned, yet quirky fun.It's obvious this is a satire, and I love satire myself. (I discovered these books because on Amazon.com they were placed beside one of the books I wrote: THE TOONIES INVADE SILICON VALLEY. While the TOONIES does not disparage our lovely Valley in anyway, I certainly delighted in poking a bit of fun at our techie culture ... tongue-in-cheek humor, of course ... as Mr. Reid does in these books.)Fun reads! Enjoy all four."},{"Title":"Laws of Islamic Governance","review":"Those interested in the true doctrines of Islam and its Sharia law need look no further than a copy of this text by Al-Mawardi (d. 1058), which establishes the legal code by which countless Islamic rulers have acted. Even moderate scholars today proclaim these laws remain very much in force.So look at the 20 chapters contained here. They cover everything from the means of appointing an imam to the means of dividing war booty and slaves; from the definition of the realm of jihad to the imposition of land and poll taxes on conquered non-Muslim peoples. Other chapters cover wars waged for the public good and rulings governing criminal actions.In the opening chapter, Mawardi discusses the establishment of \\"imamate,\\" which is necessary to determine who shall rule the Muslims. The imam appointed must be obeyed. Muslims must follow good and bad leaders alike. Following the good will reward both good people and leaders in the next life, while following the bad will reward the followers and punish the offensive leaders. (p. 11)Furthermore, once the \\"obligation\\" has been established, following the imam becomes incumbent upon all Muslims both socially and collectively, \\"like the jihad and the acquisition of knowledge.\\" As Mawardi explains it, amongst the seven requirements for the imam is \\"courage and bravery enabling them to defend the territory of Islam and to mount jihad against the enemy.\\" This is undoubtedly how Osama bin Laden sees things, and he has undoubtedly appointed himself imam for all Muslims to pursue the perpetual jihad.Chapter 4, on the Amirate of Jihad, is especially enlightening. Here are outlined in great detail the efforts that must be undertaken in war against infidels. The men and horses must be treated with kindness, but fighters are urged to go to battle \\"light and heavy and fight with your wealth.\\" The entire enterprise must ensure that the assailants \\"be vigorous and brave and aware that he will not fail in withstanding the enemy,\\" otherwise fighting is forbidden. Muslims fight, in other words, to win. (p. 64)Against those previously invited to Islam, who have rejected it, Muslims fight either \\"to harry [the infidels] from their houses and to inflict damage on them day and night, by fighting and burning; or else to declare war and combat them in ranks....\\" (p. 60) With such people, there can be no peace. Against those attacked before they were called to Islam, \\"blood money must be paid.\\" (p. 60) This, however, can be less than blood money paid for Muslims.The amir, when urging his army to jihad, may incite someone to die if he knows the death will either \\"incite the Muslims to fight and avenge him, or that it will cause the mushrikun [infidels] to lose heart on account of his audacity against them....\\" p. 64)As for the rights and duties in jihad, the fighters must a) not retreat before an army that is twice as large, b) fight for victory over the infidels even if the latter detest it, c) share the war booty according to the laws of Allah, and d) not show preference to relatives in the division of war booty. (pp. 70-73) But all four actions come with prayers that Allah \\"kill the enemies of Allah, the kafir [infidel] leaders, and the chiefs of deviation....\\"Chapter 5 lays out the three kinds of jihad other than that fighting against the infidels: fighting renegades, rebels or bandits. Renegades are those who have been Muslims, at one time, either by birth or by profession. They must be put to death, either immediately, or by allowing them three days to avow their error and return to the faith. (pp. 83-84). The chapter even discusses the means of disposal of the body, and should the person leave the land of Islam for the land of war, (dar al-harb), the dispersion of their possessions as war booty.Rebels are those who contest and deviate from the teachings of the imam, and they too must be punished, although not by death. But they must be fought to bring an end to the schism. Bandits must be killed or crucified, or their hands and feet cut off on alternate sides. (pp. 88-93)Any way you slice these laws, there is not much peace and light in them. It's hard to see how moderate Muslims can think them moderate.--Alyssa A. Lappen"},{"Title":"Laws of Islamic Governance","review":"Readers interested shari'a doctrines must read this text by Al-Mawardi (d. 1058), establishing the legal code by which countless Islamic rulers have acted. Moderate scholars even today today proclaim that these laws remain in force.These 20 chapters cover everything from how to appoint an imam, impose land and poll taxes on conquered peoples and divide booty and slaves. They also define the realm of jihad and explain how wars may be waged for the public good. Finally they discuss rulings that govern criminal actions.Upon opening, Mawardi discusses the establishment of \\"imamate,\\" which he considers necessary to determine rules over Muslims. He writes that the appointed imam must be obeyed --- and followed whether good or bad. Following the good, Mawardi observes, rewards both good people and leaders in the next life. Following bad leaders, he concludes, rewards followers and somehow (inexplicably) punishes the offensive leaders. (p. 11)Furthermore, Mawardi notes, once the \\"obligation\\" has been established, following the imam is incumbent on all Muslim believers, socially and collectively. He equates this rule with the mandate that all believers also practice \\"jihad and the acquisition of knowledge.\\" Mawardi explains that the imam's seven requirements include \\"courage and bravery enabling them to defend the territory of Islam and to mount jihad against the enemy,\\" to pursue perpetual jihad.Chapter 4, on the Amirate of Jihad, is especially enlightening. Here Mawardi details wartime efforts required against non-believers. Men and horses must be treated with kindness, Mawardi contends, and warriors must attend battle both \\"light and heavy and fight with your wealth.\\" Moreover, Mawardi instructs followers to ensure that these men are \\"vigorous and brave and aware that [they] will not fail....\\" In other words, if believers cannot win the war, then Mawardi writes that God forbids them to fight. Mawardi observes that sharia doctrine requires believers to engage only in wars they can win. (p. 64)Mawardi also teaches that Muslims must fight those people invited to Islam who rejected it. He instructs fighters \\"to harry [them] from their houses and to inflict damage on them day and night, by fighting and burning; or else to declare war and combat them in ranks....\\" If Muslims attack and kill people not yet invited to Islam, Mawardi instructs them to pay \\"blood money,\\" (p. 60) albeit with lesser amounts than required for Muslims who have been killed.Mawardi instructs jihad fighters a) not to retreat before an army twice as large, b) to fight for victory, to c) share war spoils among Muslims and d) not to allow preferences for relatives in dividing the spoils. (pp. 70-73) Mawardi notes that all four actions must also accompany prayers to annihilate the \\"the enemies of Allah....\\"Readers definitely obtain a clear understanding of sharia law.---Alyssa A.

The author's portrayl of the historical figures was very interesting, as some of them were different to the general consensus of historians. For example, the Woodvilles are shown in a favourable light: something which appeals to me, as I personally can see no evidence for why they have been slandered in the first place.The portrayal of Richard III however was not very positive, which was shocking to me as I am used to reading books that try to show him in a positive light: a 'different' light. But this book was written in the 1960s, and so perhaps this new pro-Richard attitude had not emerged as strongly at that time.This novel gives a good background to what happened during the years 1461 onwards of the Wars of the Roses, and yet because of this the narrative is a little stilted. There is not enough of a reader-character relationship established for my taste as a reader."},{"Title":"The White Rose","review":"Although it's very refreshing to read a book on the Wars of the Roses without Elizabeth and her mother Jacquetta whistling up storms and casting love potions. No *woe is me* either :pThe White Rose begins in 1461 shortly after Edward IV's victory at the Battle of Towton. Widowed Elizabeth Woodville meets the new king when pleads for the return of her lands so she can support herself and her two young sons. Edward is immediately smitten with Elizabeth's great beauty and weds her in secret - much to the eventual chagrin of his advisors who hoped to marry him to a foreign princess. Elizabeth is eventually crowned queen and begins having one baby after another while her family rises high in Edward's service, causing friction and resentment among the rest of the nobility. For those familiar with the period you know the basics and for those who aren't it's much too complicated and spoilerish to give all the details.As refreshing as it was to read about the Woodvilles without them snarling in their evilness or casting spells, they were just too OTT in their saintly goodness - and that is the great flaw in this book. The Woodvilles and That Upstart Henry Tudor = very very good, wonderful caring people. Clarence and Buckingham = silly buffoons (and a drunk one in Clarence's case). Richard III = very very bad, a dreadful evil tyrant that everyone in the Kingdom hated. So if you're one of those enamored by the saintly Richard painted by some of today's latest and *cough* greatest historical fiction authors, I'd say this is probably not the book for you.I did enjoy this book and would recommend it for first time readers looking to get a basic grounding on the period, since it's lighter on the battles and the intrigues you can just concentrate on who is who. I'm not a scholar of the period but outside of the type-casting I didn't catch anything out of place either. Still tops with me for novels on this period is Penman's fabulousThe Sunne In Splendour, with Tannahill'sSeventh Sonand Whitford'sTreasona close second and third, and I'm anxiously awaiting Susan Higginbotham'sThe Stolen Crownnext year."},{"Title":"Animals and Women: Feminist Theoretical Explorations","review":"This book is eye-opening. If we call a woman a pig, are be being verbally abusive to the woman, the pig, or both? The book helps us understand the psycological roots of violence: violence and male dominance (i.e., the spiritual hunter). The author draws many correlations throughout the book. This is not a quick read for the thinking person but an excellent study in human thought, words, and actions throughout our society, relating to women. Whether or not we agree with what is written here, we will certainly give it some thought."},{"Title":"Animals and Women: Feminist Theoretical Explorations","review":"Shipping was prompt and condition was fair.

This book applies well to any business aiming for high (35%+ per annum) growth and the tremendous strain this places on having a shared understanding of the company's goals, direction, and values.Meyer presents many attributes of successful, aggressive information-age companies and provides stimulating ideas about where and how to steer an organization's culture. Maintaining a sense of urgency and challenging things that brought about current success are hard to do, but this book sheds some light on how to avoid complacency.I find the book a tad chauvinistic about Silicon Valley, but the area certainly has an enviable track record. I do think his ideas will work elsewhere. :)"},{"Title":"Relentless Growth: How Silicon Valley Innovation Strategies Can Work in Your Business","review":"Drawing from the experiences of Silicon Valley's &quot;best and brighest,&quot; Meyer shows how innovation can be learned and managed. He introduces a model that synthesizes the core elements of innovation and he explores the organizational nature and leadership characteristics of successful high technology firms. Meyer succeeds in conveying the intangible dynamics of these exceptional enterprises. The book is rich in insights that apply to organizations who are striving for a competitive edge. Meyer shows how knowledge, creativity and passion are pivotal to creating weath and shaping the future."},{"Title":"Relentless Growth: How Silicon Valley Innovation Strategies Can Work in Your Business","review":"Developing successful new products and services is one of the most difficult tasks that a company has. Unless your products and services have very long life cycles (something that occurs less and less these days), your growth will depend a lot on how well you perform. The book's premise is that starting with the processes that work for the rapid growth, short life cycle companies in Silicon Valley, you can gather important insights. That's a sound and intriguing idea, and it is well executed by Christopher Meyer. One of the things I liked was that he looked beyond Silicon Valley to find how other companies of all sizes and types were employing the same principles. One of my favorite examples in the book was of Emerson Electric.Here are the book's chapter titles: (1) Knowledge -- The Motherlode of Value (2) The Loose-Tight World of Innovation (3) Leading . . . with an attitude (4) Strategy in a $20 Billion Startup (5) Relentless Approach to Innovation (6) Collective Power of Pairs (7) Measuring Your Measurement System (8) Getting from Here to ThereThe key point of the book is that each company needs to create an attitude among its people which fosters growth. Meyer does a good job of comparing and contrasting what what makes innovation work from what makes running existing operations excell. Unless you create this attitude, the normal operating needs will push out the needs of innovation.Building on Intel's Andy Grove's advice about paranoia, Meyer proposes having positive paranoia in regard to the need or positive momentum and change. He also encourages companies to look outward solely, rather than inward. He wants a flatter organizational structure that blurs the organizational boundaries among functions. He favors promoting people who have a passion for innovation and what your company does. He suggests stretch goals that are acted upon, with the whole process repeated.I found the thoughts in the book to be accurately portrayed and very appropriate advice. A number of the examples were also new to me, which made the book more interesting. A good adjunct to this book is Mike Pessemier's original research from the 1970s on how the best companies develop new products. The case studies in this book draw on important lessons from that research.Don't sit on your laurels. Develop your innovation attitude by applying the lessons of this book as a first step! That's the kind of leadership that can make a difference!"},{"Title":"Comprehensive English-Esperanto Dictionary","review":"The coverage of English and the distinction between various senses of the English words and idioms defined is very thorough. However, the Esperanto equivalents given are not always the words in most common use for the given concept. Benson has a tendency to list a precise neologism while failing to mention the actual, everyday word for the concept (which may have a broader or less precise meaning than the rarely used word). E.g., for \\"to count\\" he lists \\"kompti\\", a word hardly ever used, and does not mention \\"kalkuli\\", the word routinely used for that action (though it also means \\"to calculate, do arithmetic\\", etc.). There are several similar errors that make me hesitate to trust Benson on any given word until I have checked what he tells me against other sources such as the Plena Vortaro or the Reta Vortaro. But, in combination with other sources, Benson can be very useful, especially in translating materials from English into Esperanto."},{"Title":"Comprehensive English-Esperanto Dictionary","review":"The Comprehensive English-Esperanto Dictionary is so thorough in its coverage of English and in its inclusion of idiomatic expression that it is simply a must-have for Anglophone Esperantists who wish to compose in the Inter-National Language. I should stress that it would not be of much use if you do not speak Esperanto with some degree of fluency. But CEED can be of immeasurable value in breaking out of phrase-book and beginner's textbook Esperanto."},{"Title":"Comprehensive English-Esperanto Dictionary","review":"Without a doubt, this is the most complete English-Esperanto dictionary currently available. Certainly no bilingual person, or translator should rely solely on a single source, but this should be one of the most important ones. The only reason that I rate this at 4 stars instead of five is that there are a few obvious typos scattered through it."},{"Title":"Comprehensive English-Esperanto Dictionary","review":"CEED is almost universally recommended as the best English-Esperanto dictionary out there, and from what I've seen, it definitely is. Yet, it still falls a bit short of what we really need in the ideal English-Esperanto dictionary.The first major problem is that is NOT comprehensive... this isn't for lack of bizarrely specialized words \\"azygous\\" (which it has) or \\"nicad\\" (which it also has), but actually useful words like \\"coconut\\" and \\"furry,\\" which are nowhere to be found.Benson is overly fond of grouping related words together, rather than simply using the alphabetical order one expects in a dictionary. If you look up the entry for \\"nut\\", you'll also find the translations for Brazil nut, candlenut, chestnut, \\"nut\\" in slang uses, \\"nut\\" in the sense of nut and bolt, etc. I imagine he meant to include \\"coconut\\" here, but in departing from simple alphabetizing, this (and many other would-be entries) were inadvertently left out.Similarly for \\"furry,\\" if you look up \\"fur\\" you'll find the definition for a mammal's skin (pelto), clothing made from it (peltajxo) and \\"fur\\" as \\"coating on the tongue\\" (tartro)! But something got left out... what is is it that you pet when you pet your cat? Nothing directs you to the word in general use for fur, \\"hararo\\" with its adjective form \\"harara\\" serving for furry. However, if you want to look up the words \\"furan\\" or \\"furbelow\\" (whatever they are), don't worry, they have their proper Esperanto equivalents proudly printed at their side.Secondly, the given Esperanto equivalents sometimes seem to represent a personal preference rather than the predominant usage among Esperanto speakers. For instance, if you want to know the word for \\"airplane,\\" the translation is simply given as \\"avio.\\" The fact is that \\"aviadilo\\" is still the most common word for \\"airplane,\\" although \\"avio\\" is thankfully gaining in popularity. Benson translates \\"aircraft\\" correctly as \\"aviadilo\\" but doesn't indicate that it still is the everyday word to use for airplane, as well.Thirdly, there is no Esperanto grammar provided. It's common for most bilingual dictionaries to include a short grammatical summary, and after the wonderful 35-page grammatical summary of Esperanto in J.C. Wells' Teach Yourself Esperanto Dictionary, it's a travesty for any later effort to omit this.Lastly, why not an Esperanto-English dictionary with it? The one-way direction of this dictionary means that everyone is forced to turn to another source for translating unfamiliar Esperanto words to English. If Benson had skimped on the esoteric entries, there could well be room for a Esperanto-English section, which given the nature of Esperanto's structure, would be much shorter than the English-Esperanto section.Now the good news, and it is VERY good:In spite of all shortcomings, CEED IS an essential tool. It does have the vast majority of the words you'll need, and its translations are always understandable even if they are sometimes more specific, or more unusual than you would expect.But by far the greatest advantage is its numerous full-sentence translations of idiomatic English expressions into Esperanto. This is goes far beyond what I've seen any other bilingual dictionary attempt. The entry for \\"go\\" for example, has a page-and-a-half of wonderful example sentences on almost every sense of the word you can imagine. The helpfulness of this feature cannot be exaggerated. No Anglophone Esperantist should be without it."},{"Title":"Comprehensive English-Esperanto Dictionary","review":"This reference lives up to it's claim...&quot;Comprehensive&quot;. If you're going to write in esperanto this a great book to have. I selected it over other works because it appeared to be the most up-to-date esperanto dictionary available, although I do wish it went both ways (ENG &lt;-&gt; ESP). Though I'm new to the language of esperanto, those who have an expert command of the language have also recommended this as a top-notch reference for both beginners and experienced speakers."},{"Title":"Comprehensive English-Esperanto Dictionary","review":"Most English words, from the common [eg.&quot;of&quot;=multiple listings] to technical, medical/scientific and some needing an unabridged ENGLISH dictionary are included, generally justifying the 'Comprehensive' in the title. Colloquialisms and neologisms are noted. The biggest lack I find is when there is room for a notation which would help the user categorize an obscure word [with sci/med/mil etc.] and that is not done. Overall, this is an eminently worthwhile book for anyone intersted in Esperanto!"},{"Title":"Comprehensive English-Esperanto Dictionary","review":"Be warned--- this dictionary is English-to-Esperanto only. If you are learning or using Esperanto in any way, you will need a dictionary with an Esperanto-to-English section as well. I recommend the one by J. C. Wells.While this dictionary is very comprehensive, I still use my Wells dictionary much more and find it more reliable. Neither dictionary indicates whether an Esperanto word comes from the Fundamento or is official. The CEED does keep some of the more recent neologisms in a ghetto in the back of the book, however. (I'd rather see the neologisms in the dictionary proper, but marked, and perhaps with a more common Esperanto word given as an alternative.)I believe that any English-speaking Esperantist who already possessed the Wells dictionary would get some good use out of this more complete, but one way only dictionary."},{"Title":"Beyond Earth's Gates / Daybreak - 2250 A.D.","review":"The 1954 Ace sci-fi double numbered D-69 is a particularly notable paperback for vintage collectors. It includes one of the earliest appearances of Andre Norton's very first novel, \\"Daybreak--2250 A.D.\\" (which first appeared in 1952 under the title \\"Star Man's Son\\"), as well as the first--and, I believe, to this date, the only--book edition of Henry Kuttner and C.L. Moore's \\"Beyond Earth's Gates.\\" This paperback should also be of interest to collectors as it is only the sixth sci-fi double that Ace ever released, out of a catalog that eventually numbered in the hundreds. I would like to confine my comments here to the Kuttner-Moore work, as the Norton story is by now extremely well known and oft discussed. \\"Daybreak\\" is a wonderful introduction to an author who would deservedly attain enormous popularity, and features the heroic action and human-animal rapport that would become her hallmarks. Seldom discussed, if at all, is \\"Beyond Earth's Gates,\\" a novel that first saw the light of day in the September 1949 issue of \\"Startling Stories,\\" under the title \\"The Portal in the Picture.\\" This is a preferable title, I feel, as it gives the reader a more precise inkling of what the book is about. In it, we meet Eddie Burton, an up-and-coming Broadway actor who gets into big trouble with the cops when his annoying ladyfriend, Lorna, disappears into a framed Rousseau painting on his living room wall! And shortly thereafter, Eddie also disappears into the portal in the picture, and appears in the land of Malesco, which he had heard about in supposedly make-believe stories told by his Uncle Jim many years before. Malesco, as it turns out, is all too real; a sort of alternate Earth that had split off from our own space/time shortly after the rule of Caligula. Vaguely Roman in setup, Malesco is completely dominated by its priesthood, the keepers of the religion of Alchemy, and lorded over by the very intimidating figure known as the Hierarch. As had Uncle Jim, Eddie and Lorna become involved in an incipient people's revolution against the priesthood; a seemingly hopeless cause....Anyway, I have often referred to Kuttner and Moore as sci-fi's preeminent husband-and-wife writing team, but it can be fairly stated that they also excelled in the fields of fantasy and, as in their masterful \\"Valley of the Flame\\" (1946), a meld of the two genres. \\"Beyond Earth's Gates\\" is certainly a hybrid sci-fi/fantasy tale, and a darn good one at that. To make their bizarre plot a bit more credible, the authors continuously have Eddie tell us that he is no hero. He makes constant references to Edgar Rice Burroughs and H. Rider Haggard, telling us that John Carter might do this or Allan Quatermain might do that, but that he was too chickenhearted to do anything. Eddie is certainly not your classic adventure hero; just a dude who's gotten in waaay over his head, and this somehow makes the story more believable. He is a very humorous narrator, too. For example, he compares his plight in Malesco to a space alien trying to navigate the N.Y.C. subways, and tells us that nobody in N.Y.C. \\"subway change booths has ever been known to speak in human tongues\\"! When he learns that the Malescans look on N.Y.C. as an otherworldly paradise, he says, \\"Believe me, I know better!\\" (As a native New Yorker, I thought these lines were quite amusing.) The authors, very cleverly, even manage to explain the mysteries of Joan of Arc's voices, Kaspar Hauser and Peter Rugg, by tying them in with the Malescans. This short novel (the whole thing runs to less than 140 pages) concludes with an extremely suspenseful denouement, with Eddie facing off against the Hierarch whilst thousands of Malescans watch the fate of their world hang in the balance. Wonderful stuff. Anyway, shortly after \\"The Portal in the Picture\\"'s 1949 release, Kuttner and Moore moved to the West Coast to earn their degrees at the University of Southern California. Only two more sci-fi novels would be forthcoming from the team, \\"The Well of the Worlds\\" in 1952 and the \\"fix-up\\" novel \\"Mutant\\" in 1953. A reading of \\"Beyond Earth's Gates\\" will likely convince most readers that even toward the end of this prolific team's legendary career, they were still capable of extraordinary, highly entertaining work."},{"Title":"Contemporary Irish Drama: From Beckett to McGuinness","review":"A good counterpart to recent surveys by Christopher Murray and by Nicholas Grene, Dr Roche concentrates on Irish drama over roughly the post-WW2 period up to the early 1990s. His juxtapositions work energetically to open up new perspectives on Beckett--no small feat given the weight of scholarship that confronts the novice to his drama. By playing off Godot against Behan's Quare Fellow, we see that Roche's thesis--of the recent Irish drama less concerned with conventional plot than an entry into the void, what waits outside the wings of the stage--gains force.His chapters on Tom Murphy, Friel, Tom Kilroy, and plays about \\"The Troubles\\" continue this exploration into less comforting, confrontational plays exploding (at best) stereotypical limitations of Ireland and its representation. Roche avoids jargon, constructs his points carefully and cleverly, and brings to us welcome insights and a refusal to fall into cliche as he winnows down forty-odd years of plays to concentrate on the writers best suited to challenge us today.At one point he reflects how lucky he was to see a particular play in many performances, and how he sat \\"rapt.\\" Such enthusiasm, tempered with a wide knowledge of contexts within which internationally and locally to place the drama he studies, add to the appeal and the energy found in this volume."},{"Title":"Mostly Happy Clip Art of the 30'S, 40'S, and 50's: Scan, Photocopy, Stat","review":"If you've ever needed a quick, slightly silly, duty-free graphic that can inject a quick dose of humor to your project, then Mostly Happy Clip Art of the Thirties, Forties, and Fifties should solve your problem.

Email, online shopping and digital music downloaded from the Internet are now integral parts of our everyday lives. Technology aware companies have now turned to wireless web for the next big leap in commerce and communication. The race is on for deploying cutting-edge wireless technology.As a business and technology consultant I am often asked by clients to provide some guidelines on how to proceed in this new and fast moving industry. Is trading stocks using a wireless PDA really a secure transaction and are electronic coupons delivered to customers via cell phones a technical feasible marketing solution? What communications provider should I use when connecting my sales force via WAP based browsers to a wireless CRM solution? And should we look to Europe and Japan for the future in wireless communication, or will it turn out to be another bursting bubble as we have experienced with too many dot.com business ventures?\\"The Wireless Web\\", unlike so many other books covering technology topics, provides an easy to read and well-structured roadmap on how to develop a winning wireless strategy. Bergeron starts off explaining the history of this industry and it's economic drivers and then provides an overview of the current state of technologies, the various systems, protocols and technical standards used in the US and compares them to the more cohesive and further developed Japanese and European technologies. The latter part of the book focuses on the future, introducing the reader to opportunities and potential risks wireless technologies will offer as well as technical and political limitations it will face as this technology matures He closes with a well structured guideline on how to develop a wireless strategy of any scale.In summary, this book will familiarize the reader with this new and dynamic industry and provide the knowledge required to develop, communicate, and execute a successful wireless strategy. Although written for the non-technical executive, I recommend this book to every one confronted with wireless technologies, the corporate executive implementing a wireless enterprise information portal as well as the cell phone user confronted with evaluating roaming charges, communication protocols and coverage areas when selecting a calling plan. This book definitely deserves a place on the bookshelf of any technologist."},{"Title":"The Wireless Web: How to Develop and Execute a Winning Wireless Strategy","review":"Wireless Web is a refreshing kind of book. I'm tired of books that introuduce a new technology, paint a rosy picture, and then leave the reader dangling three months later. This isn't one of those books. It tells it like it is. Wireless isn't easy. In fact, implementing a Wireless Web solution is nearly at the bleeding edge of what's possible, as the author states. There are traps at every corner, and you'd better know what to expect. In this respect, the Wireless Web provides a map of the &quot;speed bumps&quot; along the way. If you're going to give it a go on the Wireless Web, you'd better have this book or some other roadmap with you."},{"Title":"The Wireless Web: How to Develop and Execute a Winning Wireless Strategy","review":"Having just put down Bergeron's last book, &quot;The Eternal E-Customer&quot;, I was interested to see his visionary take on the wireless web. I wasn't disappointed. &quot;The Wireless Web&quot; compellingly captures the multitude of opportunities which the unethering of the Web affords. What I appreciated most about this book (and Bergeron's style as in his previous book) was the practical advice on how any executive can take advantage of these wireless opportunities. Bergeron succinctly explains how a company can embrace this new technology to their competitive advantage. Five stars!"},{"Title":"The Wireless Web: How to Develop and Execute a Winning Wireless Strategy","review":"Many people have been impressed by what they have seen of the new wireless services in Europe and Japan. Based on the promise of these offerings, wireless operators have spent billions of dollars for 3G licenses in Europe that will require tens of billions to implement. Based on the amount of money invested and planned for the next few years, it looks like the days of broadband wireless Internet are about to be with us. What should you be doing now? That's the question that this book addresses.The Wireless Web is the best book I have seen for describing the background of how technology and customer needs are converging to provide new wireless offerings and the potential for new ways to solve problems. About two-thirds of the book is aimed at providing a layperson's description of technology, social, and governmental developments that will influence what will be offered by companies. The remaining third gives you a template for thinking about what these developments mean for your business. For most people now, that decision will relate to when to get involved.In my consulting practice, it is clear that there are enormous opportunities now to develop intellectual property and new business models that can be implemented immediately. For those who mainly want to use the wireless web as an adjunct to their businesses, on the other hand, you have lots of time.The best advice in the book is to be sure that you have the business processes in place that will allow you to connect wireless technology to your business when the rest of the infrastructure and equipment are in place.Basically, wireless Internet connections will become more important as a disruptive technology than the land-wire connected Internet. By always having a device present (whether a cell phone, personal digital assistant, pager, or some new device), individuals will be able to simplify their lives while they are on the go or in any fixed location. As a result, transactions will be transformed. For example, food manufacturers may have to bid for a consumer's business while she or he is walking down the aisles of a supermarket.For the first time, you will be able to shape the entire consumer or customer experience around what that person prefers. The potential for positive differentiation becomes enormous, as a result.My main caution to you is that this field is rapidly changing. This information will become out-of-date rapidly. So read the book now if you are going to.After you have considered some of the ways that the wireless Internet can improve your offerings, I suggest that you go back to the drawing boards to see how much of these changes you can offer now without broadband wireless connections. In this way, the wireless Internet can be a powerful metaphor now for improving your performance.Be helpful . . . all the time and everywhere!"},{"Title":"The Wireless Web: How to Develop and Execute a Winning Wireless Strategy","review":"My company specializes in wireless devices, like Palm 7s and Blackberry's, Motorolla pagers, and cell phones, and we've traditionally had a rough time getting our sales force up to speed on the &quot;big picture&quot; of wireless.

As the author states, it's simply a matter of time, not if, wireless will touch every aspect of our lives."},{"Title":"Children of God","review":"Using historical figures as fictional characters, Fisher tells the story of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, two very different personalities, who, respectively, founded and preserved the religion of the Latter Day Saints, Fisher seems skeptical of the genuineness of Smith's vision but not of his sincerity. By turns Fisher is admiring of the Mormons' courage and bemused by their folly, especially on Smith's part. The book is most painfully sympathetic in its unflinching account of the cruel persecution of the Mormons in Missouri in the 1830s. The novel is vivid and obviously well-researched, though Fisher's conclusions may be controversial."},{"Title":"Children of God","review":"As a person who was raised in the Mormon faith and who still maintains close ties to my cultural heritage, I found this book to be a vivid and gripping retelling of what I see as the quintessential American epic. Fisher draws on his own experience growing up among the Mormons of Eastern Idaho as well as extensive research to paint portraits of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young in the early days of Mormonism. Fisher's gift for description never fails him, and his dialogue rings true (I love the phrase \\"Hit the grit!\\" that recurs throughout the novel).Fisher comes to the same conclusion that I have reached regarding the early church: that Joseph and Brigham and the others truly believed their own story. He balances sympathy with skepticism in his fictionalized narrative of some of the most remarkable events of the 19th century. How an obscure sect came to become a major religion is truly an epic-worthy tale, and Fisher tells it with skill and the commitment to craft that characterizes all of his writing. He is oddly prescient in his predictions about the transformation that the church will undergo as it strives to become increasingly mainstream and to distance itself from its controversial, polygamous, henotheistic roots.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the Mormons or the West, or in the nature of religious faith and the actions it can inspire. The story of a people persecuted for their beliefs who turn tragedy into triumph and make a desert blossom like the rose is truly an American epic."},{"Title":"Children of God","review":"Vardis Fisher has long been a favorite of mine - a writing style uncompromised by time, although I somehow feel he would have had more fun writing in the liberation of today. Having read most of his novels long ago, I finally got around to \\"The Children of God\\". His historical novel, written somewhat in the same method Homer used in commingling fact with the literary license to turn history into a novel, is based on the origins of the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints. (Mormon) Fisher himself was from a Mormon background, thus close to his own roots in choosing this particular subject matter and it is always more than good to have first hand knowledge to draw on when delving into something like this. However, as the individualist he seemed to be, he preferred to do his own thinking, distancing himself from the Church, and this breaking away allowed his talent to perform freely and with out strict adherence to \\"faith\\". From what I can tell with my limited, yet fairly well-read knowledge of Mormonism , it is very well researched; Fisher was known for that kind of work. (i.e. - \\"Suicide or Murder?\\" - regarding the death of Merriwether Lewis) This particular work of literary art is yet another production of that talent.It starts just like it is widely known to begin - with the \\"revelation and vision\\" to Joseph Smith by God and Jesus, bidding him do the work of Prophet in establishing a new, \\"true Faith and Church\\". (Fisher let's it be firmly known that Joseph did not actually see the Golden Plates, but when asked if he did by the inquiring minds, he felt he must say that he had, because he knew that was the underlying power that would launch the religion; to say he had not seen anything would have not served his purpose as the New Prophet. This is the idea that Fisher intimates, and seems not to care if anyone should take issue with it.Fisher subtly lets the story and the personalities that develop delineate the vast personal differences between Joseph Smith, the dreamy, removed from reality self-proclaimed Prophet of the Saints and the robust, pragmatic Brigham Young, a convert who became Smith's most loyal supporter. It was apparent to me at least, that were it not for Brigham, there would be no Mormon Church today; that it was through his unbending strength and practicality regarding all things human that kept it going forward through the Missouri tribulations that threatened to fragment and derail the entire thing; but even more importantly, as the \\"Atlas\\" that brought the migration of thousands across the plains to Utah under unimaginable, perilous circumstances. The Missouri conflict is dealt with in such a way as to very effectively cast shame to those who would deny the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and common courtesy to others of a controversial religion while accepting the violence of mob rule as an acceptable, even \\"normal\\" way of crushing it. It is impossible to understand for most of us, but bringing it to readers is such a way is part of the importance of this work. (I can imagine the reactions this must have caused when it was first published in 1939). Joseph Smith managed to survive the persecution of those earlier years, landing on his feet through jailings, mob violence, at the hands of those that were termed \\"gentiles.\\" But of course, that abeyance would not last for him.But the road to Sainthood was far from being paved with gold; it was fraught with peril at every turn, angst, power struggles, revelations from the Lord to persuade upon the followers (not all of them popular at first); a steady, mounting crescendo moving under more and more layers of Faith and Instruction to be distributed and translated; and before you know it, the reader is inside the mind of a working Prophet.It's an amazing work, worthy of all the positive accolades afforded it at the time of its printing. If you are sympathetic to the LDS religion, or even if you are not, \\"Children of God\\" must be considered an excellent historical accounting - worth reading because it provides a completely different and powerful American Experience. Fisher makes no judgments; he simply spins the history of the Mormons from its roots outwards, according to the known background, breathing it life and blood through the magic of his pen."},{"Title":"Children of God","review":"I think this is a must for all Utahns, Mormon and \\"gentile\\".

Series 1, Adventure 1)","review":"If you have a train-loving tot like I do, you will be thrilled by these books and trains. My 3.5 yo has been Thomas the Tank crazy since before he was two. He got his first Railway Adventure book, The Torpedo Run, last Christmas when he was 2.5. That is the 3rd book in the series, so we have bought the other two since.The series starts with the storey of Tuck and Billy (girl) at their home in San Luis Obisbo, CA. The Daylight Limited goes by their house daily, and the whole family stops what they are doing to watch it go by. Tuck dreams up an idea for a train car, and the Holden family enters it into &quot;The invention of tomorrow&quot; contest in the 1939 World Fair. This starts the adventure that has Tuck and Billy riding on the Daylight Limited, the President Washington, and finally, the Torpedo.The trains all existed, and there are pictures of the actual engines. The text is much more than I normally read for my 3.5 yo, but he has been captivated since he was 2.5. Now, he has started asking me questions, and these books have really grown with him.In addition, Learning curve with Lionel has created toy replicas of the engines that run on batteries and are compatible with the TTT or Brio track and trains.

The second book still gave enough of an overview as to not loose the reader."},{"Title":"The Princely Courts of Europe 1500-1750","review":"Any aristocracy wants to extend its influence socially and geographically, and its first task in that pursuit is to be noticed, especially by means of very conspicuous consumption. In Europe between the Renaissance and the French Revolution, this meant the development of the court as probably the most important influence in a nation's political and cultural life. This lush volume surveys twelve of the great courts, from England, France, Russia, and Spain, to the princely establishments of Florence, Savoy, and Bavaria, as well as the singular oddity of the papal court in Rome. In addition to the pretty pictures -- which are very numerous -- the specialist authorities who wrote the chapters have investigated and largely reinterpreted the fuction of the European court. Whom, exactly, were they designed to impress? Were they really instruments of absolutism? How did they function, day to day? The picture that results is much more subtle than one might suppose, especially in the subject of power and patronage."},{"Title":"The Princely Courts of Europe 1500-1750","review":"This is a great reference book. It helped place several courts in perspective: Sabaudian, Wittelsbach, and Medici, for example, while giving important details of the machinations of others like the Swedish and House of Orange. The illustrations of the various palaces demonstrate the importance of architecture in both the image and organization of routines at court. Political aspects of the hunt, the importance of staircases, the role of mistresses, the location of the court and art as prestige are all considered. Like the other reviewer noted, it's not for beginners."},{"Title":"The Princely Courts of Europe 1500-1750","review":"\\"The Princely Courts of Europe: Ritual, Politics and Culture under the Ancien R&eacute;gime 1500-1750\\", by John Adamson is a splendid 350 page book, richly illustrated with rare engravings and full-page paintings from the period. After a lengthy 40-page introduction to the Ancien R&eacute;gime period and the historiography of European courts, the book is subdivided into separate chapters devoted to the most renown and resplendent courts of the age. In addition to the well-known courts of the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs, the French Bourbons, the Russian Romanovs and the English Stuarts, the book also includes chapters on lesser known courts such as the Bavarian court of the Wittelbachs, the Florentine court of the Medicis, the Lutheran court of the Prussian Hohenzollerns, and even the atypical yet no less important court of the Popes in Rome. It should not be mistakenly assumed from the large glossy pages and magnificent illustrations that this book is absent historical merit. Each chapter is rather well-written by separate professional historians dedicated to researching the courts under consideration. Although this period is characterized by a cosmopolitan style of court life, art, and architecture, there nonetheless emerge startling regional variations in the descriptions of the politics, artistry, and culture of the courts. The authors are generally critical of mid-twentieth century historical interpretation of these courts as merely the \\"functionalist\\" vehicles of princely \`propaganda' and political centralization. They rather take care to emphasize the political plurality, novelty and cultural heterogeneity present at these courts. Although the Bourbon court of Paris-Versailles enjoys a deserved preeminence in the public imagination, the prior French Valois and competing Habsburg courts in Spain and Austria serve as outstanding countertypes with only the most superficial similarities within the broader international-baroque culture of the Ancien R&eacute;gime. Many memorably idiosyncratic sovereigns and courts are detailed; including the peripatetic dual-court of Emperor Charles V, the pious \`hidden-court' of his misanthropic son King Phillip II, the byzantine and then occidental court of Tsar Peter I, the nepotistic court of the Popes in Rome, and of course the unforgettable courtly extravagance of the Sun-King Louis XIV. There are many curiosities here, such as the Habsburg family's magical unicorn horn and Peter the Greats' \\"All-Mad, All-Drunken, All-Jesting Assemblies\\", which will surely strike modern readers as outlandish and exotic despite the familiarity of the locations. Although the brilliant illustrations can be enjoyed by all, the text of this book is intended for serious students of European history and should be read with a background in the political, religious and economic history of the period."},{"Title":"The Princely Courts of Europe 1500-1750","review":"The paperback edition at ... approx is a great value. It has 350 pages of scrumptious illustrations on thick glossy paper. I've been looking for a book on how it was to live at court. The book has 35 pg on each of 10 or so courts of Europe. It talks about court procedure & ritual, not dates, facts, politics, policy. Philippe Erlanger wrote a similar book (The Age of Courts & Kings, probably out of print)some years ago. His book is more anecdotal. I like this new book better since it talks to court procedure, i.e. what you were supposed to do at court. If the book has a weak spot, it is that I would rather have more info on fewer courts.

Those words seem so incongruous. They seem dumb and odd and made-up. Like a self-effacing politician. How can a professional baseball team from San Francisco win a championship? How is that possible?To ask that question is to see the world from a post-1957 perspective. Before 1958, it was VERY possible. The San Francisco Seals from the old Pacific Coast League (PCL) - a high-level Triple A league - won no fewer than ELEVEN - count \`em, ELEVEN - championships - more than any other PCL team.Granted that a championship under PCL rules was arrived at through more direct routes than the multi-tiered playoff system extant in major league baseball today, there were still ELEVEN occasions when the Seals beat everyone there was to beat! Compare that with the record compiled by the team that has played in The City since 1958. The Seals outdistance that team by a total of ELEVEN! Jesus wept!As the title indicates, this book is not so much a history of the Seals or a highlight of Seals glory as it is a retrospective of the Seals teams that the author, Brent Kelley, grew up with. This includes a lot of lean years; 1946 through 1957 was not all gravy for the organization, and in fact, it was only by going public in 1954 that the team was able to survive at all. Kelley provides a good overview on the story of the Little Corporation that saved the Seals - for four years.Some information on the relationship that the Seals had with the major leagues is also provided. During the time frame in question, they had working relationships with the Pittsburgh Pirates, the New York Yankees, the Boston Red Sox - and ironically enough, even with the National League team in New York.Kelly also recapitulates Lefty O'Doul's stature as king of both San Francisco and Japan. The Seals' post-war reconciliation tour to Japan, led by O'Doul, is still remembered on both sides of the Pacific Ocean and it was made at the urging of none other than General MacArthur himself.The chapters are divided by the years in question, as Kelly interviews surviving players that he found from the teams that played during those years. The interviews themselves are unremarkable and seem to uniformly contain the patterns that one would expect of interviews with retired PCL baseball players: some players I stay in touch with; some I haven't seen in years; some are no longer with us; the money was nothing like the players are making today, but we worked harder and had more fun and I made more money on the Coast than I did (or would have) in the bigs and we didn't have to travel too far from home and we even had Mondays off and I'd do it again.The uniformity doesn't matter; the names should live forever in the annals of West Coast baseball: Frank Seward, Jeep Trower, Jack Brewer, Roy Nicely, Neill Sheridan, Joe Brovia, Bill Werle, Con Dempsey, Dario Lodigiani, Ed Cereghino, Bill Bradford, Rene Cheso, Nini Tornay, Jerry Zuvela, Jim Westlake, Ted Beard, Chuck Stevens, Bob DiPietro, Don Lenhardt, \\"Riverboat\\" Smith, Jack Spring, and Bert Thiel. Young fans once pronounced these names with reverence.Con Dempsey's story should be of particular interest because it removes some of the luster associated with the name of Branch Rickey. Dempsey's contract was ultimately sold by the Seals to the Pittsburgh Pirates of the major leagues. After he reported to the Pirates, Rickey, the innovative Hall of Fame executive who integrated the major leagues and invented the modern \\"farm\\" system for development of minor league players, ruined Dempsey's arm and his career by trying to force him to become an overhand pitcher, in spite of the success that Dempsey had attained by throwing sidearm and three-quarters. Evidently, the corporate mentality is no less prevalent in baseball than elsewhere, even among the best executives.Kelly also interviewed two players whose names that will be familiar to major league historians: Ferris Fain and Lou Burdette. Both had successful major league careers. I had not known that either of them had a resume that included a stint with the Seals. A credible case is made for Burdette's deserving membership in Baseball's Hall of Fame.And although they are not interviewed in this book, it is equally interesting to see that the Seals roster also included such familiar-sounding names as Frank Malzone, Ken Aspromonte, and Albie Pearson.And fans of the baseball team that currently plays in San Francisco (the one with no championships) will be interested to read the interview with ex-Seals shortstop Leo Righetti, father of Dave Righetti, whose major league career includes a stint in San Francisco as both a relief pitcher and a pitching coach. Befitting of an Italian surname, the Righetti family history in San Francisco baseball extends for two generations.The Seals saga has a bittersweet ending. After a number of years of futility, they win the 1957 PCL championship just before major league expansion from New York to San Francisco chases them out of The City. Most San Franciscans were delighted with the arrival of major league baseball, as can be seen from the tremendous welcome that Willie Mays &amp; Company received when they arrived and from the intense interest displayed after the season started.But there yet remained a strong minority of PCL fans who mourned the loss of their beloved Seals and regarded the invading strangers from New York as unworthy substitutes - especially the audacious presence of Willie Mays in Seals Stadium's centerfield threatening to appropriate the memory of the great Joe DiMaggio. How provincial those fans must have seemed at the time -- but did they possess some sort of crystal ball that foretold how the usurpers from New York would bring giant heartaches, endless futility --- and no championships?"},{"Title":"San Francisco Seals, 1946-1957: Interviews With 25 Former Baseballers","review":"I was one of those kids who hated seeing the carpetbagging Giants come in from New York in 1958. I grew up with the Seals and spent many days in the right field bleachers getting there early to get autographs and balls - lots of balls ended up in those bleachers. I went to my first game in 1949. I was there when Tony Ponce threw and won both games of a double header and when Earl Rapp of the Padres hit one out over the right field wall and on to the park across 16th Street - not many were ever hit out of the park to Right or Center Field in those days. For a long time then Mayor George Christopher started the Christopher Milk Club and it cost all of 9 cents to get in. I saw most of the players featured in the book and was a big fan of Con Dempsey, Joe Brovia, Reno Cheso, Chet Johnson, Nini Torney, and Jim Moran. It was great to read the interviews the author did with them and all the others.One of the biggest thrills I had as a kid was being on the field at Seals Stadium during a 1957 AAA Championship game between Polytechnic High and Sacred Heart. I was called up from the Poly JV's to catch batting practice before the game and to man the bullpen for that big game. On of our players Bill Simmons hit two over the left field wall during that batting practice.It was tough being an avid Seals fan to realize that the Seals actually faded away into history. In 1958 I had transfered to Mission High and played trombone in the school band on a flatbed truck for the parade held for the incoming Giants - It was an emotional day for me as I thought about the 8 seasons I was a loyal Seals fan. Of course over the years I started to like the Giants when my son Chris was growing up and started following players like Willie McCovey, Will Clark, Mike Sadek, Chili Davis and Mike Ivey. I really missed the Seals, but then I had a kind of foggy dream that some day I might be rooting for the San Francisco Giants to win both the National League Pennant and the World Series.

The setting for murder is an abandon house near a sewage disposal plant along the eastern shore of the Delaware River in Trenton, New Jersey. It is the fifth year of economic depression, marked by a growing anger and resentment directed at the wealthy class. This seamy murder pits a struggling family against wealth, aristocracy and political influence.Ellery Queen is now about ten years out of school. He still drives his aging Duesenberg, and he has not completely shed his penchant for making literary references. His growing reputation for his deductive skills has reached Trenton, allowing him to participate with the local authorities in the murder investigation.Although the Ellery Queen mysteries are now many decades old, they remain very entertaining. These mystery puzzles are among the best ever created, are quite challenging (but possible to solve), and yet are always imminently fair. The Halfway House plot provides a fair number of surprises, including the unexpected solution. Ellery Queen's logic is impeccable as he steps the reader through his deductions in the conclusion.Halfway House has only five chapters: The Tragedy, The Trail, The Trial, The Trap, and The Truth. I may be mistaken, but I believe that other than Calamity Town (1942), Halfway House is the only story in which the Ellery actually participates in courtroom proceedings.A word on gas prices: At one point in the trial a witness (a gas station attendant) testifies that the defendant purchased five gallons of gas, tossed him a dollar bill, and hurriedly drove away without waiting for change.Halfway House was first published in Hearst's International Cosmopolitan magazine in June, 1936. It was published in hardback a month later, but a paperback version (Pocket Books) was not available until 1944. Halfway House was the eleventh Ellery Queen story. My copy is a Signet paperback issued in 1971."},{"Title":"Halfway House","review":"This was the first Ellery Queen novel that didn't have a nationality in the title. Despite this, it has much more in common with these earlier stories than the later ones beginning with Calamity Town. In the present book, Queen is still very much in his \\"who done it\\" stage rather than his later \\"why done it\\" stage.But it need make no apology for this. The puzzle the reader is invited to unravel is well up to Queen's (and anyone else's) high standards. Very effective is the trial sequence in the middle of the book.Queen still struggles somewhat with characterization. None are particularly deep. The worst, of course, is Ellery Queen himself. He gives Philo Vance a run for his money as the most annoying detective ever published. Later books would round Queen out considerably making him more human and fallible.The Kindle edition is error free. There is no table of contents, linked or otherwise, but this is no big deal since there are only five chapters which are pre-marked.Highly recommended for fans of the classic mystery where the how and who are be all and end all."},{"Title":"Halfway House","review":"Not the best of Ellery Queen, but close to it. A man married to two very different women is found murdered in the remote shack he used to change his persona. His last words, to his lawyer brother-in-law, are that the killer was a woman. The key to the puzzle, as elicited by Ellery Queen, is - what was the identity of the victim to the murderer. Was he Joseph Kent Gimball - who had married into Park Avenue's multi-millionaire high society set, or was he Joe Wilson - a struggling itinerant peddler of cheap jewellery from Philadelphia - the husband of Lucy ne Angell, sister to Bill, the lawyer, and friend of Ellery Queen?From this tantalising start, the authors weave a classic Queen mystery involving the usual red-herrings, a million dollar insurance policy, a murder trial, and a challenge to the reader. The novel is unusual in many respects. It sacrifices reality to the puzzle much less than previous Queen novels, presenting a very sympathetic portrait of many of the personalities involved. As you might imagine, this is weighted much more heavily towards the poorer end of the spectrum - indeed, the portrayal of the Park Avenue set is at times vicious, and occasionally very funny. The court case and prison sequences are brilliantly done, very empathetic and in more than adequate detail.This was also the first Queen that I managed to solve, including most of the logic. I could never decide if this was because I was getting better at it, or that the puzzle is less fiendish because of the more realistic plotting and emotional content. The romantic element can appear trite and over-sentimental these days - but then, consider what was coming out of Hollywood in the mid '30s! The novel remains a very enjoyable read - and re-read."},{"Title":"Halfway House","review":"Sappy, like most books of this time period.

The history given here is very different from the version I learned in school and in church and from my parents.The information in this book forms much of the basis for many of my basic morals, beliefs and opinions. As a broad history, McNeil necessarily discusses many cultures. The extraordinary diversity of those cultures has given me much to think about, particularly about the effect on each person's beliefs of when in history and into which culture he/she was born, e.g., a person born into the original Assasins culture would probably believe that murder was good while the same person born into most other cultures would probably believe murder to be evil.This book has made me more tolerent of and open to other people's ideas.(Reading this book also helps a lot in Trivial Pursuit :-).)"},{"Title":"The Rise of the West;: A History of the Human Community","review":"The book arrived about three weeks after ordering, and it's on good condition, wrap is nice, thanks!"},{"Title":"The Rise of the West;: A History of the Human Community","review":"McNeill calls American Indians and Africans little more than the victims of the West in this book.

It is an outdated and bigoted way to see cultural history, and difficult to read without cringing.That said, the book contains marvelous elements. Few writers will explain with his brevity and mastery how cultures have passed elements, one to another, over the expanse of time; few writers can convey the forward momentum of history as McNeil.

One of the best aspects of the book is the way it provides insights into how developments in one civilization affected others. The way it shifts views from one major civilization to another and spans thousands of years gives the reader a sense of perspective and a realization of the depth and complexity of history.

The past 500 years has basically been the story of the Western European nations and later America surpassing overall the other historic civilizations of the world in all aspects of culture, society, political organization, science, technology, art, music, etc. Thats not something for some to brag about or feel superior about but neither is it something to bemoan or deny; rather its there to understand the how and the why it happened.The modern world we live in (and personally I dislike much of it) was shaped in the West and whether you like it or not understanding who we are--we being the entire world which is either part of the West, becoming or already is \\"westernized\\", or is feeling the pressure to do so--requires a knowledge of history that is centered on the West. Thats not to deny other civilizations and their contributions to the world their due respect, but there are reasons for keeping a larger focus on the ancient mediteranean civilizations (Greek, Roman and others) and western Europe from the Renaisance onward; its what made the world we live in and should be expected in a book titled \\"the Rise of the West.\\"As far as McNeils book goes its actually far less Eurocentric then you might think from the title, and a central theme of the book is how various cultures have interacted and McNeil does give plenty of attention to Islam, India, and China. Its only in the last half of the book that it gets Eurocentric, and not because it \\"ignores\\" other cultures/civilizations but deals with \\"the rise of the west\\" in those chapters, like any grand narrative history dealing with the past 500 years would. While not perfect it deals with its subject in a readable narrative."},{"Title":"The Rise of the West;: A History of the Human Community","review":"This is an excellent Eurocentric history. McNeill acknowledges his Eurocentrism in his retrospective introduction and provides an excellent critique of his own book: he underplays the significance of Chinese and other civilizations east of the Oxus.Regardless, McNeill expounds a sound theory that civilizations didn't evolve in isolation, but that the interplay of different cultures enabled their progress. McNeill weaves migrations, conquests, international trade, and technological innovations into a riveting story on how modern civilization rose from the fields of the fertile crescent. The book reads like an epic novel -- albeit with lots of footnotes -- in that it weaves over 5,000 years of history into a single story.This has been the most fascinating history book I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Rise of the West;: A History of the Human Community","review":"McNeill belongs to that category of historians who not only bring an enormous treasure chest of knowledge, but who present it in a writing style so direct and compelling that the reader cannot help but admire their work. &quot;The Rise of the West&quot; is a monumental book. McNeill's knowledge of histroy, of facts, his erudition--all leave the reader in a kind of suspense and disbelief. Can one man know this much? Apparently he can. McNeill's vast lore is a proof of commitment to scholarship and historical discovery. Whether or not the West has a special status and a claim to a special place in human civilization (as I believe it does) is something that is for you, the reader, to decide. McNeill makes his arguments and then reasses them years later in this new edition; and he is less upbeat about the special position of the West.

McNeill employs deft understanding and sensitivity equal to the herculean task. The author is no Western apologist, but shows how global civilization is developing into a mosaic largely driven by Western ideas.Beginning just before the dawn of the agrarian transormation and spanning its eventual blossomings (and fadings) into civilization, McNeill takes the reader on a journey that answers questions you never knew you had. The Western way eventually remade the world, and McNeill shows why and how and when. Using evidence from art, archaeology, anthropology, politics, commerce, science, and religion he paints confident, broad strokes that nevertheless are rich in detail. It is a masterpiece of staggering scope, rendered in a noble voice.The only important criticism is an undeniable Eurocentric bias (readily admitted by the author). But this becomes understandable and quite forgiveable as the reader follows the author wrestling enormous epics of civilization into a readable form. Regardless of this necessary perspective Rise of the West can certainly stand as comparable, perhaps even superior to similar works by Spengler, Toynbee, Braudel, or Diamond."},{"Title":"The Rise of the West;: A History of the Human Community","review":"The Rise of the West - McNeillBibliographical EssayAuthor's Note: This is a work in progress that may help you further your work. Please feel free to expand on the ideas and insights that you may find in this work.Bibliographical Essay (Reworked December 7, 2004) by Colin McNaullAbstractMcNeill's version of world history, to me, is one of continual human interaction. Though there are times when the paths have closed, the interchange begins again once the old road or new roads are discovered. At his core, McNeill has a simple message; humans learn by seeing, doing, and adopting. A corollary of this is that those furthest from \\"civilization\\" have a better chance of creating a more effective civilization, not necessarily one with greater morality. They can then pass their newer ideas back to the civilized centers, which helped them create their more effective society in the first place. Resources helped, but being on the edge, helped the West, and to a lesser degree, the Japanese, to become the predominant powers in their areas.One noted historian's review helps to confirm my view of McNeill's work.McNeill does not believe that civilizations have an internal rhythm. He is not a \\"cyclical\\" historian. He is too far sophisticated for that. Essentially he believes in economic organization and in \\"diffusion.\\" \\"The history of civilization,\\" he writes is a history of the expansion of particularly attractive cultural and social patterns through the conversion of barbarians to modes of life they found superior to their own.\\" Yet, of course, there are moments of greater or lesser receptivity; to every pressure there are alternative reactions. If everything is conditioned, nothing is foreordained; (my emphasis) ... the past only offers alternative answers.The Rise of the West; A History of the Human Community by William Hardy McNeill, University of Chicago Press, 1963From \\"In the beginning human history is a great darkness.\\" McNeill grabs his reader immediately to begin the voyage into \`The Rise of the West' to its conclusion:Life in Demosthenes' Athens, in Confucius' China, and Mohammed's Arabia wasviolent, risky, and uncertain; hopes struggled with fears; greatness teetered perilouslyon the brim of disaster. We belong in this high company and should count ourselvesfortunate to live in one of the great ages of the world.McNeill spreads the history of man across the ages in a masterful, extremely well written narrative that should be the basic building block of any serious study of history. McNeill gives you the broad base from which an historian can find his or own particular field of interest. This reader enjoyed the trip, as others will.The \\"effort to construct as single grand narrative of world history seemed self-defeating\\" to many historians. This task of getting from the very beginning of history to 1950 A.D. is one that McNeill accomplishes with aplomb. McNeill outlines his organizing concept as:The writing of history requires organizing concepts. This is true at every scale, from the smallest monograph to the lengthiest history of the world. Organizing concepts are needed to focus attention on the important aspects of a situation. They allow historians to know what to exclude from their history. Without such a principle, intelligibility disappears. So many things happen simultaneously, and at different levels of organization, that efforts at completely recording the past are futile, even if sources allowed it. Instead, selectivity permits intelligibility; and selectivity, to be coherent, requires organizing concepts.World history provides insight and facts that are still with us today but can be submerged when you go to different levels of analysis, especially in non-Western areas. These insights still apply as in Dufar today. \\"A farming folk's enlarged dominion over nature, and liberation from earlier limits upon food supply, meant also an unremitting enslavement to seed, soil, and season.\\"As I began reading the book, I focused on items that were new to me or that gave the West latent advantages for future and faster development. \\"The preoccupation of the earliest Middle Eastern farmers with time measurement (knowing when to plant) may well have imparted a fundamental cast to Western and Moslem minds.\\" is but one of many examples. Another is \\"the democratization of learning implicit in simplified scripts must be counted as one of the major turning points in the history of civilization.\\"\\"The warrior ethos of the Bronze Age gave European society a distinctive and enduring bias. Europeans came to be warlike, valuing individual prowess ... stemming ultimately from the style of life befitting warrior-herdsmen of the western steppes.\\"I found McNeill's explanation for the rise and success of the caste system in India to be both enlightening and informative. The caste system, even if you were at the bottom, with no caste at all, was comforting in giving individuals a sense of place and order.His overview on the rise of the Greeks, Sparta, Athens, and the Peleopnnesean War, should be included as a primer for all who study these subjects. It gives the reader a firm base to deal with the other issues involved in this field of study. \\"The most fundamental peculiarity of European society - the absolute primacy of the territorial state offer all competing principles of social cohesion-had its origin in the Greek polis.\\"It may or may not be credible gender history by today's standards but the illustration showing man's (human) shift from men hunters and women gatherers, women involved in hoe agriculture while the men still hunted, to plow agriculture with the men plowing and the women working in other areas, is an excellent way of reinforcing a well written narrative. It is unfortunate that the black and white photographs just are not clear enough to do full justice to the applicable text.500 B.C. was chosen as an organizational breakpoint because \\"after about that time, the cultural leadership of the Middle East became a thing of the past; the dominance of Europe lay still far in the future; for two thousand years between, the four major civilizations of Eurasia pursued their separate ways, often affected by what transpired beyond their frontier, sometimes borrowing cultural elements from one another, and repeatedly afflicted by nomad attacks.\\"Historiography had an early beginning, \\"As a man of letters, more interested in a good turn of phrase and an effective moral that in the stubborn complexity of human affairs, Xenophon presaged the subsequent degeneration of historical writing into a branch of rhetoric.\\"In China, \\"the work of Ssu-ma Ch'ien combined Herodotus' scope with Thucydides' exactness (in intention if not always in fact); and his example fixed the mold for subsequent Chinese historiography.\\"One of the benefits of the world history approach is that it attempts and delivers on the waves that are driving history that the \\"actors\\" have no or little control over. My own theory on the fall of the Roman Empire in the West and subsequently in the East, is that there was never a system that allowed for the peaceful transfer of power at the time of a ruler's death that resulted in the squandering of limited resources that would have been better used in securing the continuity of the state. (A properly functioning democracy solves this problem.) McNeill points out that \\"Pestilential disease, resulting directly from the closure of the ecumene may therefore be held partially responsible for the radical decay of population which became a persistent problem in Roman imperial times and assumed catastrophic proportions in the third century A.D.\\" This and wars of succession made it impossible to keep the barbarians out of the empire.Another benefit of the world history approach is to reconfirm the importance of the agricultural farmer that provided the food used to sustain the various civilizations and how little their lives changed over time. Except for times when they were directly in the path of the invaders, they kept on doing what they were doing; only the tax collectors changed. Even in those times there was the lure of the cities, which today continues at a still increasing pace.As in India, \\"village life went on much as before, modified only by the growth of royal authority in matters such as taxation and corvee.\\"McNeill's world history approach shows that it is not Eurocentric by showing how much the West used other cultures for its survival and growth. \\"Only after Latin Christendom (ninth century A. D.) adopted the Iranian type of heavy calvary could the civilized or semi-civilized peoples of the Far West halt the barbarian tide and begin a contrary movement of expansion (tenth-eleventh centuries A. D.)\\"Another response to the barbarian invasions was \\"the rise of religion to a central place in personal and public affairs gave a radically new character to the high cultural traditions of both Rome and Persia.\\"The world history approach helps to break down stereotypes as well as helping the Western reader to understand how much of his/her culture comes from other peoples, either directly or indirectly as in the case of feudal society which may be viewed as a human response to certain circumstances where various civilizations developed a system for armed protection from outsiders in return for paying for the armed protection.\\"The Parthians were the first to solve this problem in the \\"feudal\\" manner, which in time became normal in all western Eurasia. The essence of the system linked particular agricultural villages to particular warriors, who thereby acquired sufficient income and leisure to equip and train themselves and perhaps a few followers as heavy armored cavalry, ready at a moment's notice for local self-defense and able, when an effective central administration existed, to gather into larger bodies for major operations.\\"McNeill does an excellent job in dealing with religiosity (most humans now, and especially before secularism has become rampant in our day, wanted something deeper for guidance and to give their lives meaning) and the various religions that have arisen during the course of human history and how they still are affecting our history today.\\"Individuals and communities either accepted Islam or rejected it in toto. There was no halfway house, no liberty to pick and choose elements from the Islamic tradition and adapt them to local cultural styles. The reason, clearly, was the central and absolutely basic place which organized religion occupied, not only in Islamic civilization, but also in the civilizations of Islam's principal neighbors, Christendom and Hindustan.\\"One of the particular things about McNeill is the way he proposes and suggests his ideas. He is not absolute in his suggestion that there are patterns of history such as the way various religious doctrines spread around the ecumene. He observed that a newly emerging state, when it had the chance, chose a different religion from the neighbor whose civilization they were emulating, \\"thereby asserting their independence of the adjacent civilized communities and yet gaining the advantages of civilized religion, i.e., literacy and principles of political legitimacy that supplemented and went far beyond tribal practice.\\"One thing about a good world historian is that he gives credit where credit is due as shown by McNeill in his accurate praise and acknowledgement of Mohammed and Islam.Never before or since has a prophet won success so quickly; nor has the work of a single man (my emphasis) so rapidly and radically transformed the course of world history. Through his inspired utterances, his personal example, and the organizational framework he established for Islam, Mohammed laid the basis for a distinctive new style of life, which within the space of two centuries attracted the allegiance of a major fraction of the human race and today commands the loyalty of about one-seventh of mankind.People often tritely say, \\"Wars never solve anything\\" which is simply not true. If the Moslems had taken Constantinople between 673 and 680 or in 717-18, European Christendom would not have \\"survived as a geographically and culturally significant rival to Islam.\\"McNeill advances an idea on which it would be good to have a Marxian review, that the success of Western European traders was due to the transformation of piratical trade to regular, even if aggressive, trading and trading practices that gave the West an edge over the other ecumenes of the time. \\"When it was no longer safe to seize valuables by main force, trade offered an alternative way of getting possession of foreign goods formerly acquired by piracy.\\"Another of McNeill's maxims is that the further you get from the centers of Eurasian civilization, the better chance you have of adopting what you want and then to use it to your advantage. This is why he is always talking about the far reaches of Western Europe (France and England) and often, Japan in the Far East. \\"Only in the Far West of Eurasia, where Latin Christendom had not yet established a fixed and hallowed pattern of life, were the men malleable enough psychologically to incorporate techniques derived from distant China with the more massive borrowings from their Moslem and Byzantine neighbors and make the amalgam fundamental to their expanding civilization.\\" The sternpost rudder on their ships helped as well.My narrative of the book now starts to highlight both the things that made the West more successful (in addition to its natural resources) than the rest of the world while addressing the questions as to why the Islamic Civilization lost ground to the West. McNeill quite often uses Bernard Lewis as a source. I did not notice any reference to Edward Said. I find it interesting that McNeill gives a much more cogent explanation of why Islam did not maintain its momentum when compared to Lewis's latest book on this subject.\\"Moslem thought froze into a fixed mold just at the time when intellectual curiosity was awakening in western Europe-the twelfth and thirteenth centuries A. D. The rote memorization and congregational recitation of authoritative texts which prevailed in Moslem institutions of higher learning, the madrasas, presented a remarkable contrast of the intellectual tumult of the universities of western Europe. ... merely fastened the dead hand of authority more securely on Moslem minds.\\" \\"It is clear that just at the time when western Europe was beginning its greatest adventure, Islam found itself imprisoned in twin mausoleums-the official structure of the sacred law with its ancillary disciplines and the para-official Sufi tradition. The Islamic world thus missed out on the stress and benefits of the Renaissance and the Reformation. It would be the same for the Industrial Revolution and the Democratic Revolution as well.The \\"concessions\\" that were to lay the seeds for the Ottoman collapse were actually laid long before they took Constantinople.In exchange for Venetian naval help against the invading Normans, the Byzantine emperors in 1802 granted Venetian merchants far-reaching commercial privileges, including exemptions from tolls.As the world entered the 16th century, McNeill sees Western Europe having two unique characteristics:1. from the eleventh century onward, western Europeans entered upon the inheritance of the classical, Moslem, and Byzantine worlds relatively uninhibited by their own past. (my emphasis).2. popular participation in economic, cultural, and political life was far greater in western Europe than in the other civilizations of the world.McNeill himself realizes that from 1500 on, it becomes more challenging to continue with the format of the first two sections of the book. \\"Nevertheless, an attempt must be made to treat European and world history with the same broad brush employed hitherto in this book, if the artistic proportions of the entire essay are not to be lost. ... Compensation for the inherent awkwardness of such a scheme may perhaps be found in the manner in which it emphasizes the central dynamic of modern history.\\"I could not find McNeill's singular \\"central dynamic\\". I have found six in this section of the book. The first three deal with the western Europeans exploring the world and the resulting consequences. Success in this area was due to \\"(1) a deep-rooted pugnacity and recklessness operating by means of (2) a complex military technology, most notably in naval matters; and (3) a population inured to a variety of diseases which had long been endemic throughout the Old World ecumene.\\" The others were the Industrial and Democratic Revolutions and the Globalization that is now upon us.It is also important to mention that western Europe had larger supplies for the metal needed in shipbuilding and ship defense. Cultural differences, if not flattering, also helped the western Europeans.Europe was more often the receiver than the giver, for its people were inspired by a lively curiosity, insatiable greed, and a reckless spirit of adventure that contrasted sharply with the smug conservatism of Chinese, Moslem, and Hindu cultural leaders.\\"The growingly intricate market economy of Europe, supported by cheap water carriage of bulk commodities, constituted a potent lever for raising European power and wealth far above the levels attained elsewhere.\\"\\"It was the failure of Europeans to agree upon the truths of religion, within as well as across state boundaries, that opened the door to secularism and modern science.\\" People were free to think and do in ways not possible in other parts of the ecumene.\\"The period of 1700-1850 is ... a middle stage in the rise of the West, when Europeans began to dominate the bodies, but had not yet made much impression upon the minds, of most of the inhabitants of the globe.\\" \\"This expanded Europe became the center of a vast political-economic power system, engulfing most of the Moslem and Hindu worlds and lapping round the edges of the Far Eastern citadel itself. Europe, in short, became the West.\\"World history can be amazingly succinct, accurate, and trammel upon national sensibilities, all at the same time as McNeill shows in his description of how the United States of America gained its independence.After many vicissitudes, the revolutionary cause triumphed in 1783, more because of bitterly divided counsels in the British government and the intervention of the French (who declared war on Great Britain in 1778) than because of the victories won by George Washington's tattered armies.Thus the American Revolution achieved its fruition within the nexus of European power politics and war, while the American revolutionary leaders justified their actions by drawing upon the stock of radical political ideas which had recently become current in Europe. The same radical ideas, tempered by experience, inspired the men who drew up the Constitution of the United States.Americans had taken European ideas and showed the way in how the Old Regime of Europe could be challenged by having \\"wiped the slate clean of outmoded institutions in order to construct a rational system of government.\\"The challenge of writing world history becomes increasingly clear as your narrative approaches the time that you are writing in. It is like a novel that has been going on and now needs to be finished, and it is difficult to get to the end. In trying to meet all his goals, McNeill does an excellent job and really lets the reader sift through the final years of history, at the readers own pace and interest level. In this way, WWI, WWII, and the aftermath of both wars are blended into Cosmopolitan whole, with the hope that the two remaining superpowers will find a way to accommodate their mutual desires.The cosmopolitanism of the future will surely bear a Western imprint. At least in its initial stages, any world state will be an empire of the West. This would be the case even if non-Westerners should happen to hold the supreme controls of world-wide political-military authority, for they could only do so by utilizing such originally Western traits as industrialism, science, and the public palliation of power through advocacy of one or other of the democratic political faiths. Hence \\"The Rise of the West\\" may serve as a shorthand description of the upshot of the history of the human community to date.I find it interesting that McNeill's positivism overcame the potential for nuclear annihilation. His positivism is on a human basis, not nationalistic, by believing that the United States and Western Europe do not have to be the winner/leader of the New World ecumene. His positivism is his belief that humanity will continue to evolve so even if the Soviets had \\"won\\", and when he was writing, you could make the case that they might be able to accomplish this, the victory would have been for an evolving Westernized Russia to eventually come to the fore of the total ecumene of man.McNeill's positivism helped to define future problems/opportunities in a way that also foretold the \\"End of History\\". Trevor-Roper pointed out some other alternatives to McNeill's exuberance and optimism as he brought his book to a close.Perhaps we can now expect the stabilization of the world; but if so, let us not be too complacent. It is the \\"drastic instability\\" which, throughout history that has distinguished the West from other the other great civilizations of the world, and made it supreme. (The West of the Mind, my interpretation) If the West now stabilizes its victory, as ... Han China stabilized theirs, may not humanity lose its dynamic quality? ... It is ironical that the new advocates of instability should be the hitherto \\"immobile\\" Chinese; but perhaps their present \\"instability\\" has a meaning which historians, thanks to Mr. McNeill, can now better understand.McNeill might say that the current China, no longer \\"Red China\\", is or will soon become part of the West.McNeill's 1963 comments and observations concerning the Islamic world were prescient and are still applicable today. Islam is still awaiting its needed version of the Renaissance and Reformation and its continuing instability may yet generate a synthesis with the West/Modernity that is productive for both Islam and humanity.World history also differs from other forms of history, at least in the way that McNeill writes it, in that it is basically amoral. There are no \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" guys in the normal sense as when the writer winds up favoring one side/idea or another, and then casts aspersions towards those who are on the \\"wrong\\" side which is often the case when history is written about shorter time spans or from a political agenda. McNeill views warfare the way you come to accept that there are predator and prey animals in the natural world and this is the way it is. He also sees it as a force for change and innovation as he states below:Chronic warfare arising from persistent political multiplicity has long been one of the painful, but powerful mainsprings of the West's vitality.At the end of his book, where McNeill moves from history to philosophy, his hope is that a new, global, one-world ecumene will eliminate war and that the lion will indeed lie down with the lamb.Other thoughts on World History and McNeill's place in this fieldIn all the reading that I have done so far, the only attempt at world history that I am not in sympathy with is the UNESCO \`History of Mankind'. By nature, I question \\"feel good\\" projects and \\"political correctness\\" in all forms, as well as blatant attempts at indoctrination. At a more erudite level, \\"Some UNESCO critics complained of mistakes in Gottschalk's analysis, others complained that his work lacked analysis altogether ... To avoid comparing cultures ... Gottschalk avoided interpreting history.\\" One thing learned from the UNESCO project was a general \\"advance toward a course that is neither global history in pure form nor western civilization in world dimension.\\"I would agree with Mousnier, world history \\"required such concentration; it required priorities and a system of \\"hierarchies\\" in order to establish the relative importance of peoples and civilizations in time. ... History of all peoples is no history at all.\\" The UNESCO approach ignores Thucydides' triad concerning the causes of war being fear, honor, and interest. \\"Peace education and international understanding could neither explain the causes of war in the past nor remove them from the future.\\" This is what McNeill does so well.McNeill's book, or just one of its sections, could possibly have been used by Foucault to write a history by filling in all of its omissions.\\"World history was at once the oldest history course in the public high schools and the most despised by teachers and students alike.\\" I could not follow the arguments pro and con or why high school teachers should be in conflict with academia. Historians seem to have mammoth egos and very thin skins, not a very collegial atmosphere to produce knowledge and progress.\\"The rise of world history as a movement and as a field of study ... is due to William H. McNeill\\" McNeill's comments concerning \\"the crisis of history teaching ...the reign of specialization; the primacy of empirical research of historical synthesis, the breakdown of the introductory course, the failure to educate youth for public duties of citizenship, and the irrelevance of much of the old Eurocentric subject matter.\\" , in its gaps, speaks of the problems of historian academia.I think that McNeill was too hard on himself in a 25 year retrospective, in saying he could have done a better job, \\"residual Eurocentrism\\" may not be a virtue but it is certainly not a vice, and as it was pointed out in class, after \\"political correctness\\" was discounted, world history from 1500 to the end of World War II, with the exception of the rise of Japan, was a history of the West, and it could be argued that Japan was itself an extension of the West because of its ability to learn and prosper from the West without losing its independence. I also think that McNeill may have been having a bad day after constant criticism from some quarters because of the impact of his book, when he seemed to apologize by saying,\`The Rise of the West' is built upon the notion that the principal factor in promoting historically significant social change is contact with strangers possessing new and unfamiliar skills (i.e., civilizations) tend to upset their neighbors by exposing them to attractive novelties. Less skilled peoples round about are then impelled to make those novelties their own so as to attain for themselves the wealth, power, truth, and beauty that civilized skills confer on their possessors.\\"You only have to look at the situation in the Mid-East today to see that his corollary was correct then and is extremely prescient today. If you are able to see McNeill's waves and ripples of history, you may have a chance to have a better outcome when the wave starts to wash up on your shore.Islamic Jihadism is the corollary shown below:Such efforts provoke a painful ambivalence between the drive to imitate and an equally fervent desire to preserve the customs and institutions that distinguish the would-be borrowers from the corruptions and injustices that also inhere to in civilized (possibly Western ethnocentrism) life.McNeill used three periods when he organized his work, namely, from the beginning to 500 B.C., 500 B.C. to 1500 A.D., and 1500 A.D. to the present day. This reflects the way that he thought would work the best for his narrative. McNeill, in my opinion, would not be bothered by other forms of periodization, such as, \\"for the present, an eclectic periodization of four epochs divided at (mankind's history to 1000 B.C.E.), 1000 B.C.E., 400-600 C.E., and circa 1492\\" should be used.The use of B.C., versus B.C.E., reflects what I would call \\"political correctness\\" and or as others would say is a more sensitive way of dating history. This small point is just one of many where people can see both the political and ideological ways in which history is written.As McNeill would say, \\"It is so obvious that the personality and particular experiences of a given historian enter into the sort of history he writes.\\"McNeill's time spent on a farm prepared him to see the intimate nature of farming and the raising of animals that has been the foundation of a large part of our history and how it fitted into his thoughts of history and how it should be written. This \\"helped me as an historian because most of our ancestors lived by flexing human and animal muscles ... slight introduction to what it life was like for most people, most of the time in the deeper past.\\"Historiography is more than just the study of history and how it is developed. Its goal is to give the individual the reference points of others in order to enable a better rationale for his/her, as Collingwood would say, the \\"Idea of History\\". The \\"philosophy of history\\", as Collingwood says \\"is reflective, ... thought about thought.\\"One criticism of the world history approach is \\"that undergraduates ought to study Western rather than world cultures because the study of world cultures would either be unmanageable or be taught in a simplistic fashion and because the \\"ways of the West have become and will continue to be ... the ways of the world.\\" My answer is one that I think McNeill would agree to, that world history should be a required course for all students over two semesters. This course would either expand or confirm the student's knowledge obtained in high school and general education while giving the student the background on where the West stood in relationship to the major civilizations from which the West came and those that influenced its development. Alfred J. Andrea's and James H. Overfield's \`The Human Record: The Sources of Global History' could be used in conjunction with this course. (I found it odd that I could not find a reference to McNeill in this book.)Other historians, such as Alfred Crosby's \\"Ecological Imperialism\\" have followed McNeill's lead by expanding at length and in greater detail ideas and facts contained in McNeill's book(s). \\"The spread of crops, of domesticated animals, and of unwanted pests and infestations is another side of ecological history about which historians are as yet quite ill informed. Yet these clearly impinged on economic and political history in much the same way that epidemic diseases did, by allowing some populations to flourish while penalizing or even destroying others.\\"To some, maybe most, current historians may consider world history to be \\"outside the professional mainstream. To some extent they continued the providential perspective in historiography. They also wanted to contribute to understanding the processes of modernization on a global scale. ... Yet world history now is not what it was for these earlier writers as it undergoes the effects of knowledge explosion.\\" I for one, feel that these historians have done great service to historiography and that they and their ideas are still relevant today. \\"As more non-Western scholars write on these issues (world history in its fullest form), they will bring additional perspectives to world history.\\" I am particularly looking forward to the work of either an Islamic or Chinese scholar, since this is where we might glean knowledge needed for the world today.McNeill, it should be noted, was the first contemporary North American historian to write world history in the light of anthropological, epidemiological, and technological ideas. His \\"The Rise of the West\\" has been judged to be among the 100 best nonfiction books of the twentieth century by the Modern Library. \\"McNeill is also the foremost advocate of world history in the Anglo-American scholarly world. His research reflects the admirable breadth and unique courage of his scholarly interests. In an age of increasing scholarly specialization, McNeill stands out for his marvelous ability to synthesize large bodies of data and to focus his work on questions and issues that cut across national and disciplinary boundaries.\\" McNeill writes so well that his footnotes c"},{"Title":"The Rise of the West;: A History of the Human Community","review":"There are already several good reviews on this book, so, on the vexing question of why Western countries have dominated the world during the last few centuries (the very way the question is posed is controversial!), I would suggest reading the following books in addition to McNeill's: 1) \\"Power and Plenty: Trade, War, and the World Economy in the Second Millennium\\" by Ronald Findlay and Kevin H. O'Rourke; 2)\\"The Great Divergence\\", by Kennetz Pomeranz; 3 - 4): \\"The world economy. A millennial perspective\\" (2001) plus \\"The world economy: Historical Statistics\\" (2003) by Angus Maddison (a combined edition of these two volumes appeared on December 2007); and 5) The Eastern Origins of Western Civilisation by John M. Hobson.And for those looking for a broad framework to understand the past, I would add the following works, whose scope is amazingly global: A. Agrarian cultures: \\"Pre-industrial societies\\" by Patricia Crone; B. Government: \\"The History of Government\\" by S.E. Finer; C. Ideas: \\"Ideas, a History from Fire to Freud\\", by Peter Watson; D. Religion: \\"The Phenomenon of Religion: A Thematic Approach\\" by Moojan Momen; and E. War: \\"War in Human Civilization\\" by Azar Gat."},{"Title":"The Rise of the West;: A History of the Human Community","review":"For those interested in world civilization, \\"The Rise of the West\\" is a concise, enjoyable work written in 1963 that reflects the views and available scholarship of a erudite historian. McNeill's subsequent contemplations 25 years after his original manuscript are worthy in itself; that of a scholar influenced by Post-WW2 optimism of the West, but seeing inadequacies in his work because of such past exposure. McNeill is a thoughtful academic that does examine new evidence and modifies earlier theories to match contemporary findings.In McNeill's own words of 1988, parts of the text are obsolete. Indeed, the original edition is even more outdated for 2005. His overall points regarding the influence of Western civilization in modern affairs still are salient, if not also interesting, notably in the breadth and structure of European expansion.Some of the books topics are sure to run into opposition. McNeill's thesis regarding the Sumerian diffusion of civilization has been thoroughly challenged (though there are still champions of this view). The belief of outside invaders militarily conquering India and especially China for the formation of civilization is certainly far more in dispute today than in McNeill's time. The Aryan Invasion Theory is certainly no longer in vogue. Evidence for the uniqueness of China's Bronze Age is quite strong, and any outside civilizing influences are fairly negligible in Shang bronze development.Histories of civilization do reflect the mindset of that particular generation. While one can leap into judgement that this text is Eurocentric, it does not compare in this regard with other books like James Henry Breasted's (also from the University of Chicago) \\"Ancient Times, A History of the Early World, 1916, second ed. 1935\\".Other deserving books along the same lines are Fernand Braudel, \\"A History of Civilizations\\", Jared Diamond, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\", and Felipe Fernandez-Armesto, \\"Civilizations\\"."},{"Title":"The Rise of the West;: A History of the Human Community","review":"I agree that Wm. McNeill is far more contemporary and balanced than I might have expected for a 1963 book subtitled \\"A History of the Human Community\\". McNeill makes it clear that culture and civilization are not the exclusive attributes of any one people - that promising starts falter, unlikely ideas take hold, cultures borrow from each other, civilizations flourish only to fade, ideas are tried and many fail from nascent democracies to enlightened social views, only to re-emerge in another era.I think the subtitle is a bit unfortunate nowadays; it suggests that the Rise of the West, particularly the last 500 years, is \\"THE Human Community\\" and perhaps non-Westerners might feel their experience is marginalized. Frankly, I think this is a non-issue because McNeill's point-of-view would be that other cultures are clearly a valuable part of the our world culture, history, and civilization BUT outside the scope of his book. I base this on the reading McNeill's work and he's clearly a historian trying to be balanced, unbiased and honest. If the last 500 years of the book do shift into European focus, it's not because McNeill believes that history was always leading to a \\"natural\\" European prominence but because of the accumulation of centuries of cultural fermentation that just happened to sprout and thrive there because of centuries of struggle and hard-work.It might not have been, Mr McNeill would probably agree."},{"Title":"The Rise of the West;: A History of the Human Community","review":"The Rise of the West by W.H. McNeill did more than inform my understanding of history, it largely formed it. The scope, scale, and depth of the work makes it essential reading, ever now after more than forty years since its authorship.It seems to me that McNeill's central thesis is that civilizations don't rise and fall so much as evolve, wax or wane, especially during period of open communication and trade between them. McNeill comprehensively deals with the technology, politics, warfare, culture, and religions of each civilization -- the book is a tour de force of historic exposition.The book is a little dated here and there in the details, and in particular is sparse and dated after WWII, however this is a very minor shortcoming given the hugeness of its span & scope."},{"Title":"Perros (Biblioteca Visual Altea) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Another outstanding book from the Eyewitness Encyclopedia Series.

Not only does it provide a myriad of information about the main safari destinations in Eastern, Central &amp; Southern Africa, but it also has blank pages for journal entries, a safari itinerary, film log, shopping list &amp; addresses. It has a great packing list, metric &amp; temperature conversions, rainfall/temperature charts in various African cities and a southern hemisphere constellation map - all of which I use to gather separately before going on safari. Along with general travel information, it contains basic maps of the main safari countries and national reserves in Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DROC, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Bostwana, Namibia &amp; South Africa.

At camp we entered journal entries. These proved very valuable after our return to organize and present video and photos. This book has almost everything you want to look up. In addition the packing checklists were 100% right on for our experience.If you take only one book on safari, I strongly recommend this one.

Lonely Planet East Africa2. National Audubon Society Field Guide to African Wildlife3. and the African Safari Journal.A fourth book - The Safari Companion: A Guide to Watching African Mammals Including Hoofed Mammals, Carnivores, and Primates - was left at home as we wanted to limit the size of our luggage. I found this book fascinating as it discusses behavior as well as provide basic information about the animals. We just couldn't justify the extra weight.Lonely Planet East Africa is essential in that it gives information not only about safaris, but also about the various countries and cities that we visited. We could not have functioned without this travel guide.The National Audubon Guide was good in that we referred to it during and after the game drives to read about the animals that we found. The paper quality was very nice and the photos were the best out of our small collection.The safari journal was used purely as a journal, that is, we could have probably bought a notepad to do the same job. That's not to say that it isn't useful. It's just that the information contained therein was covered in detail by the other books and we never had a need to refer to the journal. However, if you are traveling ultra-light and you only had room for one safari book, this might be the best solution as it is a rudimentary travel guide, basic animal reference, and journal all in one."},{"Title":"African Safari Journal","review":"I just got back from Africa where I climbed Kilamanjaro and went on a safari.

Most importantly I was able to look up any mammal or bird or tree we saw very quickly and find just the right amount of information.I only wish the bird pages were in color as it was hard to identify birds looking at black and white pictures in the book.But, other than that, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is going on a safari in Africa."},{"Title":"African Safari Journal","review":"I wish I would have discovered this book before my safari.

I could make journal entries, mark the location of our camps on the included maps, record animal sightings, refer to the various language pages and keep track of short airline flights to out of the way dirt airstrips. Even the guides used the animal reference section on occasion.The section Getting Ready...is invaluable and matches the information sent by our tour company. This guide was obviously prepared by a VERY knowledgeable traveler.Several of our travel group have purchased this guide AFTER returning home so they can record the details of travel to this remarkable continent.This guide covers many areas in Africa so that it is appropriate for all safari locations.I would award it more than five stars, if possible."},{"Title":"African Safari Journal","review":"The African Safari Journal by Mark W.

Be sure to fill out as many of the information pages before you leave for your trip. Reading through this journal, I was trying to think of something that was missing from this book. I couldn't think of anything I would like to see added to this book. The author has thought of practically everything.The mammal, bird, reptile, tree, and insect guides have illustrated color pictures and quick descriptions of each species. There are places to check off or list exactly what you saw on your safari plus a more comprehensive checklist near the back of the safari journal. The descriptions are a bit short for my liking, however if they were longer the book may be too big or heavy to take along on a safari.I really liked the trivia tidbits at the bottom of the personal journal pages such as \\"Did you know?

More than a few people think this is Bridgman's best *individual* work, besides his later collected & largely comprehensive Bridgman's Complete Guide to Drawing from Life, which actually *includes* most of these contents within.While I'm not really certain I agree with that, Marvel's legendary John Buscema seems to think highly of it(!). Co-author of How To Draw Comics The Marvel Way with Stan Lee, Buscema lists 2 Bridgman books in its bibliography: Bridgman's Life Drawing, and then that aforementioned collected Complete Guide. My guess is that some people will feel overwhelmed by the Complete Guide, so it's definitely a good idea to steer people towards one of Bridgman's smaller, easier to understand books. Buscema knew what he was talking about! I fully agree with him on that sentiment. Upon collecting all of Bridgman's books though, I initially felt this to be among the least helpful(!). It's taken me *years* to appreciate the simplicity here. Sharing a similar contents structure to the Complete Guide, Bridgman's Life Drawing is his 1st & only book to deal with overall full-figure construction and proportions, on top of the individual parts analysis that many figure drawing books seem to prefer. The first 94 of 169 pages deal with simplified, classical looking full-figures in action. While many people love Bridgman's simplified figures here, I think most will likely find them to be of limited use by today's standards. Beautiful to look at maybe, but better, more detailed books are available. Beginners especially will be put off by the lack of clarity & detail here. The individual parts analysis however, beginning on page 95, can *really* be pretty helpful.Mainly intended as a brief overall study of the figure, it's great for a quick & easy breakdown of Life Drawing in general. People looking for more *in-depth* figure drawing skills may want to check out some of Bridgman's other, more clearly delineated, and highly detailed works. The Book of a Hundred Hands, Constructive Anatomy, and Bridgman's Complete Guide to Drawing from Life are *currently* among my favorites."},{"Title":"Bridgmans Life Drawing","review":"\\"Bridgman's Life Drawing\\"--by George B. BridgmanBeginning books on figure drawing are published every year, almost as though there was, by some insane principle, a national shortage of art instruction. Many of these books have fantastical claims by reviewers, like: \\"MUST BUY\\"...or ....\\"GREATEST BOOK EVER\\"....and similar remarks, many of which are supported by ....maybe two sentences to justify the glowing comments. Some readers will give a book glowing reviews because they have bought the book, without a comparison to other works on the same subject. I've always found it better to study the longer reviews carefully to see if there's something worthwhile to know about the book.There are some books published nearly 50 years ago that are better than any published since. Bridgeman's book I one that was once one of the best in the CLASSICAL TRADITION.Bridgman's book is available as a reprint of an original 1924 edition, so it needs to be noted that the book is \\"dated\\". It is a good book, by 1924 standards, and it is not expensive in it's paperback editions, so if you can afford it, buy it anyway.It is important to compare the illustrations inside with some of the books offered today. Thus we may observe that newer books are not always better, and in fact, today the student must fight through an insane abundance of mediocre drawing books. That is why considering Bridgeman is a good idea.There many good \\"human puppet\\" illustrations in the CLASSICAL TRADITION of block figures and so on, and his illustrations are instructive; but I've looked at older books, and generally, 75 years ago, the publishers were selfish when it came to putting lots of illustrations in the books. Whatever the reason, Bridgeman's book does not contain the abundance of illustrations that one can find in some other drawing books.I'm happy to own my Bridgman, and it's a good asset if you've not looked at drawing books published before the computer era."},{"Title":"Bridgmans Life Drawing","review":"Bridgeman teaches everything that a figure drawing artist needs to know in a clear, concise, logical, inside out progression. He teaches the mechanical workings of the limbs in relation to their counterparts and even details the tendons and striations as never before.

It's illustrations are not the best but it is very informative."},{"Title":"Bridgmans Life Drawing","review":"This was the second drawing book I'd ever bought, after Buscema's \\"How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way\\" -- which is where I first stumbled across Bridgeman's name. Buscema's book, which is fine for beginners, did well to point toward Bridgeman, for further study.Bridgeman's books are a wealth of information on classical drawing, giving the student an understanding of the mechanics of the figure, necessary whether drawing from life, or imagination. Artists of all sorts can apply the principles Bridgeman teaches. Bridgeman doesn't show us pretty drawings, but instead, the underlying anatomy and basic shapes that give a good drawing it's substance and weight.I bought this book back when I was in junior high school and now am considerably older and a published artist. I still find this and other Bridgeman books continuously rewarding of further study.The only drawing books I would rate nearly as high, are those of Andrew Loomis, though personally, I think Bridgeman is better on structure, while Loomis' books cover more of the practicalities of illustration and focus more on surface drawing (though both teacher/authors are miles above others in showing the strong fundamentals of drawing) -- unfortunately very little of Loomis' teachings remain in print -- probably due to some misguided notion that they're \\"dated\\". Bridgeman escapes this by adhering to the classical and timeless.Buy the book, already."},{"Title":"Bridgmans Life Drawing","review":"I require this book for the character animation course I teach.

So when I do get bitten by the creative bug, I find my skills have dramatically declined. I use this book the most to get my brain back into the technical aspects quickly. He has a lot of different ways to think of the human form, plane (my favorite), mechanical equivalent, muscular, and skeletal, all of which quickly get me back to where I was years ago.However, the number of examples is lacking, so I would recommend having a few other sources around.I have other anatomy books, and I never use them, sometimes I try, thinking that I better get my money's worth out of them, and inevitably I go back to Bridgman's work because it concisely tells the artist all the essentials, so that we can quit studying and start creating."},{"Title":"Bridgmans Life Drawing","review":"Their is no way to describe this book its a anatomy book plain and simple.

The only reason I rated Life Drawing at 4 stars is because there's not much variety in terms of body types (including a distinct lack of women figures).

Throw out Beta and your Capital Asset Pricing Model and develop your valuation from a strategic perspective.Does the company (your potential investment) benefit from barriers to entry? If it does, then what is the source of those competitive advantages: proprietary technical advantage, customer captivity and/or economies of scale? Does your company operate in an industry with market share stability, and does it have high returns on capital to confirm a competitive advantage like Coke and Pepsi in the Soft Drink Industry? If more than one company has a competitive advantage then how do they interact within their industry? If a company does not benefit from incumbent competitive advantages, then is management focused and running their business efficiently?My point is not to summarize the book but to show the systematic analytical approach used. The authors go through numerous case studies and examples from the perspective of game theory, local economies of scale, branding, M&A;, cooperation amongst competitors, competitive interactions, entry strategies and incumbent responses. The key is that you learn a process and approach to understand an industry and the interaction of competitors within that industry. Hence, you will expand your ability to grasp whether a potential investment has sustainable competitive advantages. As Mr. Buffett has often said, \\"How deep and wide is the moat around your castle?\\" Don't invest before you can answer that question. If you can't, then walk on by.I recommend reading Michael Porter's books on strategy but I find this book superior in its clarity and focused approach. The book is almost 400 pages long and to absorb what the authors are imparting will take several careful readings. Strategic analysis even if simplified is not easy. It is more of an art than a science, but then why would the rewards be so great if the analysis doesn't take diligent effort?By way of disclosure I have audited Professor Greenwald's-standing room only-- classes at Columbia University though I have never met him. He is a remarkably clear and entertainingly effective lecturer who uses recent business cases and events to illuminate his points. Though I am not a big fan of the typical MBA program which reminds me of the \\"Flat-Earth Society\\" instructing budding geographers-Beta and the other financial theories make no rational sense-Professor Greenwald's teachings have value. Investors can benefit if they learn how to assess the barriers to entry applicable to their companies."},{"Title":"Competition Demystified : A Radically Simplified Approach to Business Strategy","review":"This book is wonderful on the basics of competition and market analysis - especially on the role of barriers to entry. Most of the case analyses are strong. For this discussion alone, I would recommend the book to anyone in business. Some of the prescriptive advice/analysis on cooperating with competitors is puzzling. For example, at points it seems the authors believe that collusive agreements between competitors will not reduce innovation. That is hard to swallow. Everyone knows that without a real competitive incentive, R&D costs can and will be deferred in favor of other expenditures. Why improve the cow today, if you can milk the one you have and use the money to buy a beer? The case history on gas additives is silly. The authors admit that the FTC successfully challenged these people at least twice for illegal conduct. Why would their deals be cited as a model for anything that a law-abiding businessperson might consider doing \\"strategically\\"? It is not clear that the authors have a firm grasp of the antitrust laws (which can prohibit even \\"tacit\\" collusion) or the costs of an antitrust claim - they favor an approach to \\"competition\\" (wacking up markets) that runs very close to the line. Antitrust disclaimers are thrown in from time-to-time, but the legal limits of the suggested types of collusion are never adequately explored. Read this well-written book, but use it with caution (and a lawyer)."},{"Title":"Competition Demystified : A Radically Simplified Approach to Business Strategy","review":"Greenwald lays out what he calls a simplified theory of competitive strategy,\\" followed by analyses of a number of real-life situations. While the theory usually makes sense, Greenwald's application is not always as compelling.\\"Competition Demystified\\" begins by observing that for at least the last half century, strategy has been a major focus of management concern. Sometimes enormous consequences flow from decisions not even thought to be strategic - eg. IBM's outsourcing creation of its PC operating system and CPU manufacturing. Regardless, effective strategy is central to business success.Greenwald says that the first issue is selecting the arena of competition, and the second involves management of external agents. Barriers to entry is the area one should focus on first, and primarily in these analyses. If there are no barriers many strategic concerns can be ignored - the only option is to focus on being as efficient and effective as possible.Greenwald believes that competitive advantages that lead to market dominance are much more likely to be found in a local arena (either geographic or product space). Further, there are only three kinds of genuine competitive advantage: supply (privileged access, proprietary technology protected by patents or experience), demand (eg. psychological or actual costs of switching - includes branding, loyalty programs, laborious setup and coordination issues), and scale economics.An elephant (vs. ants) with a competitive advantage has as its priority to sustain what it has, and must recognize the sources and limits of its competitive advantages. Alternatively, companies with a competitive advantage may have potent competitors (eg. Coke - Pepsi, Boeing - Airbus). In this situation strategy formulation is most intense and demanding. They need to know what those competitors are doing and anticipate reactions to moves the company might make.A common managerial axiom is to avoid commodity businesses - differentiate. However, Greenwald says that this doesn't work - Mercedes and Cadillac are clearly differentiated products, but their high original returns attracted new entrants (Lexus, BMW, Accura) and they now earn only average returns. (Another alternative is for existing competitors - eg. Lincoln - to expand; Lincoln, however was not successful in accomplishing this.) \\"Competitive Demystified\\" also notes that over-capacity, especially in a capital-intensive area - airlines, can create long-term poor profits. (This contradicts Southwest Airlines' success.)Simple products and processes are not fertile ground for proprietary technological advantage. These are hard to patent (looks like \\"common sense\\") and easy to transfer (competitors could hire away employees). Similarly, technological advantages primarily provided by consultants or suppliers cannot be markets with substantial competitive advantages provided by technology.The best strategy for an incumbent with economies of scale is to match the moves of an aggressive competitor - be they price cut, new product, or new frill. Any market share lost to rivals narrows the leader's edge. (Alternatively, competitive advantage based on customer captivity or cost advantages is not affected by market share loss.)Greenwald believes that only a few industries have scale economies that coincide with global size - eg. Microsoft, Intel. Most are local. Meanwhile, growth of a market is generally the enemy of advantages based on scale.Then, we come to application problems. My guess is that if American Airlines, etc. had tried to match Southwest's early fares in Texas (Greenwald's recommendation) they would have been found guilty of predatory practices under anti-trust laws, and severely hurt themselves economically in any case.Greenwald comments negatively at length on Wal-Mart's decision to go national, pointing out that its financial returns fell when it did so, because its competitive advantage was mostly through local saturation, and not squeezing suppliers or superior distribution, etc. However, I cannot help but believe that if Wal-Mart had remained a regional phenomena it would not have the supplier leverage it has (Greenwald's financial review of this topic was overly superficial, at best); regardless, it would have been bought by a larger competitor (eg. K-Mart, Sears) and then probably atrophied in an alien management climate. Further, it probably would not earned sufficient funds to develop its computerized management systems for store replenishment and inventory control.In Wal-Mart's case Greenwald forgot a basic rule of economics - maximum profits are reached by expanding until marginal revenues meet marginal costs. In addition, my understanding of the stock market is that maximum share price is attained through strong, steady profit growth (even if incurred at declining rates).Other analyses within the book can be similarly attacked. My conclusion is that strategic planning is MORE complicated than Greenwald tries to make it out to be. Nonetheless, his book does provide useful background."},{"Title":"Competition Demystified : A Radically Simplified Approach to Business Strategy","review":"Every business student studies Corporate Strategy at one point or another. There are a huge number of books, articles, and prayers associated with this subject. Some classes become so complex that students sink from the weight of detail. Other classes are so superficial that the student walks away with what amounts to one of those tiny Swiss Army Knives with a blade, scissors, nail file, toothpick, and tweezers. Good luck with that!If you are one of those that wants to get a handle on Corporate Strategy in a clear and usable way, this terrific book is for you. Bruce Greenwald teaches a very popular course on the subject at the Columbia Business School and offers this book to business practitioners and students alike. My own view is that he has given us a real gift. It isn't that I reject Porter, in fact I am a huge fan, but this gives us another approach to the subject and its complexities.The book has 18 well organized chapters. If you have had a course on strategy you will recognize the topics and the progression. However, this book handles these topics in such insightful ways that you will find yourself nodding your head and seeing something familiar but for the first time. By that I mean, you will see something you already know with fresh and deeper insight so that it becomes new and more useful to you.I also like the way Greewald (and Judd Kahn) use the examples from the business world. They aren't the typical b-school studies written to teach some key points. Sure, the stories provided here are used to illustrate specific points, but their real world complexities are shown and the ups and downs of the companies (see the story on Compaq, for example) are frankly shown. I enjoy that because too many books use the state of companies near the date of their publication to illustrate good or bad companies and managers. In fact, all companies have their ups and downs. Yes, bad executive management can destroy a company, but a company can have a great CEO and a good strategy and still have something go against them that puts real pressure on the company and its model.The authors also use charts, tables, and graphs very effectively to make their points more clear rather than as eye candy. Too many texts insist on more graphics than necessary to hold the interest of students. For me, those books are cluttered. Here, the graphics add to the information we get from the text.I think this is a book every business person will want on their shelf and will refer to again and again. The stories will stick in your memory and serve as exemplars or cautionary tales (or both).Recommended!Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI"},{"Title":"Competition Demystified : A Radically Simplified Approach to Business Strategy","review":"My two key takeaways from reading Greenwald's well-argued and counterintuitive premise are:1. There are but a few fundamental sources of competitive advantage2. Most companies can tap these sources at a local level (not a national or international level)These show that the front-line manager - the regional coordinator of retail chain or the country manager of service firm - has the power (and the obligation) to pursue local competitive advantages. Greenwald provides a simple, intuitive method for helping such \\"front-line strategists\\" seek out a competitive edge.I recommend this highly for anyone who aspires to be a strategist."},{"Title":"Competition Demystified : A Radically Simplified Approach to Business Strategy","review":"This is a fabulous book on learning about a company's moat. Warren Buffett coined this term, which simply means a competitive advantage. A moat protects the company's revenues from competitors just like a moat protected a castle from invaders. I found this book extremely helpful because it helped me with competition and market analysis. I also read Michael Porter's books and I enjoyed them very much, but this book was simpler to understand.In this book, readers learn how to evaluate if the company has any benefits from barriers to entry and whether the moats come from a proprietary technical advantage, customer captivity or economies of scale.For readers looking for more books on this subject, I also recommend The Little Book That Builds Wealth by Pat Dorsey of Morningstar. In his book, he describes that moats can come from intangible assets, switching costs, network effect, and cost advantages.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market?

So what is followed is already famous examples of competitive wars between famous companies that has taken place. The writers try to prove their theories but in reality, I dont buy it.

It has a simplified aproach to formulating strategy and the importance of barriers to entry."},{"Title":"Competition Demystified : A Radically Simplified Approach to Business Strategy","review":"We all admire Michael Porter for his wisdom regarding strategy. But how do you use his recommendations in real life? Especially if you are an outsider, you need a toolbox that is easier to use and maybe more focused. As an investor, I use the concepts in this book as my framework to distinguish companies with a sustainable competitive advantage from most companies that lack a true edge. But every manager will find Competition Demystified useful as well. \\"Understanding the significance of barriers to entry and how they operate is the key to developing effective strategy\\".One can learn a lot. What are the genuinely important factors that separate good from ordinary businesses? What is needed for a sustainable competitive edge? Is differentiation a value creating strategy? And how do you use corporate strategy in your valuation approach?My favorite chapter is about economies of scale, Big where it counts. Most prefer high market shares, but few understand it's really about local efficiency. The Wal Mart/Coors case exemplifies this perfectly. After reading this, we ought to be more afraid of companies expanding into new markets. RONIC - Return on New Invested Capital - will probably be lower than current ROIC for companies without an edge.Market position is key for long-term profitability, usually together with either proprietary technology or customer captivity. Proprietary technology protected by patents is a strong advantage, but with a deadline. Personally, like Warren Buffett, I am somewhat skeptical to the long-term story when the current excess returns are a function of patents. Will they be as successful during the next product cycle? I feel safer with \\"search, switch and habit costs\\" - my bet is usually that the period with competitive advantage will be longer here. But it is still not easy. This book will help your decision-making in this regard.Bruce Greenwald is Head of Research at FirstEagle Funds and Professor at Columbia, especially well known for his Value Investing Class. Few match his knowledge in Value Investing and Corporate Strategy. FirstEagle has, as long-term value investors, an enviable track record, partly thanks to of the concepts in this book.Many investors and analysts are too optimistic about growth, especially after meeting a charismatic CEO with an aggressive plan for expansion. He will probably achieve growth, but will it be profitable? \\"Without competitive advantages, investments will generally return the cost of capital, meaning they will not add any value for the existing owners.\\" This is a most important lesson.Without being certain the company got some of the sustainable competitive advantages in this book, I never add any value for growth to earnings power value (i.e. to the value of a company's current earnings, properly adjusted).Competition Demystified brings you to a new level of understanding why and when strategy matters.

I will point out three strikes:1. Cost allocation: Since when does fixed allocation part of decision making? In the context of discussing Mercedes and other luxury car makers the author laments how drop in sales resulted in higher cost allocation. They go on to use this example to say why differentiation never pays.2. Focusing on % margin: Instead of focusing on absolute profits the book focus on % margins. For instance they say how in 1985 K-Mart has better % Gross margin than Wal-Mart. But what about the absolute gross margin numbers? Who is the leader 25 years later?3.

The author gives his perspective, largely based on organisational economics (business economics) on a number of US HBS case studies (read Michael Porter's work). He provides actual examples using financial statement analysis. Somebody made the point that this book is about the threat of entry force (in Porter's five force framework). This is not really true. The book is mostly about competitive strategy and covers power of suppliers and buyers, as well as rivalry. Substitutes are not really covered because technological change was not that prevalent in the late 80s/early 90s.The book is based around the case studies, but he does provide an overview of the companies too. However, if you are not already familiar with the case studies, I think the book will be quite tedious to read. So read this book for insightful details, but read another book for the basics. You should also be aware that most of the material is from the late 80s. It is still good, because it has been tried and tested in the author's teaching. Sill, knowing that some people hate old material, you should be aware of this fact.This is a book for a specialised audience only. It is still a pretty good book so three stars."},{"Title":"Competition Demystified : A Radically Simplified Approach to Business Strategy","review":"The book starts on the premise that competitive strategy is a complex subject and that Michael porter did give us a good structure/framework to analyze this phenomenon to succeed in the market place. Then the author is quick to add that among all forces analyzed by porter, \\"barriers to entry\\" is the most significant factor that affects competitive strategy. This is how the author sets the stage to explain \\"Competition Demystified\\"With this quick and firm conclusion on the most significant factor affecting competitive strategy, the book starts off with case after case to justify this hypothesis. To simplify things, it looks at sustained profit margins and continuity of the key players in the given space as a proof for entry barriers. This approach is perhaps to support the second part of the title of the book \\"A Radically Simplified Approach to Business Strategy \\". Granted that the cases discussed do justify the assumptions and are supported by hard facts or published numbers. But if competition lends itself to just a couple of variables, then every company can follow the strategy and hence no competition at all!. In fact one can say \\"The end of competition\\". Kindly recall \\"The end of history...\\"The book however deserves praise for use of Game Theory in a simple non mathematical approach to analyze competitive situations and the behavior of the players. But again, this approach is just a part of the problem and not a full explanation of competitive strategy.Given the speed of globalization and technological changes especially the internet in the last decade, the book fails to incorporate such forces that significantly affect the success of global firms.Too voluminous, and fails to impress on what it sets out to accomplish."},{"Title":"Competition Demystified : A Radically Simplified Approach to Business Strategy","review":"There are so many excellent books already in print which focus on the formulation, implementation, and refinement of business strategy. (Several are identified within this book's Notes section.) That said, I remain convinced that senior-level executives should complete some due diligence on other volumes available by reading the comments on those which are rated highest in the Customer Reviews provided by Amazon. I also think it desirable to consult more than one source (preferably several) which seem most relevant to the specific circumstances within the given organization.In this volume, Greenwald and Kahn succeed remarkably well with clarifying their readers' \\"understanding of strategy and to reframe their approach to it. We want executives to know how their markets work, where there competitive opportunities lie, and how to develop and protect them. To this end, we include both broad discussions of general principles and detailed case studies of actual competitive interactions. Taken together, we think they present a useful guide for people who make strategic decisions.\\"In large organizations, there are entire departments responsible for strategic planning. (Obviously, their efforts are supervised by senior-level executives and usually a board member or two.) In much smaller organizations, strategic planning may be conducted by the owner/CEO alone or by one or two executives. Whatever the situation, strategies are still \\"hammers\\" which drive \\"nails\\" (i.e. tactics) and invariably require both long-term commitments and substantial allocation of resources. Strategies are the cornerstones of plans for achieving and then sustaining success, plans which specifically focus on the actions and responses of competitors. Therefore, in essence, as Greenwald and Kahn correctly observe, \\"strategic thinking is about creating, protecting, and exploiting competitive advantages.\\" That is as true of the family-owned neighborhood store as it is of a Fortune 500 company. The only major differences involve those of scale (e.g. operations and resources). However, I doubt that many owners of neighborhood stores will read this book.I was especially interested in what Greenwald and Kahn have to say about business strategy at work within companies such as Wal-Mart, Coors, the Fox Network, and Kiwi Airlines as well as within others in direct competition: Compaq vs. Apple, Coke vs. Pepsi, and Kodak vs. Polaroid. I was also interested in what they have to say about mergers and acquisitions, venture investing, and brand extensions. In all organizations (regardless of size or nature), it remains imperative for their decision-makers to decide who their organization is...and who it isn't...before launching business development initiatives to become more successful, whatever the given competitive marketplace(s) may be. Greenwald and Kahn's final observation provides an appropriate conclusion to this commentary. In the absence of competitive advantages and barriers to entry, those initiatives have only one strategic imperative: \\"The efficient use of all the resources they require.\\""},{"Title":"Competition Demystified : A Radically Simplified Approach to Business Strategy","review":"Many people talk about buying companies with moats, and really have little idea what the term is. Greenwald clearly defines the term by focusing on companies that posses barriers to entry. Unlike what most people think, product differentiation is not a moat. Greenwald proves it with various examples in the book. The real factors that creat barriers to entry are economies of scale, customer captivity,copyrights and patents, and Government regulation. The best chapter in the book is where Greenwald explains how Walmart overtook Kmart as the leading retailer in America. Purchasing the book for that chapter alone is worth it.Overall, the book really explains what a moat is, discusses some interesting game theory, and gets a bit into valuation aspects.

Worse, he has no mother for his herd of kiddies after all the parade of females through his life, because they had died or possibly run for their sanity when faces with his rambunctious kiddos. Magnus has just been presented with a baby about a year old, told it's his, so he is somewhat of a joke in his Viking settlement. Taking his pride - and 9 of his children - he boards a longship and heads out to find Vineland in the new country.Cut to present day, you meet Angela and her grandmother Rose, trying to save their family Vineyard and Winery. They are all that is left of their family. Angela is divorced, working as a real estate salesman just so she can plough the money into saving Blue Dragon Winery, her grandmother's love. Rose wishes for lot of grandchildren, but see no hope as Angela has divorced \\"the Creep\\" the year before and shows no interest in men. What a grandmother to do?? She make a wish on her rosary for a big strong man and lots of grandchild...asap please.Off on the other side of the country, having found Vineland and left in shame because of the kids antics, Magnus and his brood hit a strange fog that seems to have no end. Suddenly they enter a bright area, so blinding, and find they have landed in Holly and Wood a most strange and adventuresome country.Naturally, Rose's wish has summoned him to where he and the children are very needed, but will Angela wake up and smell the wine??It is so charming and utterly witty, the droll humour is absolutely brilliant.

Please understand that this is not a conventional story. That said, if one can accept time-travel, whimsy and hot (HOT!) sex, then this is a fun read.(Have you heard the one about the medieval Viking warrior whose ship washes up on a Hollywood movie set? Ba dum bum!) By virtue of everything going on in this plot, VVV truly is distinctive.Author Hill writes beautifully, but there is so much doing in THE VERY VIRILE VIKING that it is easy to overlook her skill. Her historic detail seems knowledgable and plausible, though I was surprised to learn that medieval Norsemen spoke Middle English. Still, in reading a novel such as this, a reader either accepts the premise and goes along with the fun, or the reader walks (or runs) away from the book.Sandra Hill displays a keen sense of humor, again easy to overlook in this well-paced tale, as the plot flows along so nicely--dare I say, even so plausibly. It is entertaining to read her displaced character's take on our modern life, on such basic necessities as deodorant and sanitary napkins and \\"dome-noes\\" pizza.
