Like the title (\\"Inside Stories\\") suggested, this book is a collection of personal reflections (stories) written by experienced qualitative researchers.

The readers get to see the \\"personhood\\" of the authors/researchers along the discussion of methodological issues, such as gaining entry, establishing trust with participant, tension due to multiple roles, risks to the researchers and the researched, and power differentials. The weaving together of autobiographical and methodological information makes the research process come alive.

HOWEVER, beware of the edition published by Kessinger. It is apparently an unedited, unproofread and minimally (if at all) formatted direct printout of the open source copy available on Gutenberg.org. (This was verified by comparing the typos in the two versions. They're identical.) It appears that what this outfit does is downloads/copies/cuts-and-pastes the text file, converts it to a proportional font, and prints it as is. Superficially, the result looks respectable enough, until you start to read the thing. First, there's the book's odd format -- 7 1/2 x 9 1/4 inches -- about the size and shape of, say, your child's math workbook. It's awkward to handle and the simple mechanics of reading becomes an unpleasant chore. The text is properly single spaced, however there's a double space between each paragraph. This brings the eye up short and makes your brain involuntarily expect some sort of climax.At the end of each PARAGRAPH, mind you.Imagine a page or two of dialogue.Talk about interrupting......the flow.In short, this is a very annoying publication, made more so by the fact that there's nothing on the Amazon page or the publisher's web site to indicate the nature of this product. It goes a long way toward spoiling what should be the unalloyed pleasure of this terrific classic mystery. Buy a good used copy instead."},{"Title":"Trent's Last Case","review":"This is a wonderful, old-fashioned book, where the language is complex and clever, and honorable people recognize other people of honor at a glance.

Fans of Christie or Chesterton will thoroughly enjoy it. To say more might give something away, so I will not."},{"Title":"Trent's Last Case","review":"Scholars consider it the first modern mystery novel. Agatha Christie called it \\"one of the three best detective stories ever written;\\" G.K. Chesterton went further, calling it \\"the finest detective story of modern times.\\" The ever-erudite Dorothy Sayers flatly stated that every mystery novelist owed something to \\"its liberating and inspiring influence.\\" Today, however, the vast majority of the reading public has never even heard of it.The novel, of course, is E.C. Bentley's TRENT'S LAST CASE. By most accounts, Bentley wrote the book on a dare--much as Agatha Christie would later write THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES. When financier Sigsbee Manderson is found murdered at his country home, a London newspaper dispatches part-time artist, part-time journalist Trent to the scene. Within three days Trent cracks the case... or so he thinks. But is his solution correct? Or will it result in a terrible miscarriage of justice?From a 2005 standpoint, TRENT'S LAST CASE is not a remarkable novel. Published in 1913, it feels overwritten, wordy, more Victorian in style than modern--and while the plot itself is interesting, it hardly compares to the unexpected twists offered by the very writers who so praised it and who were so influenced by it. But the fact remains that it was the first: Poe may have created the detective story and such writers as Doyle, Collins, and Dickens may have wrung romantic changes upon the theme, but it really wasn't until TRENT'S LAST CASE that the mystery novel as we presently think of it was born.Most contemporary readers will likely find Bentley's style tough going, and although extremely influential the triple-twist plot has been done with considerably more drama in later novels. But say what you like, TRENT'S LAST CASE really is \\"the first,\\" and that counts for a lot. Worth reading for the history of it!GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Trent's Last Case","review":"Actually Trent's last case is his first - and his last: E. C.

The importance of 'Trent's Last Case' is that it helped to shape a new paradigm in British detective stories: witty, social acute, conservative (to the point of looking down on 'trade'), and flippant bordering on frivolous.

C. Bentley (July 10, 1875 - March 30, 1956), was a popular English novelist and humorist of the early twentieth century, and the inventor of the clerihew, an irregular form of humorous verse on biographical topics.Born in London, Bentley worked as a journalist on several newspapers, including the Daily Telegraph. His first published collection of poetry, titled Biography for Beginners (1905), popularized the clerihew form; it was followed by two other collections, in 1929 and 1939. His detective novel, Trent's Last Case (1913), was much praised, numbering Dorothy L. Sayers among its admirers, and with its labyrinthine and mystifying plotting can be seen as the first truly modern mystery. The success of the work inspired him, after only 23 years, to write a sequel, Trent's Own Case (1936).All lovers of the genre of mystery will enjoy his work immensely."},{"Title":"Trent's Last Case","review":"Trent makes a lasting impression in this, his first, last and only appearance. Appearing in 1913, \\"Trent's Last Case\\" is among the first classic English country murder mysteries. It's all butlers, country houses, motor-cars and dressing for dinner, sprinkled with wry observations on the manners of the wealthy, country folk, inn keepers, servants upstairs and downstairs, police inspectors, husbands, widows, American secretaries and French maids.We begin with our man Trent arriving in town to investigate a murder. The plot is brisk, without enough clues to make it a whodunit. Trent's an established painter with a national reputation as an amateur detective and newspaper correspondent. An amateur sleuth would be incomplete without a nemesis, so we have a long-time friendly rival, Inspector Murth. The presumption of a long history and the effortlessness of the characters' interactions was drawn beautifully. All is revealed through what the characters say and do, not by long narrative descriptions. I rather wish this was only the beginning for Trent and not the end."},{"Title":"Trent's Last Case","review":"What mystery writer today would use that as a title for their first mystery? It seems like so many titles now are intended to begin multi-book series that the \\"last\\" part seems strange. Why is it his last case? Does the detective die? You start this book with a question already.Trent is an artist who's amazing mind has led him to dabble in solving criminal cases for a newspaper. He's called in to consult on the case of the murder of Sigbee Manderson, an American business tycoon. Trent also happens to know the widow's uncle, Mr. Cupples, who also asks Trent to see what he can discover. Mr. Cupples knows that his niece and her husband had a falling out and knows she will be suspected but he feels his niece is innocent and wants Trent to find the proof.Trent is brilliant, working out what he feels is the solution but also falling in love with the widow! Later, he discovers much of his careful logic to be wrong.I delighted in this short little book.

The chief fault he found with it was that no millionaire would do X to himself just to take vengeance on another person (read Chandler's essay to see what X might be). The only problem with Chandler's statement is that he is wrong! The millionaire did NOT do what Chandler says he did. And yet several \\"standard\\" reference books quote or paraphrase Chandler as if he were right. (Now THAT IS A MYSTERY. Do critics occasionally plagiarize from others without reading the books they comment on? Or do they just have faulty memories? Or are they deliberately playing fast and loose with facts and trusting that nobody can tell the difference? Or what?)TRENT'S LAST CASE is actually a very cleverly plotted mystery novel that has two major twists AFTER Philip Trent believes he has solved the shooting of millionaire Sigsbee Manderson. What this essentially means (SEMI-SPOILER ALERT) is that Trent has been mistaken in his first solution--and that the second solution, which is handed to him by another person (the one that Chandler and others seem to be remembering), is ALSO mistaken. The final twist, which occurs naturally enough in the last few pages, provides the REAL solution (which Chandler and others appear to have forgotten).Anyway, these twists (which neither Trent nor most readers could foresee) are plausible enough when they have been laid out for us, and they provide us with most of the pleasure of the story. The main fault I find with this mystery is that the embedded love story (which does serve a key role in the overall plot) does not seem believable to me. (Other readers may differ, and indeed readers of 1913 might have considered it totally in line with how people felt and acted back then.)If you read and enjoy this novel, the good news is that E. C. Bentley later wrote 13 good short mystery stories about Philip Trent that are prequels to this book. Twelve of them were published in TRENT INTERVENES (1938), and the last one, titled \\"Ministering Angel,\\" appeared in THE STRAND magazine in Nov. 1938 and has been anthologized in at least 3 books that are fairly easy to find."},{"Title":"Trent's Last Case","review":"This quick read was an entertaining glimpse into early last century detective fare. Its plot twists were great."},{"Title":"Trent's Last Case","review":"This is the first of Trent's cases that I have read and I am not sure how many there were previously, but this was an enjoyable read. The characters are developed nicely, the plot flows along at a decent pace, and there are enough twists to keep me guessing. Of course, the solution comes from left field, but was rather interesting based upon the characterization of the deceased. A definite old time mystery without much gore and [sexual content], but interesting nevertheless!

You need to have a very basic understanding of HTML. What this book does is give you a very good over view of both Dreamweaver 4 and Flash 5. It then goes two steps further. It shows how you can use both programs together, easily, and it shows some advance functions of Flash 5.0. If you have both programs, and have a little hands on experience this is the ideal book for you. The two things that ended up being the deciding factor on getting this book was how clearly they show you where things are. This was very important to me, as my wife wanted to learn both programs and would be able to do so easily. Next, I sat down and compared this one book to two other books I was considering buying. (One was an Dreamweaver 4 book and the other a Flash 5 book.)

This was my first time reading Walter Mosley, and I am hooked. I was actually devastated when the story ended and I could no longer commune with its amazing characters.It blows my mind that Fortunate Son received such a critical reception. I can only assume that this is because of people like me who need a happily ever after conclusion, or from the camp of previous Walter Mosley fans who couldn't handle his apparent shift in genre. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the story itself is amazing--real and raw.And the ultimate message is fantastic, right along the lines of popular self-help books these days like The Secret. Who actually is the fortunate son: the rich privileged boy who can't feel love or a poor black boy who can never catch a break, yet remains fully satisfied with life?

So deftly has Mosley woven these threads that the novel becomes a real page turner.

Walter Mosley once again challenges us to rethink what we know about how people relate to one another in this powerful commentary on the flaws in 21st century America. The message is simple: If we truly care for another person, that caring will transcend any surface differences to create a powerful and satisfying emotional intimacy.Complaining about the disconnectedness of modern living has been a favorite theme of novelists for almost 200 years. In Fortunate Son, the title raises a fundamental question about what makes us fortunate . . . our advantages at birth, our appearance, our family or our character? The subtext message is that without being able to love others selflessly we don't amount to much.The story itself is one that will leave you thinking for a long time. One son, Eric, survives while his mother dies in childbirth. Eric's grief stricken father buries himself in his medical work . . . until he notices Branwyn who keeps a daily vigil at the hospital to keep her baby company in a plastic bubble in the PICU. Branwyn has been abandoned by Tommy's father, and the physicians don't know what to do about the hole in Tommy's lung. Life is in suspended animation for the two parents and their sons until Eric's father, Dr. Nolan, invites Branwyn to bring Tommy home to his house where Tommy can have a chance to survive. Tommy does survive, despite many challenges, and Eric and Tommy develop into closer relations than many brothers are. Dr. Nolan keeps proposing marriage to Branwyn, but she declines. Despite coming from different backgrounds as white and black parents, the parents find a completeness in their union in raising the boys that they could not achieve by themselves. The delicate balance of their lives in upset by an unexpected event . . . and the boys find themselves cut off from the care and affection they both need. Eric grows up raised by a nanny and Tommy becomes a street child.Eric's life is perfect to the outside observer. He's handsome, bright, accomplished and powerfully attractive to women. But he cannot connect to anyone . . . and feels adrift as a human idol that others feel irresistibly drawn to. Tommy deeply misses both Branwyn and Eric. But he makes the best of what life hands him. His natural nobility doesn't keep him out of trouble, and life becomes increasingly dangerous and complicated for Tommy.Powerful forces are unleashed that bring the two men together again many years later . . . with explosive consequences. As you reconsider the story, you'll find yourself wondering who was truly the fortunate son."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"This may be the best book I have read in the past decade.

His mother, Branwyn, is a kind, gentle, insightful woman who stays by Tommy's side reading and talking to him and praying for his recovery. She befriends a white doctor (Dr. Nolan) who falls in love with not just her, but her total essence, her entire being - mind, body and especially her spirit.The doctor's influence convinces Branwyn to remove Tommy from the isolation unit so that he can benefit and thrive from her love - thus begins his life. Dr. Nolan invites Branwyn and Tommy into his home and into his life. Branwyn became mother to Dr. Nolan's son, Eric, who was also drastically affected by her calming spirit. Although Branwyn never accepts the doctor's pleas to marry him, Dr. Nolan, Branwyn, Tommy and Eric lived as a family, but faced a great deal of adversity.The sudden death of Branwyn rips the makeshift family apart. Tommy inherits his mother's kind demeanor and gentle spirit and has no idea that her spirit will live on through him and affect everyone he comes in contact with. Although the boys are separated, they live life with their own share of challenges and fate eventually reunites them.Walter Mosley's characters are multi-dimensional and have amazing depth. His ability to make the characters real enough for the reader to take part in the characters' introspection is mind boggling; enough so that the reader does a little soul searching of his/her own. The unfortunate events of the Fortunate Son causes one to ponder the idea of whether or not we suffer for the sins of our \\"fathers\\" and to what degree we must suffer. Not only that, but his words cause one to tackle the idea of destiny, fate and choice. The relationships in this book also make the reader consider the complexity, fragility, and elusiveness of relationships.I thoroughly enjoyed this book! I did find myself affected by the many unfortunate circumstances the characters faced, but felt rewarded by the intrigue of the story itself. This book is a definite must read! Not only is it a must read, it is a fast one. At 313 pages, you will find it hard to put down!Walter Mosley also wrote Devil in a Blue Dress, a book that was made into \\"A Spike Lee Joint\\" in which Denzel Washington played the main character."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"I completely enjoy Mosley's books, and this one is definitely at the top of his. He gets to the heart of his characters, and every time proves that there is a human condition that is beyond races. The \\"guts & soul\\" of a person & their walk in this life makes for the very best of reading. These two brothers are as rich & deep in emotion & heart as you'll find. And what these brothers learn from each other is indeed a great lesson for us all. My sincere thanks to Mr. M for a wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"Fortunate Son: A NovelFor many years I have enjoyed Mosley's mysteries, so when I saw this book I was curious. I had been looking for a book by a contemporary writer for my English classes and this story seemed promising. When I bagan reading I could not put it down. The writing is so good and the characters so interesting and moving. I highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"Deeply engrossing and heart-breaking, while also entertaining. This story touched me on a very spiritual level. With a little more fantasy, this could rival an Octavia Butler novel."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"I think I have read every Walter Mosley book, but this one tookmy breath away.If you are thinking about buying it do it now youwill not regret it!"},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"A moving, emotional and captivating story about family. You know that saying blood is thicker than water, its not true. For a long time I've known that family is what you as an individual define it as, not who you are born to or how you are born. This story is about a family, truth, knowing who you are and that your future and how you live it is all up to you. This story about two brothers, who are not brothers, shares with us the true meaning of brotherhood and what it really means. I haven't been touched by a book in a very long as I've been moved by this, Mr. Mosley's finest piece of literature. Mr. Mosley has penned a narrative that says who ever in this life, you decide to call family, its a very good thing. Take it, keep it and be proud of it. Just read it and you'll understand."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"I absolutely loved this book! I was into it from the beginning. From Thomas' problematic birth to the end of the story. What a life Tommy and his brother lived. I felt like a fly on the wall imagining everything happening. What a tough, but inspiring life Tommy led. His trials were tremendous and yet he overcame them all. Eric's love and need for his brother was unexpected with his fortunate life. This book brought tears to my eyes. I cannot imagine the trials that Tommy experienced. What astounds me is that there are many Tommy's in \\"real life\\". I really look at homeless people differently now because of this book. I could go on, but I'll end by saying: \\"You owe it to yourself to read this book\\"."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"\\"His heart was as disconnected as hers,\\" expresses it all. \\"Fortunate Son,\\" is a story of the disconnected. Brothers by fate, Thomas Beerman and Eric Nolan are two beings in contrast. For everything Eric is, Thomas is not. There stands Eric in all of his glory taking things in stride. While early on, Tommy's life takes a harsh turn, as he is ripped from the bosom of his loving adopted family and it seems that he is alone in a world bent on bringing about his demise.With each page that I turned, my heart grew heavier with worry and sorrow. What was to become of Tommy? He was an innocent and life was so unfair. Was a break just beyond the next page? Faring better in the world, Eric does not realize how good he has it and through the years there is always something missing, a void, he is incomplete and reaches for Tommy, the brother from his past, only Tommy cannot be there.Reading \\"Fortunate Son\\" is like studying the brush strokes that comprise a powerful painting. Each word is stated with purpose and takes on a message of power and deliverance. Based on his or her perception, experiences and mindset, each reader will take away something different. This is a sorrow-filled read of substance. Walking with Tommy through his trials and tribulations forces one to pause and appreciate what is within reach. We remember that each day we rise is a glorious one and with inner strength, we can overcome and make it to the next if we dare to press on.Marian E.APOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"I think it is one of his best yet. It took me day and a half to read. It told you how a young male child was able to make in this crazy world. You ask your self could I, have done all the things that Tommy, did and make it. Read it for your self you will have tears in your eyes."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"Mosely is an inventive, creative writer in the best sense of the word: he creates unique, new worlds in his books. Here he has made something of a fable, what feels like an other-worldly tale of two \\"brothers\\"- the dark and the light. Thomas: the intuitive one, the nearly saintly, passive one. He accepts, surrenders to life's most horrible twists of fate. Stolen,abandoned, beaten, imprisoned, raped - he cannot hold a grudge. He is \\"brilliant\\"- literally - there is a light around him. I associated him with the archetypal artist, the true artist, for whom everything - the good, the bad and the ugly - is grist for his mill. He's also something of a saint, in the tradition of Dostoevsky's Mishka - \\"The Idiot.\\" Seemingly simple and guileless, everyone who is around him for any length of time is influenced by his goodness - everyone falls in love with him and never forgets him. That includes his high-octave white \\"brother\\" Eric, his exact opposite. Eric seems blessed from the start unlike Thomas, who had a hole in his heart at birth. Rich, gorgeous, a sexual dynamo, athlete - people fall at his feet; a god, \\"lucky.\\" As the book progresses, however, it becomes apparent that Thomas is the lucky one, because he has a beautiful soul that allows him to understand life on a far deeper level than the \\"golden boy\\" Eric. I found the novel a bit too grim for my taste in parts, and then too magical for me in others. But still - I could not put it away - and when it was over, I missed Thomas especially. \\"Fortunate Son\\"is a great contribution tocontemporary literature."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"Walter Mosley is a master storyteller. This tale of true brotherhood held me captive until the last word. Never have I experienced such an emotional rollercoaster. I found myself praying for all the Tommy's who walk our streets, often invisible to those of us that are priviledged. This was my first Mosley read, now I have to go back to read everything he wrote before this. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"Rebeccasreads highly recommends FORTUNATE SON: A NOVEL as a riveting, raw story of modern-day resilience & redemption. It will stretch your mind about racism, privilege, contentment, fate & loyalty.Two boys, born within hours of each other from different families, are raised, for the first years of their lives, together. Eric is white, handsome, takes his privileged life for granted & is cursed with a vile attitude. Tommy is black, unwell, good natured & feels lucky for every day of his life.When tragedy strikes their makeshift family, the boys must separate. Years later, they get back together & face down an enemy that will test their different natures."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"Note: there are no plot giveaways in this review as it is the first reader review and I don't want to spoil your discovery.I just read The Wave and was tremendously disappointed in it as a novel (might have fared better as a short story.) The heart of my problem with it was not the new-agey stuff, nor the lack of a satisfying plot, but a certain sketchiness to the characters, a shallow, generic feeling, unlike what I got from many of his other books.So I was cheered by Fortunate Son whose characters reached out to me with all their flesh-and-bloodiness. Not just the central ones, but others too, especially the cast-off few who join Lucky in his secret garden. I am just coming down from reading this book and have still to ponder its ultimate meaning, but I felt that an underlying theme the editorial reviews did not pick up on is the stark depiction of the world the brothers live in -- intolerably unjust and empty and ruled by tyrants. There are moral imperatives for those who live in this world. This is both a charming and disturbing book and, with its vibrant characters, sense of place, and pivotal action might make a cinematic gem if brought to the silver screen."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"There's wondeful, compelling writing in Walter Mosley's latest--but ultimately, I can't help but believe that if a lesser name had written it, the reviews would have been significantly less enthusiastic. The exposition is often impossible to follow, with characters introduced later in the book given elaborate backstories. The rhythm of the book is often a bit off. It feels like a great early draft of a book that really needs an editor to help sharpen it, thin out what doesn't work, and push the author into greatness--because there's a great book in here waiting for some rewriting in order to escape.For greatness, turn to Mosely's Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"Upper middle-class widowed white doctor falls in love with Black single parent woman. Their two kids and Vietnamese housekeeper briefly have a wonderfully melded family. Then mom dies, and the absent father insists on custody. Tommy (a/k/a \\"Lucky\\") quickly begins a descent into the hell of urban Los Angeles. Abusive father, drug addicted mother, drops out of school, gets a \\"job\\" as a runner for the local drug dealer, gets molested by a customer, who he kills (accidently), witnesses the suicide of his friend from the streets, hooks up with a teen mom, and is able to support the \\"family\\" through his drug \\"job.\\" However, Tommy is wounded in a shootout between the police and his drug dealing boss, and ends up in court, charged with felony murder. Sent to juvenile prison, he is raped and abused repeatedly by older, more violent boys--until he is transferred to a minimum security facility after a year--from which he promptly escapes. He spends most of the rest of the book wandering the streets of Los Angeles, homeless, broke, and illiterate.In the meantime, his white \\"brother\\" zooms to the top of the academic pile, gets the girl, and generally prospers...but is terribly unhappy, and deathly afraid that each of his triumphs has come at someone else's expense.They meet again, as Tommy intervenes in a shooting--Eric's girlfriend's ex-lover kills her, and tries to kill their kid--who is saved by Tommy.In the end, Tommy saves Eric's self-image--and his life--by sacrificing himself, only to live. We are left with the moral quandary of who was the fortunate son after all, what does it mean to be fortunate, and is there really such a thing as \\"luck\\" when life is so pre-ordained anyway.Tommy is a fascinating character--never meant to be realistic, but so real as to keep you engaged all the way through, turning page after page to see what comes next, and how is Mosley going to pull off bringing everyone back together again. The ending is contrived--but so is the whole book. It must be read as a fable or parable, not a realistic novel. Albeit, a fable built around a fabulously drawn character."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"Although Eric and Thomas shared no blood ties, they considered themselves brothers in the truest sense. The two \\"brothers\\" were as different as night and day---literally. Thomas is black and as a result of being born with a hole in his lung, he spends his entire life fighting off illness and injury. He is fairly average, observant, finds pleasure in the simple things in life, loves whole-heartedly, and basically lives his life on the periphery. Eric, on the other hand, is white and does everything in extremes, in fact, it is believed he was such a big baby, his mother died in childbirth. He is strong, smart, handsome, and successful at anything he touches. He is an instant people-magnet but deep down, he fears he is cursed with such an overwhelming inner-strength that it hurts, even kills, those he loves most.The lives of the two boys initially intersect when Eric's father, a physician, meets Thomas' mother while she is visiting him in the hospital he called home for the first several months of his life. Despite their racial differences, and the stigma associated with interracial relationships at the time, the two quickly fall in love and eventually move in together and create a family. Everything goes well in this idyllic family until tragedy strikes, and as a result, Thomas must leave the family he knows and forge a new life with his biological father. At this point, Thomas and Eric's lives take dramatically different paths, as Thomas suffers through abuse, poverty and struggles to survive, Eric thrives and lives a life of privelege. An uncanny turn of events eventually reunite the brothers, and each of them must come to terms with their pasts and recognize the blessings and curses associated with leading a charmed life.Walter Mosley has written a poignant, thought-provoking tale that is an interesting examination of life, luck, and love. Through complex plotting and in-depth characterizations he points out that even blessings sometimes come at a cost. While it may initially seem easy to assume which son is the fortunate one, deeper reflection will cause readers to second guess and even re-examine some of their basic assumptions about life. Can your environment change who you are really meant to be? Is being the best at everything worth it if you have to lose everything dear to you in the process? What is the meaning of family and unconditional love? FORTUNATE SON subtly addresses these universal questions while relating a deeply personal and moving account which demands introspection on the part of the reader.Reviewed by Stacey Seayof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"I have read Walter Mosley's books from the start, even before president Clinton named him as his favorite author.

You won't be let down.Wonderful"},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"i've read most of mosley as he's simply a fine writer. what i didn't expect to be so very blunt & powerful are his sexual scenes in this new novel. they move the storyline , but they also have a carnal knowledge which i have not witneesed in his other works. this is a compelling read. powerfully fine."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"I loved the complexity of the book.

It is a book where you have to be willing to live with the people and care about them and I loved that.I choose this book after reading Potlomey Grey (which is another awesome book by Mosley)and I was not disappointed. Two books in a row by the same author and being able to love reading both of them is a rarity these days. I am glad to see that among so much riff raff and chaff that Mosley continues to deliver solid works."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"Have never read a Walter Mosley book before, purchased at the suggestion of my daughter. WOW! I could not put this book down. Had my mom get the audio version as she cannot read any longer. Looking forward to reading more of Mr. Mosley's superb style and splash of diverse characters."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"This one is a bit of a departure for the acclaimed mystery writer, delving into mysteries of the human spirit as opposed to criminal acts and gangsters. The premise of the story may be odd, if not far-fetched, but Mosley manages to weave those absurdities into a spellbinding story that will hook you. There are some amazing, if not inspirational, characters in this novel, one of Mosley's strongest and most moving ones to date. If you thought he was just a mystery writer, think again. There is real depth here."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"I could not wait to finish this book. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next.

AND MOST OF ALL IT'S QUITE BELIEVABLE AND BRILLIANTLY WRITTEN. JUST WHEN I THINK I'VE ENJOYED HIS BEST, MR. MOSELY SURPRISES ME AGAIN. I'M HOOKED."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"And it mostly works. As everyone else has already said, this is not your typical Walter Mosely novel. His Easy Rawlins detective stuff is terrific. He has at least one knock-off called Fearless Jones, which is not so great. Fortunate Son has nothing to do with these. It takes place more or less in the present and follows the lives of two boys of very different character and abilities: Tommy, black, and Eric, white. They live as brothers for their first six years and come to love and depend on each other, but become separated in tragic circumstances. You desperately want them to get back together again and you are not disappointed. The beginning of the book is wonderful, the middle mostly sustains the momentum but tends toward the episodic, the ending is more than a bit melodramatic. We are introduced to a Bad Guy, the only cardboardy character in the book. \\"Will Eric and Tommy survive his malovelent machinations?\\" Well, you'll see."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"I am sorry but I thought this book was terrible. I am a fan of Walter Mosley and have read all of his other books. Easy Rawlins, Mouse, Fearless and the rest of his characters are beautifully drawn, gritty and funny. His portraits of the underside of L.A. in the 50's and 60's are always masterful. On the basis of that experience, I picked up this book and stayed with it to the end. In my opinion, it is awful and Mr. Mosley's first real failure. As Ambrose Bierce said about a book \\"the covers were too far apart.\\" The plot, if you can call it that, is patently ridiculous as are the characterizations. Could this be the same author who wrote the wonderful \\"Devil in a Blue Dress\\"?Finally, there is the issue of racial stereotyping. I hate to bring it up but Mosely always does in his books, so why not? Mr. Mosely displays a racial animus against whites in all of his novels and I don't begrudge it to him. I don't agree with him but it is his right to have this world view and readers can always vote with their pocketbooks. This time however, he goes too far with his racial animus and it infects the book. True, the underlying story is one of devoted filial love between and a black boy and his white \\"brother.\\" But every white character in the book is depicted as a heartless, empty vessel while every black is depicted as loving, generous and kind.This last aspect of the book disappointed me and definitely affected my opinion. But, in my view, even if all the characters had been white or black or green, the book would still be awful. There is nothing believable about it and the characters are absurd. I'm really not sure why Mr. Mosely chose to tell a tale like this one. With all respect, he isn't suited for it."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"Walter Mosley is one of my favorite writers. I have enjoyed a lot of his novels, this one no different.This book was full of emotions and was a little hard to get through at times. I'm glad I did though, it was well worth it.Walter Mosley has a very raw writing style that really sets him apart from other writers. He doesn't hold back, and brings things out in his characters, that other writers could only hope to achieve.Enjoy this book, just be ready for an emotional experience.Happy reading."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"First ever Amazon review here, written to spare people the thoroughly unsatisfying experience of trying to finish this unbelievably bad novel. Despite the glowing praise which persuaded me to purchase the book, it's poorly written, completely flat and one-dimensional, alternately sickly sweet and falsely gritty. It gets one star for a well-written public relations campaign that claims \\"a modern-day parable\\" -- driving the eye-ball-rolling reader to persist to the end in a desperate (and unfulfilled) need to know why this book was ever allowed to be published in the first place. Some editor failed to do his/her job!!"},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"Awful, dreadful book. Characters are one dimensional and stereotyped. The plot is simplistic and formulaic. My first review on Amazon because, like the other reader who gave this book one star, I wanted to spare anyone the agony of reading this novel. After a summer spent reading really fine works like Water for Elephants, Eat Love Pray, A History of Love, The Road and more, this novel leaves me scratching my head and wondering where are the emperor's clothes?"},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"It's a terrific story - much more interesting and poignant than many of his others. The characters come-off as multi-dimensional and the story is both tough and rewarding without being sappy.

One gets his message indirectly and thus the reader is not being preached-at.I cannot strongly recommend this book enough!"},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"I did not understand the ending of this book at all. After suffering through 300 plus pages hoping it would have its big finish and message at the end I cannot begin to say how disappointing this was. Also there were a lot of gratuitous sex scenes in this novel that actually took away from the story in some instances in my opinion. I am glad that I have read other Walter Mosely books and know that he is a talented writer; otherwise, I would never again waste my time on another book by this author."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"This is the story of two close brothers, one white (Eric), one black (Thomas), separated when about 6 and reunited at about 20. The two have vastly different lives during their separation. Yet, which one is the \\"fortunate son\\" is a moot point. Further details would not really be spoilers, but would be irrevalent and misleading. The specific plot, per se, does not matter. Like a magnificent painting, the story changes as you view it from different angles, and the longer you dwell on it. Ultimately, it is a story about fate. In this case, the hand of fate is very heavy.Superficially, some of the events are a tad implausible and some characters larger than life---but this is a vivid uplifting grand allegory of great depth, power, and complexity. As such, \\"suspension of disbelief\\" isn't an issue.What is the allegory about? After considerable reflection, I've concluded that the underlying theme is the Black experience in America. Okay, as a typical White guy, I would not find that description appealing. Don't be put off by that description/conclusion. The underlying theme is at most extremely subtle, not \\"in your face\\", nor antagonistic toward Whites. However, the eyes of a Black author may be more attuned to the question of fate. All of us are minorities of one, each struggling with our own fate---the lessons of the book are universal.Okay, I suppose that I'm suppose to complain about something to demonstrate my \\"sophistication\\". The only thing that bothered me is the temporal disconnect after the brothers are separated. Chapters in which Thomas is 5 are followed by Eric at 14, back to Thomas at 6, to Eric at 15. The discontinuities were a bit jarring.This is a story which will stay with me for a long time. I look forward to re-reading it at long, but regular, intervals. This is one to buy in hardcover."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"I have read all of Mosley's books. This one is by far the best.

If Fortunate Son is any indication of Mr. Mosley's abilities as an author, then he is a great one. This book had me crying, laughing and at one point even wishing that poor Thomas would just go on and die. That poor, poor boy. I know it is fiction, but this book could be as real as the drive I make everyday. This life holds no promises and being able to deal with what it dishes out can be a testament to anyone's character, and what character Thomas had. Wonderful, wonderful book."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"I wonder how many children out there are fortunate.How many can live with respectable,loving relatives care for them as their own? Even though, this story/novel was fictitious but, reality makes you think -awake you to see how blessful you are.This was a nice storytelling how unfortunate child can be so fortunate to have love there just have to continue reach for it."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"This novel tells the story of Thomas \`Lucky' Beerman and Eric Nolan. Thomas is the son of Branwyn, a single mother who works in a flower shop, and Eric is the son of Minas, a recently widowed doctor. Although the boys come from completely different socio-economic and racial backgrounds, a brotherly bond is formed and follows them throughout their lives.I have really enjoyed reading this novel. Mosley's use of descriptive language captured and held my attention. His writing is like watching a program on a spilt screen; showing the lives of the bonded brothers in closely related vignettes. This was an excellent literary device to show the contrast between the lives of Thomas and Eric.The most interesting thing about the character development is how Thomas never allowed his surroundings and circumstances to make him bitter or angry; he pressed on, in spite of, with a smile. I wish I could have Thomas' attitude in all aspects of my life. Although some of the themes and language are a bit adult, I believe this would be a great book for young people in their late teens. It definitely shows what can happen when you're not willing to give up on your vision."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"Walter Mosley has done it again !!! Not only has he captured my attention with his Easy Rollins mysteries, but this book is phenominal. He paints a vivid picture of a non-convential family and the love that transends many years. There were points in the story that I actually got angry, and there were parts that had me thinking about my own life. I don't want to give away the story, but believe me you'll be (as with all of his writings) sucked into the story until the end. Thank you again Mr Mosley,"},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"I love Walter Mosley. I think he's a gifted and brilliant writer. But for those coming to him for the first time, this wouldn't be the book I'd recommend.I remember reading early publisher reviews of this book and couldn't wait to get my hands on it. This modern day fable takes two boys: a charmed perfect blonde Adonis, and his African American 'brother' whose luck runs from bad to worse. Yet together their karma creates a perfect Ying and Yang that harmonizes both their lives. It's beautifully written, with Mosley writing the kind of searing and insightful passages I'm sure many writers can only aspire to. That said,for some reason I was left cold by the end, which is ironic because everything leading up to it said I should've been completely invested. If you've never read him before, I'd suggest cracking open the first Easy Rawlings mystery, 'Devil In A Blue Dress' which in my mind redefines the mystery genre."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"This is my first experience reading Walter Moseley. I am glad that the first book I chose by him is Excellent. It is well written and the story flows well.

I would have liked to see the roles of life switched in this book, because many of the things that happened to the black son, is very typical, however, the author can only write about what he knows."},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"From birth, Thomas Beerman was special. A week later, so was Eric Tanner Nolan.Thomas was born with a birth defect, but was destined to live. Living in a hospital for over four months as a baby, he still saw the beauty in everything. To him, Branwyn Beerman was sunshine. To her, she was one fortunate lady. Although left to raise her child alone, she welcomed this opportunity and never gave a second thought to Thomas dying; instead, she diligently stayed by his side while he lay in his cocoon.Dr. Minas Nolan was a lonely, widowed heart surgeon. Having a 12-pound, 12-ounce baby boy to care for by himself was not an easy task. Losing his wife during childbirth was hard enough, but it seemed as if this \\"wonder\\" child sucked the life out of everything and everybody around him, demanding something from Minas that he just could not give.The one thing in common for both parents --- their loneliness. They never expected to actually fall in love. Although time waits for no one, it seemingly stood still for these two lovers; one black and one white in a world that wasn't supposed to embrace them, didn't embrace them. Minas loved Branwyn desperately, but she would never marry him --- not while Thomas's father was still alive and had the ability to make her heart race. The years quickly passed, and as the boys turned six, their lives were forever changed.Although Thomas and Eric grew up as brothers, Eric's family didn't accept Thomas or his mother. But Minas and Eric loved them both dearly. For Eric, Branwyn was the only mother he knew; the only one who could calm him down, cheer him up and tame him. Her sweet, gentle, no non-sense affection gave Eric the love that he so desperately craved.Unfortunately, life is cruel. Eric became sick, and a few days later so did Branwyn. He made it; she didn't. From that moment on, Thomas's life was turned upside down, as his real father came to retrieve him. Thomas was taken into an unhealthy environment, which resulted in him being thrown into jail, becoming homeless and virtually living on the streets. Tough and resilient, he knew he would make it through and one day vowed to find his family again.Eric, on the other hand, had everything a young boy could imagine. Everyone succumbed to his commanding presence, but didn't realize that they, too, sucked the very life from him. The only thing lacking in his life was his mother and brother, which affected him deeply. One of his main problems was the notion that he hurt everyone who loved him and he couldn't understand why.As Eric and Thomas progress through time, years pass and situations change, but one thing remains constant: their love for one another. Walter Mosley does an excellent job of capturing the lives of two young men whose existences are entwined, no matter the time or distance. With true-to-life characters, Mosley paints pictures of stereotypes, true love, devotion and the ability to one day find exactly what you're looking for.--- Reviewed by Belinda Williams"},{"Title":"Fortunate Son: A Novel","review":"I enjoyed the first half of this book very much, but by the time I got to the end 100 pages I was very very bored. It dragged on to me once he grew up and became what he did, the ending didnt suit me because I felt like I needded more.Plus I felt it had this strong side towards all african american's being this poor race, with poor chances (the father, his girlfriend,Monique,the thug street boys, on and on and on) and then the white folk all being depicted as these white tennis playing rich folk with everything going for them. It had a very sterotypical sort of edge to it, all the way down to the nanny from koreaThe \\"brothers' was a nice tie and how it didnt matter who was what, they were brothers. Other then that I felt this troublesome matter on what black and white see each other as, when we should be what the brothers see each other as.One family, one people, nothing lessI feel like I missed a lot, ans also like thomas couldnt really fit in one or the other he was just kinda this special being who got caught up in the wrong thing, and with bad luck."},{"Title":"Fag Hag (Plume Fiction)","review":"OK - It's my turn!! Here I was stuck for a month in some ridiculous backwater business assignment so I took a chance and bought all the Rodi books to keep me company. The GayMuse of Entertainment was watching over me! This guy is literate, amusing, profound, and definitely has the ear of his audience. I could go on and on about all his books: comparing &amp; contrasting &amp; up-thumbing and down-thumbing... but the bottom line is that this man WRITES with a wit and wisdom that is oh! so rare in Gay Fiction today. Now do a little 'search' here at amazon.com on 'rodi' and pluck up anything that pops up. I guarantee you that you will be pleased... if not just a little bit moved!"},{"Title":"Fag Hag (Plume Fiction)","review":"Robert Rodi has been compared to Armistead Maupin (author of &quot;Tales of the City&quot;) and the comparison sure is apt with &quot;Fag Hag.&quot; Like Maupin, Rodi has an eye for detail, which he uses to skewer and satire the good and bad of contemporary urban gay life. And Rodi (like Maupin) also has compassion for even his unsavory characters. In this book, Natalie (think Natalie on &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; for a rough mental image) is the classic &quot;fag hag&quot; in love with her best pal: a gay man, Peter, who will never be able to return her secret desire. A manipulative woman on a Bette Davis/Joan Crawford scale, Natalie resorts to more and more desparate measures to snare her man, or at least keep him for herself. But her work becomes more challenging when Peter falls in love with Lloyd, a libertaarian intellectual &quot;survivalist.&quot; One of the funniest scenes in the book occurs when Lloyd turns his rational, Socratic conversational approach on a bitter, wisecracking queeny gay man, who has no idea how to respond.... I was a little disappointed by the ending, but otherwise this is an enjoyable, funny read. Gay male readers (and the women who love them) will get the most out of this book, but most anyone with a sense of humor should be able to appreciate the (decidely politically incorrect) satire here."},{"Title":"Fag Hag (Plume Fiction)","review":"I enjoyed this book, but I found myself frustrated with Natalie and her blind descent into madness. But then, maybe that's the point -- we are often the last to realize we've gone over the edge. Even so, Natalie's actions seemed too much over the top, even for a genre in which over the top is the norm. Still, it is well-written and funny, and I'd probably read other books by Rodi."},{"Title":"Fag Hag (Plume Fiction)","review":"I read this book years ago. Just when I was starting to get tired of the overly P.C. humorless writings that the gay community was being subjected to. This book was a godsend both then and now. It could be a Psychological essay on the type of girls who become fixated on gay men used in classes at Ivy League schools if it wasn't so damn funny.Natalie loves Peter, She loves hanging out with him, going to clubs, watching movies, and she knows if she can keep breaking up his relationships by subtle sabotage he will one day realize that all of those men can't make him happy, only she can. Read on while she slips farther and farther from reality, especially when Peter meets perhaps the &quot;one&quot;.

This one isn't as good as Closet Case but still entertaining. Natalie is the title character, a fat girl in love with the perfect Peter, who can't seem to keep a boyfriend. She's happy living her life with him, until he meets a right-wing libertarian....Like most of his books, the main characters who are straight are less than admirable, while the gay ones have only a few flaws. But don't let that turn you off - this book is still an amazingly funny work.

Imagine a tinge of Fatal Attraction, only without the precursory affair between the two leads. It was almost frightening to read, since you can imagine people in the real-world who are just like Natalie. Not a good book to give a potential stalker! :-) Definitely worth the read!"},{"Title":"Fag Hag (Plume Fiction)","review":"\\"Fag Hag\\" starts as a comedy and then slowly gets darker and darker - an innocent reader may miss the early signs that something is in the air.It is a story of not-too-beautiful girl Natalie who fell for her gay friend Peter and at least superficially decided to let her laugh turn into friendship. Yet deep inside she is still in love and will do anything to stay with the man she loves.We may laugh at Natalie when she successfully chases away potential candidates for her gay friend's significant other. Rodi very skillfully thickens the atmosphere, what seemed innocent at the beginning will come back to grow to completely unexpected dimensions. Fortunately, the tragic dimension never develops into a real tragedy, when Natalie decides that there are no holds barred in her attempts at keeping Peter forever by her side against his will, she will be stopped on time.Rodi combines his comic literary skills with psychological depth of analysis achieving almost eerily true picture of a friendship between a gay man and a straight woman gone terribly wrong. Fag Hag is simply a must read for gay men and their straight female friends because it delineates in detail all the dangers of such relationships. You will be laughing at the characters antics but don't forget to give a moment of thought to how similar their behaviour may be to yours and where you are heading if in a similar situation."},{"Title":"Fag Hag (Plume Fiction)","review":"It's melodramatic- a perfect beach book.

That very act alone and the stereotypes are insulting. Or perhaps thsi is how White people think ALL people who are Black would be? I doubt it but thats the first major flaw.The second is the lack of depth Peter shows to Natalie. i fthey were totally together and he was a shave dumber you could understand all of her manipulations working. But him having some smarts makes everything seem like a set-up for her insanity which is ultimately contrived and silly. She suddenly gets money when she needs to bug his place, her kidnapping and imprisonment of Peter and Lloyd's militia rescue...all a bit trite.Lets not even touch the wilding Latino gang that she gives a freebie to in order to maintain the gay one's machismo in the gang. It's sickening. All the races are stereotypes and disgusting while Peter and Lloyd could fly with angel wings if teh book oepned too fast.Also the concept that there is no play from the inner workings of their relationship. Using Natalie as the ploy ultimately wear sthin because everything is from her eprspective, which is warped and some things that need to be explained become inexplicable.The whole pity over certain kinds of women clutching to gay men is attacking and pathetic too because it never supposes genuine relationships of human beings, just gay to straight, lose rto winner, man to woman. This book is misogynistic is truth as all of the women are settlers or fools, even Natalie's boss who has a gay husband, or downtrodden Black girls with thug boyfriends.The problem with gay literature is that it has only so many veins because the writer pushes the whole gay thing. Satire/lark, coming out story, fetish clique insights or lurid drama with gay sex. Even the sex scene in this book is incomprehensible. Why write about people, including gay people, if they're just going to be caricatures.The one star saving grace of this whole book is Lloyd's realistic arguments, his thoughts. Though not necessarily agreeable to all, it shows some depth. Unfortunately so much work went into Lloyd and Natalie as polarities that they stretch to the point of unrealistic."},{"Title":"A Discourse of Matters Pertaining to Religion: The Collected Works of Theodore Parker Part One","review":"These are apparently a serious of lectures Parker did in Boston in the 1840's. His writing is articulate and definitely shows evidence of how erudite he was in matters of religion. I appreciated the annotations, since he provides additional sources for those who want to read up on subjects he touches on.I initially thought that these writings on religion would be a bit dated considering they were written by a Unitarian minister from over 150 years ago - but I was surprised by how timeless his words have become. Any religious student would find this book a great addition to their library because he speaks about fundamentals from the prespective of a religious liberal. Those who don't know about Parker will find in this book a clear thinker who challenges the meanings of religion and church that were, and still are, warped by those who believe they have a monopoly on God. It's difficult to read this book and not be inspired by the words of an intellectual powerhouse that still haunts the halls of Harvard Divinity School.Anyone interested in reading more about Parker and the Transcendentalists might read Dean Grodzin's book \\"American Heretic\\" - which can be a bit turgid, but gives a thorough account of Parker and his friends. Commager's biography is lighter fare and equally interesting. It would be a shame if Parker's words and dreams were lost, and this book helps to preserve them both."},{"Title":"Ten Thousand Lovers : A Novel","review":"\\"Ten Thousand Lovers\\" is a haunting, lyrical love story.

Weird and interesting things that happen in another country keep the story going."},{"Title":"Ten Thousand Lovers : A Novel","review":"I didn't like this book. The story is not about love, but about politics. There are two people in love discussing Israeli-Palestinian conflict all the time. How romantic is that? The characters are very strange and unrealistic. The prison interrogator, who doesn't believe in his country's politics, is unbelibible. Can you imagine Stalin's camp interrogators who are really anti-communists?There are only two things that the author apparently likes about Israel: the Hebrew language and the landscapes. She is trying to portray prisoners, who Ami interrogates, as innocent kids who are there for no reason, which is a very one-sided view of the situation.I was really upset about one character... Lily's roommate who came from Russia and is more worried about how her family will take Israel's politics then their struggle in Russia. I emigrated from Russia many years ago and I can tell you that immigrants like me do appreciate the freedom and democracy in Israel and America.

It is told in a simplistic and breezy style vascillating between the 70's, the era of her story, and her current time in England.She inculcates the reader in the confusion of the time, as a liberal trying to deal with a lover who is an interrogator of Palestinian prisoners. Her lover is also conflicted, but there lacks depth in his motivations for his job. However, as the story between the two lovers unfolds, less emphasis is played on his job and more on the relationship of the two lovers.The conclusion is moving and stayed with me."},{"Title":"Ten Thousand Lovers : A Novel","review":"BASICS:I really loved this book and read it in a day.Ten Thousand Loversprovides everything an excellent novel should: laughter, insight, accessible characters with depth and life, beautiful language, and finally a window into another world. Ami and Lily are wonderful and you fall in love with them as they fall in love with each other. After finishing the novel I just sat for awhile and the feeling of fragile life and tragic beauty thatTen Thousand Loversgave me stayed throughout the evening; it seemed almost wrong to return to everyday life.THE WRITING:Ravel did a wonderful job of intertwining Ami and Lily's love story with Hebrew and Arabic etymology and I think it greatly enhanced and deepened the story. Her writing is both poetic (\\"'... people are too emotional. There are seven hundred Greek tragedies taking place inside everyone. And another three hundred stories by Kafka.'\\") and starkly honest (\\"'People are very simple in some ways. We want simple things. Food, shelter, love, respect, fun. A flag. An apology. A sense of accomplishment.'\\"). Through Ravel's writing, Israel itself becomes a living and breathing character and Ravel describes it with such beauty and an aching sense of nostalgia and sorrow.ThoughTen Thousand Loversdeals with very heavy subjects - love, nationality and identity, tragic loss and suffering, all set amid the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - she approaches these issues and her characters with both humor (\\"Before we sat down to eat Bracha turned on the television for the news. 'Let's see whether we still exist,' she said. Israelis never tired of saying that before they tuned in to the news.\\") and tremendous insight (\\"'People aren't good or bad. They just do good and bad things. Your only hope is to know which is which.'\\").SUMMARY:(from the back cover)\\"Israel, 1970s. Lily, a young emigrant student exploring the wonders and terrors of her new land, finds the man of her dreams - Ami, a former actor. Handsome, intelligent, and exciting, but like his beautiful, disintegrating country, Ami has a terrible flaw - he is an army interrogator. As Ami and Lily's unexpected passion grows, so too does the shadow that hangs over them. They must face the unspeakable horrors of Ami's work and their uncertain future. While set in the \`70s, \\"Ten Thousand Lovers\\" is a brilliant and terrifyingly contemporary tale of passion, suffering, and the transcending power of love.\\"P.S.:The summary above is, in my opinion, slightly misleading, as though there is conflict that arises from Ami's profession and his work, its effect on those around him, and resulting occurrences greatly shape the story, I don't think that the summary gives an accurate impression.RESPONSE TO OTHER REVIEWS:I disagree with those who felt that either the love story was lost amidst the backdrop of the political scene or vice versa. I also don't think that this is political commentary passing itself off as fiction. The complete tragedy of this situation is felt more deeply by the novel's indirect, but steady, approach. I don't think that Ravel necessarily simplifies nor belittles the conflict; rather it is the constant backdrop for the characters lives'.I don't agree with the assertion that Ravel takes a one-sided approach and I do not think that it should be considered so dangerous to point out the mistakes of either side. This novel is coming from an Israeli perspective and viewpoint and is it not always better for change to come from within? People have perpetrated, committed, lost, suffered, and cried on both sides and peace will never be achieved unless introspection, acceptance, and forgiveness occur and a hand is held out."},{"Title":"Ten Thousand Lovers : A Novel","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful novel. The love story itself is beautiful and real. And the political subtext conveys perfectly what the situation in Israel is today. For anyone who cares about Israel, this will make a painful read. For me, it made me all the more determined to strengthen the wonderful people in Israel (the peace activists) who are trying so hard to save Israel (and the Palestinians) from the current nightmare. If you care about Israel, read this book and learn."},{"Title":"Ten Thousand Lovers : A Novel","review":"I wish I could share with you the reasons why I didn't find this to be politically charged; the truth is that I wasn't even thinking of politics when I read this. The story was magnificent and I have never read an ending more powerful. I read this book over one year ago and I still go back just to read the last twenty pages. I feel that I learned about a lifestyle that I know little about, but I did not come away feeling like a political agenda was forced on me. I am writing this review because this is one of my favorite top 5 novels and I don't understand how it got lost in America. I only found this because I was given an advanced reader's copy at my bookstore and it was never officially even carried at the store. It's a shame because this is a beautiful work."},{"Title":"Ten Thousand Lovers : A Novel","review":"Ten Thousand Lovers is an excellent book and I would recommend anyone interested in culture or love or the struggles of life to pick it up. Ravel is able to take the reader to the exact point of her narration and she pours her heart and soul into the pages of her work. The reader is given a better understanding of Israel and a culture that is so foreign to most of us while at the same time we feel as if we are part of the story that is unfolding around us. Ravel was able to make me laugh and cry as I turned the pages of this generous book and I was unable to put it down until I had finished it completely. I have already bought my own copy and am pushing it on all my friends."},{"Title":"Ten Thousand Lovers : A Novel","review":"My counsellor at summer camp started reading this book to some of the fasters on T'isha B'av (a Jewish fast day) while the younger kids were having their meals.

It is! I would have put this book down after the first chapter if not for my interest in the Hebrew language and Ravel's decision to include Hebrew etymology woven into the story. (Granted had it been any other language, I would have REALLY put the book back on the shelf). Ravel's political leanings are clear in this story and really frustrate me because someone with less knowledge of the situation would really get the wrong idea!"},{"Title":"Ten Thousand Lovers : A Novel","review":"Ten Thousand Lovers was recommended to me by a person at Monroe Bookstore in Victoria, B.C. as a good example of recent Canadian fiction. The truth is this first novel is completely based and focused on Israel. The love story is touching. I share the view that the politics are simplistic. Still, they have a ring of truth and as a person who is strongly pro-Israel I felt it was important for me to read this book. I don't think the erratic movement from present to past was particularly effective. At times I felt I was reading a romance novel. That being said, I read it in its entirety in almost one sitting because I found it absorbing. I certainly would recommend it to others. I look forward to reading more of Ravel's fiction in the future."},{"Title":"Ten Thousand Lovers : A Novel","review":"This book was wonderful -- beautifully written, an engrossing read, and a nuanced portrait of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Speaking from the vantage point of living in Israel (for the past 38 years), I thought this book wonderfully captures our reality in the Mideast. It also holds out a place where right meets left among Israeli Jews. What a relief! If you believe that only you own the truth, it may be hard to see the strands of integrity in both positions that are depicted here. Thank you, Edeet Ravel, for writing a beautiful and hopeful portrait of Israel. May your pen be fruitful and multiply."},{"Title":"Ten Thousand Lovers : A Novel","review":"In 1980, Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai noted in a lecture that I attended the responsibility of the writer to help their reader understand the nuance of language. Language, he argued, was being appropriated by pundits and politicians in a manner that was systematically degrading the value of the &quot;word&quot;.Edeet Ravel's first novel, a finalist for the Canadian Governor General's Award for literature is a lovely blend exploring language, love, and the rich contradictions of Israeli society in the late 1970s. While the novel has yet to appear in hebrew (I think), Ten Thousand Lovers is among the very first novels to explore the nuances and growing turmoil of Israeli society in the late 1970s. The novel also takes the reader on several insightful excursions on the meaning of hebrew and arabic words informing the dialogue and backdrop in the narrative.As someone who lived in Israel through much of the period, I found myself swept back to those days from the hitchhiking experiences (which have largely disappeared), to the carefree night life in Tel Aviv (which is still very real), to the confusing conversations over identity between Israelis, Israeli-Arabs, American and Candian Jews, Georgians, Yeminites, and Ethiopians. The politics of of an emerging occupation culture, which everyone who lived through those days fully appreciates, is wonderfully shared through the love relationship between Ami and Lily.In the past year or two a number of novels have explored the messy vitality of Israeli society (both jewish and arab) in the post 60's era. While not as rich and mature as A.B. Yehoshua's The Liberated Bride, or Open Heart, Ravel's first novel, is an amazing read for its female-centered characters, its insights and glimpses into the invisible realities of Israeli life. I hope she has another manuscript in the works. I can't wait to read it."},{"Title":"Ten Thousand Lovers : A Novel","review":"Lily returns to Israel during the 1970's and meets handsome Army interrogator Ami. Although attracted to him, she is never quite at ease with the situations his job demand of him. Lily tells the story of her relationship with Ami while also revealing a bit about her present life in England through chapters which flip-flop through the time difference. In addition, there are significant lessons in Hebrew words which add to the flavor of the book and provide insight into Israeli attitudes. The author even adds one recipe to give the taste of the Mideast!Due to the increasing complexity of political turmoil in Israel and a tendency to be more mainstream, modern Israeli novelists increasingly tend to omit political leanings in their writing. No so Edeet Ravel. She weaves it into the very heart of her story with great eloquence. She expresses her views openly because one cannot live in Israel without revealing those feelings. Beyond that, however, is a more heartbreaking story. It's of how an Israeli woman feels in the company of a man who loves not only her but also his country and has an important duty to both. The end of the story is one of the most powerful that I have read in a novel in a long time, and how the author creates this atmosphere is for the reader to discover."},{"Title":"Ten Thousand Lovers : A Novel","review":"I think it's very good bookI liked Hebrew words meaning/origin explanation tooI don't think I can share political view of the author, though"},{"Title":"Ten Thousand Lovers : A Novel","review":"As a left-leaning supporter of Israel who has long hoped for a peaceful, two-state solution to the Middle East conflict, I found this book deeply disturbing.While the writing is beautiful and intelligent and easily worth five stars, the story is marred, in my opinion, by its simplistic analysis of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. In the world of this novel, peace would be easily achievable if only Israel withdrew from the territories occuppied during the Six Day War, and good Israelis, who are conscious of the plight of the Palestinians, wind up dead, mad or in voluntary exile.The book contains no reference to the fact that in the 70's, when this novel was set, the Palestinian leadership had the stated goal of destroying Israel, not creating a state alongside her.As a literary love story, this novel succeeds brilliantly. As a moral fable, it helps perpetuate the dangerous fiction that Israel could have had an easy peace thirty years ago.And that really is a fairy tale."},{"Title":"Ten Thousand Lovers : A Novel","review":"A young Canadian-Israeli woman student hitchiking in 1970's Israel gets picked up by a handsome, charming Army employee whoseparticular work it is to interrogate Arab prisoners.

As she gets to know him, she points out the differences between American/Canadian interaction and Israelsocial manners and styles, frequently breaking off to parse theHebrew words and phrases and compare their nuanced meanings toequivalent English ones. This may sound dull, but it's not: itis absolutely riveting in helping to respect the roadblocksbetween two different genders, nationalities, and languages asthey move together.

At page 60 I began to skip ahead to the end; and then I placed it back on the shelf. What I read would have made a good essay on modern Hebrew and its co-existence with the Arabic from which it borrows certain terms of abuse and really, to Arab ears, abuses them; and it was a good picture of Israel and the everyday theatre of the absurd that Israelis live in. But passion? Emotion? I found the narrator to be an all too credible representative of the academic who sets out one day to write a novel; her 'passion' is a transference of her political 'feelings' into the personal. Real love, real loss? Tension, drama in the telling? None of that came across to me. Maybe her sheeplike promiscuity blinded me to the possibility that this was just stage-setting to her eventual commitment to a real love with all the risk that real love brings. The sex, as well, was far too close to the page; I could smell it, and it was no more erotic than urination or perspiration. It seemed to me that the writer took no risks; that she chose for a safe and uncommitted vantage point a 'passionate' moral outrage that such a fact of life as interrogation should exist; that she set forth her 'humanist-Marxist' allegiance at the start almost as if she expected this to render her immune from all criticism from lower down the mountain. As I see from the other reviews here, that worked, whether it was a culpably conscious strategy or just the natural consequence of being an academic with a great deal of personal security that tends to dampen thought about what it's really like to sit in a prison cell waiting for the punches. Instead, everything came filtered through chat. People who will read this book probably feel passionately about Israel (where I lived as well). That passion itself, I fear, may substitute for judgement. An essay in a magazine, yes. As a story: with harder work she might have tried to tell a more difficult story from the point of view of someone without the advantages of a citizenship and income that allow her to float up and away from real trouble. But this is only the impression I got from the first sixty pages. At that point, I didn't care if the narrator got blown against a wall in the Old City; and I couldn't believe that a soul this comfortable with herself and her self-deceptions ('Men hurt me; they lied to me; I only sleep with everyone because I'm vulnerable') - I couldn't accept that a character as weak as this would attract a lover of any credible stamp. Ami did seem to be a good character and a good man; which shows the mesmerizing power over a male of beautiful blond crinkly hair on a woman whose own character is way out of line with her surface appearance: fool's-gold-blond. 'I don't even know if I like you', she says repeatedly; this after they've shared bodily fluids many times. For me that disconnect between Ami and the narrator merely left bare the artifice of the story. I could no longer imagine the possibility of genuine emotion leading to some cathartic enlightenment at the end. The interrogator dies? The survivor gets to retail a 'story'. About a beautiful, sad, mad country. Not a country that can be understood by academics. A 'haunting' book? Yes, it is: it strikes real fear in me that readers can be so impressionable that a cover blurb really sticks. It's as if one wants to convince oneself that one can still be moved, touched, brought to the tissue box. At least when Beethoven bragged from behind the curtains that he would bring his audience to tears in five minutes, he hit the right chords."},{"Title":"Ten Thousand Lovers : A Novel","review":"Ten Thousand Lovers has a lot to say about the daily conflicts and commonalities that make up Arab/Israeli life. It was refreshing to see this \\"hot\\" topic approached from such an ordinary perspective, even though Ami our main male character has anything but an \\"ordinary\\" job. We tend to see so much information that is polarized to one view or another, it's easy to forget that most perspectives are likely much more moderate than those we see on the evening news. I liked Ami and Lily; they were earnest, passionate, and quite believable in the immediacy of their love during turbulent times. I enjoyed the linguistic information which is sprinkled throughout the story, and I think this novel would be an excellent selection for a book club, as their is plenty of fodder for discussion; albeit the discussion could become quite intense in a hurry depending on your political beliefs."},{"Title":"Ten Thousand Lovers : A Novel","review":"Set in the seventies, the novel demonstrates the political landscape of the newly formed Israel, through its citizens and their personal and professional lives. They are constantly coping, separating/distancing themselves, waiting for disaster.With the title, Ravel reminds the reader to look beyond the central story. This is the story of one lover, but also ten thousand lovers. It is the story of one couple, but thousands of couples feel this way. In a country that encourages distance for protection, the love of Ami and Lily is bound through intimacy and closeness with each other and with the land.A very good read -- hard to put down.

In discussions i find myself mentioning Pickerings cone of distritution. The cone is both pictograhic and mathematical in explaing how a manuscript is distributed.

Despite pickerings great analysis of the traditional text he has a statistical section that helps us understand how the tradtional text is distributed and created.

First, it is very rare and unique--a must for comic collectors and afficiandos. Second, it is a prime example of Nixon propaganda. Third, but most important, it was illustrated by the great Geo Wildman!Wildman, a lifelong resident of Connecticut, studied advertising at what is now the Paire College of Art. During the 1950s, he was a successful commercial artist, first working for an ad agency, and then becoming a freelance artist. During this time, he began producing freelance comic book art for Charlton Press in Derby, Connecticut.When King Comics ceased publication of their POPEYE title, Charlton acquired the rights. Longtime writer-artist Bud Sagendorf was busy with the daily and Sunday newspaper comics, and declined the job of continuing. George Wildman was offered a contract to produce the POPEYE illustrations, with prolific Joe Gill writing scripts. The first Charlton issue of POPEYE appears in 1969, the final one in 1977. Wildman was hired as assistant editor to Sal Gentile, and in 1971 was promoted to managing editor, and eventually executive editor. Assistant editor Nicola Cuti wrote several of the later POPEYE scripts for Charlton.Wildman's tenure as editor continued through 1985, while Western Publishing picked up POPEYE under their Gold Key and/or Whitman trademarks. Bill Pearson, by then assistant editor at Charlton, began writing scripts, and Wildman produced illustrations while off-duty from Charlton. Their crowning achievement was the epic 50th anniversary special published in 1979.Thanks to the Robert Altman POPEYE movie, a demand for Popeye-related merchandise led to Wildman's working for Random House, illustrating a classic \\"Pop-Up Book\\" which became a best-seller and later a display at the Smithsonian Institution. Wildman was also invited to produce a painted wooden Easter egg for the White House Easter event, his egg also now housed in the Smithsonian. Around this time, the National Cartoonists Society awarded him \\"Best Cartoonist, Humor Division.\\"Western Publishing ceased its comics line in the early 1980s, and Wildman retired from Charlton Comics in 1985, moving into a freelance comic book and children's book illustration career. His pencils, inks and paints graced publications featuring Disney, Hanna-Barbara, Harvey and Warner Brothers characters along with countless designs for various businesses.In 1994, George and wife Trudy Wildman were honored in a gala festival in Chester, Illinois, celebrating the 100th birthday of the creator of Popeye, Elzie Crisler Segar. Wildman received the Popeye Fan Club's Lifetime Achievement Award and performed a sketching show to a standing-room-only crowd. A return visit to Chester in 2004, to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Popeye, found Wildman teamed with Hy Eisman, the writer-artist of the Sunday POPEYE newspaper strip since 1994.Today, Wildman and son Karl operate their own advertising agency, producing computer animation, greeting cards, and a wide variety of products. Wildman's work is seen regularly in the \\"Hidden Pictures\\" publications of HIGHLIGHTS FOR CHILDREN. He celebrated his 80th birthday in 2007 and continues to receive mail from Popeye fans around the world."},{"Title":"Musclebound: The limits of U.S. power.(US cannot always succeed in foreign relations): An article from: Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists","review":"Stephen Walt points out that the United States has enormous influence in the world. Plenty of people in science and business use English. Even our culture and free market democracy are popular elsewhere.But Walt boasts that such power does not guarantee that the United States can achieve its foreign policy objectives. Here, I think he's overlooking something. I think if we want to do something arbitrary, counterproductive, and of transient impact at best, we may be forced to abandon our plans. If we merely wish to support truth, justice, human rights, reality, or even peace, we may well succeed in the long run.Iraq was governed by a rather arbitrary and counterproductive dictatorship. We did indeed intervene there, and there is no reason to suspect that in the long run, decades from now, Saddam Hussein will be brought back to re-install that government. So let's not kid ourselves: what we do matters, and if we fight for sanity against arbitrary opponents, we are likely to accomplish something.Walt, however, asks why the United States does not simply get its way all the time. And he attributes this to several reasons. First, sometimes other nations \\"care more about certain issues\\" than we do. And they are willing to oppose us even if it is costly to do so. Obviously, that is true. But I think that's not always enough. Germany in the 1940s cared very much about fighting Slavs, Jews, and Gypsies. And it did so, and it paid a price for it. But did it accomplish anything positive by doing so? No. Politically, the United States was correct on these issues, and in the long run, America got its way on them even though in the short run, Germany did what it pleased.A second point Walt makes is that there is a natural alliance of the rest of the world against the most powerful state. But once again, I think it would be unwise for even the whole world to do something totally counterproductive just for fun. Only when the United States is trying to get away with doing something unfair does it make sense for such an alliance to try to stop us.Walt discusses several areas in which the United States may have trouble getting its way for a third reason: we're working against ourselves. We want to slow the spread of nuclear weapons, but that is tough in a world in which several nations already have a big arsenal (I think it might be even tougher if we had no arsenal, but that's not the point). We want to expand NATO and also improve relations with Russia and China. Once again, these goals may be at cross purposes. We want \\"power-sharing\\" in Bosnia and peace there, even though these goals seem difficult to meet simultaneously. We want to support Israel against the threat from the Arab states, but we're unwilling to demand that the United Nations, the European Union, or the Arab states abide Jewish rights in the region. Oops, Walt didn't say that! Instead he said that we \\"want to hasten a peace settlement, which requires putting pressure on Israel.\\"Is it just a careless error on Walt's part that he feels that the way to achieve peace in the Middle East is to attack the victims of Arab aggression? I don't think so. I think it is part of a systematic misunderstanding of world politics. Sure, any group can be defeated by some tyrants. But in the long run, no tyrant can force everyone to agree that two plus two is 77.9823, not merely because that's absurd and false, but because it is totally arbitrary. Eventually, tyrants will get overthrown, perhaps by other tyrants, and the whole escapade will be over.Does that mean that I think that when the United States is right, it will win? Of course not. Anyone can lose, even when they are both right and powerful. But in the long run, those who keep fighting against truth and reality will have to lose, because there is no long-term gain from defeating truth or rejecting reality. So I think that Walt may have a point about the difficulties America faces, but I also think he should advise us to find ways to succeed in those cases in which we're right and our opponents can't win no matter what we or they do. Instead, I think he's advising us to appease aggressors no matter how counterproductive that may be. And that truly would put us in a position where we'll be unable to get our way."},{"Title":"The Secret of Nimh: Mrs. Brisby and the Magic Stone","review":"This GoldenBook tells the story of the Don Bluth movie The Secrets of NIMH in a very condensed version.

The story was fast-paced and the characters fairly believable. I did feel the inclusion of a Cockney and a Yorkshire woman in one story a bit much, though the dialog was done well. The story followed straight logic and I felt the murderer was a little too easy to guess; however, the reasons given at the denouement were interesting. I don't want to give away details because the book's detailing was very good; however, the mystery which revolved around two murders and a long ago disappearance was neatly dovetailed. Although I guessed the murderer easily enough, I did not twig to one of the most important details until the book's end. Personally, I would have murdered Mabel myself, and thought the Cockney a bit hackneyed; however, the one big error was the English detective's mentioning that a town the size of Taunton was in Devon instead of Somerset. Nevertheless, I did enjoy the dogs and I did enjoy the read, but it was over too fast."},{"Title":"Delilah Doolittle and the motley mutts (Pet Detective Mysteries)","review":"I stumbled across one of the books in this series at a book sale and was immediately hooked!

They'd make a good TV series, in the manner of Murder She Wrote."},{"Title":"Delilah Doolittle and the motley mutts (Pet Detective Mysteries)","review":"British born Delilah Doolittle, long time resident of Surf City, California, is having a slow work period. The pet detective has had only one case on her docket, find a missing dog. When her own canine, a Doberman named Watson becomes lost, Delilah ends up in the WW II bunker located in the nearby wetlands. Sharing the bunker with Delilah is a trapped wild cat. Delilah frees the animal and takes the feline to the vet before visiting Bill Watson, the wetlands biologist to learn if he knows anything about the illegal trap.To her horror, she finds Bill dead in his house and his wife is missing. The police believe his spouse is the most likely suspect. Delilah, who was a close friend to Bill and his spouse, believes that the biologist's murder has to with development of the wetlands. The death of an animal activist follows. This convinces Delilah that the wetlands serve as the common link behind the murders. Though it may lead her into danger, Delilah plans to prove that Bill's wife did not commit murder.Patricia Guiver gives an interesting perspective on an English woman living in the states. However, the canines steal the show with their precious personalities and antics. DELILAH DOOLITTLE AND THE MOTLEY MUTT is a quaint cozy that evolves around a first rate mystery. The blossoming interest on the part of the heroine for the senior detective on the investigation adds plenty of fun. However, the heat of this novel lies in the various reactions of factions, including government, towards coastal development.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Fly On, My Sweet Angel","review":"To those of us who knew &quot;Caroline E.&quot;, Betsy Anderson has been an inspiration.

Sometimes I would play over the games twice but the time is worth it if you want to improve at chess. There are other great books on chess like My System by Nimzovitch or Chess Strategy by Pachman, but both are turgid and boring going compared to this modern classic. It covers the entire sweep of chess history and discusses most middlegame concepts like the minority attack or asymetric pawn structures or development vrs material advantage or the art of defense.

This, as well as the first, are MUST HAVE books for any serious student of the game. Training by a world champion, are you kidding me? Where else can you get lessons from a world champion for such a small price?? Like I said about the first book of this series, the ideas you will learn from this book are the marrow of chess. It will teach you proper chess thinking, thinking that will spill over into the other stages of the game. You will develop a much better understanding of the opening and what you are trying to accomplish, rather than just trying to play back long variations that you've toiled over but only slightly grasp.

Attack, initiative, defense (yes, defense), Nimzo's prohylaxis and blockade, simplification (for attack, defense, combinative liquidation). The games are as always, engaging.

Tom Horn is buried in the old Columbia cemetery there. I have seen the pink granite stone with the simple inscription In Loving Memory Of Tom Horn. Everything I have read about the man never disclosed why Tom was buried in Boulder until I read Dean Krakel's book, The Saga of Tom Horn, A Vindication written by Himself. Tom was born in Missouri, not Texas. He left home after his Dad gave him a severe beating for skipping school and chores to go scouting for varmints. Tom had a natural talent to speak other languages. On his way to the Southwest he learned Spanish and later Apache after he was assigned to live with the Apache at San Carlos and Cibecue to keep an eye and an open ear on the Indians. After the Indian wars he became a Pinkerton detective, a miner, and a cattleman's detective. It was in this last capacity that got him into trouble. Tom had a brother, Charles, who operated a freighting business in Boulder. After Tom was hanged his body was sent to Boulder where Charles received him and was buried in the family's cemetery. This was his only connection to Boulder.I have read microfilmed letters that were sent to Tom by nieces while he waited in jail.The Boulder library has these microfilms,In 1993, Sept.16th and 17th a new trial was ordered for Horn in the Laramie, Wyoming courthouse. Charles O'Neal was the oldest living descendant of Tom Horn at that time and was gratified that the modern day retrial won Horn a posthumous acquittal.However the descendant of Willie Nickel, a niece named Viola Nickell Bixler, then 70 years old stated that she didn't think it was wise or reasonable to change history so many years after the fact. This information was taken from an article written by Kevin McCullen and published in Rocky Mountain News.Another article about Tom Horn and written by William Hafford and published in the May 1996 issue of Arizona Highways is also interesting reading along with a few great photos."},{"Title":"The Saga of Tom Horn: The Story of a Cattlemen's War","review":"I have read more western history than many and while the book is good as far as it goes, it overlooks most of who and what Tom Horn was. He hailed from Texas of German stock and had a very Wild West life - mining, Indian Scout, spoke the Apache language, worked with the legendary Al Sieber and was in on at least one capture of Geronimo. The Apache Chief in whose camp he learned their language called him Talking Boy, his Apache Name (used to describe one's character or most salient trait), and the one that proved his undoing. I believe Tom Horn was a great frontiersman and, like so many, used by the government, discarded without so much as a by-your-leave to either discard all the government had set his life to, or else be brought down. I believe many a Viet Nam Veteran will know whereof I speak on this. What is missing from this book is Horn's early experience, which is nowhere documented properly in print. He, Mickey Free, Al Sieber and a handful of other white and Apache scouts won the Apache Wars. And they were all dropped like hot rocks so soon as the war was over, with lesser men garnering glory and acclaim for what others in fact did. Tom Horn's story, here, shows what happens when a man out-lives his time, when a soldier used to truly vicious conditions plies his trade for his own purpose, and in service of the way of life he thought he was defending. I rate this at 3 stars only because I wanted to more know about Tom Horn from this book, and less about the penny-ante locals. The book's evidence shows pretty clearly, to my mind, that Tom Horn was railroaded to top it all off."},{"Title":"The Saga of Tom Horn: The Story of a Cattlemen's War","review":"The book covers the life of Tom Horn during the cattlemen's war. He was found guilty and hung for the killing of a teenage boy. The evidence was circumstantial. Hopefully today, Tom Horn would be acquitted.The author does great research to reconstruct all the actions that lead to Tom Horn being put to death wrongly. The book is easy to read and understand. You feel as you know the man, the places and the time period."},{"Title":"The Saga of Tom Horn: The Story of a Cattlemen's War","review":"Fifty-some-odd-years-ago, I ran across a small soft-covered book which was published in 1904 by John C. Coble, a Wyoming Cattleman and good friend of Tom Horn. The book is entitled [The] \`Life of Tom Horn: A Vindication,' by Himself. When I bought it, I was well aware of what Horn had supposedly done, of what he had been convicted of doing, and that he wrote this book while in Jail waiting to be hanged. After reading it, I couldn't believe that the man who wrote it could possibly have committed the crime for which he was hanged.Horn's book --- one of the best books on Indian affairs I've ever read --- however, was devoted primarily to his life \`before' coming to Wyoming; whereas this book is devoted entirely to the events leading up to fourteen-year-old Willie Nickell's murder, the crime for which Tom Horn was tried, convicted, and hanged.. A large part of the book is also devoted to the actual transcript of Horn's trial. Tom Horn's book, then, gives us a fairly good impression of what kind of man he actually was; while this book gives us a clear understanding of the evidence on which he was convicted.Now I don't really know what kind of man Tom Horn eventually became, but this book and the evidence presented herein seem to leave some strange questions unanswered. Why, for instance, would Willie Nickell have been so terrified that he immediately began running away if his assailant was 300 yards away, as Horn claimed to have been? (The length of three football fields) Why would Horn claim that he always tried to get as close as he could when shooting a man, and then have not done so in this instance? If Horn had actually run barefoot through 300 yards of rocky terrain, as he said he did, in order to leave a rock under Willie Nickell's' head, why were there no bloody foot prints? And, could he even have such a thing? This author claims that Horn likely mistook Willie for his father since he was wearing his father's hat and slicker (raincoat): If so, why does the testimony at the trial clearly show that he was NOT wearing his father's slicker. And, finally, why would a man who was close-mouthed and so meticulous about not leaving any evidence so casually confess to having killed the boy? Somehow, it doesn't make sense, especially since Horn stated repeatedly that he was sober and knew exactly what he was saying --- and more importantly \`why.' On the other hand, one can only wonder why the Wyoming Cattlemen went to such great lengths to save Horn and to obtain the State's best legal minds to defend him --- strange; very strange; and perhaps telling.My intuition tells me that Horn may have been innocent, but my brain tells me otherwise. Perhaps you should read both books, and see what you think. Of course, it doesn't matter much to Tom Horn at this late date."},{"Title":"Fist Of The North Star: Blood Brothers (Viz Graphic Novel)","review":"(...)

No doubt the efforts of this author to make this most complex of traditions more accessible and intelligible deserves our gratitude. However I would like to particularly point to the artistic quality of the plates. Today in the time of computer graphics and push-button reproduction of images, it is hard to find anyone under the age of 70 who has taken the care to acquire artistic skill and apply it as Robert Beer has done. The plates in this book are all originally composed, not just copied. They are accomplished by drawing with the finest imaginable brush and ink (no computerized improvements here). In other words, we are talking a labor of love which is also a masterpiece. Each plate yields new detail and delight on each viewing. I write this to tempt those who are not devotees of Eastern religion but are lovers of fine art to invest. It will yield hours of pleasure in the seeeing for the rest of your life."},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs","review":"I would like to recommend this book to anyone who is seriously interested in practising Vajrayana Buddhism, as it accurately decribes and illustrates every ritual item.

Alongside the images are very clear and insightful descriptions of the meanings of these profound depth symbols. I found this book over 7 years ago, and continue to read through it,engrossed in absorbing the images and text.Some of the imagery spoke to me quiet directly, and has supported my own artwork on many levels. It has also supported my growth as a spirtualist, quite profoundly.I am always surprised to (occasionally) encounter what can seem to be a sort of condescending attitude towards this authors qualifications....for myself, I assess based on my own internal responses to the works. There are many many who choose to simply share their internal cognitions quietly, through their art and lives. These illustrations speak to realized states. In other words, you can taste for yourself some of what is being referenced throughout.This is an exciting, inspiring, rich, and interesting book, full of food for thought, magical concepts and intriguing possibilities. With this book as my guide, I have created some of my most provocative artwork that in turn carries the energy of my own realizations.

Often these thangkas are incorrectly identified, and where the deity's often highly specific attributes are listed many errors and omissions may occur. Deity identification is essentially of little value without an understanding of the qualities of the deity, and these qualities have everything to do with the Buddhist teachings, yet little to do with art history. Naming the names' is perhaps akin to trainspotting, or to knowing the names of everyone in a crowded room and something of their dress sense or style - but unless one goes beyond the superficial and gets to know these people in their full and unique individuality, they will always remain strangers."},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs","review":"I'm not going to babble on and on about this book.

Almost every book he writes seems to be the definitive book on the subject. Lord, Have Mercy is probably not his best book, but it is the best book I have read on the topic of sacramental Confession.Hahn seems to have done it all: the Old Testament pre-history of confession (going back to Adam and Eve), the New Testament origins of the sacrament, the history (from patristic times to the present), the theological and spiritual reasons why confession is necessary, and a common-sense guide to best practice for penitents; he ends with an up-to-date and very comprehensive examination of conscience. Along the way, he demolishes every significant argument against the validity and efficacy of the sacrament.All of this is done in Hahn's simple, easy-to-read style, which makes deep theological and exegetical issues comprehensible to almost everyone. Above all, he writes everything in the context of the overwhelming mercy of God. And all in about 200 pages, including sources and references.To add fun along the way, we also get his delightful word-play subtitles, for those who, like myself, agree with Isaac Asimov that the play on words is the noblest form of wit.All in all, this is the perfect book on Confession to recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"OLD BONES","review":"For anyone new to David Wishart's main character Marcus Corvinus and they have read any of the \\"Falco\\" novels by Lindsey Davis, the Marcus Corvinus novels are in the same \\"style:\\" A Roman sleuth whose manner of speech is out of character with the surroundings he lives in i.e. Ancient Rome.

It presents some interesting perspectives on US-French competition in the world of industrial espionage but overall it is not very informative. Its principal failing is that it is a book about technology that butchers technical details.The author's disconnect with technology is demonstrated in his discussion of the Clipper chip. Clipper is now installed in most stand-alone voice encryptors that are sold in the US. At the beginning of each phone call a new session key is shared between the two callers. It is not practical to find this session key by guessing but a separately encrypted version is sent along with the conversation. The session key can be discovered by government agencies through appropriate procedures. The author's discussion of this states that a NSA proposal &quot;...would add a device called the clipper chip to every telephone or computer manufactured in the United States.&quot; For most phones that use analog transmission of voice this would clearly make no sense. Apparently the author missed the issue entirely.In places the book becomes more of a political platform than a balanced discussion. After condemning filtering programs that block access to porn sites he states that &quot;The fun for those who devote themselves to censorship is the daily discovery of new sites that they can condemn and prohibit&quot;Even commonly known security details are missed. In a discussion of phone phreaking the author states that the publication titled 2600 was named after the frequency that a quarter made when falling into a pay phone. 2600 Hertz is actually the frequency of a supervisory tone that was used to bypass toll equipment.In an evaluation of the hacker Kevin Mitnick's his technical abilities were rated as #2 in the world.

Publishing a bunch of quotes don't prove jack.In one glaringly ignorant sentence he infers that published bomb-recipies are a phenomenon perpetrated solely by right-wing militia groups. Huh. On the subject of internet policing he wanders from: the idea that governments should not, to the idea that the internet is a &quot;self-policing nirvana&quot;, to wondering how laws to prevent nazis from having websites could be enforced. If you are a regular study of this topic you will not find anything new here.

By Jean Guisnel; published by Plenum Publishing, 800/221-9369 (phone), 212/647-1898 (fax); 296 pages; $26.95.In the recent flood of cyberspace publications, this book at best adds a mere trickle to the literature. While the author presents some interesting perspectives on United StatesFrench competition in industrial espionage (in fact, the book is translated into English from French), the faulty technical details present throughout ultimately sink this effort.The author's disconnect with technology stands out in his discussion of the Clipper chip, which is now installed in most standalone voice encryptors sold in the United States--but in few other applications. The author contends that the National Security Agency proposes to add the chip to every telephone manufactured in the United States. This statement is both illogical and wrong. Analog phones, which can't take chips, continue to be widely manufactured because they are far more affordable than digital phones. Moreover, digital phones are generally hooked to analog lines and don't use encryption. Thus, installing Clipper in all phones makes no sense.The author even confuses commonly known security details. In a discussion of phone phreaking, for example, he claims that the publication titled 2600 was named after the frequency generated by a quarter as it plunks into the slot in a pay phone. In fact, the publication's title derives from the frequency in hertz of a supervisory tone used to bypass toll equipment.And in places the book lapses from a balanced discussion into political commentary. For example, after criticizing filtering programs that block access to pornographic and other objectionable Web sites, the author states that &quot;The fun for those who devote themselves to censorship is the daily discovery of new sites that they can condemn and prohibit.&quot;Instead of providing new material, this book is essentially a collection of accounts of computer intrusions previously published in newspapers.

Most of what you might see on this side of the globe about the Alps is directed at the casual tourist who hardly leaves the valleys and the pavement. This book is quite different in that it's aimed primarily at the mountaineer, adventurer and lover of high alpine wilderness.Each of the several dozen high peaks gets generally 4-8 pages which have basic info about the peak, the story (brief) of its first ascent(s), as well as the later climbing history of its other routes and walls, plus a condensed box with route gradings and descriptions, needed maps, nearby avenues of approach from civilization, available huts and the like -- all the vital info you'd seem to need if you were going in to tackle one of these beauties.The whole thing is illustrated profusely with photos which are both very informative and stunning in their beauty. Even if you have no interest in climbing, the book is worth the price just for its photos alone. Yes, this technically makes it a coffee table book, but unlike any other I've seen. Each turn of the page makes you think *this* peak is *the* most beautiful -- until you get to the next one. I especially liked the way many of the photos (at least one for each peak, usually two) are presented in an annotated, line-sketch form so you can see exactly where the routes which are described in the text lie on the various hi-res photos (many taken from the air or adjacent high routes).This book has so much going for it that it's few flaws don't pull it down out of the 5-star category: 1) I believe the english edition is a translation from the german original; it's a very good translation, but the book assumes a certain familiarity with the subject matter and the region which would have benefited from a glossary and an extra sentence here and there. 2) Each geographical section of the Alps is only allowed one (pretty decent) map, so for a given peak you may be flipping back and forth 50+ pages alot. 3) There's nothing explaining the climb gradings. It wasn't until I compared some of the photos showing climbers (roped) on the actual routes with the descriptions in the text and the gradings (in the condensed box) that I realized a class III climb in the Alps is not the same as one here in the Rockies; I believe the book uses the UIAA system (where a III is the same as a 5.3 or 5.4 on the Yosemite Decimal System); this is an important oversight since someone could seriously underestimate the difficulty and think they were headed for a walk-up when in fact a technical climb lay ahead. I've never seen a climbing guide (though this is so much more) where the difficulty grades were not explained with at least a paragraph or two. I'm still confused about what the &quot;AD+&quot; type ratings included along with the roman numerals are meant to signify. In other words, the book's abundant climbing info is less accessible here in the US than one might have wished."},{"Title":"The High Mountains of the Alps","review":"A superbly produced book that describes in more or less detail all the classic routes to the summits of the 4000m peaks in the Alps, along with commentary on the history of many of the climbs. The previous reviewer was unclear about the AD type grades. These are widely used in the Alps to capture the overall difficulty of a climb (they allow for technical difficulty, seriousness, length, altitude etc.) In increasing difficulty they are F (Facile), PD(Peu Difficile), AD (Assez Difficile), D (Difficile), TD (Tres Difficile),ED (Extrement Difficile)."},{"Title":"Revolutionary Antisemitism in Germany from Kant to Wagner","review":"This book details the \\"bipartisan\\" nature of German anti-semitism. Non-Christian revolutionaries hated Jews as well, and Rose details their reasons by analyzing the political opinions of various Romantic/German philosophers of the 18th, 19th Centuries. He covers Kant, Hegel, Voltaire, Fichte, Marx, and ends with Wagner, and shows the intellectual development of revolutionary anti-semitism through these philosophers. Some are well-known, like the aforementioned ideologues, others are lesser known. The book shows the development of an anti-Semitic mythology, that began as a Christian anti-Semitism (the Ahasverus-Wandering Jew, Moloch and Mammon), yet by the beginning of the 20th Century, was a fully Secularized anti-semitism.The important lesson from this book is how entrenched Jew hatred was across the German intellectual landscape in the 19th Century. It wasn't limited to a bunch of Capitalist Christians (as accused by many Marxist historians, who would no doubt be ashamed that their hero Marx hated Judaism), but atheists and socialists as well. A good companion book to this is \\"Scientific Origins of National Socialism\\", about Ernst Haeckel and the Monist League, and how the German scientists caved into Jew-hatred as well."},{"Title":"Revolutionary Antisemitism in Germany from Kant to Wagner","review":"This outstanding book clearly shows that 19th century Germany was soaked in a rabid antisemitism of the most dangerous kind, namely, revolutionary antisemitism: philosophical,supposedly rational/scientific/secular, but in reality driven by that same irrational hatred and resentment inspired by christian antisemitism and fueled by Germany's anxiety regarding its national identity.A masterpiece."},{"Title":"Revolutionary Antisemitism in Germany from Kant to Wagner","review":"This book is most interesting for me because I know what kind of trouble Kant, Hegel, Fichte, and Heine had with the authorities of their times. Some young thinkers who followed Hegel could be accused of getting Hegel into more trouble than he deserved, and this book offers a tremendous amount of support for that view. There was a tremendous enthusiasm for revolution, and one of the writings produced in 1793 suggested cutting off certain heads, which is what the terror that followed the revolution in France had made a significant news item in those days. I am interested in economic issues, which a few of the philosophers tried to deal with abstractly as they aged. Actually writing about Jews seemed to be easiest for those who were young, and most of the great thinkers outgrew that phase very rapidly when they found out how long a memory the Jews have.This book was written recently enough to have a view of the world that coincides quite well with the political issues of 2008 and the froreseeable future. The basic statement of the issues as major themes in the revolutionary changes that everybody expected to settle long before now at the beginning of the book points to specific disputes that are discussed in the chapters that follow, but it strikes me that the world has never become as settled as anyone has expected, and attempting to turn a crank by imagining an ideal outcome of a revolution is merely turning a crank."},{"Title":"Revolutionary Antisemitism in Germany from Kant to Wagner","review":"Rose has written a masterful book, capturing the true essence of Antisemitism.

Buy it!"},{"Title":"The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, The Underclass, and Public Policy","review":"A sure indication that you have arrived at an independent, intellectual, and honest position is the degree to which both sides of the ideological fence find fault with your work. Mr Wilson experienced that with his earlier book THE DECLINING SIGNIFICANCE OF RACE, the radical liberal left, excoriated him as selling out his race and lambasted his work as cultural determinism. With THE TRULY DISADVANTAGED, Mr Wilson gives as good as he gets.Cogently he argues that the Great Society architects thought that creating educational, training, and development programs would, by their very existence, simply cause poverty to shrink. There was very little analysis of the impact that changes in the US economy would have - not only on the programs, but on the beneficiaries. One telling indication that his finger is on the correct pulse - economics - is this: in nearly every year that unemployment has risen and wages have fallen, poverty has grown worse, yet &quot;when the economy has picked up, poverty has lessened.&quot;There are a couple of things that are significant about this book, which, even now, 14 years later, makes it one of the more useful and original analyses even done on US urban problems.(1) When it was written, in the late 1980's the economic trends that Mr Wilson so clearly elucidates as the problem were still largely unstudied, especially the interconnectivity and complexity of the issues. Mr Wilson says conservative writers such as Charles Murray are incorrect when they proclaim that because poverty rates were as high in the 1980's as they were in the 1960's, the Great Society programs were failures. This neglects, or conveniently ignores, the fact that there was a doubling of the unemployment rate, which disproportionately affected blacks. The causes of huge unemployment rates amongst young black men are less to do with racism, but more the following: the mechanization of southern agriculture, the large number of baby-boomers and white women who entered the labor market in the 1970's, and the profound shift of the economy from manufacturing to service industries. Blacks were heavily represented in manufacturing and the decline in key sectors such as automobile, rubber, and steel had a particularly deleterious effect on black employment.(2) While it can be seen that THE TRULY DISADVANTAGED was in part, a response to conservative analyses of the issues, this book is not a rhetorical rejoinder. There was significant new material brought forward by Mr Wilson and the focus was on an objective assessment of cause; not on ascribing blame to racism, culture, or government policy. I remember reading UNHEAVENLY CITY REVISITED as part of an Urban Studies course at college in the 1980's and what has remained with me, and is heightened when compared with Mr Wilson's book, is the rather shallow analysis of the former, and its emphasis on cultural and social factors as determinants for urban decay. I graduated before Mr Wilson's book was published, so have no idea if it was used as a text. It should be.This book stands as an insightful look into the causes of urban decay and poverty; it highlighted economic trends that were not seen by others and it came out at a time when competing scholars were offering only narrow, single source answers. If you prefer one of the latter, there is non better than LOSING GROUND which lays the blame for black poverty squarely at the feet of government policy.&quot;A book is a version of the world. If you do not like it, ignore it; or offer your own version in return&quot; (Salman Rushdie)We're still waiting for an equally well-reasoned and rounded version as this one."},{"Title":"The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, The Underclass, and Public Policy","review":"In The Truly Disadvantaged, Wilson attempts to concentrate where his previous work The Declining Significance of Race left off, more specifically the effects of social isolation, male joblessness, and single mother headed families have perpetuated a self-fulfilling prophecy among young black youth. A daunting task at hand, I must say, but I think he makes valid points, yet they aren't articulated as well as in his previous work.I believe that this is a worth while book for any reader trying to understand the complexities of the urban poor."},{"Title":"The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, The Underclass, and Public Policy","review":"Groundbreaking and unconventional, Wilson took a completely independent stance in this book, one that managed to displease partisans on both left and right. What he argues for is, among other things, that race-based programs and policies are doomed to fail because they ignore the core economic issues which in the inner city communities are at least partly defined by the elimination of industry-based jobs. Since Wilson wrote this over 20 years ago, the original economic problems are now massively compounded by precisely the kind of social problems he at least in part predicted. A brilliantly argued work that is perhaps even more valuable today because partisanship from both conservatives and radical &quot;race based&quot; activists has almost completely replaced reasoned, compassionate understanding."},{"Title":"The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, The Underclass, and Public Policy","review":"Wilson does not beat around the bush; this book is a fairly quick read, but dense with economic and social policy criticism and sociological analyses. Specifically, expect to hear a lot about race-specific policies (i.e. affirmative action) and how they don't really help the \\"ghetto underclass.\\" Might offend some senses but the ideas here are solid, and Wilson uses race as a reference point, not an explanation. Instead, he explains the problems of the \\"underclass\\" in terms of social and economic policy. His case against race-specific policies (and for large-scale economic change) is strengthened when you consider that the social/economic situation of poor inner city minority communities is not very different from Wilson described 20 years ago. This book also offers a clear explanation of the problems of those communities, and research to back it up.Overall, I'd say it's a must-read for anyone interested in social policy or recent U.S. history."},{"Title":"The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, The Underclass, and Public Policy","review":"This book is a masterpiece. Brilliantly written, clearly argued. Even after 30 years, you cannot read this book and not have your opinions of urban poverty transformed. We need more thinkers like William Julius Wilson, who insists that his theories be drawn from the facts, rather than marshalling facts selectively to support his prejudices."},{"Title":"The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, The Underclass, and Public Policy","review":"I choose this rating because i recieve the package fast along with the book being in good conditiion!!!!! worked out great"},{"Title":"The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, The Underclass, and Public Policy","review":"This book stands in direct opposition to Loosing Ground by Charles Murray. However, where Murray's argument is solid and convincing, Wilson's is riddled with gaps and broad assumptions."},{"Title":"The Science of Consciousness","review":"This is a good collection of papers on the science of consciousness. Anyone interested on the field, or someone familiar with it, will find nothing terribly new, except perhaps the clinical papers, those dealing with the placebo effect and somatic consequences of consciousness. This would be a much better introductory text than an original contribution in general.The introduction is about average. Papers on perception without awareness and consciousness in relation to memory and learning are quite good. Bernard Baars presents his cognitive theory of consciousness again. Then are the two really good papers, the jewels, one by Libet discussing neural correlates of consicousness, and a review of neuropsychology and dissociation in consciousness by A. Young, one of the best yet. Then there are the before mentioned papers on clinical matters, the often ignored section in consciousness studies. Max Velmans writes some philosophy of consciousness, and proposes a reflexive model, which I think was a little confusing, for mixing up phenomenology and objectivity. For example, for him pain is in the finger that hurts, not in the brain. But he admits the correlates and presumably mechanisms of pain are in the brain. He holds that pain is in the finger that hurts in a strange pseudo-phenomenological sense."},{"Title":"The Science of Consciousness","review":"This is a good collection of papers on the science of consciousness.

Not only is she writing a hit tv show, but she also has six published novels, a few short stories found in various collections, and a film based on one of her novels. She's done it all.I just finished her third novel, If You Could See Me Now and was completely thrown off by her slight change in genre. The thing I like about Ahern is that she writes chick lit well. I'm not a huge chick lit fan, it's very hard for me to find one that's actually...good. But not with Ahern. Her books are fun, interesting, and lively. She lets you love the characters and grow with them as the story progresses. And you always feel something, which I like best. Her new book, though, takes the romance theme and adds magic. The book is about a middle aged woman who lives with her adopted nephew. She is strict and unyielding--she does not let people in. When her nephew starts talking about an imaginary friend, she gets irritated. Yet, when she starts seeing this imaginary friend, well, things get interesting.At first, I was disappointed that she veered into the fantasy genre, but as I read the book, I almost understood it. Whether it's her way of sticking out in the sea of similar chick novels, or just her writing what she enjoys, it works. And although it was hard to get into at first, ultimately I enjoyed the novel. The imaginary aspect of it made you remember what it was like to feel invincible and live without fear nor limits. It made me want to run through a field and pick flowers.And all good novels should make you want to do that, right?"},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I thought that this book was really really good. It kept me interested with Ivan's thoughts and feelings toward Elizabeth, and their romance just kept me wanting more. I think that this book will change people's minds about \\"imaginary friends\\", and it will make people believe that there are spirits looking out for you. It's a must read!"},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"Oh - I really loved this one! It was more entertaining than her others and infinitely more magical. But it was much sadder too and it left some loose ends - namely, about the sister, and the main character's own future. If I had to describe this book to anyone, I would call it a more romantic version ofDrop Dead Fred- and though the book seems like a clear deviation of it, it still managed to sparkle with originality and I would recommend it to anyone who would like a good chick lit read."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I've really enjoyed several of Ahern's other books so when I found this title at my local paper store, I snapped it up. Even though the book I picked up had been mis-binded (actually read backwards page wise... a bit tricky really) I was so absorbed in this tale that I didn't mind struggling a bit to get through (in whatever direction) for the story. Her writing is quirky, beautiful and lyrical. The story focuses on a character undergoing a transformation. Unlike many romantic stories I've read lately, Ahern's thoughts on love may be whimsical but always reality based so that you never have to feel the novel is ridiculous. Yet, she still brings a lovely romanticism to the tales. Also, there is a little plot-twist that I didn't see coming. All-in-all, for this avid reader- a great find!"},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"This book was such a joy to read!!! You don't want this book to end!"},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"This book was incredibley great! The premis of the story was, to me, very unique. At first I did not expect to like it because of \\"imaginary friend\\" element, and I also did not know that this was what the story was about. But I was very moved by this story. It was funny, very sad, and had a happy ending. Even though the characters dealt with sadness, they were able to accept their situations and move on. I laughed and smiled and was also brought to tears by this story."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"This was an excellent read. Really hard to put this book down. A great escape from reality."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"\\"You've Got to See Me Now\\" was dramatically different from Cecelia Ahern's first two novels. I loved \\"P. S. I Love You\\" and \\"Rosie Dunne\\" and pre-ordered this latest novel before it was officially released. Unfortunately, her departure from reality to fantasy left me cold. Also, I found Elizabeth was far too astute, too detailed, not to have picked up earlier in the story that Ivan was invisible to everyone else but her.However, I'm still Cecelia's greatest fan"},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"As a fan of \\"P.S. I Love You\\" and \\"Love,Rosie\\" I must say that I was not as pleased with Ahern's latest work. After being so pleased with her 1st two books I had to continue on and read this one - I was surprised at how different it is from her other work. Initially the story is somewhat confusing and at times frustrating with Elizabeth being such an \\"enabler\\" to her family members ill behavior(s). The story does get better as it goes along and in the end I was fairly pleased. I'm glad that I read it, but I'm hoping for more great reads from Ahern like her first two."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I read and really liked PS I Love You so I thought I'd give this one a try. I'm really glad I got it from the library rather than buying it. I felt like it might be fun for a 15 year old but was silly and hard for me to get through and I only did so because I have a hard time not finishing a book. I was not surprised to read on the back that the rights to the film version had been bought by Disney. I have no prolem with imagination and books of fantasy but this was plaing juvenile and the heroin a bit neurotic and mean for my taste. Maybe I'll try Rosie Dunn or Rainbow's end or whatever it's called but I think I'll try the library again. I would have given it one star but I didn't have the heart since some people seemed to like it."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I liked it, I didn't love it but Ahern's book is a magical one that took abit to understand at first but ended up being an enjoyable romp through the world of imaginery friends. The story was clever and delightful however the characters didn't warm up to me as I would want them to.Set in Ireland, this tale weaves the lives of two sisters, Elizabeth (leading the straight and narrow life) and Saoirse (the wild child). Elizabeth takes care of Saoirse's son, Luke, who has an adult imagnery friend. The story is abit confusing in parts but once you understand and BELIEVE that 'Ivan' exists, well, you understand completely after that :)"},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I originally read this because I'm a fan of Hugh Jackman's and I know he's planning to produce/act in the theatrical version of this story. I plan now to read more books by this fine author.

Abandoned by her gypsy alcoholic mother as a young girl, she was forced to raise her younger sister and cater to her bitter, resentful father. At the age of 35, not much has changed, except that now she has adopted her sister's son, Luke, and she is all business as an interior decorator. She has no time to laugh or take the lesser problems of life with a grain of salt. That is, she doesn't until Ivan comes into her life.Ivan is a \\"best friend\\" who usually helps young children in trouble and, at first, only Luke can see him. Then it's Elizabeth who sees him. That's when things get complicated, because, amid all the life-changing fun of discovering the childhood she didn't get to have with Ivan and Luke, Elizabeth and Ivan begin to fall in love. There are just a few problems, though: Nobody else can see Ivan, although he is truly there, and he can never grow old like a mortal being.So what is to become of them? Well, get If You Could See Me Now and find out for yourself. I laughed a lot, cried a few times, and was totally enchanted by the childlike magic aimed at all ages in Ahern's sweet story. Here is a charming book that deserves to be made into a blockbuster family movie. It might even make you believe there's something more than air to your childrens' imaginary playmates."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I LOVED this book!!! When I started reading, it reminded me a lot of the movie \\"Drop Dead Fred\\" but quickly I became intrigued by the characters!

All the copies I have purchsed were received in great condition."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"Although I believe/dream of fairy tales, this book was more geared towards a children's section. It was more comparable to a teenage crush than a romance. I didn't like Elizabeth, a highly intelligent woman, couldn't understand the world of make believe. She was totally oblivious to the fact that no one saw her friend and kept calling her crazy. I also think Ivan's explanation of himself and why he had to go could have been more powerful. I did like that it showed how strong a connection two minds can make and commend Cecelia Ahern on approaching a romance in the non-conventional way. I give it a 2 because the first 100 pages were slow but it does get better further in."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"It's my first time reading a novel by this young pretty author but frankly I'm rather disappointed. First of all, the plot was totally predictable and disengaging. The idea about \\"imaginery friend\\" working for a company (since Opal is known as \\"the boss\\") was absurd, leaving me scratching my head wondering why the author would choose to confine this genuine individual to an institutional context. Second, while Elizabeth as the protagonist was portrayed as a rigid yet ambitious woman, she was unable to detect any flaw in the existance of Ivan, the imagery person. Especially when it comes to reality, it would not make sense not to ask for contact method when getting to know someone, not to mention falling for him/her. It was almost until the end of the novel that she became suspicious, but even so Luke, her nephew, seemed to understand the reality better than her. It made Elizabeth even less convincing as someone who wanted to take control of her life since this line of plot did not align with her personality. Third, the part which suggested that an individual could have imagery friends for 3 months was inaccurate. This misleading detail might easily distort the general conception of children's capacity to create and imagine. Lastly, nothing is mentioned between the relationship of Elizabeth and Benjamin, which was acceptable, yet leaving this bit hanging appeared unsatisfactory. The novel overall felt like a children's fiction. Giving credits to the beautiful scenery description of the town which the plot was set, I rate this book a 2."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I'm a great fan of cecelia ahern's books and I always keep a lookout for any new releases.As again, this book is another heartwarming experience. Trust cecelia ahern to be capable of that. :)Its sad of course, that Ivan never made it with Elizabeth. However, I am satisfied with the ending, just like every of her books. Ivan is make believe, but it just depends on whether you believe he exists or not. Maybe to put it simply, whether there's such a thing called a Guardian Angel.I am looking forward to her next write."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"This book seemed to go on and on forever. Like it was a single sentence that was blown up into a book. I think the author was published because of her Father's influence, not because of her talent."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I loved this book. It's about some of my dearest childhood memories: the so-called imaginary friends. Elizabeth Egan is 34. She is taking care of her sister Saoirse's child Luke, because her sister is an alcoholic. Her childhood has not been easy. Her mother was always running away and coming back from what she called adventures, leaving her and her dad alone with a toddler sister to care for. Slowly her father became a very sad man, waiting for his wife to come home. Elizabeth by growing looked more and more like her mother and she knew her father couldn't look at her without sadness in his eyes. So she decided to prove him that she only looked like her mother. At 34 she lives in a home that looks perfect, with a six year old boy, whom she can't show any tenderness and a sister who has disappeared. She loves her job as an interior designer, though she lives in a cream and brown world of her own. The day Luke has a new best friend, Ivan, all her nightmares resurface. Just because only Luke can see Ivan. And fantasy has no place in her perfect world. Illusions, that can lead to disillusionment must be kept away from her nephew. So she starts a crusade against Ivan. Until she meets him. He will help her handle her condition, he will help her remembering lost truth of her childhood, he will help her bringing back the lost child in her, but most of all he will help her to live and after some embarrassing encounters, she finally discovers another truth: Imaginary friends do exist. If people would stop being scared of things they can't rationally explain then they could open their eyes and see so many things. Their minds would travel unknown places. Discover new worlds. If people would stop arguing about or trying to decide what is \\"normal\\", this would be a happier world. Because imaginary is only a name they've been given by dull people, who'd have a great potential of being fantastic if they only destroyed the mental walls they live within."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I've never read any of Cecelia Ahern's other books but thought I'd give her latest release a try.

It's about Elizabeth Egan, who at first seems so rigid, inflexible and closed off to life that it's hard to stay interested in her.But as the story unfolds, Elizabeth meets her nephew's imaginary friend, Ivan, and is forced to confront the question: What if imaginary friends are real? And what if no other adults can see them?Ivan is part of an organization called \\"What If\\" that generally helps children in need of friends. But every once in a while, adults can see the imaginary friends, too. In this book, the friends are not imaginary, just invisible to most adults.The book reminded me a bit of Roman Holiday, with its sense of a fun-filled, playful life away from the daily grind, and the inevitable ending.Although this book took a while to draw me in, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Cecilia Ahern's previous novels. At first, also, it struck me as more of a children's story, but as we learn more and more about Elizabeth's past, the story becomes more three-dimensional and interesting.

I Love You\\" and Rosie Dunne\\" will be pleased with the different road she takes in her third novel \\"If You Could See Me Now.\\" This time out rather than a happy ending romance with an Irish lilt we find a wee spirit. Not so wee after all, his name is Ivan, and he's invisible - to everyone but 6-year-old Luke.His tightly wound aunt, Elizabeth Egan, fears Luke is imagining things just as his mother does and her mother did. Fantasy is fearful according to Elizabeth whose childhood was spent trying to make up for a mother who disappeared from the small village in which they lived. Life was simply too dull there, and she left in search of adventure. Elizabeth's sister, Saoirse, is her mother's daughter, one more \\"free spirit\\" who doesn't let parenthood hold her back. Thus, it is left to Elizabeth to care for Luke.After a sad childhood and a less than satisfactory adulthood, adventure, enjoyment are not a part of Elizabeth's existence; order, control, practicality are her mainstays. However, she had not counted on Ivan. According to him there was \\"nothing imaginary about him whatsoever.\\" It was simply that people couldn't see him. He has everything Elizabeth does not - a sense of fun, spontaneity, and a lusty love of life.Ivan arrived to bring a little cheer to Luke but soon discovers that Elizabeth could also use a new lease on life. It is not too long before she is able to see Ivan, too, which is where the fun begins.After all, Ireland is the home of leprechauns, elves, and other magical creatures. So, what better setting for this imaginative story of a man who may or may not be real? It is belief in him that brings about change. For those who doubt, Ivan speaks of imaginary friends, \\"...we're here to help and assist those who need us, who believe in believing, and who can therefore see us.\\"\\"If You Could See Me Now\\" is a bit of a fantasy, a lot of enjoyment, and soon to be a musical starring Hugh Jackman.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"This third novel of Cecelia Ahern did not leave me disappointed in the least.

It is not the type of book I would necessarily pick up and buy. The idea for the storyline is original and the characters are easily brought to life. Ivan inparticular lived on with me. As an imaginary friend, he definately brings life to the book, although his fate left me feeling cheated. Elizabeth could be slightly annoying at times, letting her family rule her life and basically closing herself off from everyone. I felt sorry for her nephew, Luke, who at 6 years of age has a mother who's an alcoholic with a peter pan syndrome and an aunty who shows him no love or affection. The book definately has it good moments and I enjoyed it enough to seek out Cecelia Ahern's previous 2 books.

I ended up listening to the audio version (the full one, not the abridged one...) instead of reading it, but I don't think that changed my opinion on the novel.To me, this was not the best novel Cecelia Ahern has written. I enjoyed both PS I Love You and Rosie Dunne more than If You Could See Me Now. It took me about 35 chapters to really get into the novel...for me, Elizabeth just had too many issues. As someone else's review has said...it's hard to believe that Elizabeth, who is so acute and aware of everything around her, didn't realize who \\"Ivan\\" was until the book was almost over.The other thing that I did not like about this book is that it seemed like too many strings were left untied at the end. I don't want to give away the ending...so I'm not going to be specific, but to me, Elizabeth's family situation was never really concluded.But enough negative stuff. I actually did really enjoy this novel. It was nice to be able to read something so different from the rest of this genre. Ivan's character gave me a lot of food for thought personally...something I always enjoy getting out of a good read.With an open imagination, this book can most definitely be loved. I definitely enjoyed it, but, when recommending it, I would caution that it is not Ms. Ahern's best novel.

I had read good reviews for it and thought I would give it a try. After buying it, I could barely lay it down, and in two days, read the entire novel. This book was refreshing. It was cleverly written, witty, emotional and not one bit cheesy. There's a point where I wondered how the author had managed to write about an 'imaginary' friend without it seeming too child like. The characters are three dimensional and I believe if you're from a small town or have a family, you can relate to at least one of them. It was beautiful and I would recommend it to anyone who was looking for something uplifting to read.

Her free-spirited sister, Saiorse, has never been organized and has left Elizabeth to care for her six-year old son, Luke. All is well and good until Luke begins talking to an imaginary friend, Ivan. Elizabeth is initially very worried because Luke believes very deeply that he can see Ivan. She becomes even more worried when she begins to see Ivan as well. Elizabeth convinces herself that what she is seeing is not the so-called \\"imaginary\\" friend, but is in fact a neighbor or the father of one of Luke's friends. Ivan and Elizabeth begin forming a friendship and find themselves spending a great deal of time together. Ivan has many life lessons that he wants to teach Elizabeth but she is very reluctant to let go of her strict views of life. Will Ivan be able to bring out the child in Elizabeth before it is too late? If You Could See Me Now is the third novel by Irish author Cecelia Ahern.

I fell in love with the story, as well as the characters, right from the first page. This book shows a whole new perspective on imaginary friends - they are not just for children, but for anyone needing a bit of help.'If You Could See Me Know' introduces us to Elizabeth Egan. Elizabeth focuses her life on her work, as an interior designer, who owns her own business. She is on the obsessive side when it comes to having things perfect - from her work and home, to the salt and pepper shakers at restaurants. There is no room for messiness or unorganization. This stems from a childhood of insecurities and broken dreams.Elizabeth also has to deal with raising her nephew from infancy, the reason being that his mother, Elizabeth's sister, is on the wild and impulsive side - having no desire to be a mother.One day, Luke, Elizabeth's nephew, begins talking to and seemingly playing with someone who cannot be seen. This worries Elizabeth and she is hoping that this is only a very short phase and a bit normal for a six year old.Luke insists on sitting places at the dinner table for Ivan, his friend, and holding doors open for him. He also becomes very upset when Elizabeth cannot see his new friend. This doesn't last long, however, after a very short while, a man shows up at Elizabeth's house, seemingly to pick up Luke's friend, Sam. She mistakes Ivan for Sam's Dad and things just are not the same after that.Ivan is from Ekam Eveileb and soon finds out that he has been sent to be friends with Elizabeth, rather than her nephew. His job is to add fun and love into Elizabeth's life - help her to see and come to terms with her life and a piece of forgotten childhood.Something happens, though, that neither Ivan nor Elizabeth counted on. Soon, a decision has to be made by Ivan - a very painful one.I greatly enjoy Cecelia Ahern's works of literary art. She has a wonderful way of blending fun and tenderness to her stories. It is so easy to become absorbed into the character's lives and see a whole new life through their eyes."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"What a delightfully fun and wonderful story!

She is on the obsessive side when it comes to having things perfect - from her work and home, to the salt and pepper shakers at restaurants. There is no room for messiness or unorganization. This stems from a childhood of insecurities and broken dreams.Elizabeth also has to deal with raising her nephew from infancy, the reason being that his mother, Elizabeth's sister, is on the wild and impulsive side - having no desire to be a mother.One day, Luke, Elizabeth's nephew, begins talking to and seemingly playing with someone who cannot be seen. This worries Elizabeth and she is hoping that this is only a very short phase and a bit normal for a six year old.Luke insists on sitting places at the dinner table for Ivan, his friend, and holding doors open for him. He also becomes very upset when Elizabeth cannot see his new friend. This doesn't last long, however, after a very short while, a man shows up at Elizabeth's house, seemingly to pick up Luke's friend, Sam. She mistakes Ivan for Sam's Dad and things just are not the same after that.Ivan is from Ekam Eveileb and soon finds out that he has been sent to be friends with Elizabeth, rather than her nephew. His job is to add fun and love into Elizabeth's life - help her to see and come to terms with her life and a piece of forgotten childhood.Something happens, though, that neither Ivan nor Elizabeth counted on. Soon, a decision has to be made by Ivan - a very painful one.I greatly enjoy Cecelia Ahern's works of literary art. She has a wonderful way of blending fun and tenderness to her stories. It is so easy to become absorbed into the character's lives and see a whole new life through their eyes."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I have to admit that it took me a while to get into the book. I found it somewhat difficult to relate to Elizabeth. The character of her adopted nephew was not fleshed out enough, and Ivan seemed a little bit too childish at times, and the idea of a 6 year old boy having a grown up imaginary friend is a little hard to swallow.There seemed to be several facets of the book that were hinted at, but never fully realized. Of course this was to leave more to the imagination, but it leaves you somewhat wanting. As the book wore on, I became intrigued with Ivan's fascination with Elizabeth. I also enjoyed Elizabeth as she began to add color too her neutral toned life.All in all it was a quick read and I think that the way that the book ended was much more memorable than what you would typically expect from a book with this theme. I would like to read more books by this author. It would be kind of interesting to learn more about some of the other characters in this book, and to know how things ended up for Elizabeth later down the road."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"Let me start off by saying that P.S. I Love You is one my favorite books. So I expected this book to be just as warm and funny. I think the concept of this book was great, a wound-up-tight woman falling in love with her nephew's imaginery friend, but at some points it dragged on. Overall, not one of Cecelia's best!"},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I absolutely LOVE this book! The character development was wonderful. I hate that so many reviews complained that it was so 'far out' because that was my favorite part! It's so creative and out of the box. If you are stuffy and have no imagination-this book will probably be wasted on you, but if you are a child at heart, open-minded, & creative-you will love it! I felt like a child again at so many parts of this story and it was so light and uplifting."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"what should have been an ridiculous plot and premise turned out to be a heartwarming story about hope and believing what we cannot see. It was absolutely wonderful."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"Ahern tempers heartbreak with hope and playfulness in this uplifting, sentimental tale.34-year-old Elizabeth Egan is an uptight interior designer with a 23-year-old sister Saoirse who prefers drinking and getting arrested to parenting and an adoptive son Luke (Saoirse's son). Her alcoholic mother abandoned them and left them with their emotionally distant father to fend for themselves. Elizabeth learns to adhere to an obsessive compulsive existence to survive and protect herself from the pain of loving and being disappointed... she prefers to have no mess, no conflicts, and thus, no love. However, all that changes with the arrival of Ivan, a funny and spontaneous guy intent on infusing happiness and tenderness into Elizabeth's frigid self. The catch is that no one can see this ageless guy from the land of \\"Ekam Eveileb\\" (Make Believe) except Elizabeth and her nephew. Being with Ivan makes Elizabeth turn into the woman she's always been too afraid to be. He helps her live the childhood she never had and forgive those who have let her down. An inspiring tale of love and friendship."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I love Cecilia's writing. She's a very good writer, and storyteller. With P.S. I love you, I cried and laughed the entire time, it was great. Same with Rosie Dunn, very good books. This book was good, but not great. I suppose because of the unexpected fantasy thing that happens, also it didn't end the way I wanted it to. This does not deter me from looking forward to her next book."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"Cecilia Ahern has a knack for writing books that deal with subjects otherwise left alone in Chick Lit. A big fan of her work, I was skeptical about this book because of the vague descriptions on the jacket. After reading the book, I now know why the description was written the way it was- you would not want the book given away to you before you had a chance to read it.This is an endearing, well-written and emotional book full of funny moments as well as touching moments. A great book to sit down with that fully engulfs you and bring you into the story."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I have read Cecelia Ahern's earlier books: \\"PS I Love You\\" & \\"Rosie Dunn\\". I likened both works to be in the pop music category, very danceable, its easy to bob up and down with the story, you go with the flow. Lots of interaction & action among characters. Whoosh!!However, this latest book is like soulful music, it has a very slow tempo. To me, the ending is happy but muted as there is the lingering aftertaste of an overburdered emotional baggage. I felt like I was dragging a chain of huge dumb-bells attached to my ankles. Here's why I have this effect.Chapters can be entirely full of contemplation without any conversation or action among characters. In fact, there are many chapters that go on being reflective pieces or the inner thoughts of the main characters which can get quite dreary. I was confused at the opening chapter trying to figure out who is who.This is a departure from Cecelia Ahern's earlier writing style that has a strong casual tone. The tone in her latest work here is very heavyweight with magnified worries, frustration & angst. Not that her earlier works did not carry these emotions, it did but as I said it was a lighter brush stroke that you can skip over lightly.The plot is unusual. I give credit to the author for coming out with original plot lines like in her earlier works. Its about imaginary friends present in an adult world. As kids you believe but as you become an adult you dont. This book reverses this thinking.So, Cecelia Ahern received her full advance of one million pounds with the completion of this third & final novel in her first contract. Just wondering whether she changed her writing style becos critics have in the past complained that she does not have a matured style of writing or she feels that this style of writing is better. I still prefer her 2 earlier works."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"This was really good, I liked it because it was an unusual story.This is a story about two sisters. Elizabeth and Saoirse. Elizabeth try's to make a perfect life for herself... perfect house, perfect job! Saoirse is the opposite. Saoirse's life a mess. Saoirse drinks too much, doesnt work, and constantly steels her sisters car. Saoirse also has a son. Luke, who is taken in by Elizabeth as Saoire is unable and unwilling to take care of him.Both Elizabeth and Lukes lives change on the arrival of Ivan who teaches Elizabeth that live doesnt have to be as difficult and serious as she makes it and he also becomes a close friend Luke."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"After finishing The Book of Tomorrow, I've decided to get this title. I finished this book in 4 days (reading while eating, while waiting at the traffic light, etc). I just can't put it down. The storyline was well-written, and of course when Ivan met Elizabeth, their conversations were funny at times, making me laugh.It's a good read, and I wished the story did not end the way it did. In fact, I wished it did not end at all! Will there be a continuation of this story, Ms Ahern?The creativity and imagination rendered in this book is creative. The love that unfolded between Ivan and Elizabeth gave *me* butterflies! I would recommend this book to anyone who likes light reading - and make believe for once that there are people out there guiding and helping us. If you could just open your hearts and see them :)"},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I loved this book. It's the first Ahern novel I've read, and I'll definitely be buying her other books.I grew up reading Maeve Binchy, and am a big fan of Marian Keyes. When I heard about Cecelia Ahern I decided to give this Irish author a whirl.I loved it. It was really magical and sweet and the end was very touching.I'm going to tell all of my friends about the book and this author. Thank you, Cecelia!"},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I really enjoy Cecilia Ahern's writing style. Even though you know it's a fictional story, it draws you in, wishing it were true. She is a wonderful storyteller!"},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"A child's imaginary playmate gets the \\"hots\\" for the lad's aunt/guardian and decides to loosen her up a bit. This kind of blarney is not my Irish cup of tea and I threw in the towel halfway through. Read anything by Maeve Binchey instead."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"Oh my gosh, what a great book! She is a fantastic writer. This light hearted story gives \\"PS. I Love You\\" a run for it's money when it comes to being her best yet! You will laugh, you might cry, and you will laugh out loud! Very charming, great character development and an easy read. VERY ENJOYABLE... Absolutely a Two Thumbs Up, and if I had 10 hands, I'd give it 10 thumbs up!! ;-) I love her books and can never wait for the next one to come out...still waiting, by the way."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"This book is much better than I originally anticipated. The characters are well developed and interesting. The story itself was very refreshing and made for a lovely escape from the stresses/monotony of every day life. I'll happily recommend this book to my \\"book club\\" as a must read."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"That is how i felt about the book. the beginning was slow and not interesting. the middle of the book was great! and then the ending sucked. i might have not been in the mood to read a whimsical book such as this but i just did not like the way it ended. Currently reading Love, Rosie which is MUCH BETTER."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I love Cecelia Ahern, but this is my favorite (close second is Rosie Dunne).Anyways, the book is very well written, quick paced and witty. The characters are great too. I don't much like the cover art of either version I've seen, but don't let that stop you.Great plot line. Hard to put down."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"Elizabeth Egan is a buttoned up, unappreciated martyr to her family. At the outset of If You Could See Me Now, she is almost unbearably unlikeable. She has the care of her nephew, Luke, due to his mother's instability, and she has no idea, or interest, as to how to relate to this little boy. Enter Ivan.Ivan has a very special way of looking at the world, and a special way of being seen. He breaks things down into the segments that truly matter, and throws the rest away. His gentle good humor breathes life and humor into this book, and provides a new way to look at life, if one cares to see it.If You Could See Me Now is not by any stretch a demanding read. What you get out of it, however, depends on what you bring to it. I found some home truths that will stick with me for a lifetime, which makes this novel well worth the time it took to read. I was reminded that life is what we make of it, and that we must choose to find joy, and not lock ourselves away from it. These are simple truths, but so easy to forget. I'm grateful to Ms. Ahern for the reminder."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"okay it wasnt that much good T&#304;LL the end in the end i really weeped it was unexpected ..but cecelia ahern's books are easy reading and while i'm reading i feel relaxed dont know why it's a book u don't HAVE TO read but you can read easly good book i enjoyed"},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"As an Irish woman living in the US I eagerly await new Irish authors and love to read novels set in my home country. This book is utter tripe! The concept is completely unbelievable, the characters are one dimensional; ohmigod a commitment-phobe, routine driven, unlucky in love career-woman heroine? I kept reading and waiting for it to get better, but it never did. Ahearne's first novel PS I Love You was pretty good, however, unlikely it would have been published if Cecilia's daddy wasn't Taoiseach (Prime Minister) of Ireland. It helps to have friends, not to mention relatives in high places, all that free publicity! Save your money and buy Marian Keyes, as the guys in the Guinness ads say, she's brilliant! I give it one star as it's not possible to give none."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"Practically an impossible tale about an imaginary friend. Cecelia, you are a much better writer than this 3rd grade style of writing."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I am almost done reading this book, and I found that for the size of the book, not very much has happened. Although some lovely moments, so much of it was predictable and had me rolling my eyes! I found the characters to be really annoying, especially Ivan, the invisible friend. I just couldn't warm to him, and found him to be sappy. The writing is @'ok' if that, and it seems to ramble on and on in so many areas."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I just ordered the book because it had a 4star rating at amazon but I couldn't believe how bad this book was. It's absolutely overrated. I think I didn't even read the first 50 pages."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I was prepared to really enjoy the story as it sounded as though it might be somewhat unusual, but was deeply disappointed. The story was unfortunatley, predictable. Some other chicklit author recently wrote a novel in which a bodice-ripper novelist's leading male hunk comes to life and leads the novelist out of her mundane life, awakening her soul, etc., etc., etc. It's been done, ad nauseum.Perhaps it was the audio CD version which ruined the story. The narrators had lovely accents but did not do a particularly good job of differntiating between characters. In particular, Susan Lynch's breathless simpering depiction of Elizabeth - a la Marilyn Monroe singing Happy Birthday to JFK - was extremely annoying. That may have clouded my overall impression of the book."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"This book might just be a piece of fiction, or you could chose to believe that there is more to life than meets the eye. This book brings joy and hope, I loved it and instantly recommended it to a friend of mine whose three year old daughter has an invisible friend called Eva."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"This is sweet, innocent, and charming chick-lit at its finest. Be prepared to start: you'll have to stretch your imagination and accept the impossible as possible. If you don't, there's no chance of enjoyment.Elizabeth is a go-getter with no room for a relationship in her life but has opened her home to her young nephew because of her younger sister's alcoholic ways. She is as straight-laced and practical as they come... until her nephew's imaginary friend steps into her life.There's something so appealing about the child-like qualities of this novel. Definitely recommended to those who have enjoyed other Ahern novels (especially A Place Called Here), chick-lit with a heavy dose of magical realism, and/or those looking for an escape back to childhood."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"This was a cute, fun read. I know Disney had bought the rights to it, it turn it into a kids movie. So if Disney wants it, you know it is good."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I love Cecelia's books. This is the fourth book I read from her. There are easy to read and the stories are very creative andromantic. I wish we all have an imaginary friend such as Ivan."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"This was the first Cecelia Ahern book that I read and I loved it. It was this one that led me to her others. Personally, I think that it is her best. It's quite simply magical."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"This book sat on my bookshelf for quite a while...waiting for me to be ready to read it. And when it was time...it was time. I flew through the book unable to sit it aside. The story is so sweetly touching. It's playful and lighthearted yet full of deep emotion and caring. I couldn't wait to finish the book to pass it along to a friend. This is a story about coming into your own and letting go of the deep seeded beliefs and fears that get in your way. Ahern has done well."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"This is an AMAZING book!! Made me remember so many things!!! It's so easy to read and jet we all can learn so much about every part of it. I real,y enjoy reading it :)"},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I absolutely loved this book! I could not put it down. Cecelia Ahern is one of my new favorite authors. I also suggest reading \\"There's No Place Like Here,\\" also by the same author. Cecelia Ahern tells a fabulous story with great imagination."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I asked my cousin if she recommended any books, she rated this as her all time fav. I read this book in a few days and found it a heart warming story and very unusual. The story is captivating and I couldn't put the book down, however it is not something I regularly read. I rated this book 3 stars as it is out of my comfort zone, and not a very meaty novel. All up I found this a light hearted, entertaining read with an interesting twist... well worth reading to the end for!"},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"Cecilia Ahern's books always makes me cry, she writes in such a magical way that it touches your heart and you feel the characters as if you're in their place, as you walk through the village, often somewhere in Ireland.This story is a little slow- moving in the beginning, and I wondered if it is merely a fragment of imagination or is it for real- there you go, she mixes romance, mystery, and beauty all together.I enjoyed this book but it made me feel a little melancholic and sad after reading it. I am touched by the storyline and the ending.If you enjoyed PS I love you, you will also enjoy this book."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"\\"If you Could See Me Now\\" is another of Ahern's novels that at first glance may seem a bit odd, but once it has caught you in its web, you are unable to break free. In fact, after reading the synopsis of the novel I had to force myself to read it by reminding myself that Ahern isone of my favorite authors, otherwise I would never have read a story like this. A grown woman with an \\"imaginary\\" friend?! Please, I am an adult, why would I read a story like that? However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is anything but childish or silly. \\"If You Could See Me Now\\" is filled with deep insight into relationships, family, intimacy, and love. The entire book had me enraptured, entertained, and intrigued, and it made me think about life in a new, more whimsical way. As clich' as it to say, I laughed and I cried! This novel grabbed my attention and my heart, in the same way that Ahern's previous two novels did. I highly recommend it, and I can't wait to see what she comes out with next!"},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewer's that reality is not a strong hold of this book. I could not wait to read it as I loved Ahern's first two novels. This one, at the onset was different. Reality it isn't. If you can get past the fact that it is not believeable, and just read for enjoyments sake, you will be ok.Elizabeth Egan needs to get away from reality so she does via Ivan, her nephew's \\"invisible\\" friend. I loved that he was from ekam eveileb. The story was cute and it was a nice change from the realistic fiction I normally read. Ahern did good with this one."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"First of all if you do not like fairy tale type stories, you will really not like this one. I think this is my main problem with the story being not that keen on fantasy stories. It definitely would appeal to those who have a child like imagination which I am afraid to say I dont.Having said this though, the Cecelia Ahern is a good writer, and her style kept me reading this book.I have read Rosie Dunne which is a really good book, and I was looking foward to this story. Just a little disappointed by the plot because from reading the back on the book you would never know that it has a fairy tale element.I will not give up on Cecelia Ahern because like I said her writing style is fabulous, but I cannot recommend this to anyone that thinks only in reality."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"This is a story about forgiveness and family and finiding yourself and that when you think you arent loved, you realise you are but you were just too busy too notice, I absolutley loved the characters and that they were average people, and that the story was very sweet and endearing... I also have read P.S. I Love You and I can say I will be a reader od Cecelia's for many more years to come...."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I was so excited to read this book but what a huge disappointment it turned out to be. I LOVED Cecelia Ahern's Love Rosie and P.S. I Love You and couldn't wait to get my hands on this one. I had to force myself to finish it. Huge let down."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I've read each of Cecelia Ahern's previous books - PS I Love You and Rosie Dunne. I was eagerly waiting for this year's latest novel from one of my favorite new authors. When I read a summry of what this book was about, I began to question whether or not I wanted to give this one a shot. I have really enjoyed Ms. Ahern's two previous novels, and was anxiously looking forward to what she had in store for readers this year, but to be honest, the land of \\"make believe\\" is not usually my cup of tea!Readers need to free up their imaginations when reading this book and allow themselves to be transported to the land of make believe for a little while. I for one, find it hard to suspend all that I know and allow my imagination to run wild, I therefore, had a little bit of a hard time reading this novel.The concept is a good one - Allow \\"grown-up\\" mature readers a chance to put aside their every day \\"realities\\", traveling to a place where there are no worries about money, no wars, no divorce, etc. I'm sure there are many readers who were thrilled to be transported back to a time & place in their lives when they had no responsibilitites, no concern for anything other than their imaginary friends and their land of make-believe.If you can let go and just imagine for a little while, you will probably thoroughly enjoy this book. I had to keep reminding myself that this book is purely fiction and not my typical novel about women, love, family & friendship. Although those subjects are tackled in this book, they're not done the way most middle-aged women have come to know & respect (thru the words of Debbie Macomber, Nicholas Sparks, Luanne Rice, etc). I really would have liked to have read a novel about these same characters written in the same way that ROSIE DUNNE or PS I LOVE YOU was written - without the use of gimmicks and pranks. No imaginary friends, or unbelievable ways to handle your feelings.I understand that this book is being made into a movie starring Hugh Jackman, who I think will do just a fine job at protraying Ivan. I do think this will play out much better on the big screen than it does within the pages of novel (it almost seems to have been written with a movie idea in mind). I also think that when the movie is released it will appeal more to children than to adults and women. If the movie is made for an adult woman audience, some major changes in the story will have to take place.Fans of Cecelia Ahern will more than likely enjoy the book and will probably feel like I did (not wanting to skip over it), but whether or fans of hers will enjoy this book as much as her previous releases remains to be seen. I am still a fan of Cecelian Ahern and look forward to future novels from this promising young author, I just hope she returns to the themes of her first & second releases, becuase I think those types of novels touch more readers' hearts since so many can identify with her characters and the events that shae their lives.IF YOU CAN SEE MY NOW is a nice novel to escape into for just a little while, but a quick return to reality is needed once the novels ended."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I found the characters in this book compelling, rich with wonderful depth. I wanted to continue reading, right to the end, to see how things worked out for them. Ms. Ahern created a story that was the perfect reminder to kick off your shoes from time to time and look for the wonder in life. I recommend you read this story, you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I originally picked up this book because I was out of ideas to read and so I started in the library at the letter A. What a great book! Kind of different with the whole imaginary friends thing, but a great story. Very well written."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"The first Ahren book I read is P.S. I love you which, for me, is not so great to keep me reading the others of her books. My friend recommended me to read this and I could not stop reading this until the end. This is a light but somehow inspiring book. The topic is unique and you can relate yourself to the charater. I like how she structured the story."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I've never read any of this author's books before, though I have seen the movie version of P.S. I Love You. This is a different sort of book, though both stories are magical. This isn't a romance. It feels a little like a kids book, in fact. But it's not. It is written for adults, but is intended to help us see that we are allowed to dream, and even need to continue to dream, as we get older. It is a magical story of an invisible friend who helps the main character deal with traumatic childhood memories and losses that she had buried long ago, but that were still haunting her. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys make believe or who would like to remember what it's like to dream. As a note, I will say that I listened to the audiobook version. This may be why I never felt that the story was slow, as others have said. The woman who gave her voice to the telling of this story did a wonderful job. It was delightful from beginning to end."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"Firstoff, it is important to say that I am strictly a non-fiction reader usually. But my friend loaned me this book that her mother had loaned her. She insisted strongly that I read it and even did a small sales pitch that I would like it because there is a hospice reference in the book. So now that you know that I do not normally read fiction, I can tell you that I was entertained. I read the whole book in two days. I had my doubts in the first 20 pages or so because it was slow to start and catch up on all the characters, but once the story got started, it was engaging. I did not feel it was predictable and I liked the conundrum the characters faced. I never felt that I knew how the story was going to end and I liked the mystery of discovering along with the characters how their lives would end up."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"It's a very light, easy and entertained book, for being read whenever you need a nice time with yourself with a smile."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"The fact that my maiden name was Elizabeth Egan has absolutely nothing to do with my love of this story! Actually, I grab everything by Cecelia Ahern the minute it hits the stores. I absolutely love her imagination and the modern-day, adult fairy tales she creates for us. Although she does not travel from town-to-town or village-to-village, she is, indeed, a great seanachie!"},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"All of Cecelia Ahern's books are offbeat and cleverly written. The gal has a gift. They are all poignant and they are all in the chick-flick genre.Some are even better in the hearing. If You Could See Me Now is one of these. The Irish accent lends a magical quality to the already magical telling. But I don't want to spoil if for you.Suffice it to say, Elizabeth Egan, an organized, everything-in-its-place businesswoman, has a long way to go from beginning to the end of her journey. A journey she takes with her six-year-old nephew, Lucas, and his not-quite-six-year-old friend, Ivan. You'll laugh. You'll cry. But you'll love it. And you'll wish you could see it too!This is Cecelia's third novel - all are bestsellers. She currently has seven novels published with the eighth due out shortly. Her first book, P.S. I Love You, came out in movie form a few years ago as a major film. She has received many major awards and they are well-deserved.Cecelia Ahern is the twenty-something daughter of former Irish Prime Minister, Bertie Ahern. She and her new husband, David Keoghan have a daughter, Robin."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"Initially, this book was hard to get into for me, but I persevered and enjoyed it overall.I found myself wishing that Ivan could become a person, because I didn't find Elizabeth's possible match very convincing. Somehow he wasn't enthusiastic enough and the reader doesn't get to know him. The sister, Saoirse, disappears and there is no conclusion about her - but Elizabeth's fixation with saving her to the detriment of her own life is very irritating.All in all a good read for rainy days, which we have had for a week or so now!"},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"This is the first book I've read by Cecelia Ahern. I experienced a range of emotions while reading it: disbelief (at the idea of an imaginary friend), sadness, frustration, hope, love. My too grounded in reality self found the fantasy element too hard to believe, but it served as a nice get-away-from-reality book. I read it while on holiday; I don't know if I would have enjoyed it as much if I'd done so while caught up in the grimes of daily life and work. I liked the book but I thought it left much hanging at the end."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"All of Cecelia Ahern's stories seem like fairytales but this one particularly so.I really liked this and read it in one sitting. I wasn't that fond of Elizabeth for most of the book, it's true, she's just too rigid and clinical. But by the end I was shedding tears for her and loving the tale. I wish I had an imaginary friend just like Ivan too.I was a bit unsure of Ivan initially because there's something a bit squirly about a 6ft man playing and acting like a little boy but I soon got over that and he grew on me. I actually felt really sorry for him at the end too. It must be a good book if I'm feeling sorry for a figment of a book character's imagination......All in all a really good book and I would recommend it for anyone that likes a weepy but feel-good book. And it's just perfect for a beach or garden read.Comment"},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I was very disappointed with this book and barely got through it. The characters didn't catch my interest and found the relationship with Ivan strange. I like fantasy but this wasn't my type of book. Don't think I'll be reading this author again."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"What I like about Cecelia Ahern's books is that she takes a relatively mundane, everyday-type occurrence and infuses it with magic and with explanations that you never contemplated. Here, that everyday thing is the existence of a child's imaginary friend (in A Place Called Here it was when everyday objects or people go missing). The concept is original and the characters are compelling. That said, the speed with which Elizabeth was able to make significant changes in her personal life and emotional outlook was a little farfetched, even with magical intervention. But I enjoyed the book and will look forward to reading more things from Cecelia Ahern."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I started reading \\"If You Could See Me Now\\" but I'm glad I read it. The use of an imaginary being fir an adult was a great idea, and the chemistry and storytelling was excellent. Ahern portrayal of each character was clear and detailed. I especially liked the character of the imaginary friend. He was so child-like that he possessed a vast amount of wisdom. If you like feel-good stories with unique twists, I highly recommend this story."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"Highly recommend this book for everybody, who loves imaginary story ...It took time to understand the subtext, however, it's worth to try ... I read it 5 times and still love it ... Ivan is not real and Elizabeth is not a perfect woman... But still, the way they come close to each other is same as other couples ... REally cute but a little sad at the end :)"},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I recently finished PS I Love You by the same author and absolutely loved it. I could not wait to read this book, but once I started reading and learned more about Ivan, I was so disappointed. I did not realize the story was a fantasy when I bought the book and thought it would be comparable to PS I Love You or to a Maeve Binchy novel.I couldn't get over the whole premise of the novel and therefore I couldn't enjoy the relationship between Elizabeth and Ivan. Like others said, I really felt sorry for Elizabeth's nephew but couldn't get into the book enough to care about the other characters.I have not given up on this author, but will be more careful the next time before purchasing!"},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"This novel slowly wrapped itself around my heart, captured my imagination, and took me on a journey I didn't want to see come to an end!"},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I loved the idea behind this story (adults need to hold onto their imagination), but the book was missing something. I became a huge Cecelia Ahern after PS, I love you and Rosie Dunne. I could not put those books down. I've been reading this story for about two months . I will still read and recommend books by Ahern, just not this one."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I bought it because I loved P.S. I Love You wriiten by the same author. After reading the description of book I wasn't expecting anything more than a run of the mill romance novel, but figured I would give it a shot anyway. This book was fun, whimsical, light hearted and truly an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I'm not a fan of these so called chick lits but for some reason I've lately start buying Cecelia Aherns books. They are a pleasent read when you just want something easy to read and enjoy. I have to say that this one is by far one of her better ones! Thanks for the memories felt empty and A placed call her was just... I don't know just OK. BUT this book on the other hand makes you feel good!"},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"This is a really cute story. Cecelia Ahern has become one of my favorite authors. She truly is a talented author. This book is going to be turned into a movie and Hugh Jackman has been cast to play Ivan. He is perfect for this part. Patrick Dempsey would be perfect as Ben! If you liked P.S. I love you, you'll like this better. It's much more light hearted and fun.I can not wait to see the movie!"},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"LOVED IT!!!!!!!!! Best one she has written by far. It really gets you thinking about being a kid again and how we as adults take so many things for granted. I sent it to a friend to read and now she won't send it back cause she is now sending it around her circle of friends back ome. Guess i gotta but it again. Totally worth it though."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"I wanted to say this was a unique book written by a truly gifted writer. She writes about strong women who are so amazing. I can't put her books down. Thank you Cecelia, keep writing."},{"Title":"If You Could See Me Now","review":"There aren't even words to describe how fantastic this book really is. Cecelia Ahern takes the reader on an emotional journey, and in writing about oen woman finding herself and her ability to love, the reader in turn is taken through an emotional catharsis unlike any other!"},{"Title":"Rumic Theater, Vol. 2: One or Double","review":"'One or Double' is the second collection of short tales that don't fit into any of Rumiko Takahashi's ongoing series. Unlike the first volume, which contained mostly recent stories, this one seems to cover a range of years, judging from the art styles. They're not all winners, but over all this book is yet more solid evidence that Takahashi is a master of the graphic story telling medium. Whether you're a fan of &quot;manga&quot; or not, there's no denying that she's a skilled artist and writer who deserves the accolades and success she has enjoyed.Most of the standout stories in the book are, sports-themed. 'Excuse Me for Being a Dog!,' (a young boxer turns into a dog whenever he gets a bloody nose) 'Winged Victory,' (the tale of a rugby team that's lost 999 games in a row and the ghost who watches over it), 'The Grandfather of All Baseball Games' (a young man plays hardball with his obnoxious grandfather), and the title story (in which a kendo instructor is put in the body of the club's pretty manager) all use sports either as the backdrop or motivation for the story and its characters. The characters in these stories are Takahashi at her most charming.'The Diet Goddess' (about a girl who buys a dress with the intention of losing enough weight to look good in it) and 'Happy Talk' (about an adoptee who embarks on a search for her biological mother) are two slice-of-life stories ala the majority of the shorts from the first 'Rumic Theater' volume, and the 'Maison Ikkoku' series. Again, Takahashi presents us with charming characters the reader can't help but care about, in stories both funny and touching.Dissapoints in the book include 'To Grandmother's House We Go' (about a pair of hardluck cases who try to collect the large birthright of a deceased friend for themselves) and 'Reserved Seat' (a curious tale about a rock singer who is haunted by his grandmother and Tarakazuka). The first story is simply too short and it feels rushed on every level--the ending feels particularly unsatifactory--while the second is the only Takahashi story I've read where I felt no sympathy or good will toward any of the characters present in it.Finally, there's 'Shake Your Bhudda,' a tale that appears to be early Takahashi, both based on the art style and the story's pacing. It's clear she was still mastering her craft, and there's very little to recommend this tale. In fact, I feel the book might have been better served if it had been left out all together."},{"Title":"Rumic Theater, Vol. 2: One or Double","review":"So many stories! This book has many good stories, but I think my favorite is &quot;Excuse me for being a dog.&quot; Very very funny, about a boy who turns into a dog. Ranma comes to mind."},{"Title":"What every girl should know","review":"The essay that got Sanger banned is in this book, as the US (and other) governmentswere set on suppressing the effect of venereal disease on unsuspecting wives.Subsequently the US government circulated this essay to servicemen, without acknowledging,Sanger as it's source.Her real sympathy and desire to help women live decent happy lives shines through. Her backingfor eugenics, still widely and secretly backed worldwide as Malthusian effects are overcome bymodern societies, is hotly debated today.Her frankly cookie schemes for how to isolate the unwanted fromsociety might make you smile. Except that rumour of similar schemes for the unemployed, beingsecretly put in place across America, have gained credence.You will not be bored reading this book, and like Malthus, Sanger's real goodwill towards her fellowman and woman cannot be doubted, however much you disagree with her conclusions."},{"Title":"Bottoms Up!","review":"I have struggled with my weight all my life, especially since I turned 40. For three years, I religiously used a Nordic Track-- 5 days a week for 40 minutes--and it still did NOT change my body shape like this book did in three months! Vedral is so right. Put on the muscle and watch your metabolism change! Without consciously going on a diet, I lost 30 pounds. You can forget weighing yourself. Measure progress through the inches that disappear and then go shopping for beautiful sexy new clothes! At one point, I actually GAINED weight but LOST two dress sizes! Who cares what the scale says when your legs look great in a mini-skirt? Who cares what the scale says when you can sleep like a baby at night? Do this workout and your clothes will start hanging on you in a matter of weeks, even if you don't change your diet.Forget the tempting Info Commercials with all those expensive gadgets, gizmos and pills. You don't need to waste your hard-earned money on a space-hogging Nordic Track, Total Gym or Susanne Sommer's Ab machine. I have tried it ALL and bought hundreds of dollars of worthless stuff that ultimately didn't work. NONE could do what this book did for me! (Example: I tried the Total Gym and found it very disrupting to have to stop and change the mechanical setup from exercise to exercise. I tried the Ab machine and it was awkward and boring.)All you need with Vedral's workouts are some hand-weights and a simple exercise bench that you can fold up and slide under the bed. You can pick these up cheaply at any yard sale. Don't fall for the unhealthy fad diets and the &quot; fat buster&quot; pills that only make your wallet thinner. Vedral says the truth. There are no shortcuts. If you want to stay healthy, vital and beautiful you gotta exercise and eat right.The hardest part is to START exercising. Once you start this workout, it is almost EASY to begin to eat right. When you work so hard, you are automatically motivated to stop eating fatty foods. When you give your body what it needs, the destructive cravings for unhealthy foods begins to vanish. It's almost magical. Your body wakes you up, and says, &quot;Hey, listen to me now. I don't want that soda, give me fresh juice... I don't want that ice cream, give me a slice of watermelon instead.&quot; Your bad cravings STOP, your colon is stimulated, waste moves faster out of your system, and your skin begins to glow with health. When you exercise first for your health, the weight automatically does down. It's miraculous.Something AMAZING happens to your body AND mind when you start to work out with weights. Your posture changes and you feel deeply connected at the core. Not only will you slim down and become firm and shapely, but you will gain an almost spiritual sense of what I can only call &quot;centering,&quot; a kind of inner balance... like one sees in martial artists.I DO suggest that you go slowly and DO NOT try and keep up with the instructions in the book. Even you are already exercising, you will be surprised at what this workout will do. Start with one set of exercise (not three) until you are comfortable, then add another set for a couple of weeks, then the third set after a month or more. Use very small weights in the beginning. I jumped right in with 10 lb. weights and did it all vigorously the first day and was so sore I couldn't move for a week. Dumb. Go slowly and gently and you will be up to target at your OWN speed. It doesn't matter HOW long it takes. You may feel like you have two left feet, but don't give up. After a couple of weeks, it gets SO much easier. This workout is good for anyone from teenager to senior citizen.My only criticism (and it is an important one) is that the book SHOULD have some stretching warm-up and especially a cool-down to stretch out the muscles at the end. She has said that these ARE included in the Bottoms Up video, so I am glad to hear that. If you want to use the book only, be sure to do some basic stretching out at the end. Once you get good at it and don't rest between sets, you will find that the Lower Body part of this workout is strenuous enough to keep your heart rate up and give a decent aerobic workout too.I originally bought this book because I admire the gutsy, no-nonsense, compassionate author. Vedral is a model of American rags to riches and her Bio is inspirational and heartwarming. She now has a website where you can buy her exercise videos (they're not here on Amazon.) I just ordered The Fat-Burning Workout Video Vol 1 and the set of 3 Definition: Upper, Middle and Lower Body Workout Videos and can't wait to get them! She also has 6 different inspirational audio cassettes to motivate you even more. (I ordered all six.) Check out the Before and After pics too!... LOVE yourself. Buy this book. You are worth it!"},{"Title":"Bottoms Up!","review":"I have tried everything.But this book is the best if you really want to loose inches, try these exercises they really hurt, I thought I was in such good shape, oh my gosh, did I feel muscles I have never felt before. I have her video, which is also great. I really have to admit, I thought this would be just another diet book and exercise thing, but it helped me so much. I also liked in her book how she encouraged you, with paragraphs that said if your 10lbs or 20lb or 30lbs etc. over weight this is how long you should expect it will take for you to loose the weight and inches. A great book, I have bought quite a few for my friends that wanted the same results I got. I felt like Joyce the author and I became friends she just knows how to relate to you in a matter that makes you really want to give it a try, and it's not a long program so you will have the time to do it. Good Luck!"},{"Title":"Bottoms Up!","review":"Following the birth of my second child, I thought I will never get rid of this extra weight. It was hard with the first but this time I really put it on in the hips and thighs... My friend is a personal trainer and she said get this book.. I stuck to the work out and within weeks I had lost a total of 6 inches and can see the difference. For women who are frustrated with empty workout promises buy this book. You will love it...."},{"Title":"Bottoms Up!","review":"This is a GREAT book. I would only caution that if you are obese that no you won't be physically sexy within the In 24 Workout Hours, but you will be more sexy mentally since the program will change your attitude. And if you're one of those people whop gets easily discouraged you need to realize that she teaches a tough lifestyle choice, that if you stick with it for a couple of weeks you will see results.I personally like the emphasis on healthy heart and stronger bones from the weight bearing exercises that weights provide. And her ideas WORK! And have been proven by reputable independent sources like medical and sports fitness experts, to WORK.She also has an excellent website under her name, where you will discover she is for REAL. She was FAT and got FIT. So it isn't as if she was 10 lbs overweight and needed to lose some weight. But a woman who realized that eating right and getting the physical workout is what was needed. Now her weight and fitness fits her body frame.And she sure proves that being over age 50 doesn't mean you have to look OLD and flabby!"},{"Title":"Bottoms Up!","review":"I had bumpy fat all my life, even when I was thin (memorable quote from an ex-boyfriend: \\"For a skinny girl, you sure have a lot of cellulite.\\"). I had also tried lifting weights before with no success. In her book, Joyce Vedral has come up with a system that works--it gets rid of cellulite and builds muscle.I used this book to gain muscle & lose 25 pounds of fat, and I ended up with NO CELLULITE. I wore miniskirts for the first time in my life and was proud to show off my strong upper body, too.Then, for eight years, I was dumb and didn't work out, eventually accumulating about 40 pounds of fat. This spring I decided to get my old body back, so I immediately got out Joyce's book and dusted off the weights. Now it's going even better than before, maybe because I didn't completely lose my former muscle. I'm 41 and feel like my metabolism is actually speeding up thanks to Joyce's workout.I'm now 20 pounds from my target weight, but people have already started complimenting me on my weight loss, and I'm wearing smaller sizes than I would have expected. It's the muscle. It improves my posture, gives my upper body a nice V shape, holds in my stomach, and gives me confidence and energy. My butt has practically disappeared and my, um, chest is getting firm and lifting.Joyce doesn't go into much detail on how to avoid soreness. You might want to warm up with about 5 minutes of aerobics before starting, stretch a little when you're done, drink a lot of water, and make sure you get enough calcium, magnesium, and potassium. I do these things and only occasionally have sore muscles, even though I'm working hard and clearly building muscle.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to lose fat and get strong. And it takes only 30 minutes a day!"},{"Title":"Bottoms Up!","review":"I thought a update would be helpful to those trying to make a decision on this workout.After just 8 weeks of doing the workout in this book I feel GREAT. I have NOT dieted with this workout just watching the amount I eat being aware of what I eat. So far my first month I lost 7 1/2 inches, 3 lbs. The 2nd month 7 inches and 4 lbs. I am doing the MAXIMUM plan including the terminator and wild woman exercises she lists as optional. At this rate I should be close to my target after 6 months! The workout is something anyone with 30 minutes a day can do. Having never worked out with free weights I found this approach easy on the mind and body. It took a couple of times to identify and work the specific muscle groups before I could pick up the pace. I am telling everyone I know how good it makes you feel. I use the Nordic Track ski machine and do Tae-Bo for aerobics. This workout provides the strength I have been looking for. It also helps my posture. I am sold! Can't wait for summer (that's a first)."},{"Title":"Bottoms Up!","review":"I love Joyce's books. This workout is tough for beginners but, if you do it regularly, you will not be a beginner for long. At first, I dreaded my workouts, but when I started seeing and feeling results, I began loving them. Now, I actually look forward to them. I have several of Joyce's books and love them all. Joyce is an inspiration to all women who may think they'll never look sexy again."},{"Title":"Bottoms Up!","review":"This book is great because it allows you to work out at home and get great results. The exercises can be modified for women who have never worked out before or for those who have been in great shape in the past and need to firm up! Dr. Vedral's instructions are easy to follow and she even gives modifications for most exercises. Diet tips, aerobic exercises and lots of motivation are included. If you want to work out at home with a minumum of equipment and see great results, this book is a must have!"},{"Title":"Bottoms Up!","review":"I began using this book when I was fourteen and have used it on and off over the past three years. I really like the exercises and format, and working out is fun! The descriptions and pictures are easy to follow. I have had great success on this program. Even when I put down the weights for months at a time, I still saw those &quot;firm, sexy muscles&quot; she talks about. A great workout...even for the younger generation!"},{"Title":"Bottoms Up!","review":"I have always wanted a lean muscular physique, so when I seen Joyce's sculpted body on the cover of the book, I knew I had to buy it. I started this workout a weak, flabby, 170 lbs. at 5'9\\". I've been at it for 2 months now, and I have lost 10 lbs., and 14 inches off my waist, hips, thighs, arms, bust, and calves! Joyce really put a lot of time and research into this book. She has worked with some of the best female bodybuilders in putting the workouts together. I like how she explains why you are doing everything, like supersets, giant sets, etc... I really believe in the methods she uses, and she is living proof that it works! The book is a good read too, and I find myself going back and re-reading sections. The bottom line is results, and this workout delivers."},{"Title":"Bottoms Up!","review":"This book is excellent in that it really makes you loose the fat and get defined, sexy muscles. It's really inspirational because if someone who is 54 and looks that good can do it, so can I. It is a must read!"},{"Title":"Bottoms Up!","review":"I am approaching 60 myself and have lifted weights for a few years. It is impressive that a book this \\"old\\" has such current information and advice for women.Women have a great deal of difficulty overcoming their fears that they will get \\"big & bulky\\" if they lift weights. It is IMPOSSIBLE for women to do so unless they take steroids. Women do not produce enough testosterone to get big and bulky. Steroids increase the testosterone level which allows more bulky muscle to be built when working out. That is why so many male athletes take them.Women -- you will NOT get the trim figure of your youth unless you lift weights. I don't mean machines, I mean free weights. No matter how much you diet, do cardio, aerobics, etc. you will not get the figure of your youth without muscle on your body. What happens as we get older is that we get more sedentary and we lose our muscle tone. The reduction in muscle is what also causes our metabolism to go down.l SO even if we eat no more than before -- we will gain weight. And that usually starts a spiral of overeating because everything seems so useless -- not working.For example: When I first started lifting weights at the age of 56, within a year I lost only 5 lbs but went from busting out of a size 12 to slipping into a size ate. Plus I ate an outrageous huge ice cream Sundae every weekend. The reason lifting weights works is:1. building muscle burns fat -- it is a little more sophisticated than that -- but for this review purpose - that explanation will do. Muscle takes up less room than fat. So if you build muscle and it replaces the fat on your body -- you can stay the exact same weight and become trimmer and go down dress sizes.2. Muscle burns more calories that fat. -- If you build muscle which will replace the fat, you will be able to eat more and still lose weight. In fact you need to eat more if you have been on starvation diets (anything under 1200 calories a day) because your body needs fuel to feed the muscle you are building.The reason starvation diets do not work in the long run is that, since you are consuming too little calories to sustain your body -- your body starts consuming itself for energy -- in particular fat but most critically muscle. SO you lose the weight, you are thinner but you don't look that great but OK and then you go back to a normal diet. Now, because you have lost so much muscle, your metabolism has dropped and you gain back the weight very fast and usually more because you don't burn as much as before when you had more muscle. Furthermore as you gain this weight back -- if you are not lifting weights to restore your muscle the weight comes on as fat and that makes you look even fatter than you did before you started all this starvation diet cycle, even though you are the same weight as before you started your starvation diet.The author of this book has these principles down but she does a good job of disguising that what she is really having you do is build muscle. That way she doesn't scare off the ladies, That's why her program works.She takes one approach to nutrition; there are others. They all support th conversion of fat to muscle and all its benefits. You should chose the nutritional approach that appeals to you -- that is because if it appeals to you -- it is right for your body. There are too basic approaches -- one is high protein \\"high\\" fat -- the most extreme version is identified with Atkins but there are healthier ways to do it. The other is to have a 40-40-20 split in each meal of 40% of your calories coming from protein, 40% of your calories from carbohydrates and 20% coming from fat. Whether you are a \\"protein\\" person or a \\"carbohydrates\\" person, you have to find out for yourself. This book advocates the 40-40-20 split. The only caveat to all of this nutrition info is that protein counts only if it comes form animals or fish: beef, chicken, pork, fish milk cottage cheese, etc or you can buy whey or casein protein powder -- which are proteins that come from milk (sometimes egg whites are in there as well. No Soy protein or any of the other non-animal proteins the US Government with the support of the medical profession so wrongly advocated for over 30 years. They now admit that they were wrong. Their analysis that consuming products with cholesterol will build cholesterol in your blood and body was also proved wrong. So embrace that steak, those ham and egg breakfasts -- you will look better, loose weight faster and be healthier. (It is possible to build muscle with a vegetarian approach but it is extremely difficult, needs careful monitoring and nutritional supplements. -- The nutritional supplements are necessary for a pure vegetarian approach any -- that is if you eat no fish or eggs or dairy -- which are variations on so-called vegetarian diets -- but if you are on one of those you are OK -- just get your macronutrients: Protein, Carbohydrates, Fat, in line.)And don't forget to lift those weights!!!BTW -- all of the above apply to men too -- so heads up men -- if your wife follows these approaches and you don't -- you will find she will be gone for a younger man -- which she will get, because older women who are in shape are very, very sexy !! :-)"},{"Title":"Bottoms Up!","review":"I am a &quot;firm&quot; believer in Joyce Vedral.

The others are great too. This book will be in my house for a long time to come."},{"Title":"Bottoms Up!","review":"I originally bought this book in 1993. It opened up a new world for me. Before \\"Bottoms Up\\" I only heard \\"Aerobics...aerobics...aerobics\\" for women. I learned so much from Joyce Vedral. To this day, I remember the upper body routine and use it on occasion.I wanted a break from my fitness DVDs and it's been far too hot to run outside. I had lost my copy years ago and I reordered it so that I could review the lower body workout.I forgot how much I loved this book. Joyce gives so much background advice about working out and explaining concepts. The photos, of course, are outdated. There are a few lower body exercises in here that I don't do because I baby my knees...overall the book is even better than I remember it.If you are just learning about weight training or want to review proper form and technique, I highly recommend this book. I don't follow the program as written, I have just been using this on my strength training days.Such a good book. Sometimes old school is the way to go."},{"Title":"Bottoms Up!","review":"THS IS A GOOD BOOK. SHE GIVES YOU GOOD EXERCISES, HOWEVER, I THINK THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE MAIN POINTS AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH CHAPTER (WITH BULLET POINTS) WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE IT EASIER FOR THE READER RATHER THAN HAVING TO READ THROUGH EACH AND EVERY CHAPTER TO GET THE MAIN PONTS OF EACH CHAPTER."},{"Title":"Bottoms Up!","review":"I recommend this book (or any of Joyce Vedral's books)to everyone! I used to be a size 11-13 back in high school, I had lumps of fat on my back, huge cellulite covered thighs, flabby arms, and a doughboy belly. I still follow her weight lifting programs today and now I'm a size 4. People I've met after high school never even believe i used to be fat. Her routines are hard but effective, so if you're not willing to put in some effort, this is probably not for you. However, it gets easier and easier as you get used to it. I love the fact that you can do it at home (even in my very tiny apartment) and you can get it done fast. The eating plan is easy, healthy, and effective as well...you never go hungry. Trust me, I have tried every fad diet along the way (south beach diet, raw food diet, fit for life, the zone, starving, slim fast, etc.)I just ended up fatter in the long run.

It's great, efficient and ...well in a month's time you'll hear my results!"},{"Title":"Bottoms Up!","review":"THIS PROGRAM IS VERY EFFECTIVE. HOWEVER IT IS JUST TO LONG. IT TAKES ME AT LEAST 2 HOURS TO DO THIS PROGRAM. I SIMPLY DON'T HAVE 2 HOURS. I CAN MANAGE UP TO AN HOUR. I CAN, IN SOME CASES, EVEN SQUEEZE IN A FEW EXTRA MINUTES. BUT A PROGRAM THIS LONG BECOMES BORING. AND BECAUSE OF ITS LENGTH I COULD ONLY DO IT ON THE WEEKEND (FRIDAYS, SATURDAYS, AND SUNDAYS) OR DURING MY VACATIONS. HAD I KNOWN WHEN I BOUGHT THE BOOK THE LENGTH IT TAKES TO PERFORM THE EXERCISES, I MAY HAVE SKIPPED THIS BOOK/PROGRAM ALTOGETHER. I DON'T KNOW WHY JOYCE, AND SHE ISN'T THE ONLY FITNESS INSTRUCTOR WHO DOES THIS, CLAIM THAT HER PROGRAM IS SHORTER THAN IT REALLY IS. THAT IS VIA THE BOOK. SHE ALSO DID THIS SAME THING IN HER PROGRAM \\"THE FAT BURNING WORKOUT\\". THAT PROGRAM CLAIMED 20 MINUTES. IT TOOK ME ABOUT 45 MINUTES. UNLESS YOU ZIP THROUGH THESE, EXERCISING LIKE A MAD, CRAZY PERSON, THERE IS JUST NO WAY YOU ARE GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS PROGRAM IN GOOD FORM. AND I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT EXERCISING USING WEIGHTS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DONE SLOWER SO THAT YOU DON'T INJURE YOURSELF. AND I HAVE NEVER READ, OR HEARD ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY. I SKIPPED READING THE BOOK AND WENT STRAIGHT TO THE EXERCISES, SINCE I HAD ALREADY TRIED HER \\"FAT BURNING\\" PROGRAM. TO THIS DATE I STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN THROUGH THE BOOK. AND BY THE WAY, I BOUGHT A COPY OF THIS BOOK WAY BACK IN \\"1993\\". SO IN FIFTY WORDS OR LESS: UNLESS YOU HAVE A LOT OF TIME, FIND A PROGRAM THAT IS SHORTER OR JUST AS EFFECTIVE.

I like the concepts she uses, and I do apply pyramiding to some of my routines, but some exercises (as she says in Bottoms Up) you'll find you can pyramid, and some you can't. So true!I also liked the VERY sensible nutrition plan, but 'Bottoms Up' I think is a much, much more comprehensive book on fitness and nutrition than 'Now or Never'. She goes into much more detail on both topics. I wish I had gotten this one first!Ah well - they're both good books, just if you're a beginner, start with Bottoms Up! If you're looking for a challenge and want to add a wollop to your workout - get Now or Never. :)But all in all, I really like Joyce Vedral's book so far, and plan on checking out 'Hardbodies' she co-authored with Gladys Portuguese :)"},{"Title":"Bottoms Up!","review":"Those other reviewers are probably people that helped write the book. I had to search all over to find the right instructions to each exercise. Some of them were so complicated I couldn't even do them. I'm in pretty good shape but how can you sit on a bench holding a five pound weight with your feet and lift your legs up without falling backward? Plus there were too many exercises for one workout. I think you could spend much less time and get better results. Joyce says that these workouts take thirty minutes but it took me an hour to get one workout completed. (That's how long they are) The only good thing about this book were the pictures. But that's a given that in a weightlifting book that you need pictures. The other thing that I didn't like about this particular fitness book was the eating plan the author had set up in the book. Come on guys! We all finally know that pasta and starches are not going to make you thin! They'll just add more insulin to your body which will turn into fat and therefore make it much harder for you to to burn the fat you already have!...But back to the book. Joyce should have done her research more carefully and made the instructions easier for us readers...."},{"Title":"Asking for trouble","review":"He had a gilded youth, and it carried over into his preisthood,He had a powerful impression on young people who met hm"},{"Title":"East Anglia: A Novel","review":"The combat scenes are realistically frightening.

Examples - plants for specific soils, deer-resistant plants, hedge and windbreak plants, groundcovers for both sun and shade, dry shade, moist shade, and the list goes on.The bulk of the book focuses on individual plants (Trees, Shrubs, Roses, Perennials, Annuals, Climbers, Bulbs, Rock Plants, Water Plants). Each section of plants is categorized by size (Large, medium and small) and then by color of the bloom. A color photo of each plant is provided as well as a brief description, size, exposure needs, zone, etc. A page number reference refers to a more in depth description of the plant in the back of the book.Beautiful and plentiful photos, thick glossy pages and a wealth of information make this a reference that you can browse for hours.

I am a landscape contractor and can attest to the rich information and pictures inside. Although, I wouldn't recomend this bk for the beginning gardener. It has a 'common names' index by which to cross ref backwards with but, if common names are all you are familiar with, this bk may be a bit much to find what you want. However, this bk will tell you if thie plant is evergreen,semievergreen, deciduous, its habit, bloom time, hardiness zones,Hight & Spread, Light & some moisture requirements, etc. The bk is alphabetized with the genus/ Latin names for a reason. These Latin names are how all plants are traced from their origin and habit, regardless of hybridizing or crossing. A Plant may have several common names regionally or for marketing purposes, but will always have the Latin name to trace its' origin. This is why you will see alot of bks with Latin names intead of common names. This bk is a must for landscapers and horticulturists.

This one - the Plants and Flowers book - should be viewed as a very comprehensive plant type, size, zone, and technique book - all of which provide the book's context mentioned below - while the A-Z guide really is more like a traditional encyclopedia and is heavily focused on individual plant entries. Much of the same material on plants can be found in both books, but this one structures the entire volume into a gardening context, while the A-Z guide provides more detail on individual plants (as well as coverage of more plants and varieties).Even a relatively advanced gardener is unlikely to need the additional plants coverage in the A-Z guide, as many cannot be easily found. The reason a number of people end up buying both is that the additional depth of material in the A-Z guide for plants found in both books can be helpful in special circumstances. Naturally, some avid gardeners simply enjoy the additional botanical detail also.This is a superb book for extended study and planning.

However, it has some minor flaws.Not enough effort was made to look at the issue from a Persian perspective as well. Thus it has a Western bias. E.g. Alexander is referred to as the 'Great' yet Cyrus is deprived of that title. From an Eastern perspective Cyrus created a civilized and fair empire while Alexander killed and destroyed.The author claims that the motives for the Persians freeing the Jews were purely economical and for empire building. Yet the bulk of evidence indicated that the reasons were infact humanitarian.Also the author claims that the religion of Iran at the time was dulaistic. This is also doubtful as they believed in Ahura Mazda (= The Wise Lord) as the creator of all things."},{"Title":"Empty Nest Cookbook","review":"I was really happy to find out about this book.

Besides relating dozens of stories of real gunfights the author acutally gets inside the head of the gunfighter and tries to figure out what made him tick. The reader learns for example that it usually wasn't who drew the fastest that won the gunfight but rather who had the greater nerve and time enough to aim.It's also amazing just how many shots were fired in the typical gun fight. And how many of those shots usually missed their mark. A testiment to just how much nerve and steadiness entered into the equation. I found the details such as where bullets hit and what types of guns mankillers preferred and why to be invaluable.I highly recommend this book. It's a good read with lots of information that's been compiled with hundreds of footnoted sources."},{"Title":"The Gunfighter: Man or Myth?","review":"THE GUNFIGHTER MAN OR MYTH is a surprisingly complete look at the wild west. He goes beyond a study of gunfighters to the various bodies of lawmakers, the vices, guns and much more.On the subject of lawmen he covered the history and some adventures of the Texas Rangers, the Pinkertons, and the U.S. Marshals.The cowboys, cattle drives and the Texas Longhorn cattle were examined.Mr. Rosa had short essays on some of the prominent gunfighters from both sides of the law. Among those were the Earps, Wild Bill Hickok, John Wesley Hardin, Ben Thompson, and \\"Mysterious Dave\\" Mather.Another fascinating subject was the handguns that were so instrumental in the life and death of a gunfighter. He explored the manufacturers and the models they sold. What was even more interesting was the individual modifications some of the shootists used for safety or to enhance the use of their gun. He also addresses the reasoning for some of carrying more than one pistol.Among the myths that the author dispelled was the quick draw. It wasn't a normal part of a gunfight. Situational preparation and \\"deliberation\\" were under-rated factors. On page 180 Mr. Rose wrote; \\"Legend has made all the shootists appear much better shots than they were. But there can be no doubt that some of them were great pistol men.\\"This book not only accomplishes the goal of separating the gunman from the myth, it educates the reader on other relevant topics in the life of the gunfighter. Also helpful are the footnotes to sources and the Index.I recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Gunfighter: Man or Myth?","review":"This book was such a pleasant surprise. I expected it to be just a \\"thin\\" myth-busting account of gunfighters but it is actually a beautifully written account of the western culture from which gunfighters appeared. It is extremely well-written and anyone who is interested in the West should enjoy it immensely. As a professional photographer, I have had a fascination with ghost towns of the West since the late 1960s and this book has greatly increased my understanding of those towns in their heydays. Surprisingly, the book doesn't really spend too much time on gunfighting itself. I found another review here to be a bit baffling when it says that the book goes into endless details about who shot whom, where they were shot, which gun they used, etc. I have to wonder if they actually read the book because that's not a good description of it at all. This book doesn't glorify or demonize gunfighters. It explores the culture that produced gunfighters. It puts them into the context of their times and, as such, is a wonderful historical account of the West itself, not just gunfighters. Being a voracious reader, I can say that this book was a complete surprise to me. Rosa is an outstanding and insightful author. It's ironic that an Englishman was able to best put western culture into context. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in history even if they have no interest in gunfighters."},{"Title":"The Gunfighter: Man or Myth?","review":"Only one returns. At least, that's the way it always used to be on Saturday afternoons at the movies here in Marblehead, Mass. about half a century ago. Television kept the tradition going a bit longer, and then there was Clint Eastwood. Yup. Nope. Well, it turns out that all this was pure mythology. Joseph Rosa did some excellent research back in the 1960s and came up with the ultimate book on the subject of guns and gunfighting in the Old West. Despite Hollywood, most of those gunfighting heroes, were, not to put too fine a point on it, pathological killers. If they lived, it was because they didn't hesitate to kill in situations where they felt threatened. Men with some qualms about taking human life usually lost their own. Fast draws ? Showdowns in the main street lined with those hitchin' posts and false fronted saloons ? Forget it, that almost never happened. Still, Wild Bill Hickok, Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, and many others whose names are written in American legend did exist. Perhaps the reality was neither as pretty or as irreproachable as the legend. They often consorted with the bad guys and definitely with ladies of ill-repute.If you happen to be interested in the 19th century development and manufacture of various brands of pistol, THE GUNFIGHTER is certainly your book. It's all in here. You can also read countless stories of the many gunfighters, lawmen, and semi-heroes who fought (and usually died) in the bad old days. Gunfighting cowboys or sheriffs over 30 must have been a rarity. Of course, nobody had heard of testosterone in those days. Gunfighters appeared in the cattle towns in Kansas, in mining towns like Tombstone, and wherever cattle barons clashed with settlers. Rosa concentrates on Kansas and Texas, but the phenomenon existed all over. I feel that Rosa got lost in a galaxy of details. He can and does tell you the story of a hundred famous gunfights, of who killed whom, in what part of the body he was shot, and with what weapon. What is missing is a wider view of history, any connection to the rest of the world or the rest of America. He frequently compares the reality to the movies and dime novel fantasies, which I appreciated very much, but he cannot seem to decide whether he is a local historian or one who wants to put the whole subject in the context of American history and culture. THE GUNFIGHTER falls between the cracks. Anyhow, if the topic interests you, I doubt if you can afford to ignore Rosa's work."},{"Title":"The Gunfighter: Man or Myth?","review":"The Gunfighter: Man or Myth?, by Joseph G. RosaJoseph G. Rosa lives in Ruislip, England and is the author of a biography of James Butler Hickok. He believes his detachment from local influences in the US allows a more accurate assessment of the wild West era. This 229 page book has fifteen chapters, and a Bibliography and Index. The \`Introduction' says the Western gun fights had the image of a \\"lone crusader who fights evil in order that good may prevail\\" (p.vii). The gunfighter emerged from the American wild West, although Australia, South Africa, and other new countries had similar violence and lawlessness (p.viii). Thousands of novels and movies all presented legends that became history for most people. [No explanation why people wanted to believe in a hero.] Only Hickok and Masterson led lives that resembled their legends (p.ix). Others, like Wyatt Earp, were the result of fiction. The \`Acknowledgments' list the people and Public Libraries who helped him.Chapter 1 discusses \\"The Gunfighter Legend\\", how dime novels and early movies created these legends for an audience that loved them (p.6). Few western pictures are better than those of William S. Hart (p.7). Tom Mix made his flashy suits into people's idea of what a cowboy wore. The gunfighter and cowboy are characters fixed in American folklore (p.12). Chapter 2 tells about \\"The Wild West\\". Some of these stories formed the basis for countless western movies. Ordinary common folk, small ranchers and farmers, settled the West. Chapter 3 tells how life on the Frontier influenced later history. Revolvers were a very useful tool. The story of \\"The Bad Man\\" is in Chapter 4. Many large landowners hired gunmen to halt small ranchers and farmers, as in the Johnson County War (p.53). [Many western movies of the 1930s used a version for their story.] The common people had established laws and courts against robbers, thieves, and killers (Chapter 5). The number of homicides in the five principal cowtowns were far less than fictionalized accounts (p.64).The real cowboy spent his time working with cattle, not as a crack shot (Chapter 6). He wore a flannel shirt and a bandanna, not the fancy tailored shirt and pants of a stage cowboy (p.70). Saloons served cowboys and cattlemen for business and pleasure (p.75). Chapter 7 writes about \\"Policing the Cowtowns\\". It's a lesson about law, politics, and the economy. Increasing numbers of settlers put an end to the trail-cattle industry. Railroads in Texas loaded cattle to market. Chapter 8 discusses the characteristics of \\"Man Killers\\". Chapter 9 tells about famous gunfights such as the \\"OK Corral\\" and other lesser known ones. The personalities of gunfighters are described in Chapter 10. Most were good mixers and married. They all would kill when provoked (p.162). [Note how often these gunfights are associated with drinking and gambling.]Chapter 11 discusses the rival products in revolvers. Colt's version was not original but the most practical. The Walker Colt's performance in the Mexican War made it famous. The 1873 Colt was more rugged and reliable (p.177). Skill with a pistol alone did not guarantee success in a gunfight (Chapter 12). Bat Masterson tells about skills (p.181). W.W. Greener describes what is needed (p.187). Chapter 13 says the \\"fast draw\\" seems to be a modern idea (pp.197-198). Chapter 14 tells about the developments in bullets and holsters during this era. A flap on top of a holster gave maximum protection to a pistol. People's ideas of the Old West come from fiction (Owen Wister, Zane Grey, Ernest Haycox, Clarence Mulford, and \\"Max Brand\\"), movies, and television (Chapter 15). \\"High Noon\\" can't be \\"the finest Western of them all\\" if the climactic scene \\"would never have happened in the real West\\" (p.210). The Western movie is popular in Japan, Spain, Italy, and Germany (p.211). [Did they suffer from an aristocracy and military-industrial complex and like to see ordinary people win out?]So why did popular Western films die out? Was it the result of fewer horses and increased costs? Was it the result of the censorship of movies that dealt with working people's concerns and their right to keep and bear arms? Television successfully competed for audiences in the home."},{"Title":"The Gunfighter: Man or Myth?","review":"For newcomers into the study or sheer pleasure reading into the history of our American Western heritage (1830 to 1900), don't pass this one up or any of Joseph Rosa's writings.

Even worse, if there's no way to clean up a line in translation, he simply leaves it untranslated. Take this example from poem 16:You read of those thousand kisses.You deduced an effeminacy there.You were wrong. Sodomites. Furius & Aurelius.Pedicabo et irrumabo vos.While I'll admit, that last line's difficult to translate into English without using slang usually confined only to gay porn, the translator doesn't even have the stomach to attempt it. In my humble opinion, anyone willing to translate everything EXCEPT for the dirty bits has no business translating at all."},{"Title":"Poems (Latin and English Edition)","review":"This is a blisteringly vitriolic, tawdry, funny and love-induced forray into modern poesy. The catch is that it was written by an ancient Roman poet. Although his historical background is a bit sketchy, it is believed that the poet was an established member of Rome's high culture and a son of wealth who had even come in contact with the great Caesar. One would never know this from the bawdy lyrics or the heart-wrenching songs one rarely equates with the unfeeling elite.51Godlike the man whosits at her side, whowatches and catchesthat laughterwhich (softly) tears meto tatters: nothing isleft of me, each timeI see her,...tongue numbed; arms, legsmelting, on fire; drumdrumming in ears; head-lights gone black.CodaHer ease is your sloth, Catullusyou itch & roll in her ease:former kings and citieslost in the valley of her arm.As is evidenced in the above selection, Catullus was one of the great love poets of his or any age. These often beautiful and forlorned sentiments were mostly written for \\"Lesbia\\", a woman believed to have been married to a diplomat or some man of high rank whom Catullus never fully ensnarled with his wit and passion but seemingly had a long-tryst and/or tumultuous affair with.But just as soon as you think that Catullus is E. E. Cummings you are shocked into the realization that this man was as multi-faceted and prone to \\"juvenilia\\" and sensationalistic raunchiness as say a Bukowski or Ginsberg.88What, Gellius, of the manwho itches with sister & mothernaked in night-vigils,who 'lies-in' for his uncle,what stain does he lay on himself?Such, that not Tethys to far limitsno Ocean, father of Nereids, can cleanse:no fouler brand (Gellius)even supposingone were to lower his head to his own loinsand swallow himself.Just as well he could be straight-laced and political and silently thoughtful in the same way as he was exuberant and confessional.93Utter indifference to your welfare, Caesar,is matched only by ignornace of who you are.102If, Cornelius, we entrust our secretsonly to those whom we know we can trust,here is Catullus,devoted to secrets & secrecya finger ever to his lips,as mute as Harpocrates!Another aspect of these translations by Peter Whigham, as witnessed above in \\"51\\", is the tendency to modernize the poems and language. \\"head-lights gone black.\\" is one such example. Some scholars(http://www.classics.und.ac.za/reviews/94-2whig.html) say this is to their detriment as are Whigham's liberties with words being fitted to his artistic credo moreso than the original Latin texts. I'm no scholar, but have read several different translations thought to be more true to the original Latin and I must say that they are tedious and rubbery bores. They hold none of the lively magic or smart humor of the Whigham translations. To read the others is like reading Nietzsche by any translator other than Walter Kaufmann, you lose a bit of the modern scholarship and interpretation and lively poetry for stale accuracy's sake.This is one of the few books I have used to excess, marking, creasing and breaking the spine open searching and re-learning these invaluable and poignant texts. Behind Jeffers, no poet other than Catullus is revered more by me."},{"Title":"Nether-World","review":"Nether-World is a book for more than just role-players. It details the pathos of a less-fortunate earth, and makes all too understandable the apathetic and corroded society thereon. The artwork in this book is perfectly suited to its core of moral decay, and brings an eerie life to the pages. As far as roleplaying goes, there is no better system available for personal preference in making characters or designing quests and campaigns. The system is sensible and easy to learn, and provides an outlet for anyone's tastes. I highly recommend this book to new roleplayers along with the old pros.(Legal Disclaimer) I am in no ways affiliated with Darkforce Games or any of its employees.

Powered by anti-gravity \\"spindizzy\\" devices, whole cities have taken to the stars, where they wander from planet to planet looking for work. These stories focus on the city of New York and its mayor, John Amalfi.I have made the commitment to read this series because of its reputation as an SF classic, but I haven't enjoyed a single one of them yet. The episodic nature of this book weakens it as a novel, but at least it helped to keep me reading, since none of the stories on their own are strong enough to sustain a book-length treatment. These stories feature extraordinary amounts of dull exposition, as well as the nave infatuation with extraordinary, god-like intellectuals that is so common in Golden Age science fiction. Amalfi treats other human beings as pawns, even sacrificing their lives as he sees fit. Now, I have no trouble believing that a man in his position might find it necessary to do terrible things in order to protect his people, but it is incumbent upon the author to deal with the moral implications. Blish ignores them completely, treating each triumph as merely another victory for the clever Amalfi. Blish also fails to convey the sense of New York as a city with a population of millions. We really only get to know three characters and they serve primarily as mouthpieces for Blish's theories of history and economics."},{"Title":"Earthman, Come Home","review":"There are several ways that shorter fiction is converted into novel length fiction. Sometimes the author revisits a single shorter work and broadens it and gives it greater depth. Sometimes the author will take two or three shorter works and add on sections which strengthen the link between the shorter works as well as attempt to add some depth. The last method is that a very minimal amount of effort is put in to correct any inconsistencies and maybe provide a couple of links. Unfortunately, it was the last method which was used here. Don't get me wrong, Blish's Okie stories are well worth reading, but if you have read the original versions you aren't going to get much out of reading this novel.\\"Earthman Come Home\\" by James Blish is a loose attempt at taking the four original Okie stories and putting them together to form a novel. The result is a novel which lacks real character depth or much character development, and serves pretty much as a collection more than as a novel. The original four stories are:\\"Okie\\", a novelette length work which was first published in April of 1950 in \\"Astounding\\". This story jumps right into the middle of the Okie saga, and the reader learns about the main characters (Mayor John Amalfi, Mark Hazleton, and Dee from Utopia) quickly, as well as about the relationship the Okies have with the planets as well as the police, and the importance of technology and resources to he Okie cities. In this story the Okie city is entering a system with a serious, if not critical, need for resources only to find two inhabited planets who hate each other and each of whom are add odds with the Earth police who don't want the Okies around. The Okies are forced to play a dangerous game in pitting the different sides against each other in order to obtain what they need, and eventually are forced to flee adding to the list of violations for which the police want to fine them.\\"Bindlestiff\\" is a novelette length work which was first published in December of 1950 in \\"Astounding\\". This story picks up with the Okies having fled into the Rift, a near starless area of space which is uninviting, but which may help them escape the pursuing Police. There they witness a Bindlestiff (an outlaw Okie city) destroying another city in an attempt to steal a key piece of technology, a fuelless drive. The Okies try to find some of the survivors who may hold the key to the technology on a planet which is part of an isolated star system which is passing through the Rift. There the race is on to find the survivors before the Bindlestiff arrives, and the resulting conflict forces some desperate measures to fulfill a contract they make with the natives, wipe out the Bindlestiff city, and escape to the far side of the Rift.\\"Sargasso of Lost Cities\\" is a novella length story which was originally published in \\"Two Complete Science-Adventure Books\\" in the spring of 1953. In this story the Okies escape the Rift only to find a very large \\"jungle\\" of Okie cities desperately trying to survive as the Acolyte system exploits them after an economic collapse has rendered the Okie resources almost valueless. In this story we learn about the politics between the Okies as well as one of the Okie legends which may well threaten Earth. We see how Mayor Amalfi carefully pulls strings to manipulate the police, the other Okie cities, and Mark Hazleton to try to save his dying city as well as all of Earth, and still manage to keep free from the police.\\"Earthman, Come Home\\" is a novelette length story which was originally published in \\"Astounding\\" in November of 1953. In this story the Okies head to the Greater Magellanic cloud to avoid the police, just as the most notorious city of all had done so long ago after their incredible crime on Thor Five. This will be the last landing of the Okie city, as age and lack of repair have finally taken their toll on their old city from Earth. Here they look to find, and then find a way to destroy the criminals from Thor Five without suffering the same fate.These are wonderful stories, but this effort at novelization simply does not work. The small amount of added material cannot make up for the essential writing differences between a novel length piece of fiction and four shorter fictional works. Treat this book as an anthology, and it will be easy to do as the jumps occur between some of the chapters and are easily spotted."},{"Title":"Earthman, Come Home","review":"\\"Earthman, come home\\" is the third in James Blish's classic \\"Cities in Flight\\" Space Opera quartet, written about fifty years ago, which consists of1)They Shall Have Stars (Cities in flight / James Blish)2)A Life for the Stars3) This book, \\"Earthman, Come Home\\"4)A clash of cymbalsThis series tells a \\"future history\\" epic, covering 2,000 years, in which machines called \\"Spindizzies\\" could lift not just starships, but entire cities, through space.

Mand and William Whipple III, AMACOM, 2000.As an attorney practicing corporate law in Delaware, I have been involved in many acquisitions, mergers, divestitures, etc., and have an understanding of the imperative for all companies and businesses to increase shareholder value. &quot;Partnering for Performance&quot; is the first book that I can recall reading which provides a lucid explanation of how a company can do so. The discussion is enlivened by numerous real world examples, as well as by an engaging dialog between the CEO and CFO of a hypothetical company.The book goes on to sketch the wide range of activities that are conducted under the Finance umbrella, and offer suggestions as to how the value of these activities can be enhanced. There are two key thrusts the author recommends, which in many companies will require a significant culture change:* Finance people must rethink their roles, and make the transition from functioning as analysts and controllers to &quot;Shareholder Value Enabling.&quot;* The business people and finance people in a company must work together as equal partners, otherwise known as &quot;Partnering for Performance.&quot;Drawing on their considerable experience as financial practitioners, the authors do not merely advocate such changes in principle. They also explain the obstacles to implementation, and offer solid suggestions for achieving the desired changes. The suggested game plan includes new roles and responsibilities for business people and finance people alike, demonstration projects such as overhauling the budget process, the integration of talented finance people into business teams, incentives for change, communications and training, and sample diagnostic tools (such as a corporate troubleshooting guide).In sum, &quot;Partnering for Performance&quot; offers valuable insights about a low cost, low risk approach to increasing shareholder value. The book should be of considerable interest and value to a broad audience."},{"Title":"Partnering for Performance: Unleashing the Power of Finance in the 21st-Century Organization","review":"Mand and Whipple do an excellent job describing how finance, business centers and top management can work together more effectively for optimum performance.

This little volume, however, retains a special place in my book collection since it was my first O'Hara and my first poetry book.

Terrific, fun, funny, exciting, moving poetry."},{"Title":"Lunch poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"The best collection of poetry written after World War II that I am aware of, &quot;Lunch Poems&quot; brings together the high culture and low culture. O'Hara was known for hanging out with the '50s elite of celebrity and progresive painters, musicians, and actors. Yet he also had an affinity for walking the streets of New York alone at lunchtime or evening, befriending vagrants, observing day to day work and the diversity of metropolitan life. His poems are witty, profound, insightful, original, inspiring, and always unsettling the reader with his unusual observations about life. O'Hara is incredibly literate and knows his poetic heritage, but through &quot;Lunch Poems&quot; he remains intenseley aware of his present and the importance of what goes on around him. Between musings on Charles Baudelaire, Billie Holiday, Arthur Rimbaud, and Miles Davis, one gets the sense of a rootless, absorbing man in love with New York City, art, poetry, daily life, and transcendent experience."},{"Title":"Lunch poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"Hello my literate friends.I want to tell you something. This is a book of poems and I should not be writing a review for it. It is famous everywhere except here, and we are here. But I will tell you what you should know to buy this book. That is my job. Now that we have that clear.These poems are beautiful and good. They are also talky, which is a word my friend Mark Halliday uses, which means that they might sometimes seem close to prose. They are called Lunch Poems because that is the idea, poems that you might compose on your lunch break, walking around New York with some change in your pocket, if you are Frank O'Hara. They seem silly sometimes, and they are, but they are not meaningless: they convey a voice which is suitable and believable and honest.I think you will like this book.I will tell you a secret: in my copy of this book, City Lights has increased (somehow) the font size, or the kerning or whatever, so that some lines run-over onto the next. In the original version this did not happen. This is a minor detail that I want to tell you about because you deserve to know. City Lights if you are reading this: hello, and, please fix it.Thank you."},{"Title":"Lunch poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"Frank O'Hara's reputation seems caught in a holding period, an awkward stage preliminary to his work becoming universal and timeless.Consider, for example, the final scene in the opening episode of the second season of \\"Mad Men,\\" the cable TV series set in the world of advertising as practiced in New York in the early 1960s. We see the show's protagonist, Don Draper, picking up a slim volume of O'Hara's poems (\\"Meditations in an Emergency,\\" 1957). He recites the final lines from \\"Mayakovsky.\\" There is an ambivalence to the scene. Was the O'Hara poem chosen for its intrinsic merit, or was the O'Hara name used as an easy marker for the zeitgeist (the same way the show's producers highlight the period-specific cut of Draper's suit and hair and attitudes)? With friends like these, when will O'Hara escape his confinement to the mannerist ghetto of the \\"New York School\\"?And so some readers may pick up \\"Lunch Poems\\" (first published in 1964) after seeing it praised as an emblematic cultural document of mid-twentieth century America. Yet even if the time-bound aura of O'Hara is the come-on, what makes you stay enthralled is his voice -- a \\"thinking\\" voice as vitally American as Whitman or Frost.There are 37 poems in \\"Lunch Poems\\" and their quality as well as their accessibility varies. The poems span a period from 1953 to 1964. This book is not a \\"best of\\" O'Hara collection, yet it does contain what may be his most durable poem.A few of these short pieces are so recondite that they lose me. In a few others O'Hara raises an opaque scrim to suggest beauty beckoning from the other side, and these poems begin to \\"click\\" only after multiple readings. But the majority of the poems are freshly-minted coins granting immediate access to a lively, urbane worldview. While general knowledge of the New York cultural scene in the '50s and early '60s is helpful, these poems, at their best, easily communicate to us in a way undimmed by the passage of time.The poems are populated with the poet's friends and lovers, with artists and musicians, and with the conversation of meals and parties. Here are O'Hara's travel experiences and his love of foreign languages (you could write an essay on the myriad uses of French in O'Hara's poetry). The man wears his erudition lightly on his sleeve. He's enamored of both high and low American culture: \\"I am ashamed of my century for being so entertaining but I have to smile\\" (\\"Naphtha\\", 1959). Another poem from the same year, \\"Rhapsody,\\" contains a premonition of O'Hara's early death a few years later: \\"I historically belong to the enormous bliss of American death.\\"Most delightful is his man-on-the-street reportage that spins off in all directions. A typical bout of intense observation occurs in \\"A Step Away From Them,\\" which begins: \\"It's my lunch hour, so I go for a walk among the hum-colored cabs.\\"In what I think are the best of the poems, the cityscape serves as a platform for accessible philosophizing. An enduring example is \\"The Day Lady Died.\\" Is there another poem where so much meaning resides in its title? At first glance the title rattled me. In it I heard a rhythm, but an uncertain one. Then I hit upon the answer: simply reverse \\"Day Lady\\" to reveal \\"Lady Day,\\" the nickname of blues singer Billy Holiday whose dark night of the soul ended in 1959. The displaced \\"day\\" (her missing day) had to be displaced (had to go missing) from O'Hara's title. The text of the poem recounts the day the poet walked the streets and avenues of Manhattan attending to errands. These everyday pleasures come to a halt when O'Hara spies a tabloid newspaper's front page announcing Holiday's death at age 44. It is the day after death, the first of many days fate denied her.In the poem's final stanza O'Hara recalls once hearing Holiday perform at the Five Spot Caf&eacute;, and here the poet accomplishes a wonder. He turns death into something other than displacement and omission. Memory overpowers death, conjoining time present and time past."},{"Title":"Lunch poems (The Pocket poets series)","review":"Leonard Lopate, a regular on the public radio station WNYC, was inspired by the BBC series and associated bookA History of the World in 100 Objects.

As NYU professor Lytle Shaw, author of the bookFrank O'Hara: The Poetics of Coterieexplains: 'Lunch Poemsis a condensed and highly accessible book that is smaller than a subway map.' That feature makes it easy to take the book anywhere. Shaw described it as having the potential to 'acclimatize you to the things New York has to offer.'\\"Well, the listeners have a point; there is much about New York in this wonderful collection, but frankly I came for the guidance, but stayed for the beauty.

I am writing this review to aid those out there to decide whether they want to ante up their rent money to buy these books or not.I have this book and I am currently working on the Grant Avenue vest. I have the original Scottish Campion yarn, bought years ago before it became worth more than its weight in gold. A couple of notes--I bought the proper yarn amounts in Campion as stated in the instructions--enough to knit the largest size listed. Owing to having the loosest gauge in the world, I am knitting the SMALLEST size so it won't be a circus tent (remember to KNIT YOUR GAUGE SWATCH!!!) So, in theory, I did all the necessary prep and am knitting to gauge. Despite this, I ran out of one color of yarn (Brass). This distresses me because if I had been knitting a larger size, I could have been totally sunk. I was lucky in that Shetland Spindrift color Old Gold is a dead ringer for a substitute.In searching for substitute yarns, I came upon several online charts. About 3/4 of the Campion colors have Spindrift equivalents, but some do not. A specific example is Delph, heavily used in this vest. The suggested color is Cobalt, but since cobalt is also used, in this case, the substitute won't work. Another way to make up colors is to watch for them on eBay, which can also cost big bucks. In this specific case, AS has actually posted a kit with pattern for the Grant Avenue vest at [...], so if I didn't already have the materials, I would have bought the kit.Lastly, This book is patterns only--NO TECHNICAL INFORMATION. So you need to know how to work with steeks, do fairisle stranding and cable work already, have references you can use or an experienced knitting buddy to guide you through.So, I can say I am glad I have this book. I love it. I will use it and knit from it. If I was starting from scratch--well, I MIGHT buy it. More likely I would use the money at virtualyarns to buy a kit with a pattern. That would be a lot easier that trying to make these designs up with substitute yarns or bankrupting myself trying to find the original yarns. As much as I love this book, there are so many great projects out there from cheaper books. So, if you are a Starmore junkie, go for it. If you are just curious, find something cheaper."},{"Title":"Pacific Coast Highway","review":"This oop book is another in the series of large format paperback knitting books by Alice Starmore. Her artistry with wool is reknown amongst knitters and admirers of all kinds of textile art and craft.Ms. Starmore, and her apprentice, daughter Jade, take colorways directly inspired by landscape and natural items and then blend them into fairisle type colorwork sweaters or textured Aran fisherman knitted pieces.The Pacific Highway recalls the colors along California's glorious coastline and the shapes and feel of the sea and shore. It's hard to pick a favorite, but I like the Abalone for its uncanny impression of shimmering nacre (how DOES she do this in matte wool?) and everything Jade designs (I love her shaping and bold colors.)The only caveat about these books is that not only are they out of print and very rare, but the yarns are often out of production. However, if you do find a copy, with the help of color charts and some guessing about gauge of wools, you can often recreate the model and make an heirloom garment to wear or give as a treasured gift."},{"Title":"Pacific Coast Highway","review":"I acquired the Starmore books in real time, not knowing they'd sell for hundreds on EBay.

I've seen Pacific Coast Highway sell for 600 dollars US.If you can see a copy, you'll find lovely, timeless designs, gorgeous detail and fit with a winning color palette. It is definitely worth learning to substitute yarns."},{"Title":"Pacific Coast Highway","review":"Another glorious Alice Starmore book. What makes this one special is not only the amazing photography, with large pictures that show the finished product from multiple angles, but also intricate charts and helpful hints on finishing. The patterns in other knitting books look dated. You can pick up a book and recognize a 1980's sweater immediately. Starmore's sweaters look timeless. They could have been made at the turn of the century, or the turn of the next century.She also has an excellent color sense. Many other books have good patterns, but the examples are made with the ugliest color yarns imaginable (\\"Latvian Mittens\\", \\"Ethnic Socks and Stockings\\", Zilbourg mitten and sock books, etc). Starmore chooses colors that really do lend themselves to the sweater pattern. These definitely are heirloom sweaters.My only regret is that Amazon does not show the pictures of finished products (especially to spend that kind of money for a pattern book sight unseen). If you are lucky, it will show the table of contents, which does you no good on this kind of book. If we could insert images into this review box for others to see scanned snippets, that might be helpful in a pinch.If you have an account, you would be wise to look at the finished products of these sweaters on the Ravelry website (where you can find errata as well). Then you can decide if you wish to take a 2nd mortgage out for this book.ps.

I thought 8 of the designs were nice or OK, but not special enough to knit - such as the somewhat unoriginal texture-work of Golden Gate and the impracticality of the Grant Avenue vest. The book had 4 patterns that I would love to knit, including a children's sweater, a truly striking women's colorwork cardigan, a gorgeous blanket, and the textured unisex sweater \\"Irish Beach.\\" 4 of the patterns were not really appealing at all.Some of the designs fit the models rather poorly, and thus the knitwear wasn't really showcased as well as it could have been. In addition, some of the sweaters were knit very long which was rather unattractive (in my opinion) and could be much improved simply by making them shorter. However, in general there were lots of photos so you could really tell what the finished pieces look like.The book contains Starmore's usual (in my opinion) easy to follow instruction and the very readable charts of her recent publications. The charts are large enough that I don't think enlarging them is necessary.Overall, this isn't Starmore's best work, but if you can afford it, it's certainly a nice addition to your knitting library."},{"Title":"Pacific Coast Highway","review":"Every book I have by Alice Starmore is more beautiful than the next.

It's a shame that Alice Starmore yarn is no longer made but Jamieson, Rowan or Simply Shetland are good substitutions.I wish there were more hours in the day so that I could knit every project in this book.

The humor comes from the fact that the American family that buys the ghost along with the mansion takes him as being real and apply to him all the possible modern techniques to improve his life and make his sojourn in the mansion untroublesome for the new inhabitants. It is also funny because two young boys play all kinds of tricks to the ghost and there is no end in their creativity. But the story is also a little bit sad because it reveals the ghost has become a ghost when the brothers of his wife, whom he had assassinated, took vengeance and starved him to death. It also reveals that the ghost can be redeemed if love comes along and frees him of his misery and fate. And this love will come from the young daughter of the American family. She will naively open her heart to the suffering of the ghost and thus free him of his lot. This also shows how the attitude of the English owner of the mansion are just not interested in the suffering of the ghost, whereas the Americans will take this ghost seriously and will try to understand him and give him solace. Beyond the humor of the tale there is the tremendous belief that suffering can be solved.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan"},{"Title":"The Canterville Ghost and Other Stories","review":"This is a short book with a few short stories.

The two longer stories in this Dover Thrift - \\"The Canterville Ghost\\" and \\"Lord Arthur Savile's Crime\\" - are scathingly funny, with well-turned sarcasms in every second phrase. The former is not so much a tale of the macabre as a satire of American pragmatism jousting with British maudlin antiquarianism. The latter is an exercise in \\"reduction to absurdity' applied to the philosophical humbug of Fate. Nobody ever recognized Humbug as readily as Oscar Wilde. Nobody ever penetrated the Ark of Human Vanity more sacrilegiously, only to discover the mummy of a fool. But make no mistake! Wilde is utterly serious in his scorn for humanity. Had he been just a little less clever - a little less convinced of the futility of serious endeavors - he might have been the greatest statesman of his time. Solve any of mankind's grievous cares? How utterly boring!Here's a bonus for readers with an appreciation for the Wildest ironies.

On the front cover the number &quot;365&quot; is printed in black and barely shines through the wrapper appearing as a ghost underneath the title.

This is the second time that I have read this book, and I love it as much the second time as I did the first. Time has not diminished the capacity of this book to entertain the reader.The book has a wonderfully intriguing plot. What would happen if one were to have the opportunity to relive one's life after death? That is exactly what happens to Jeff Winston, a forty- three year old man who is trapped in a stale and loveless marriage with a dead-end job as the icing on his personal cake.In 1988, Jeff has a fatal heart attack and wakes up in 1963 as his younger self, an eighteen year old college student. After his initial shock wears off, he realizes that he remembers what the future holds. Using that knowledge, he goes about trying to improve his life the second time around, only to die again at forty-three and have to replay his life, over and over.Along the way, Jeff tries to correct his mistakes in judgment and develops a new perspective on life. He also discovers that he is not alone in terms of the ability to replay one's life and finds a soul mate who shares a similar fate. Jeff ultimately discovers true love, romance, adventure, and a deep appreciation of life itself. This is a wonderful book that will keep the reader turning the pages. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Replay (French Edition)","review":"\\"Replay\\" is a book that hits directly in the middle of a universal fantasy: \\"What will you change in your life if you were able to do it?\\" I think there is no one, that at some point in his/hers life, hasn't wondered on this question.I feel that that is why this book is such a compelling reading.Jeff dies suddenly of a heart attack at age of 43 after living an unsatisfactory life, but instead of going to Heaven or Hell or Nothingness he awakes at his college dormitory when he was 18 years old. First he is almost driven into madness (as it will occur to you or to me). Then little by little he is able to gain control of his new life and starts an amazing trip.However when he reaches 43, he dies again. Is this the End? Of course not, it's a new start. He is launched, and the reader with him, into a seemingly endless quest.Ken Grimwood, (unfortunately dead) has constructed a novel that dwell with fundamental questions as: Which is the meaning of life? Are our actions inane? Is love attached to a person?He broods on ethics, responsibility, altruism, selfishness, fatherhood and vocation amongst other significant issues.So, is this a philosophical and boring book? No, not at all! It's a fast paced gripping and thought provoking novel! It earned his author the World Fantasy Award in 1986.Just one more detail: take a careful look to one of the Replayed Lives that depicts what kind of world may arise from a ruthless America and remember it was written in 1986 way before the more dreadful recent events.Have a nice reading!Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"Replay (French Edition)","review":"This book is a true example of a hidden treasure.

Sedentarization is shown to be associated with the process of food system intensification.Nomadization is the process whereby a group of people gradually adopts a nomadic mode of existence. Nomadization is linked to the process of food system abatement.In order to understand the processes of sedentarization and nomadization, the impact of the physical environment on the food systems must be explored. There are several environmental influences.The first influence is the climate and geology. The most characteristic feature of the Middle East is the summer droughts. It also develops the most extreme temperatures, alternating between some of the coldest temperatures on earth and very hot, dry weather. This results in evaporation and water shortages. There is also a close proximity between deserts and fertile lands.The second influence on the food system is topography and hydrology. The rivers in the lowlands and piedmonts resulted in irrigation agriculture. In places where there is little rain, moisture-maximizing dry-farming techniques are employed. This is also mixed with pastoralism, or raising sheep and goats on nearby mountain slopes and desert pastures. The topography and hydrology also affect two patterns of migration involved in food production: vertical migration (transhumance) and horizontal migration (plains). Transhumance is the seasonal movement between lowlands to highlands in search of pasture. Horizontal migration involves nomads who have to move longer distances in search of water and pasture for their animals. However, these strategies do not operate independently of each other. They often work in cooperation with each other.Thirdly, plants and animals influence human mobility. Certain types of plants require yearly attention and is not conducive to nomadization. On the other hand, pasture animals are more mobile. Camels are used because they are able to travel distances without much water.There are three structural mechanisms that play a part in dealing with the environment: tribal organization, political allegiance, and shared ideals.Tribal organization is important because to belong to a particular tribe meant to belong to a social entity which specialized in or had control over particular natural resources or areas of subsistence. In rural households, the process of sedentarization tends to be directly promoted by the policies and actions of the political powers. Nomadization is often a form of resistance, or a form of natural response by the rural population to the exploitative undertakings of the urban elites."},{"Title":"The Art of Critical Reading: Brushing Up on Your Reading, Thinking, and Study Skills, Annotated Instructor's Edition","review":"I had to purchase this book for school and was rather impressed in the stories they use as educational exercises.

If you have a general interest in the Porsche 356, and are looking for a nicely illustrated tour of the various models, this book could be the foundation of your Porsche library. For those restoring a car, it is likely insufficient, but even at that dirt-under-the-nails level of work there is much useful content here.The 356 series effectively launched Porsche as an independent automaker. From the original Gmund cars -- handbuilt in what had been an Austrian sawmill -- through the Pre-A, A, B and C versions, the 356 was developed and improved over time. The first thing you're likely to want to know, as a new Porsche enthusiast, is how these differ and why. Meredith provides ample detail, and spices it with enough commentary to keep it all from becoming a snooze. The photography is not comprehensive, but is representative: you will know what a Pre-A looks like relative to an A, and you will have some idea as to the changes made.It misses the mark slightly once you are past the basics and want to know, for example, what the boot would look like in a properly restored 356A, or how the A bumpers changed over the years. For the newcomer, not all that important. But for restoration, that level is warranted, and you won't find it here.I should compliment the author on the back sections, with production numbers, engine specs, color combinations and a running calendar of model changes. While I have found the colors section to be incomplete -- will someone please have a go at reproducing the color samples/codes in the format of a car brochure? -- the amount of information is impressive and useful. Similarly, the Restoration section is an accurate and sobering walkthrough of a near-basketcase car, highlighting the many places a 356 is susceptible to rust (hint: the whole car, except for the fabric roof...)The bulk of the book concerns the Pre-A and A, but this is appropriate because most development took place during the 1950s, the era of those models. The chapter on the Carrera versions is especially good, perhaps the best of the book.Original Porsche 356 isn't a coffee table book, and not a extensive history of the company. It is a beautifully printed (at least the Motorbooks hardcover edition I have), straightforward and concise overview of the cars, which is hugely educational and -- for those engrossed in the minutiae -- fascinating. For those less into the details, it is eminently skimmable.Very much recommended."},{"Title":"Epistemology: An Anthology (Blackwell Philosophy Anthologies)","review":"I've already reviewed the Kim and Sosa anthology in contemporary metaphysics, and I have much the same verdict on their anthology in contemporary epistemology: this, to the best of my knowledge, is the single best anthology of contemporary philosophical work in this area for advanced students of philosophy. (That, of course, isn't to say that there isn't a better anthology in epistemology; there are simply far too many philosophy anthologies for me to know that with any certainly.) The virtues of this anthology are considerable. Its coverage of most areas is broad, the readings have been carefully selected from the contemporary classics of the field, and it touches on the most of the central areas of research in contemporary epistemology. Furthermore, this anthology is packed with papers displaying the virtues of good analytic philosophy: patience in explaining the nature and importance of the issues, precision in exposition and description, clarity and honesty of argument, and carefulness in analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of various positions.The reader should know that this is emphatically not a historically anthology--they don't even include a selection on skepticism by Descartes! Since these are all contemporary readings, this anthology isn't a place to go for knowledge of the epistemological views of the great philosophers. Nearly every election is from the last fifty years, and a good many of them are from the last twenty or so. So the focus of this anthology is on the sort of metaphysics that is being done in analytic philosophy right now.The subjects covered include, inter alia, the following: skepticism, the analysis of knowledge, justification, foundationalism vs. coherentism, naturalized epistemology, externalism vs. internalism, virtue epistemology, and contextualism. The aim of the individual sections on each of these questions isn't to provide a synoptic view of the positions in these areas. That, of course, simply couldn't be done in an anthology of this sort. The aim instead is to give the reader a sense of the positions defended in this area, to provide her with the outlines of a couple possible positions on each of the issues, and to give her the background to enter into the contemporary literature on the subjects.Now, it may seem that there are some obvious lacunae in this list. Where, for instance, is coverage of rationalism and a priori knowledge or of the problem of induction? It is, of course, true that more could have been added to this anthology--but that's going to be true of any anthology. I doubt it's a major problem here, though, as it seems to me that you'll have no problems engaging with most of the literature in contemporary epistemology if you've mastered the material covered in this anthology. And it seems to me that this is the role that an anthology of this sort should play--providing the reader with an entry into contemporary literature in the field.But while I think this is an ideal way to introduce oneself to the contemporary literature, the reader should know that this isn't an anthology filled with introductory material by the editors themselves. Most of the sections begin with only a page or two of introductory material, and those few pages are expected to both introduce the basic issues in a few paragraphs and relate the readings included to the basic issues and to one another. It's not clear to me that much more than this sort of brief introductory material is necessary here, though. First, as is often the case in philosophy, many of the basic issues discussed don't need much motivation since they can be stated in a few words and since they concern questions that, on their face, are quite straightforward and simple. But there is more to it than that. What seems most important is that the subject matter of most epistemological worry is pretty narrowly focused. For epistemology is really concerned with a small number of very basic and interrelated questions (viz. Can we know anything? And, if so, how can we know it? What is it to know something?), and so it's possible to see most all of these selections as engaged with a limited range of general issues. Moreover, it is possible to see general connections between the different subjects here since many of the positions discussed are motivated by a concern with rebutting skepticism. In fact, the structure of anthology mirrors the structure of epistemology from Descartes to the present day: we begin with challenge presented by skepticism, and we go from there. The anthology begins with a section on skepticism, and it's possible to see almost everything thereafter as involving an attempt to deal with skepticism and what it shows us about our knowledge of the world. Many papers discuss how the skepticism is formulated, why it seems plausible, why it goes wrong (if it does), how we can meet the skeptic's demand, or why the skeptic doesn't really present us with a challenge.Naturally, this material is going to be helpful for people working in other areas of philosophy, as epistemological issues turn up everywhere. Skepticism and responses to it have a role to play in every area of philosophy, and so understanding the material in this anthology should be helpful if you're going to study just about anything in contemporary philosophy. But, unless you already have some background in contemporary philosophy, this is not an anthology I'd recommend for someone beginning study of the subject. While some of its selections should be accessible to anyone with an interest in this subject, many of them technical and philosophically sophisticated. Since many of these selections are journal articles or selections from book-length treatises on the issues, the authors often assume that the reader is coming to this material with a thorough grounding in the aims and methods of contemporary philosophy. So, before you try to tackle most of this anthology, I'd recommend reading an introductory text in contemporary epistemology or at least doing some coursework in related areas.This is an ideal anthology for courses surveying contemporary metaphysics that are aimed at graduate students and advanced undergraduates. The only drawback is the fairly high price, but this book is certainly worth it if you're interested in this area of contemporary analytic philosophy."},{"Title":"Epistemology: An Anthology (Blackwell Philosophy Anthologies)","review":"Sosa and Kim's text is a guide through the most influential and provocative articles in philosophical epistemology.

Arriving back home they throw him out in spite of his warning that he is the West Wind and will return just one time. His return is in the form of a gale force wind that destroys their house. Not only that but the West Wind stops the rainfall into the valley; the farm dries up; the three brothers move to the city. They use some gold that they have to become goldsmiths but spend the profits instead of using some to buy more gold for smithing. The younger brother treasures a gold mug with a face imprinted on it. They tear it away from him and toss it into the kettle to be melted down. Then they leave. The youngest brother hears a voice from the kettle and realizes that it comes from the face that was on the mug. He is asking to be fished out. When the brother does this, the gold face becomes a head and body and sprouts arms and legs and struts about as a dwarf. This is the King of the Golden River. As a reward for the boy's kindnesses he tells the boy the secret of how to turn the river to gold to make himself rich.- - That's all I will divulge. - - There is a moral, of course. This tale is short and delightful; written as present for the young girl who later becomes his wife."},{"Title":"King of the Golden River","review":"The brothers Schwartz and Hans seem to have it all - a rich valley in the mountains that provides for them handsomely. But, instead of being happy and generous, the brothers are mean and miserly. And when they mistreat Southwest Wind, Esquire, his curse brings about their downfall. They have a younger brother, Gluck, who is everything that his brothers aren't, and his goodness definitely brings its own rewards.John Ruskin (1819-1900) was an English Renaissance Man, who was highly influential in the Victorian era. This book was his only work of fiction, but it is quite good, with a charming story and a firm morality. Also, part of what makes this book interesting is that it was influential on later writers of Fantasy literature, making this something of a pioneering work in the genre.I highly recommend this book. It's definitely one that should be read by the young, and the young-at-heart!"},{"Title":"King of the Golden River","review":"This is an amusing if slightly odd story. I guess that Ruskin considered himself such an intellectual jack of all trades that he'd a have a go at the genre, if only to say he'd done it.The story is built from familiar parts. There's a Cinderella theme, built around a young boy and his two cruel brothers. There's also a theme of the wandering stranger who, after being treated well or poorly, rewards the doer equally well or poorly. In fact, that was such a cool idea that Ruskin threw in two magical beings quite independent of each other, making the front and back halves of this little creature look like thay came from two different animals.It's a pleasant enough fairy tale, but not one that I'd spend a lot of time hunting down.//wiredweirdPS: This reviews a different edition of the story, apparently not listed at Amazon.

It's a pity, because when I finally stumbled across it, Browning went from being just another 19th-century poet to my favorite English language poet of them all, at one fell swoop. The Ring and the Book is based on a real-life murder trial in 17th century Rome. The story is told from multiple perspectives, changing with every new section of the book; we hear from the &quot;Man on the Street&quot;, the murderer, the victim on her death-bed, and even the Pope. The details of the story are far too convoluted to explain in summary and do anything resembling justice to the book, but it can be safely said that once you've begun, you're in for a whirlwind ride through a carnival of a trial that makes the O.J. Simpson affair look like a parking-ticket dispute by comparison. The truly stand-out feature of The Ring and the Book is not in the story itself, however, but in the telling. Browning handles the English language like a virtuoso emulating angel's choruses on a Stradivarius. If the book suffers any single flaw, it is the simple fact that at times, Browning writes these lines almost TOO well, making it difficult for the reader to pay attention to the actually progression of the story, as said reader becomes entraced by the beauty of the poetry. (In particular, I consider Caponsacchi's description of the flight from Arezzo beginning at line 1152 of Book VI to be one of the best written passages in literature of all time.) Dramatic blank verse hasn't seen genius of this level since Milton wrote of the angelic Fall. It's a pity this book isn't more widely recognized and discussed, for it deserves recognition as one of the best-constructed poetic stories of history, and the pinnacle of 19th century authorship."},{"Title":"The Ring and the Book","review":"I've just read some Amazon reviewers' responses to T. S. Eliot's poetry as testimony to his possibly being the greatest poet ever. Such an evaluation practically proves Eliot's insistent point about the cultural impoverishment of the present.Indeed, Browning's masterwork may very well be the ultimate poetic epic in the English language, rivaled certainly not by Spenser, Wordsworth, and Pound but only by Chaucer and Milton. The fact that even the \\"trial of the century\\"--the O. J. Simpson case--did not produce widespread renewed interest in its literary predecessor and equivalent would produce surprise and disappointment were I not so aware that, outside of Shakespeare, the academic canon has been foreshortened (and engendered) to a tradition that begins with Virginia Woolf and ends with Sylvia Plath.In \\"Ring and the Book\\" Browning takes the sordid event of an enraged husband murdering his helpless bride--the daughter of a prostitute and rescue project of a priest--to \\"explain the ways of God to man.\\" The reader of the poem becomes, in effect, a \\"privileged\\" juror in the trial of the murderer, positioned through Browning's protean and powerful rhetoric within the consciousness of each of the principals before finally being enabled to glimpse the \\"truth\\" that affords meaning to human mutability and suffering.The poem no doubt will remain in dust closets, largely unread even by literature Ph.D's. But there's little chance of its ever becoming lost. Like the priest-hero of the poem, a few priests of the imagination will ever so often make the poem's discovery and be lured into the quest of pursuing its singular meanings.[A reader recently wrote asking me about this edition, which led to the discovery that Amazon often uses the same review for any and every edition! (Be careful about ordering used editions for the same reason.) I was referring to the Penguin edition, which is now out of print. Beware of the \\"Kessinger Edition,\\" which is really no edition at all but a bootleg, an uncredited reprint. Moreover, it's the version that a search of the title is apt to take you to. You might try the Collins and Altick edition on Broadview.]"},{"Title":"The Ring and the Book","review":"Fascinating novel-length poem exploring the various sides in a real life 16th century Italian murder trial.

He's an engaging, well-drawn character, but what happened to the other protagonists from the first book? I would have liked to follow them as well.The book is completely from Claiborne's perspective, including his feelings about secession and the Confederate flag (which some modern readers may find disconcerting, but which seem historically probable) and slavery. Some of the secondary characters -- Olivia, Minter, Henshaw -- show promise, but vanish disappointingly; Minter, a main antagonist, is hustled out of the story in an expository section, and it's not clear whether Henshaw survives to the end of the book or not. An African-American point of view would have made a good counterpoint, but unlike in the first book Poyer does not give us one, and Ker's servant Romulus seems more a stereotype than a person.Battle and action scenes are very strong throughout. The plot moves fast and grips the reader, and most of the sentence-level writing is vivid, with some striking images. Despite my reservations about the handling of secondary characters, I enjoyed the book very much and recommend it."},{"Title":"A Country of Our Own : A Novel of the Civil War at Sea","review":"Excellent novel about the Civil War at Sea. David Poyer's research and knowledge, coupled with his ability to capture personalities and frame events is unmatched. I've been in the Navy for 38 years, and have never found a better writer about issues relating to the Sea."},{"Title":"A Country of Our Own : A Novel of the Civil War at Sea","review":"I came to this after reading James L. Nelson's latest novel, &quot;Glory in the Name,&quot; so there was some danger in getting too much of a good thing. Both books are about the naval fronts of the Civil War, but that is where the likenesses between the books begins to end. This is solid good stuff, and it's obvious that Poyer has done his homework. If you like Nelson's book, which squeaks out this one by just a nubbin because of Nelson's great sense of humor, you will probably enjoy the further advntures of Custis Claiborne in this book."},{"Title":"A Country of Our Own : A Novel of the Civil War at Sea","review":"This sequel was much more enjoyable than the first. Mr. Poyer settled down and eased up a bit on the nautical jargon. I'm anticipating the third book with relish. I want to know what happened to Hank, Minter, and Minta!"},{"Title":"A Country of Our Own : A Novel of the Civil War at Sea","review":"I have read all three in the series and it was a long drawn out struggle to finish. Poyer displays his great knowledge of events, sailing, and personal drama. If you are not a nut for detailed sailing and weak drama, then you may not like this book and series, because action is lacking. I have also read James Nelson Civil War Naval books and enjoyed them. This series is boring at times and had me flipping pages until something interesting occurs - it could be alot of pages.This is civil war naval stuff - a war that is not known for much naval action, except for a handful of events. As you can guess, our heroes hit all the main events, that is one event per book. The first is Sumter, then Raiders, and finally Hampton Roads.The series appears to have stopped. Likely because it is hard to keep anything interesting going. The only thing left to cover is river battles. At the used prices, I got what I paid for and an OK read."},{"Title":"A Country of Our Own : A Novel of the Civil War at Sea","review":"This book is a follow-on to Poyer's first book on the Civil War, \\"Fire on the Water\\". In that book, Poyer introduced us to a large cast of characters; in this book he follows basically one of them through the end of 1861, while leaving you in some suspense as to what the other characters are doing or what's happened to them.The character that the author decides to follow is Ker Claiborne, the Confederate officer who was one of the main characters in the first book. At the end of that novel he joined the Confederate Navy, and in this book he winds up first as the executive officer of one Confederate raider, then the commander of another. That's the main part of the book: Claiborne fights various battles against the Yankees, and he and the other characters think about, but don't discuss much, the issues that have started the war.This is one of the strangest sequels I've ever read. Since the first book has so many different characters, it had multiple points of view, and that made things interesting. This book is much much more narrowly focused. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's a change, and I can't figure out why he did it. On the other hand, there's one thing that he did that I liked. Typically, in Civil War fiction, you get two stereotypical characters. First, you have the reluctant rebel. He typically is pro-choice on the issue of slavery, i.e. he won't own slaves himself, but he thinks that Yankees shouldn't be invading his country to force emancipation on others who own slaves. The second stereotype is the Yankee abolitionist, who of course is always portrayed as a religious fanatic, an unsavory character, and usually some sort of hypocrite. No one on the Southern side is ever portrayed as a fanatic of a lunatic; instead, they're victimized and reluctant to fight.While the main character fits the first stereotype pretty well, the second one isn't here. Instead, the fanatic turns out to be a Confederate who's basically a lunatic. He wants to kill all the Yankees, and has all of the requisite silly Southern prejudices that were held during the era: gentlemen will put the \\"rabble\\" to flight at first sight, Yankees are only good merchants when they cheat everyone, breeding makes a man a better person, etc. You instinctively despise him, and of course he's the villain of the piece.I enjoyed this book, at times, though there is the large issue of the characters other than Claiborne. I am looking forward to the third book, in which he apparently reintroduces most of the characters from the first book, while following Claiborne also."},{"Title":"Whistles Across the Land: A Love Affair With Trains","review":"Book title is \\"Whistles Across the Land: A love affair with trains.\\" Since I am the first to review this book I am here to offer more information for the buyer to use in consideration of their purchase.

I got this \\"classic\\" version when it was the current version (1993). I learned with it and used it and never needed another Kanji dic.After becoming proficient with Nelson, I raced some friends with Wordtanks (an electronic dic). We tied. So this isn't the fastest method, but it is so much more complete than the Wordtank. Someone should test Nelson against an updated electronic dictionary, as my test was done in 1996 and electronics might be really good now.Nelson is big and heavy, so don't plan on lugging it around campus or bringing it with you on your travels.The pages are pretty thin so you won't want to make notes in it. The font is small so if you have bad eyesight you might think twice or get a mag-glass. These two \\"deficiencies\\" allow a LOT of information. There are tons of combinations here. Unfortunately, it's not all of them - and the best writers have a tendency to get creative with Kanji, so you still might not find one or two combos you would like to see. Nelson includes old and obsolete characters as well.If you are a casual student, Nelson might be overkill.Finally, it takes practice to learn how to use a Kanji dictionary. Here's how Nelson is used (There are complete lessons in the book):First, determine the radical of the character. Nelson gives a lesson on how to do this, something like \\"all radical, only one radical, left, right, top, bottom, NE, SE, NW, SW,\\". It's tough until you get used to it, then it becomes second nature.Second, determine the number of strokes in the radical. Again, there's a lesson how to do this. It is easy to do and you have to know it if you ever want to write.Third, find the section number based on the number of strokes in the radical (section 5: five stroke radicals). It is easy to find as the number is printed in large text in the top corner.Fourth, find the section with the correct radical. A list of all radicals with 5-strokes is listed vertically on every page of section 5. They are in character order, and the current radical is circled. Flip pages until you find the right one.Fifth, now that you are in the section of the character's radical, count the number of remaining strokes in the character. If there are 10 more strokes, go to the section 10 under the current radical.Finally, scroll down the section until you see your character.It's easy, but you do need to get used to it. Thing is, you will need to go through a similar process for any Kanji dictionary, so don't be discouraged.On the other hand - Nelson presents other ways to find characters. For example, if you know the sound of the character, you can look it up in the sound index, which will point you directly to the character's location in the book.In summary, I have never seen a better Kanji dic, but it will take some time to figure out."},{"Title":"The Original Modern Reader's Japanese-English Character Dictionary: Classic Edition (Tuttle Language Library)","review":"Below are some of my thoughts on kanji dictionaries. First of all, if you intend to study Japanese for more than a couple of semesters, you really ought to invest in one of them. Don't waste your time with a compact dictionary. I relied on one for two semesters trying to find words that weren't in there. It was very frustrating. Personally, I don't care about speed. I want it to be easy for me to use and worth my while when I arrive. My recommendations reflect these priorities.Second, you should know that the deeper you get into Japanese, the more kanji dictionaries you'll need. I've been relying on Nelson's for years, but at some point I began needing more. I have an electronic one (good for using while traveling on the train, etc.), dictionaries in my computer (great for copying and pasting characters into it), several Japanese (kanwa) dictionaries, and some Chinese character dictionaries. The one dictionary I use the most I actually do not have--Morohashi's Dai Kanwa Jiten. I'll keep using the library copy until I can come up with $500+ for it.Third, find the dictionary you like to use. You may not like the Nelson dictionaries I recommend. No problem. Some of my friends swear by Halpern's. See the excellent reviews others have written for each of these before you make a decision.(1)The New Nelson Japanese-English Character Dictionary*If I was starting out again, I would get this one.PROS--------+ Many kanji compounds+ Useful glosses for characters and compounds+ In my experience it has more compounds than the original Nelson dictionary+ Standard look-up system (knowing this will help you with Japanese dictionaries too--I sometimes have trouble finding characters, probably because I am more used to the original version)CONS--------- Minor changes in the glosses from the original, and sometimes with useful information removed(2)The Original Modern Reader's Japanese-English Character Dictionary: Classic Edition (Tuttle Language Library)*I use this one at home, because when I started, the New one wasn't available.

However, it is abridged, hence my reviewing the original Nelson dic, since I use it at work, in a university library, where it is the (only) available version. Some (ok, most of) the rare characters and combinations you need when using Japanese at a certain level are precisely the ones cut out of the abridged version.I must however confess that I do not -of course!- know all the character combinations included in that abridged dictionary (!), almost a match to the hardcover unabridged editions, if one does not intend to study classical texts...That said, and just like the title of this review implies, I consider this dictionary (or these dics, so to say) the best ever made.Other users detailed perfectly the method to look up a character, so I won't take your time for that.I however thought it interesting to compare my experiences with the different editions.First, the classic and revised versions do not differ that much, as far as everyday use is concerned. For some subtleties (i.e. characters with 'more than one key' - in fact characters whose historical key tends to be replaced by another part of the character, normally a key in itself in OTHER characters, but not in that one, but nowadays tend to be regarded as *the* key - for instance, such characters will appear by both keys only in the new revised edition (or only the modern one in the case of the abridged edition), whereas only by the historical key in the original), the differences come in handy, though, in my experience, you only notice them, and their usefulness, when after using the revised edition you go back to the original and one of the (rare) cases an enhancement you made use of without noticing would really be helpful, and you realize it is not there...Besides this redundant key addendum, the new version includes a new ROMAJI table, to look up words according to their pronunciation, with new entries, especially of irregular purely Japanese readings (kun-yomi). It lacks some of the old ON-yomi readings present in the original, however...Like I said earlier, the abridged version is quite extensive, despite the characters and combinations that had to be cut off to make space, and produce a smaller, lighter dictionary.As a conclusion, I would state that:both original and revised editions are more or less worth one another, each one having some assets and flaws the other does not, but, except if you've got the chance to use one (or both) from a library, either one will do for more or less a lifetime.the abridged version tends to be a little short for high-level studies, and for professional use. It is however quite enough, in my opinion, to match most electronic devices, even nowadays, and all any student needs during one's fisrt couple of years or so in college. Plus it is handy when it comes to carry it around...Later on, even when a full edition becomes necessary, I'd suggest the abridged one as a second-in-line reference and in-bag book (mine is therefore quite worn out, I'd tell you)As a final afterword, I'd suggest something else :a nintendo DS and the 'Kanji Sonomama Rakubiki Jiten' cartridge.It is originally a dictionary for Japanese students learning English, but is the travel companion I became addicted to, and the only electronic dictionary to equal and sometimes beat (sometimes only, mark my words, but there it is) Nelson's paper version(s).Actually, it includes a dictionary of definitions, in Japanese for the Japanese, a double entry Japanese-English English-Japanese dictionary, either by hiragana/katana or plain old English alphabet, and, last but not least, makes use of the DS touch screen to recognize the characters!Unbeatable in that aspect!It lacks behind the (complete) Nelson's dics for some old characters, but the Japanese-English-Japanese search is definitely an asset.One might have to get rid off of bad writing habits (when it comes to stroke order, mostly, or to speed -not too fast!) to get the characters recognized, but once you get used to it, it's easy to write a recognizable kanji.Foreign words, without kanji equivalents, are included as well (like 'fouku' (fork) and the likes), those lacking, by definition, in the Nelson's.But, that exception apart, at best, some electronic dics equal the Nelson's, most are usually not as complete and/or convenient (except for their weight) as them, many remain, even nowadays, quite lame compared to the Nelson's dics, and none beats them.Therefore, the Nelson's dictionaries remain a must for any Japanese afficionado having to learn, study, or work with characters!"},{"Title":"The Original Modern Reader's Japanese-English Character Dictionary: Classic Edition (Tuttle Language Library)","review":"This is the original kanji dictionary a lot of us who lived in Japan in the late 80s and early 90s used. I've compared it to other Japanese-English Kanji dictionaries, and I still think this one is the most useable (even better than its newer revision). The system for finding radicals and then locating the target kanji works well, and the more often I use it, the more the system becomes intuitive. I've used it for paid translation work when translation engineering documents, for translating martial arts texts, and for composing letters to my Japanese friends. Only rarely do I find that the target kanji is not included.

I love just sitting down and reading a dictionary. I keep one beside me all day at work.After studying Japanese for many years, I realized that I needed a comprehensive Kanji-English dictionary since my level is steadily increasing.Years ago I gave up paper dictionaries in favor of an electronic one. But it's just as hard to look up a kanji in an electronic dictionary as in a paper one; you have to count the strokes or identify the radical. So I've only been using the electronic dictionary to look up Japanese words that I have the reading for or for English to Japanese.So I got the \\"original\\" Nelson only a couple of days ago and I love his system. It doesn't really take all that long to learn, if you take the time to read the appendixes.I believe the reviewer that said that he beat an electronic dictionary.Once you've gotten the system, you can just flip the pages and almost immediately find the kanji.I haven't tried to use the newer version, but after reading these reviews I decided on the original and am very glad that I did!"},{"Title":"The Original Modern Reader's Japanese-English Character Dictionary: Classic Edition (Tuttle Language Library)","review":"I just finished japanese 1 at my college and my instructor suggested this dictionary for japanese 2. so as a beginner knowing very few kanji, i found this dictionary a breeze to use.i have been using this for translating some of my manga and the biggest difficulty is probably counting the number of strokes in the kanji i was looking up; which was a problem with the manga, not the dictionary. even if that is a problem, you can look up the kanji by pronounciation in the back.there are also a lot of cool features in the back: counters, kanji known by certain grade levels, and even history.worth the money."},{"Title":"The Original Modern Reader's Japanese-English Character Dictionary: Classic Edition (Tuttle Language Library)","review":"A friend of mine purchased the nice red cloth bound edition for me as a present back in the early nineties and I foolishly sold it.

Though it is showing its age somewhat, and though it includes a large number of obscure and older kanji which can be a distraction to the intimidated, until someone does something astounding and delves deeply into the language to produce a work like it but informed by current trends, this is it.Purchase with confidence, if you are serious about obtaining a solid reference work for the Japanese language.The only weakness (and not a large one) is that though it addresses the use of a character in the first position, it does not address the use of a character in the second or subsequent postion, as does Spahn and Hadamitzky's also excellent work. To be fair, this would have increased the size of this work and made it a multiple volume affair, so this approach is understandable."},{"Title":"Lessons from the Light: A Spiritual Light","review":"Over the years I have read dozens of books on Near Death Experiences and probably hundreds on spirituality and metaphysics.

It is a book written to transmit needed answers out into the world. It is simple yet profound."},{"Title":"Liberation Theology: An Introductory Guide","review":"The author, Robert McAfee Brown, states that his goal for this book is to bear witness to the extraordinary faith of Latin American Catholics who participate in the Liberation movement (20). He has been, no doubt, successful in his objective. This text is intriguing more for its intent (a \\"call to action\\" for first-world readers) rather than for its main content (an introductory description of Liberation Theology-primarily in Latin America). The reader of this book will find many entreaties to action on behalf of the oppressed peoples of the world, many of whom reside in our \\"backyard\\"-the poor urban areas of North American cities (94). Brown does a commendable job of keeping the topic interesting through the consistent intermingling of real-life anecdotes with theological and historical descriptions. Perhaps the most impressive characteristic of this book is the fact that it reads more like a story than a theological text.In most non-fiction books, there are some areas that stand out more than others. This book is no exception. The introduction, for example, carries several stories of actual people who have suffered horrible atrocities in some areas of Central America. These real-life stories help the reader to understand the type of political, economic, and social oppression that a majority of Latin American people must deal with daily. Accordingly, it becomes more realistic for the reader to understand what a powerful \\"liberator\\" the Liberation movement has become for the lay Catholic in many parts of Latin America. The base church communities that have evolved to support the critical needs of the oppressed are much more than a reflection of a \\"professional\\" theological movement as we might, at first, guess. On the contrary, the roles are reversed. It is these base communities, providing for the needs of people, through which Liberation Theology-the subject-has evolved. So then, Liberation Theology as an academic field, is a mere reflection of how oppressed Christians respond-epistemologically and ecclesiologically-to the institutionalized oppression with which they must deal. Brown notes that \\"It is not enough to read books about poverty; commitment means encountering poor people\\" (56). Liberation Theology, therefore, can only be truly understood and practiced through and with the lives of oppressed peoples.Again, the real value of this book comes in Brown's consistent appeals to his readers for action in support of oppressed people groups. In fact, he even lists steps that we might take to truly \\"practice\\" Liberation Theology even while in the midst of our comfortable, first-world environment (116-120). If the reader is interested, the author's Endnotes and Section on Discussion Questions are both helpful and useful for further research."},{"Title":"Liberation Theology: An Introductory Guide","review":"This is an excellent introduction to Liberation Theology.

Many books don't leave me feeling as educated as this book does.However, having a degree in theology and studying it on my own, I do not agree that liberation theology should exist.

He fails, however, to present the theological evidence for the call to active resistance, political engagement, and violence that is the conclusion one must draw from the unbalanced interpretation of Jesus' radicalism. He is so biased in his own appraisal of the gospel message that he fails to fairly present any altermative view.It can be argued that Jesus did not call for societal activism, but rather individual loving acts, that He did not call for resistance but rightous living, that he did not expect the condition of man to improve (\\"The poor will always be with us.\\") but came to save man's soul instead. Indeed, though He promised persecution and even death for His sake, have the persectution and deaths of so many Latin American activists advanced the plight of the poor more than quiet safe water progams and educational assistance of US Catholic Relief Services for instance. Brown's inability to evenly present this proposition, unfairly influences young minds and greatly impairs this works usefluness. To call it a theological treatise is a mockery of real theological inquiry. Brown would have been better off calling it what it is--a collection of stories about the Latin American roots of Liberation Theology and his own \\"feeling\\" that this is the call of the Ministry of Jesus."},{"Title":"Ayurvedic Massage: Traditional Indian Techniques for Balancing Body and Mind","review":"I really liked this book.

However, for anyone researching the details of chimpanzee culture, this book offers a wealth of insight from a variety of sources.I recommend this book only for those seriously interested in chimpanzees and primate social structure.

Mr. McDonald pays tribute to Gujarati traders/ Banias in the first few chapters by acknowledging their exuberance of speech, inventiveness, and commercial drive. Dhirubhai first displayed his diplomatic and negotiating skills during the Junagadh freedom struggle. At Yemen, he exploits the fact that silver content in rial was higher than the pound. There he also learned the fundamentals of business by taking position in rice, sugar, and other commodities. At India, Dhirubhai progressed to trading in REP licenses and later textile manufacturing. One of Dhirubhai's greatest attributes was that he networked and lobbied furiously. He cultivated several journalists, politicians, and bureaucrats including Girilal Jain, Murli Deora, Yashpal Kapur, T.A. Pai, R.K. Dhawan, P.C. Sethi, Pramod Mahajan, and Pranab Mukherjee. Several policies such as the High Unit Value Scheme were introduced for the sole benefit of Reliance and tariffs mostly for the detriment of competitors like Kapal Mehra (Orkay Silk Mills) and Nusli Wadia (Bombay Dyeing). Reliance was the first to recognize the most important external environment- Government of India. Dhirubhai used the government to destroy Indian Express and Bombay Dyeing. Wadia, Mehra and the journalist Gurumurthy were arrested on fake charges. He is alleged to have tried to get Wadia assassinated through Kirti Ambani and contract killers. Reliance also resorted to envelope journalism and later buying out a newspaper to unfairly cast DMT as inferior to PTA. Dhirubhai is rightly called father of Indian equity cult as he patronized convertible debentures. One out of every four investors in India is a Reliance shareholder. The Ambanis used loopholes, shell investment companies/ tax havens in Isle of Man, duplicate shares, insider trading, and financial engineering tricks to ensure that Reliance was the largest zero-tax company and a pure cash flow operation. Though correctly described as ruthless and daring, Mr. McDonald overlooks that Dhirubhai was an innovative financier, brand builder (Only Vimal etc.), and an industrialist way ahead of his times (vertical integration, GDR etc.)."},{"Title":"The Polyester Prince: The Rise of Dhirubhai Ambani","review":"I bought this book directly from the publisher as it has been banned in India and after reading it is easy to understand why. Ambani's were the most visible business family from India in 80s. Everyone knows that powerful political connections are responsible for the meteoric rise of the ambani business empire. What the book talks about are many issues, which were kept under the carpet and never ever spoken in public. It is a very interesting reading.Anyone who is interested to learn how business can be done in India, especially before the privatization, must read this book. The link between politics and business is very powerful and though it may have diminished a little in today's India, it is not completely gone.I recommend this book to anyone who is trying to analyze the strengths of Indian business environment as an emerging country and wish to do business in India."},{"Title":"The Polyester Prince: The Rise of Dhirubhai Ambani","review":"It can be anybody's guess why the Book didn't get any publicity and got banned in India.

Concerete evidences were destroyed, ruling governments broken and shaken.

Read this book to get an insight as to why an average Indian businessman thinks that one has to take a 'twisted' route to be successful. And why you can't realy blame them - especially the players during license raj. Though Hamish has tried to write a biography of Ambani, this book suffers from a major handicap - most of the 'revealing' things are not backed by the source of that information. But I would recommend this to those who are intrested to have closer look at the wheelings-dealing of politicians, businessmen and the mafia.

Indian Express had published a devastating series of articles about Ambanis' special treatment in the mid-80s. Ambanis may or may not have had a vison.

Not critical enough (Per the book, the author had too many problems while researching his book). This shows, in places, in his choice of words in trying to couch some of Dhirubhai's more outrageous transgressions in the corporate world.Nonetheless, it is one of the most candid books to be published about a mercenary-turned-industrialist, which only a Hamish McDonald can pull off, in the name of being an objective non-Indian, non-partisan journalist.Despite these obvious advantages for McDonald and his book, Mukesh and Anil Ambani got it banned in India, making it worth a read just for its 'notoriety'"},{"Title":"The Polyester Prince: The Rise of Dhirubhai Ambani","review":"The book describes how business is conducted in India.

In his day, Tillich was held in high esteem not only among theologians, but by experts in many different fields for his incredible breadth of knowledge, his insight into culture, and his humanity.'Liberal Protestantism' sought to reconcile the gospel and the Christian faith with contemporary cultural ideas, rather then set the two up against each other. Religion is, for Tillich, the best of culture. (An alternative view, for example, is that of Karl Barth, who saw the gospel as fundamentally a critique of culture - as the Word speaking from outside ~to~ the world, not within the world). So, for Tillich, there should be signs of God everywhere, not just in Christianity, and religion and culture and closely connected.God, for Tillich, is not therefore the anthropomorphized God of the Old Testament, who has a personality and creates and destroys and judges in an almost arbitrary fashion. Instead, Tillich sees God as 'the ground of being'. God is the very fundament on which rests everything that is. God is the Abyss.The problem with man, for Tillich, is his 'finitude'. Man's life is finite, his body makes him finite, his capacities are finite, yet he craves to transcend these, to be unlimited, to be God. This is impossible; rather one should accept one's finitude courageously. This is what Jesus did singularly and perfectly - he never sinned, because he always accepted the finite nature of his being; he faced death courageously. Tillich's christology is therefore a 'spirit christology' (Jesus was led by the spirit) rather than a 'logos christology' (Jesus was God incarnate, the Word made flesh).The last important thing is that Tillich makes use of his famous 'theory of correlation'. This is how the 3 volumes of his ~Systematic Theology~ are set up. According to this theory, things in culture are correlated with the theology; theology provides the 'answers' to the 'questions' posed by culture. So his five sections (divided among the 3 volumes) are called: 'Reason and Revelation', 'Being and God', 'Existence and the Christ', 'Life and the Spirit', 'History and the Kingdom of God'.Tillich's writing is for the most part easy enough to read for the layperson - just don't get bothered by particular tricky bits. I would recommend it to anyone interested in theology; it has influenced a generation of theologians."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology, vol. 3: Life and the Spirit: History and the Kingdom of God","review":"Tillich, in the complete three-volume series on Systematic Theology, addresses the overall problem of meaning and meaninglessness in modern times. Written in the middle of the twentieth century, Tillich's theology is greatly influenced by the intellectual developments of the late nineteenth/early twentieth century philosophies, including such schools of thought as phenomenology (Husserl, Heidegger, etc.) as well as existentialism, and in particular issues such as \`the death of God' philosophical/theological speculations. Tillich's theology is also significantly influenced by (as are the intellectual developments of which he was part) larger historical events such as the first and second world wars. Tillich, a native of Germany, saw meaninglessness first-hand in the trench warfare of the first world war, in which he served as a chaplain. He also saw problems in the rise of the Nazi party, not just for political and cultural issues, but also theological issues (such as the idolatry of the state over God).Tillich, spirited out of Germany during the rise of the Nazi power, spent the remainder of his career teaching in universities and seminaries in the United States. This second volume of his major work in Systematic Theology was produced in 1957, while he was teaching in the United States - it is dedicated to his friends at Union Theological Seminary, where he first taught after leaving Germany.In Tillich's first volume of this series, he discusses the sources of theology as he sees them - scripture (both text and the events behind the text), the overall church history and tradition, and the wider traditions and history of religion in the world. Tillich has a problem with seeing experience as a source, but rather prefers this to be seen more appropriately as the medium through which the sources are understood and analysed. Tillich introduces norms and the rational character of systematic theology - Tillich is in many ways writing for philosophers who have discounted the validity of theology in the modern world; by emphasising the aspects of reason and logic in his system, he carries more weight in that community. Tillich also develops his famous Method of Correlation, a dialectical system of engagement between the temporal situation and the eternal in an ongoing process.Tillich explores the various aspects and relationship of reason and revelation, including ways of trying to make sense in a rational manner of revelations, including what constitutes final revelation. From here, Tillich proceeds with his ontological constructions - one of the keys to Tillich's overall theology is contained here, in which God is the \`ground of being'. Some have accused Tillich of being an existential atheist, because they have heard that Tillich claims that God does not exist - while it is true that, for Tillich, God does not exist, it is not true that there is no God; Tillich defines the term \`existence' as being \`that which is created', and as God is not a created being, God cannot exist. Rather, God is something greater, something deeper - the ground of being. God also becomes the only appropriate \`ultimate concern' (another key element in Tillich's theology) - that concept is developed in that volume as well.Volume two is primarily Tillich's Christology. Tillich has a small section that relates the second volume to the first, and restatements some major points from the first volume, but very quickly jumps into the concepts of existence/existentialism and Christian theology, developing from there concepts of sin and human estrangement (setting the stage for Christ and salvation/redemption in the new being of Christ). For Tillich, the central question of the age is one of meaning, and Christ is meaningful, as a New Being, who has a uniqueness and a universality, but not in typical Christian theological ways.Tillich's third and final volume addresses topics of life in the Spirit, how his overall theological constructs of God as Ultimate Concern and the Ground of Being, translated through humanity's estrangement and redemption through Christ as the New Being, can have an impact on our own lives. Tillich develops ideas of self-actualisation and self-creativity, spiritual presence in faith and love, spiritual presence manifested in historical situations, and the various ambiguities. This is a perfect point at which to discuss dogmatic issues such as Trinitarianism, a problematic construct even for the most rational and traditional of theologies. Tillich concludes with a discussion of eschatology, the idea of \`end-times' (not to be confused with the sort from \`Left Behind' novels) and how the kingdom of God is present in reality past and present. This also approaches topics such as immortality and eternity - Tillich states that Christianity has traditional seen individual participation in eternal life in terms of immortality and resurrection, but that in fact immortality is not a biblical term - it is a Platonic idea taken on board by the church.Tillich's theology is continued in two other volumes, the first volume produced in 1950, and the third volume in 1963, a few years before Tillich's death in 1965. Taken together, the three volumes represent a major theological force in the twentieth century, and one that is bound to continue to have impact for generations to come."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology, vol. 3: Life and the Spirit: History and the Kingdom of God","review":"This final volume was published in 1963, while the two earlier volumes (Systematic Theology, vol. 1andSystematic Theology, vol. 2: Existence and the Christ) were published in 1951 and 1957, respectively.Tillich notes in the Preface, \\"With the third volume, my Systematic Theology is completed. The last volume appears six years after the second volume, which itself appeared six years after the first one.... My friends and I sometimes feared that the system would remain a fragment. This has not happened, although even at its best this system is fragmentary and often inadequate and questionable. Nevertheless, it shows the stage at which my theological thought has arrived.\\"Here are some representative quotations from the final volume:\\"Therefore, obedience and disobedience to the law are mixed; the law has the power to motivate partial fulfillment, but in doing so it also drives to resistance, because by its very character as law it confirms our separation from the state of fulfillment. It produces hostility against God, man, and one's self.\\" (Pg. 49)\\"Religion (is) defined as the self-transcendence of life under the dimension of spirit.\\" (Pg. 96)\\"In so far as religion is based on revelation it is unambiguous; in so far as it receives revelation it is ambiguous. This is true of all religions, even those which their followers call revealed religion. But no religion is revealed; religion is the creation and the distortion of revelation.\\" (Pg. 104)\\"faith is the state of being grasped by the transcendent unity of unambiguous life---it embodies love as the state of being taken into that transendent unity.\\" (Pg. 129)\\"Not faith but grace is the cause of justification, because God alone is the cause. Faith is the receiving act, and this act is itself a gift of grace. Therefore one should dispense completely with the formula 'justification by faith' and replace it by the formula 'justification by grace through faith.'\\" (Pg. 224)\\"the revelatory and saving manifestation of the Spiritual Presence is always what it is, and that in this respect there is no more or less, no progress or obsolesence or regression. But the content of such manifestations and their symbolic expressions, like styles in the arts or philosophy, are dependent on the potentialities implied in the human encounter with the holy, on the one hand, and on the receptivity of the human group for one or another of these potentialities, on the other.... Progress in this respect is possible between different cultural stages in which the revelatory experience takes place or between different degrees of clarity and power with which the manifestation of the Spiritual is received.\\" (Pg. 337)\\"for participation in eternity is not 'life hereafter.' Neither is it a natural quality of the human soul. It is rather the creative act of God, who lets the temporal separate itself from and return to the eternal.\\" (Pg. 410)\\"The frequently evil psychological effects of a literal use of 'heaven' and 'hell' are not sufficient reason for removing them completely.... There would be less reason if not only theology but also preaching and teaching would remove the superstitious implications of a literal use of these symbols.\\"Tillich's work is a \\"must have\\" for any complete theological library."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology, vol. 3: Life and the Spirit: History and the Kingdom of God","review":"It's a brand new book and in excellent condition.

This monumental 1000-pages book comprises 40 chapters which have been organized in 8 sections:(I) Fundamentals, (II) Technology and analysis, (III) Logic devices, (IV) Random access memories, (V) Mass storage devices, (VI) Data transmission and interfaces, (VII) Sensor arrays and imaging systems, and (VIII) Displays.Fully covering each of the above fields would require far more space than that available in a book of this same size. Hence, the editor has done the clever choice of writing chapters 20-30 pages long, each of them sufficiently self contained. For example, the (sub)field of Molecular Electronics (my favorite topic) is treated in ch.20, pp. 503-525. This chapter ends with 66 references, enough for further study. The closely related subject on Organic Light Emitting Devices (ch. 38) can be consulted by checking either the general index at the end of the book or the table of contents. Placing some keywords at the end of the former chapter, however, would have greatly facilitated my jump to the latter. Chapters seems being too independent from each other. This, I think, is the weakest point of this monumental opera. The book contains plenty of good graphs and figures, many of them colored, placed nearby the text.

This book had lots of great suggestions to make the trip easier ... like how to make sure I had a seat on the plane without actually paying an extra $500 for his ticket.

We used the third edition of this text, and it covered the spectrum of concepts for a basic introduction to real estate investment. Even though the course focused on commercial real estate, I found the concepts have helped me determine whether I have made good choices in residential real estate, as well. The best aspect of the book (and the course) was applying a discounted cash flow analysis to particular properties. As a method to assess the financial viability of a property by analyzing the rent, tax, depreciation and other effects, the discounted cash flow analysis helped me feel much more confident in my real estate investments.The book covers four basic areas: investment principles like net present value, real estate markets, mortgage financing, and legal aspects of real estate. Although not flashy with lots of pictures, the essential concepts and methods are thoughtfully explained and applied. I highly recommend this book as a reference to keep on your shelf to refer to periodically if engaged in the acquisition of real estate."},{"Title":"Real Estate Perspectives: An Introduction to Real Estate","review":"I took prof corgel's class in the hotel school at cornell and used his book both for his class and the upper level real estate finance class ha 420. in both classes i earned very high marks. jack corgel, while extremely knowledgeable, is an under-achieving professor. this is widely agreed upon in the cornell community and most students make tremendous efforts to enroll in the required course during the spring when it is taught by a different professor. he has great difficulty conveying information in an understandable, overlapping, interconnected manner. he would do well to show us the completed puzzle first and then explain how and why all the pieces go where they go. his book demonstrates his deficiency in this area. the text is pact full of information. It is poorly organized and extremely difficult to follow. his text attempts to use 1 example and continue to reference it throughout the chapters. this method has failed corgel considerably. as a result, it is difficult to make use of his example when reading the book out of chronological order and much early chapter referencing is needed to remind the student of the example's background information. he would have done well to introduce a new venture at the beginning of each chapter in the context of the material being examined in the subsequent sections. Not only would this have provided students with a catered scenario for maximum comprehension of material, but it would have allowed for general absorption of practical real world applications. Lastly, the text is a miserably boring read lacking any and all forms of personality or interesting commentary. It is as boring as it is complicated."},{"Title":"Instant Analysis","review":"Bringing psychology into plain English, Dr. David Lieberman offers a wealth of information that is useful for every reader. No one is immune from the emotional fragilities that accompany life. While some people are more stable than others, each individual has experienced certain fears and self-doubts. Leiberman artfully addresses many of these circumstances by identifying the problem, analyzing the situation and offering several solutions. The main text, which is divided into 100 easy to read and understand chapters, teaches the reader to overcome his or her self-defeating habits. Lieberman states, &quot;By becoming aware of your behavior, thoughts and feelings, you make visible the process and gain the ability to see the harm.&quot; Thus, when one is able to indentify and admit self-defeating habits, one has taken the first step to conquering the problem, and is on the road to wellness. Lieberman states that the objective here is to break up the negative mental routin! ! e and break free from conditioned thought patterns. As he writes, &quot;This is accomplished by looking objectively at specific behaviors that usually go unnoticed or unexamined. As you begin to question these behaviors, you will get in the 'habit' of not being in the habit.&quot; How does one identify these unnoticed behaviors? Dr. Lieberman does the work for the reader. By looking through the 100 chapters, the reader will be able to indentify with certain circumstances that he or she may not have noticed, because the self-defeating behavior has become habit. For example, several chapters include: &quot;Why do I always stare at myself in the mirror?&quot; &quot;Why am I so absent-minded?&quot; &quot;Why am I so easily discouraged?&quot; &quot;Why do I misplace my keys, papers, and just about everything else?&quot; (my favorite), &quot;Why do I enjoy being angry&quot;?, and &quot;Why do I act cruelly to people I care about?&quot; By scanning the table of contents, the reader ! ! will be able to identify several self-defeating habits that! the reader engages in -- realized or unrealized. By reading the entire text, the reader will understand basic human pyschology as a whole: the reader will understand his or her problems as well as the weaknesses of others. *Instant Analysis* is the modern &quot;Cliff Notes&quot; of human psychology. After identifying the problem, Dr. Lieberman describes several scenarios applicable to the the situation and offers several helpful solutions. For example, in the chapter concerning losing keys, etc. Lieberman offered several suggestions that has helped me overcome this most frustrating situation. *Instant Analysis* is a must-read for all human beings. As humans, no one is immune from self-defeating habits. By indentifying the problem and offering concise and powerful solutions, Dr. Leiberman can save each reader hundreds of dollars in psychiatric fees and hours of therapy. *Instant Analysis* is the bible of modern psychology, written for &quot;everyday people.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Devil and all his works","review":"While Wheatley's \\"right-handed\\" moralizing gets tiresome, this book is a useful introduction to each avenue of the occult.

Each author has a somewhat different approach, no doubt reflecting his particular expertise, but the overall quality of writing is excellent This is not a battlefield history of the British Army. While some key battles are described, the focus of this history is on policy and strategy for resourcing and employing the British Army. There is associated discussion of politics internal and external to the Army as they relate to the formulation of policy and strategy. The chapters on the First and Second World Wars are particularly well written. Those readers closely following current U.S. policy and strategy in the War on Terrorism will find interesting parrallels in the role of the British Army in safeguarding the Empire through a series of low and medium intensity conflicts.

While Binns' isn't successful in giving as much attention to these obscure Middle Eastern churches as to the well-known Byzantine church, his approach is worthy of some attention.Binns starts his overview of Orthodoxy's diversity by examing the various bishops found along Straight Street in Damascus. The city has five patriarches, all representing different traditions in this fragmented faith. After this example, Binns proceeds to tell the history of Orthodoxy. He assumes that readers will already be familiar with the basics of Christian thought and the early spread of the faith, and so he begins this history from the moment when Orthodoxy gained a distinct characteristic from Western Christianity, namely with the rise of Byzantium.The middle of the book is dedicated to Orthodox faith and practise and how these might vary from Western Christianity. The chapter on liturgy I found to be among the most interesting portions of Binns' work, for it describes not only the well-known Divine Liturgies of Constantinople, but also the little-known liturgies of the churches in the Middle East. The chapter on icons commendably describes the theological arguments for and against in considerably more depth than many descriptions of Orthodoxy.Forty pages are dedicated to the complicated issue of church-state relations within Orthodoxy. I found this to be somewhat disappointing, for he doesn't speak of the simultaneous willingly collaboration and underground resistance of the Church in Romania and several other oppressive regimes, though the former Soviet Union gets sufficient attention. This chapter is followed by one on the relations between Orthodoxy and the churches of the West from the schism (which was much gradual than one would have thought) to modern-day ecumenism. Finally, the work concludes with a brief survey of Orthodoxy's triumphant return after the fall of Communism and its contemporary struggles.While the book is generally informative, it is somewhat flawed. Binns occasionally fails to maintain a neutral tone. Whether this is due to a personal commitment to Orthodoxy or a desire to present everything from the view of his subject is uncertain. However, I was made uneasy at several points, and downright appalled when he suggested that calls for the Russian Church to distance itself from anti-semitism is undesirable Western meddling. I was also disappointed by a number of small errors which show insufficient fact-checking. Though the work was first published in 2002 Binns uses, for example, the anachronism \\"the Ukraine\\" for \\"Ukraine\\", and \\"Kiev\\" for \\"Kyiv\\". He also shows a misunderstand of European geography when he speaks of \\"the border between Slovakia and Russia.\\"For one looking for a basic introduction to Byzantine Orthodoxy, this book is far too dry and unfocused to please. I would suggest getting Bishop Kallistos Ware's THE ORTHODOX CHURCH instead, a modern classic by one of the most respected bishops of the Church and a book continually updated and reprinted. If you are looking for a wider perspective on Orthodoxy including the non-Chalcedonian churches of the East, Binns' work might be appropriate."},{"Title":"An Introduction to the Christian Orthodox Churches (Introduction to Religion)","review":"A fascinating look at the Churches of the East, and how they not only differ from the churches of the West, but also from one another.

But most importantly, WKK's mysteries are also great stories."},{"Title":"Purgatory Ridge","review":"Your pulse is barely audible then quickens as the book devolops, finally turns into a full charge of adrenaline as we race to the end. This is my third book I have read that Krueger has penned, and he has solidified himself as one of my favorite authors, this book was no exception. Purgatory Ridge at first I thought was going to be different as the book was slow to develop, but deemed necessary as Krueger lays the foundation and develops his story and its wonderful characters along the way. As usual the story envelops around former sheriff Cork O'Connor and his family. Being a former sheriff of Aurora, MN O'Connor and his wife Jo a local attorney, seemingly always gets sucked into some type of adventure/mystery involving locals in Aurora, MN. This time it concerns the great white pines sacred to the Anishinaabe tribe that are in danger of being logged out by a local logging company. The book is full of twists and turns and will have you guessing up the very end who is planting bombs, threatening the loggers, and eventually kidnapping. Seems to be a trademark of Kruegers and I can say he will give you sleepless nights as you forge ahead and flip pages to get to your answers. His characters some are dark and you learn to despise them, some full of flavor or interesting, and others like Cork and his family you grow to love. His characters are not without flaws though, and he writes as all authors should, as we as humans are not of the perfect sort. Again you race towards the end and I do mean race as this book is a thriller as it takes you towards the finish line. If you dare pick up the book be sure you have time to spend, as you won't be able to put it down once your past the halfway mark. I won't give away any of the fun as thats your job as you open up to page 1 to see if you can figure out who is behind it all before you flip to the last chapter! Also who will live and die or will anyone come out of this unscathed?"},{"Title":"Purgatory Ridge","review":"I have just started reading William Kent Krueger and he is really a good author.

I always rate them 4 stars, taking one off for minor imperfections such as a few too many named characters for the average reader to remember the basic facts about each of them until they've read 3 or 4, occasional very minor slips on grammar or technical issues (though he's almost flawless on the latter and covers a dozen technical fields e.g., guns, fly fishing, mining, shipping). Unlike other top serial writers e.g., Lee Child, he has so far resisted the temptation to let a ghostwriter step into his shoes for a whole book (or to write a book that looks as if a ghostwriter did it). And his hero has enough human flaws to be more real than most serial heros. May he keep up the good work!"},{"Title":"Purgatory Ridge","review":"Quite a thriller.

Teasdale sank during a Lake Superior storm, 12 years ago. LePere's beloved younger brother, Billy, died in the wreck. John LePere has since survived bouts of heavy drinking, and has put his life back together sufficiently to land a maintenance job at the Ojibwe casino in Aurora, Minnesota. He lives in a remote cabin, continues to own his family's small home below Purgatory Ridge on Lake Superior, and spends all he can save plus all of his free time diving the Teasdale wreck. He wants two things. One is to recover his brother's body, since the frigid depths of Lake Superior - unlike waters elsewhere - never give up their dead. The other is to prove that the Fitzgerald Shipping Company deliberately arranged the sinking in order to collect insurance. He's helped by a man called Bridger, and egged on - unknowingly - by having as his neighbor Grace Fitzgerald, whose husband, lumber mill owner Karl Lindstrom, has built a home on property adjoining LePere's. John watches Grace Fitzgerald and Scott, the son of his first marriage, and he dreams about revenge.Former Tamarack County sheriff Corcoran \\"Cork\\" O'Connor wants only to run his seasonal burger joint, Sam's Place, and enjoy having his once broken family back together. When local politicians approach him about running for sheriff again, due to the anticipated retirement of the man now holding that office, Cork's initial reaction isn't positive. Yet he misses law enforcement deeply, and he cannot seem to help thinking and acting like a lawman. When environmental activists go up against Karl Lindstrom's determination to cut a stand of old growth pines that the Ojibwe call Our Grandfathers, Cork tags along as his lawyer wife represents the tribe's interests. Then Grace Lindstrom and Scott disappear - and so do Jo O'Connor and 7-year-old Stevie. Now Cork must use all his skills as an investigator, because the clock is ticking and the survival of his wife and son depends on his solving the case before time runs out.Another taut, literate suspense novel in the Cork O'Connor series, with the usual strong sense of place (small town, backwoods Minnesota) and the usual excellent pacing. This time I'm fairly sure I noticed a plot hole or two, but nothing that detracted from my enjoyment in turning pages until I'd finished the story. Cork O'Connor is a conflicted protagonist, sympathetic because of his flaws and not just in spite of them. The series develops its continuing characters in believable ways, and for that reason I'm finding it is best read in publication order.--Reviewed by Nina M.

Characteristically, they involve great characters, interesting mysteries, Ojibwe lore and northwoods atmospherics. In an ethos that is both vast (the lakes, woods, etc.) and small and enclosed (a Minnesota town, the Ojibwe reservation nearby) WKK takes his compromised but engaging hero, who is half white and half Ojibwe into the darkness of the past and into the darkness of the human soul to probe the mysteries that await him there.Purgatory Ridge is different. While the other elements of a WKK story are all in place here, this book is much more of a suspense/thriller than a mystery or crime novel. There are mysteries, of course, but the novel's two plots (an explosion at a lumber mill which is threatening to harvest a stand of pines that are sacred to the Ojibwe; the broodings of a half Ojibwe half white man whose brother was lost in a ship which collapsed in a storm on Lake Superior) come together in an elaborate kidnap/murder plot which threatens the families of the industrialist whose property has been destroyed and, as well, the wife and son of Cork O'Connor.Who are the kidnappers? And is there an additional individual behind the kidnap plot? The suspense is protracted, the saving of the kidnappees an apparent impossibility. There are knives, broken glass, duct tape and blood aplenty and the ending is a sixty page crescendo of death, revenge, and--the reader hopes--last-minute escapes.The result is one of the very best of the WKK novels, a novel that is faster in its pace and more urgent in its plotting than the other stories in the series. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Purgatory Ridge","review":"To clarify, I read \\"Thunder Bay\\" first, my introduction to both WKK and Cork O'Connor. That book hooked me from the beginning and I immediately ordered six more of the books in the series. I read \\"Iron Lake\\" and \\"Boundary Waters\\" and was only mildly impressed. It was interesting to see the progression in the development of the leading characters. Now I know who Molly was and her importance to the storyline of Cork and Jo. Still Henry Meloux is a shadow of the character he is in \\"Thunder Bay.\\" That said, this is one good book and kept me glued to the storyline. There are definite adrenaline chasing scenes and I found myself turning pages quickly in order to find out if pivotal characters would live and how that would be resolved. John LePere is a very interesting character, full of strength, goodwill, determination, and a deep-set anger that needed to find closure. He did find redemption, it was sad but it was as it should be. Now I am eager to read the next book in the series and know that WKK is indeed an author that should have universal recognition for his writing.

It was a great read. I read Boundary Waters, the next in the line of the Cork O'Connor books and just finished Purgatory Ridge.Purgatory Ridge has everything you want in a good suspense mystery, great character development, excellent story line (this one actually had two), a couple of twists, and edge of your seat, page turning suspense.It is obvious Krueger has done his home work. This may be a fiction novel, but the places he describes (Boundary Waters Canoe Area, North Shore of Lake Superior, Sawtooth Mountains) are all accurate. I spend a lot of time in Northern Minnesota. I associate with many of the landmarks in his books, and that makes me feel like I am part of the action.Upon finishing the book, it is apparent that Krueger is going to follow up with another Cork O'Connor novel. I CAN'T WAIT!"},{"Title":"Purgatory Ridge","review":"This is the third in what discerning readers all over the world must hope will be a long-running series featuring Cork O'Conner, his wife Jo, and his three children, Jenny, Annie and Stevie. While this is a fine mystery, and a terrific adventure, all these elements of the novel are shaped and informed by the changing relationships among this family.These relationships are at the core of author Krueger's interest, and while I feel he still struggles at times with female sensibilities, his \\"take\\" on father-daughter contretemps and emotional spread is dead on.Lake Superior is a vast, emotionless, natural wonder. Yet we frequently describe it's many moods in human terms, its raging storms, its implacable irresistible strength, its icy coldness. In the dark foundation of this story, Lake Superior plays a real and important role. Krueger has taken the true story of one man's improbable survival of the sinking of a lake freighter in a November storm, and made it the prime motivator for everything that follows.Some things in life, and in death, appear to be foregone. From the very beginning, when John LaPere loses his beloved younger brother to the great lake, it seems inevitable that LaPere's ancestral sensibilities will one day lead his feet into a path that intersects with those of the O'Connor family, and with others, whites and Indians, who live, work, plot, scheme and murder, in and around the small northwoods community of Aurora.The story begins in high tension, death and destruction and rarely slackens it grip until the final chapter. In Purgatory Ridge you will find all the elements readers have come to expect from this fine writer: a complex plot, a great range of real characters who jump off the pages, descriptive passages that bring scenes so alive one can almost smell the pine woods of Northern Minnesota and hear the waves of the great lake, good dialog, suspense, well-contrived and placed sub-plots, a fired up pace and a careful, surprising ending that perfectly fits what has gone before. Purgatory Ridge is a novel to be savored."},{"Title":"Purgatory Ridge","review":"This is the 1st Krueger novel I've read (I just found out its the 3rd in a &quot;series&quot;) and I was totally captivated by it! The characters are incredibly lifelike, the storyline is well rounded, the plot is riveting, and the emotion is powerful.When I first read the dust cover for a synopsis of the book, I admit I was unimpressed. But after reading only a few pages of the book, I was 100% interested in what was happening within the story (actually turned out to be multiple story lines - all receiving equal and adequate attention).I'm on my way to get the remaining Krueger novels (excellent job, Mr. Krueger!) and I highly recommend this book as a very entertaining read."},{"Title":"Purgatory Ridge","review":"The book did hold my interest most of the way through; it definitely was a fast-moving story. I enjoyed the detailed descriptions of the setting and the characters. It started out to be a pretty good mystery, but didn't deliver in the end, and here's where I differ from previous reviewers. The blurbs describe the book as full of plot twists and surprise endings. I didn't find this to be true. I figured out fairly early on what Bridger was up to, and it didn't take a genius to guess who his secret accomplice was. So much for surprise endings. In addition, I found the dialogue to be clunky and awkward at times; AND, I wonder, does anyone proof the book drafts before they go to print? Does the author get to see a proof of his book cover synopsis? I wonder because on the back of this book it says, \\"When an explosion kills the NIGHT WATCHMAN at wealthy industrialist Karl Lindstrom's nearby lumber mill...\\" As anyone who has actually read this book knows, it was NOT the night watchman who was killed, but another individual. Just another example of shoddy editing..."},{"Title":"Purgatory Ridge","review":"Near Aurora, Minnesota, a major environmental-industrial dispute exists. The Anishinaabe tribe wants the two hundred acres of great white pines that are sacred to them as &quot;Old Grandfathers&quot; protected from the lumber industry. Karl Lindstrom's lumber mill resides on the edge of the forest and he is not known for his conservation methods. As is the case in many local arguments, outsiders come marching in to join the Native American protesting the cutting down of the trees.However, all hell breaks loose when someone blows up the mill, killing a Native American employee. The industrial moguls blame the Anishinaabe tribe and the law agrees even though someone named the Eco-Warrior claims credit for the deed. Though he lost his job as sheriff a couple of years ago, Cork O'Connor, at the pleading of his wife Jo, the tribe attorney, begins to search for the identity of the terrorist. As he conducts the search, the Eco-Warrior adds kidnapping and ransom demands to his crime list.PURGATORY RIDGE is an exciting ecological thriller that keeps the suspense and action at high levels throughout the tale. When the story concentrates on the central theme of conservation vs. development, the plot is as good as it gets. In those circumstances, all the key characters seem genuine in their beliefs. When the story line spins into sidebars like the ransom kidnapping it appears as if a plot device has been used to add unnecessary tension to an already strong novel. Award winning William Kent Kreuger has written a one-sitting tale that will send sub-genre fans off to read the previous O'Connor books (see BOUNDARY WATERS and IRON LAKE).Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Purgatory Ridge","review":"I've been following Krueger's work ever since IRON LAKE first hit and have to say he's on my must-read list of authors. He writes about his characters with such a deft and gentle touch I'm almost convinced they're real. While readers who are only looking for the thrill of the mystery can pick up his books in any order and not suffer confusion, I recommend savoring them in order to get the full impact of the character development.PURGATORY RIDGE is perhaps the most thriller-ish of Krueger's work to date, but still satisfies those looking for a puzzle to solve. He's one of the few authors I enjoy reading who is able to manage multiple points of view and can also sustain tension throughout a scene. Everyone comments about his wonderful setting and descriptive language, and you'll get no arguments from me. (Check out the SCUBA diving chapters if you have any doubts on either front - you'll be convinced.)I'm looking forward to more of Krueger's writing. His success this far is impressive, but I think he's going to break away from the pack very soon."},{"Title":"Purgatory Ridge","review":"Years ago, plot was the thing in mystery novels. Over the last several decades, authors have relied less on plot and more on character to carry their work. Two current authors who are especially proficient with character driven mysteries, but who also don't scrimp on the twists and turns, are Michael Connelly (see my review of A Darkness More than Night elsewhere) and William Kent Krueger.William Kent Krueger's third Cork O'Connor book, Purgatory Ridge is set in Aurora a town in northern Minnesota not far from Lake Superior. Krueger's novel runs several plots simultaneously. But each is propelled more by their respective character's backgrounds and motivations, and less by finding a solution to a traditional mystery puzzle.When an early morning explosion at a lumber mill kills a respected Anishinaabe tribal leader, the stage is set for confrontation over the logging of old-growth white pines. The trees are considered sacred by the Anishinaabe, but the townsfolk rely heavily on money from logging and environmental extremists have swarmed in to stop any logging at all.Meanwhile, a man who is the sole survivor of a shipwreck on Lake Superior, obsessed with guilt over his brother's death in the same wreck, vows revenge on the family-run shipping line even if it leads to kidnapping and murder.Into the mix is O'Connor, the former sheriff of Aurora, a man who, like Connelly's McCaleb, is beginning to realize how much he misses police work. He is encouraged by several prominent citizens to run again for office, but his wife, a prominent attorney, dreads the affect it would have on their fragile marriage.Krueger's handling of his character's thoughts and motivations is deft and he never lets the tension of the subplots falter. O'Connor, his family, and especially the Anishinaabe people are appealing because they are delivered fully alive to the reader."},{"Title":"Purgatory Ridge","review":"Mysteries are not my genre of choice. However, I am such a fan of Mr. Krueger. I so totally enjoyed Iron Lake. Couldn't wait for Boundary Waters. Thoroughly enjoyed Boundary Waters. Couldn't wait for Purgatory Ridge. Now, as usual, am left disappointed that this one, too, has ended and I have to wait again for his next book. His writing gets better and better. His characters get stronger and stronger. He is truly an intelligent writer with a knack for grabbing you from the beginning and not letting go. Every time I think I have figured out &quot;who done it&quot;, he throws a wrench in the story and proves me totally wrong. His books are so much fun. They are well researched and he shares so much with his readers. Mr. Krueger is a joy to read."},{"Title":"Purgatory Ridge","review":"\\"Purgatory Ridge\\" is one of those books that grabs you at the outset and doesn't let go till the end. And you won't be disappointed. Krueger writes a gripping novel, set along Minnesota's rugged shores of Lake Superior. Not only will you get a sound reading of the local environment, you'll also learn a lot about the modern Indian culture of the region. Krueger's characters are vividly drawn and he doesn't allow for too much nuance. The good guys are very good; the bad, very bad. The plot has a lot of twists and surprises, especially at the end. And for the most part, Krueger eschews serendipitous coincidences to move his plot forward. This is my first Krueger book and I found it surprisingly engaging and compelling."},{"Title":"Purgatory Ridge","review":"Krueger is at the top of his game with the third of his Cork O'Connor series. Relationships, greed and revenge power this story of a timber war, Indian casinos, and marriages. O'Connor's marriage is three dimensional and the characters are real life adults. A fine read."},{"Title":"Leading Teams: Creating a Team - Resolving Conflicts - Delivering Results Through Teamworking (Essentials)","review":"The good point of this book is the same that mostly each of the Business Essentials books has:* Clear structure* Consistent design* Pocket book format* Step-by-step description.*** Whom this book could be interesting to? ***The book can be interesting for team leads, especially for those who are lack of managerial experience.This publication covers basic but important managerial issues in quite a consistent way, describing, for example, the difference between a Group of people and a Team, phases of Team existence and more. Several useful advices are given regarding how to organize meetings and especially how to behave at the very start when Team members meet for the first time.Brain storming technique description is given with valuable hints on how to make it properly, i.e. encouraging Team members to contribute rather than depressing the idea of the method.Conflict resolving and motivation are slightly covered that is probably enough for a book from \\"Business Essentials\\" series.*** Summary ***I personally found this book useful. The reader should take into account that this publication is a pocket reference issue and does not claim to be a compete study on the subject. The book describes the ideal situation without real life examples or discussions that looks to be enough for a one searching for day-to-day reminder on how to do things right until developing basic managerial skills as automatic actions."},{"Title":"American School Reform: Progressive, Equity, and Excellence Movements, 1883-1993","review":"One roots for this book to be better than it is, as it fills a niche: a brief, easily understood overview of school reform movements in the U.S. On progressivism,though, Berube is blind to the division of the movement into competing branches, what Lawrence Cremin summarizes well as \\"scientists, sentimentalists, and radicals.\\" When in Berkeley in 1964, student protest leader Mario Savio squared off against University of California president Clark Kerr, both advanced \\"progressive\\" positions. An active participant in New York City's community control battle in the late \`60's, Berube brings not only a distorting partisanship to \\"equity reform\\" but a wrong-headed partisanship. Sorry, but Black Power was not, as Berube thinks, an instance of identity politics, asking \\"Who am I?\\" Read Carmichael and Hamilton again, Maurice, and shame on you for stretching to find Jewish racism in NYC teachers' unwillingness just to give up labor rights won after a century of unmitigated opposition. Nor was 1960's feminism \\"an offshoot of the Civil Rights Movement\\" (p.114). Read Susan B. Anthony, Mary Garrett Hay, and Charlotte Perkins Gilman for confirmation. Correct to decry the crude prosperity-education link in A Nation at Risk, Berube rushes to condemn \\"excellence reform\\" as an elitist strategy out only to educate the best students and advance the cause of privatization. Read Vonnegut's \\"Harrison Bergeron\\" and a few pages of ninth-grade writing from anywhere in America today to get a better glimpse of why \\"excellence reform\\" is desperately needed."},{"Title":"American School Reform: Progressive, Equity, and Excellence Movements, 1883-1993","review":"This book provides a nice overview of several educational reform movements.

With a cover graced by none other than Armand Van Helden, HOUSE: The Rough Guide breaks down this musical subgenre in small easily digestible doses.In keeping with the MTV mindset of short attention spans, HOUSE provides synopses highlighting the salient points of significant contributions DJ's (e.g. Masters at Work, DJ Pierre), producers (e.g. Mood II Swing, Basement Jaxx) and labels (e.g. Nervous, Salsoul) have made to House music. Very much like a NY Times investigative story, Bidder's Rough Guide leaves no stone unturned, reporting on names both past and present in the house music game from Robert Owens to Adeva to Daft Punk to Bobby Konders. The book serves as an excellent resource and reference for beginners to gain knowledge about the genre, for intermidiate house lovers to further their education and for advanced house users as a reference tool to key people.One added bonus, the book not only covers the people and the labels, but it also names the tunes that catapulted to stardom."},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to House Music","review":"I take this little book with me everytime I go record shopping.

I highly recommend browsing the artists and listening to their tracks when you get a chance. It was an era of completely creative individuals. Not everyone could make music tracks back then,you had to have talent(usually) to be able to work in music studios to make tracks.

Mr. Freeman creates a fascinating and surprisingly sympathetic cast of characters out of the random, ragged, largely alcoholic and thieving crew of a rundown cargo ship. I could not put this book down and hated to see it end. I hope that someday he will write the story of his second voyage on the ship."},{"Title":"Seaspray & Whisky","review":"How can one begin to describe the madcap antics of the Allanwell's crew? The book is about an Irishman who seeks a job as a radio/radar operator on a nice clean ship with a respectable crew. He ends up on the Allenwell,a rusty tub with an appalling half-drunken crew and a crazy Captain, too. The ship is carrying a hold full of Vat 69 whiskyfrom Britain to the United States. The crew is mesmerized as they watch it being loaded into the hold. You know they are thinking of theft. Is it illegal to break into the hold? Of course. Does that stop the crew from frequent pillaging? Of course not! Poor 'Sparks' (the conservative, quiet, radio operator) narrates the various onboard shenanigans throughout the colorful journey and back. Add bad weather, seasickness,two cooks with the most appalling kitchen ever to violate a health code ordinance and you have the making of a great read.Here is part of the crew's 'at sea' Christmas dinner:The portions were hidden beneath a cow-pat of thick, greasy gravy...the ham parboiled to squelchy disintegration. 'At least there's plum pudding to survive on' said Misery.Toni came rushing in, bearing a huge ball of blue flame on a platter. Mr. Yardley...from a safe distance, peered at the conflageration that was our Christmas pudding. There was at least an inch of...Vat 69 swashing about on the platter. The captain poured (water) over the flames. The sodden, smoking pudding looked like a cannonball come to rest after its explosive trajectory. &quot;Maybe we'll get a bit of Christmas cake at least&quot;, said Misery (not a chance! Toni the server trips and cake goes all over the floor).And so the voyage goes. When the authorities look into the hold and find almost 1000 bottles of whisky missing they search every inch of the crew's quarters. Happily, the crew had quickly opened the portholes and tossed hundreds of stolen bottles into the Mississippi river long before the FBI arrived. No evidence found!This is a great read about a very colorful voyage!If you like salty sea-yarns, and want some laughs, this is the book to buy!A review bySpyrenee@aol.com"},{"Title":"Seaspray & Whisky","review":"I came to Amazon looking for more books by Norman Freeman; \\"Seaspray and Whiskey\\" is a richly marbled slice of life that goes against the grain of expected British nautical behaviour.

The idea behind the book is to give the reader all the information they need to play a game of Killer a.k.a. Assassination. The point behind this popular game is to use either water guns, household objects, whatever, as a method to \\"kill\\" your opponent or opponents. This book gives different gaming scenarios like Mafia and Round Robin, as well as plenty of methods for killing. The best part of the book is this last part which lists tons of ways to get your opponent like taping a note under their car hood like a car bomb, poisoning their food and drinks by a similar method, or even setting up contraptions to drop \\"acid\\" on their head when they open the door! The beauty of these games is that they are done in real life, not sitting around a table ...like in D&D.

She works at the HiTek corporation, where she studies fads: to discover their roots and what, exactly, they mean. This isn't a completely good thing, however; she becomes so used to the idea of fads that she notices them everywhere. No one, not even the most minor of characters, is excluded from her notice.The story really picks up when a package meant for someone who worked halfway across the building fell into Sandra's lap, thanks to Flip, the apathetic and trendy mail-girl.Meet Bennett O'Reilly. He is a chaos theorist, working for HiTek, ever since the funding for his project at the Loue river in France fell through. All he really wants are a few monkeys to teach the hula hoop to... but when Flip loses his funding packet, Bennett and Sandra lose - and gain - a lot more.Some sheep, for example. And a breakthrough in science (similar to Messier, Galvani, Roentgen, and even Einstein's theories). And true love.Bellwether is a novel that is essentially a satire of the world as we know it; the idiocy of people who just don't seem to get it, the trends and fads that are seemingly far more common than you'd think, even how one person can change the outcome of their surroundings just by existing.This is, in my opinion, Connie Willis' best book. Not only is it the one that I discovered Ms. Willis by, but it is also a fantastic love story, mystery, and heck - even educational, what with the paragraphs on fads of the past at the beginning of each chapter. Even if you do not think this novel is of the sort that you normally like, you should still read it. It will be worth it."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Wonderful, funny, &quot;works on multiple levels,&quot; romantic, escalating.

For its light tone and the way threads come together, Bridge of Birds by Barry Hughart."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Probably the most enjoyable book I've read that asks the question: why do people jump on the latest bandwagon only to discover that it doesn't make them any happier than they were before? The protagonist-narrator of the story is a social scientist, working for a research corporation and trying to find how fads begin. The corporation wants to figure out how to use her research to make new fads, and of course gobs of money in the process. The weekly meetings presided over by &quot;management&quot; are hilarious.This book reads so easily that you might be deceived into thinking that it's simply written. Hardly. Willis has worked very hard to tie together a number of disparate elements. Some of the most enjoyable parts of the book are the short descriptions of dozens of past fads -- everything from coonskin caps to bobbed hair to mah jong. In the process, Willis tells us a lot about what we're willing to do to &quot;belong.&quot;I noticed from previous reviews that some people were disappointed with this book because it really isn't science fiction. It's true, this is not traditional science fiction, with a futuristic setting, new technology, etc. But Willis's remarks that relate fads to chaos theory are very well thought-out. In giving the reader something new to think about, she meets the basic test of science fiction. And in creating an enjoyable, perceptive story, she meets the challenge of being an exceptionally good writer."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"You know, it really irks me when a wonderful book like Bellwether comes out and all these &quot;well-read&quot; types come out of the woodwork to tell you how awful it was because it wasn't like her other work, didn't turn out how they wanted, maybe wasn't as deep as something else she'd written....Please read it anyway! I loved this book! I have read it many times, loaned it to many friends, bought it for birthdays...you name it! I love the fact that it's not like her other books. I love that Connie Willis can allow herself to branch out. She is a fine author in any incarnation, and just because it doesn't focus on spaceships or aliens or time-travel, doesn't mean it can't be science fiction. You got your science. You got your fiction. Voila!

A semi-scientific, extremely funny, geeky love story emerges from chaos, which is embodied by a fad-obsessed, incompetent mail clerk named Flip.If you've ever entered an IKEA through the front entrance (instead of sneaking through the marketplace), you'll understand the \\"sheep\\" reference. People walking along assigned pathways, eyes glancing downward nervously, following large black arrows on the floor, not daring to stray from the path, much less walk in the opposite direction.Sandra Foster works in a \\"Dilbert\\" type corporation, trying to work out what causes fads, from hairstyles to crossword puzzles. Bennett O'Reilly works for the same corporation, studying chaos theories. When these two get together thanks to a misdelivered package, things really start to get chaotic, compounded by the hiring of an assistant for Flip, who is (gasp) a SMOKER, and Management's efficiency meetings.Studying the behavioral patterns of a flock of sheep proves to be a lot harder than it looks (almost as hard as filling up a Corporation request for a paper clip) but through some coincidental occurrences they learn the secret of the wooly herd-followers the hard way.An enjoyably easy read, I especially liked the information on various fads at the beginning of each chapter.

Sandra Foster is the fads researcher, Bennett O'Reilly is the chaos-driven sheepherder (sort of), and everything comes out all right in the end.

And you'll have to read it to truly appreciate this comment. :) If this book is indicative of Connie's writing I can see why she has won six Nebulas and five Hugos (including short stories, novellas etc).The story revolves around Sandy, a research scientist working at HiTek. She is searching for the cause of fads. There would be a lot of money for the people who could predict the next fad. She is focusing on the fad of 'hair bobbing' that afflicted women in the 1920s. If she can find what caused it she can apply the model to fads in general.When the story starts things aren't going to well for Sandy. She's found lots of leads, but nothing conclusive. Her investigations are hampered and conversely helped by the conditions and environment she is forced to work in.'Bellwether' is written with a wickedly cynical sense of humour. I had to stop reading in a couple of places as I was laughing so hard. The characters have to be read to be believed. Even the incidental people in the book are beautifully described. They are the sort of people you never want to meet, but that you know are out there.Some of the characters don't have names, but this is because they don't need them. The most notable example is Sandy's boss, he (the gender is specified) is simply the Management. He is the epitome of everything that you think off when you think about corporate management. I won't go into detail as it would take some of the fun out of the book, but Connie has captured the concept with breathtaking accuracy.Connie manages to include huge amounts of information about both fads and chaos theory without being boring or impenetrable.Each chapter has a paragraph at the start about one fad. I'm astounded at some of the things Connie has managed to dig up. Some of the fads we have indulged in in the past are utterly ridiculous. You wouldn't think anyone would ever do anything like some of the things Connie describes, but they are (sadly) all to true.Chaos is a central theme to this book in both theory and practice. Chaos theory is central to Sandy's study of how fads get started and chaos is central to how her life operates. It's just one bewildering, inexplicable thing after the other. Don't despair about this book being incomprehensible, though, Connie's leads you though it all with skill and wit, I never felt lost, and ties everything together at the end.Being a fad researcher one thing that Sandy notices, and frequently comments on, is that people don't think for themselves, they simply follow the fad. A fad that Sandy would like to see start amongst the insanity she is researching, is people thinking for themselves. I dare say this is something Connie would like to see as well and I wholeheartedly agree. It's a pity that the only people who are capable of understanding what Connie is saying probably don't follow fads anyhow. But if this book gets at least one person thinking for themselves rather then following the trend then I'm sure Connie would be delighted.When I was half way through I was seriously thinking this would be a five star book. So what went wrong, why have I only given it four? Towards the end the humour starts to disappear. The book never becomes uninteresting or dull, it is a delight to read right through to the last page, but it doesn't quite have the bite at the end as it has in the initial two thirds. Still I highly recommend you read 'Bellwether'. It is a damn good book, quite definitely four stars and quite nearly five."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"I opened this book expecting a serious Sci Fi look at the workings of Chaos, based on the Mandelbrot patterns on the cover and the blurbs tauting Willis as one of \\"science fiction's best writers\\". What I got was well-crafted, romantic and wickedly funny writing about scientists, not science fiction. But the quality of the writing was so good and the satire so pointed that I didn't mind in the slightest.Sandra Foster studies pop culture fads and is currently pulling her hair out over the prime cause of the fad for bobbed hair in the 1920s. Though she can isolate several factors, none seems to fit as a prime mover. A misdirected package given to her by her office's angry slacker assistant brings her in contact with Bennet O'Reilly, a chaos researcher and perhaps the only man Sandra's ever met who seems genuinely immune to fads. Add on a coporate bureaucracy fond of anagrams like GRIM, a seriously out-of-control anti-smoking work environment and a biologist obsessed with handicapping a rare and lucretive \\"genius\\" grant and you have the makings of a funny satirical romp through corporate groupthink, fashion victimhood and the silliness of science-for-hire.The novel is a very fast read. I was done in about an afternoon. But it is diverting, clever and lighthearted. The plot twists are somewhat predictable, though ultimately I think part of that predictable nature was calculated by the author. Willis has a acute ear for popular culture's language and clevery skews many fads from angels to anti-smoking campaigns to odd clothing trends. Overtop of the satire is a layer of science in the form of chaos theory. The entire story is structured as an exmple of increasingly chaotic systems breaking down and then suddenly creating new levels of organization. This scientific veneer isn't particularly important to understand in ordered to enjoy the book, but it does lift the book into the realm of speculative fiction.So, it's not deep and it's not heavy. But it is fun and it is a smart read. You could do worse than spend an afternoon in Willis' wacky world.Chris Forbes"},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"The more Connie Willis I read, the more I like her work. The tone of this book is strongly reminiscent of &quot;To say Nothing of the Dog&quot;, so chances are if you liked that one, you'll like this one. Instead of being a time-travel story, however, it is set in contemporary Boulder, Colorado (an ideal environment for any trends researcher such as our main character, I assure you). I really got the feeling while reading this that I was present at a scientific breakthrough. All the disparate events and characters force the story gradually to a satisfying conclusion, while giving the impression that they are stumbling blocks to any progress that might be possible. Just a lovely, lighthearted book -- which may lead you to deep thoughts if you wish, but which can certainly be enjoyed on a more &quot;surface&quot; level."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Connie Willis' Bellwether is both amusing and thought provoking. During the course of this novel, Ms. Willis investigates the extremes to which people will go to 'fit in' to society, and how social climate can affect different aspects of existence. Even scientific research, that bastion of logic and unemotionalism, is swept up in the ebb and tide of the herd instinct.And yet, through it all, Ms. Willis' protagonist, battered on all sides by tidal waves of fadism, maintains a firm anchorhold on the really important issues: truth, love, self-respect and common sense. Her individuality highlights the almost comic efforts of the masses to follow the latest fashion.In the end, the Bellwether paints an optimistic picture of man the individual, if not of man the social animal. Love, self-respect, and self-determination wins out, leaving the reader heartened that somewhere, deep down inside, man is still a thinking animal, capable of great foolishness and great accomplishments.I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who doesn't mind laughing a lot at society and a little at oneself. Although this book takes place in the future, the roots of the society she protrays exist today, making the scenery seem strangely familiar. Don't be surprised to find yourself caught up in the protagonist's search for a little slice of truth, and moved when the truth finally catches her unaware."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"There's just something about Connie Willis' books...Bellwether is a book about fads, what starts them, and how they impact society. Unlike Willis' two time travel books (Doomsday Book and To Say Nothing of the Dog), Bellwether is set in contemporary Denver, Colorado. Sandy Foster works for a corporation there, where she researches fads. She spends much of the book trying to figure out why women suddenly cut their hair into bobs in the 1920's. Ben O'Reilly also works for HiTech; he researches chaos theory. Naturally, Sandy and Ben start working together, trying to correlate their two fields.Like her other books, every character is fleshed out, and used in the plot, even the ones that seem incidental. And naturally you don't find out how everything fits together until the end of the book. And like To Say Nothing of the Dog, this book made me laugh out loud in public places. It also pokes fun at the scientific community, trendy restaurants, and libraries which refuse to keep classic books. I was a little surprised by the anti-anti-smoking sub-plot, but that's not enough to make me give Bellwether anything less than five stars. Highly enjoyable and re-readable."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"A breezy, light read that is quite clever and features some interesting commentary on trends, corporate cultures, and human behaivior."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"With _Bellwether_, Willis has created something strikingly like _To Say Nothing of the Dog_, one of the funniest compilations of highbrow wit this side of Stoppard and Shakespeare. But _Bellwether_ comes off feeling somewhat inferior: a bit less clever, a bit more oversimplified. While Willis obviously did scads of research regarding the lives of scientists, chaos theory, and fads, her characters are very familiar. For example, as something of a 20-year-old myself, I gritted my teeth through the novel, waiting for a single character between the ages of 15 and 30 to be anything but vapid, vain, and irrationally unfriendly. I don't know what kind of horrid teenage customer service experience Mrs. Willis has had in Greeley, but I resent being defined by association as an i-branded lemming. Through an entire novel crammed with minor-role twentysomethings, nothing but empty-headed lovers of _90210_ and Eddie Vedder ever appear.Still. This is Connie Willis we're talking about. The writing is almost terminally good, and if a bit of the humor seems a touch forced, well, a lot of it isn't. (In one case that I caught, she drops the gratuitous word &quot;corduroy&quot; in a sentence, which, coupled with an observation her main character made 100 pages earlier, makes for a very funny joke; just to make sure you're awake.) If she resorts to gushy sentimentalism, she cordons it off safely to one five-page section of the novel where it doesn't infect the rest of the work. All in all, this is a fine book. But it has its flaws, and when compared to the virtual perfection of _Dog_, it cannot help but suffer by comparison."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"What a lovely book, read it in 3 sittings, which is pretty good for me. Annoyed the hell out of my wife for my outbursts of laughter (she's now halfway through it). I specially identified with Bennet, as I'm not known for my sartorial elegance or fad-following, and recognised Flip as a collage of several of our Admin staff. Well-turned characterisations and a not-too-predictable plot, as well as loads of fad trivia, make this a joy to read. Not quite the gem that Doomsday Book is, so 4 stars, but well worth a read."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"I found this book years ago seriously discounted at a book store. I think I paid about a dollar for it. I will buy just about any book for a dollar. Well, it hung around the house for a while before I even started reading it. The cover photo and the author winning science fiction awards sort of scared me. I am not a big fan of science fiction.But this is not really science fiction. It's like \\"chick lit\\" really.A light fun read, lots of trivia thrown in...a bit of a love story and it's funny.I've actually read it about 4 times - and I hardly ever reread books.Since I liked this so much I have also read Connie Willis' \\"To Say Nothing of the Dog\\" and \\"Doomsday\\" and I recommend those as well. They are not typical science fiction either.If you are a fan of chick lit, try this book. It will change how you think of \\"science fiction\\" authors."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Connie Willis rarely ever disappoints and this book is one of her funniest---light, clever and a quick read. Save an evening to read this as you won't want to put it down once you've started it.In Bellwether, Willis brings together a sociologist studying fads and a chaos theorist (who seems immune to fads). Both work for a nameless faceless corporation which seems to thrive on chaos itself---even as it searches for a way to control and manipulate its workers.The main characters are wonderful as always (as always, Willis has created a wonderful heroine---a mix of savvy and naivity). But it is her minor characters who keep you laughing--Flip, the assistant who makes everyone's lives a nightmare, the mothers at a birthday party for pre-schoolers who are driven by discipline fads, and even the faceless and nameless Management.Don't miss out on this!"},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Connie Willis combines her love of chaos theory, science, literature and screwball comedies into an entertaining romance set in the world of high-tech research.Sandra Foster is a sociologist researching fads, and Bennett O'Riley studies chaos theory at a commercial research insitute called Hi-Tek. When the incompetent and outrageous departmental assistant, Flip, misdelivers a package and fails to hand in a research funding form on time, she sets off a chain reaction of events that forces Drs. Foster and Bennett to combine their studies into one. As the remaining scientists at Hi-Tek try desperately to figure out how to win the coveted but mysterious Niebnitz grant, Foster and Bennett try to study information diffusion in higher mammals. Unfortunately, the only higher mammals on which they can get their hands are a flock of sheep, which bear a surprising resemblence to the people who inhabit Dr. Foster's day-to-day world. In the process of trying to find out why people behave as they do, Drs. Foster and Bennett rediscover their love of science and discover their love for each other. Along the way, they are helped out by the strangely competent Shirl, who no one else wants around because she smokes, but who seems to understand science, sheep, and perhaps a whole lot more.Connie Willis successfully conveys a joy of science and literature, while wryly looking at the trials and tribulations of trying to be trendy and successful. It's hard to describe this melange of sheep, Barbie dolls, personal ads and science adequately, but if you like intelligent and literate humor with a touch of romance, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"The novel kept me amused the whole way through - I liked the fad basis. I think Willis went overboard when creating some of the slacker-girl characters, but it all works out."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"This is an excellent book. I believe it is my favorite Connie Willis novel, and that's saying a good deal.There are already plenty of reviews which go into detail, so I won't. I just wanted to add my five stars, and to recommend this book to anyone who enjoys humor or who has an interest in social trends."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Willis' apt observations of fads, crowds, and group behavior were spot-on. I laughed so hard I almost wet myself. Then I felt a little guilty because I was being snobby and feeling superior to all those &quot;sheep&quot; who follow fads. Then I laughed at myself because I am guilty of following fads, too (Rachel haircut, anyone?). Hilarious."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Willis is a capable writer, which makes it all themore frustrating that there's so little behind this book. The protagonist researches fads at a corporate think-tank. The descriptions of these fads are amusing, as Willis' depiction of corporate mindlessness. But there's not much else to the book--a flimsy plot, likeable but bland characters, and none of the social or technological insight which characterize good science fiction. I got the feeling Willis was capable of much more, given a strong idea to start with."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Light as a feather, entirely nonsense, and completely irresistable.

Thereference to &quot;The Management&quot; and their interminable but predictable changes reflects a trend one sees today in business. The petty jealousies among grant-seekers is all too true in academia and big business today. But the crowning glory of this book is the sly subtle way that Willis lets the reader know that everything they do is a reaction to yet another event, one that may not have been intended by the antagonist. This book is a must-read for students of human nature, for those in government and other bureaucracies, and for those who appreciate a sly satire on business today.

Science Fiction at it's highest levels IS social satire! The rocket ships and monsters of the stereotypical space opera are present only to provide a unfamiliar environment against which our human foibles can be seen more easily as that which is familiar: our own sometimes shaky moral and behavioral sacred cows. This tale differs only in that the use of science (don't expect it to always be valid) is simply a vehicle around which a simple plot, in very familiar surroundings, is conceived. Willis has written a character-based, broad satire with no pretense of sublety; it's a grinner. It's also a terrific book to give to friends who have said \\"I don't care for all those spaceships and slimy monsters in Science Fiction\\"; usually their science fiction exposure has been limited to hollywood's worst offerings.Lighten-up, folks; this is one is just pure fun."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"I was not familiar with the term \\"bellwether\\", prior to reading Connie Willis' often hilarious, tongue-in-cheek, always humorous 1996 novel. Instead of wondering what a bellwether (the sheep) can have to do with a HiTek research centre, I relaxed into the story. Willis, in fact,takes the reader with great skill for a fun ride and only towards the end of the book do all the pieces come together. Written fifteen years ago, the novel may have had an even stronger impact on its readers then than it has today. For example, the discussions on the specific fads and fashion trends at the time may appear somewhat dated now, still, other trends she explores, such as the Barbie doll, are still (or again) with us, maybe with a different or better understanding of what they can represent. There are enough wisdom and interesting information tidbits in the book to keep the reader involved. And, of course, for the soul, there is an old-fashioned romantic love story as well.Sandra Foster, the researcher of the origins and sources of fads, has an close to impossible task. Her current preoccupation is how, where and when, \\"hair bobbing\\" started as a fad. Each chapter starts with a brief encyclopedic entry on any number of fads - many well known to us - but not many directly related to her time or preoccupation. She collects her source material only from public sources, e.g. the media and, not surprisingly, doesn't get anywhere. It doesn't help that the interdepartmental distribution coordinator happily misplaces documents or otherwise messes things up. Still, Sandra is not the only one struggling with her research. At the other end of the building Dr. O'Reilly is researching chaos theory. He is desperately looking for triggers that lead to chaos behaviour in groups, also with limited to no success. Fortunately for both, fashion trends and chaos come together in the office in unexpected ways, on the one hand through the obnoxious mail distribution coordinator, with the name Flip, and on the other through \\"The Management\\" itself. Fad behaviour can be studied right there on colleagues, who join into one chaotic scenario after another and to varying degrees. And, eventually, there are surprise outcomes.I found the depiction of The Management's actions most entertaining and totally to the point. Their constantly changing prescriptions, whether for improving the working atmosphere in the offices or increasing output and results, attracting new money, etc., each is accompanied by a new acronym. Flip is a wonderful caricature of a mail delivery system, especially in big corporations... and the bellwether? Yes, sheep are introduced for the chaos project, but that may not be leading to the right outcome either. Still, there may be more results than expected at the end. While some of the fad discussions feel somewhat drawn out and also repetitive, overall, it is a fun read, even today.

They work in two completely different realms but a misdelivered package and some terrible luck, mostly due to the strange and terrible office assistant Flip, they end up coming together on a joint project with a flock of sheep. Despite Flip's continued \`assistance' and with the help of the assistant's assistant, they both eventually find the answers to their particular questions and the story ends with great success.I enjoyed the story as a whole and the development of the relationships especially between Sandra and Bennett. Of course I loved Flip, whose complete uselessness and oddities became hugely central to the plot, even if you don't really notice this until the end. I really liked how all the little lose ends because ties together and pretty much nothing was in the story without a reason. Finally, each chapter starts with a fact or piece of random information about fads or science, which I found interesting."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"I can understand why this book isn't everyone's cup of tea--it's not your usual science fiction, instead working much more like modern literary fiction. But I think it's fascinating because the book's structure actually models its subject (which, loosely speaking, is the relationship between chaos and social structure). At points the book feels random and repetitive, but this seems a deliberate comment on the topic at hand. In some ways, Bellwether reminds me quite a bit of Susan Griffin's \\"Our Secret\\" in terms of how it connects cultural studies and science and the study of an individual's life. The book at first appears to answer questions about how fads work (and if this is all you think about the plot, I can see how the novel might seem overly simplistic), but I think it raises more questions than in answers--and this, too, is replicated in the plot of the book, as it culminates in the start of a new research project."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Gotta love Connie Willis. Her usual dry sense of humor is evident here. As is her ever present introspective protagonist attempting to deal with a problem while juggling a love interest. I dont mind that Willis seems to use the same plot structure story after story, its not a bad one, and so minimal that it fundamentally works as a foundation supporting an idea she is trying to get across.This time, Willis is trying to talk about Chaos Theory. Basically she does an admirable job of spelling out how it works by making her lead character, Sandra, a woman employed to study 'fads' and how they are created. Willis spends a lot of time going into an exact meaning of fads, how they relate to chaos theory. Its lightly written, and enjoyable to contemplate.I would totally recommend this book to anyone who can take a book that in all regards is VERY SLOW. As I said the humor here is 'dry'. I loved it, but you might pick this book up and think of yourself in hell if you are looking for an action packed page turner."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"I stumbled upon this small book and decided to give it a try, mainly because I also have Doomsday Book but haven't read it and wanted to read a book by such an accomplished author. For the most part I am very glad that I read Bellwether and you can certainly see why Willis is such an accomplished author.Willis is a very fluid and smooth writer, transitioning well from character to character and chapter to chapter. Early on she established a theme that rang true throughout. Sandra Foster studies fads and is continually annoyed by Flip, who continually tries to be hip, trendy and up with every fad. Add to the mix Bennett O'Reily, a biologist studying chaos theory, and the basics for a well rounded book are there. Initially I was annoyed with Flip and some of the other characters, who are idiosyncratic and weird, to say the least. At first they don't seem to fit and are nothing more than a way for the author to inject character to the book with a little flare.Eventually all the elements coalesce as, just as the characters theorize, the chaos grows and grows to the point that it organizes itself and begins to reveal the underlying plot. I was annoyed in the beginning of the book, enjoying myself in the middle of the book, to finally falling in love with the book by the end. Willis masterfully built her characters and plot so that eventually everything was fluid and believable. A definite recommend and I cannot wait to read another book of hers.4.5 stars."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"This novel is packed with information; it's similar to the Da Vinci Code in that way.

As an introduction, it was a limited success. I only found Bellwether to be so-so, but it certainly wouldn't discourage me from reading more of her work in the future.Bellwether is a short satirical novel, set in the world of science for profit. It's the story of how a social scientist researching fads and trends meets a colleague studying chaos theory and information diffusion, and how they team up to survive their corporate management and the \\"help\\" of a surly office assistant. Along the way, Willis takes pot shots at parenting, cuisine, fashion, lifestyle, and other trends, and those who adhere to them.Honestly, on paper, this looks it should be a home run for me. I'm a big fan of satirical novels, but I've seen similar takes on office culture done better. (Max Barry's Company is highly recommended!) Another issue is the fact that I listened to Bellwether as an unabridged audiobook. Reader Kate Reading (yeah, that's her name) did a fine job with most of the narration, but for the annoying office assistant, Flip, she did a really annoying Valley Girlish voice. It got old fast. Not only that, she used the same voice for all of the many other annoying characters the protagonist encounters. It was a legitimate choice, implying a sameness to the hostile, ignorant, lazy characters in the book, but again, it was tedious. I find stories about really annoying people tend to get on my nerves. Maybe it's me?I did think the information on the science and history of fads was quite interesting, but there was simply too much of it. And there were some laughs along the way to the novel's clever ending, but they didn't fully compensate for the negative aspects of the book--for me. I will read Willis again, because she is clearly a talented writer. But next time I'll stick to a recommended title. I think I could become a fan; this just wasn't the right starting place."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"If you're new to Connie Willis (which I was when I read Bellwether), you can rest assured that time invested in reading her work is not wasted. Winner of 10 Hugo Awards, and 6 Nebula Awards, Willis is a smart, funny, engaging human being, and Bellwether reflects those same qualities.Connie Willis writes stories whose humor and delightful characters do not obscure her underlying intent: bringing thought-provoking information about the world we live in, or may someday live in, to the audience for consideration. Bellwether does not have the rough-edged intensity of the drug-fueled speculations of Philip K. Dick, the manic brilliance of Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five, or the chilling hard tech projection of books like Gibson's Neuromancer. Bellwether does not contain the sweeping sociological analyses of an Ursula K. Leguin tale. Nor does Bellwether contain the sort of quotable wisdom that has resulted in Asimov's Three Rules of Robotics being so frequently resurrected lately in discussions about military robots. What DOES Bellwether have?It has a truly enjoyable tale, populated by characters that have hearts, minds, and depth. It has a delightful romance, the type of love story that eschews anatomical detail for the (IMHO!) more deeply satisfying pleasure of a relationship built on humor, common cause, mutual admiration, and a sense of adventure. Lust is the sauce in a Willis romance, rather than the main course, and much power to her for helping the reader to remember such a concept.Bellwether also has, underpinning a misleadingly lighthearted style of prose, substantial food for thought. Bellwether's discussion of what drives fads/trends/fashion, mixed with a dose of chaos theory, is intriguing and informative. And, Bellwether has this: scientists as Good Guys; scientists as full humans that not only care about, but derive huge pleasure from, the world in which they live. Bellwether has the kind of scientists that make one say \\"I'd like to be someone like that when I grow up\\". No left brain hypertrophied, right brain atrophied geeks need apply, both sides of the brain required to live successfully in a Willis novel.Bottom line? When you pick up Bellwether, don't expect prolonged episodes of staring off into the distance as your brain reconstitutes itself in accordance with a newly dawning world view (though a few such moments may indeed occur). Do expect to be charmed by the characters, and to root for them. Be comfortable that there are some interesting takeaways in store. Relinquish the idea that absorbing new concepts requires arduous diligence and/or mental gymnastics. The literary atmosphere in this novel is one of Heli-Ox: some helium for a light heart, some oxygen for sustenance of cerebral metabolism. Just read, and enjoy."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"A bellwether is \\"One that serves as a leader or as a leading indicator of future trends.\\" In Bellwether, sociologist Sandra Foster works for HiTek, a \\"think-tank\\" company, where she is studying fads. With this study, HiTek hopes to find the secret to making people follow fads.The plot has Dr. Foster tracking down THE origin (not \\"origins\\") of the 1920s women's \\"bob\\" hair fashion. While she is doing this, she is:1. Clashing with interdepartmental assistant \\"Flip,\\" a consumer and purveyor of current fads.2. Ending a romance with a rancher and starting one with a scientist studying chaos theory.3. Groaning under the weight of Dilbert-like MBA management pronouncements.4. Herding sheep.5. Observing fellow workers search for the mysterious Niebnitz Grant-winning strategy.6. And, of course, studying fads of all types.None of these is enough to carry this story, and everything is on the \\"too-weird\\" side of the work environment equation. Flip is too weird. The secret of the Niebnitz Grant is too weird. The inability of adoption-diffusion theory to be brought into the fad equation is too weird. Management is too weird. And everything regarding the sheep is too weird.Loser - the whole sheep issue. Federal law regarding the use and care of live animals in research would preclude everything that was done, period. For a story that focused on management policies, this seemed like a huge oversight.Winner - these ideas:\\"But the fashion designer couldn't make people buy po-mo pink, couldn't make them wear it and make jokes about it and write editorials on the subject of 'What is fashion coming to?'\\" (p. 63). I enjoyed these discussions.\\"And if [Dr. Bennett] could be immune to fads, did that mean they were caused by some kind of virus?\\" (p. 77). Intriguing idea for a future book!\\"Chaos,\\" Ben said, almost to himself. \\"The key's the bellwether\\" (p. 216).Bellwether was light reading. Don't expect too much, and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"This is a work of great subtlety in the guise of a comic romance. This book conceals a \\"wolf\\" in the clothing of a story about \\"sheep.\\"Other reviewers have remarked on the \\"chik-lit\\" quality of this work; yes, it does have that. But there is more. The idea that our decisions, desires, dreams and aspirations are not our own may not be a new idea, but it is rarely brought home in such a personal way as in this work. To the extent that what we think are our own ideas and thoughts are the product of outside influences is not new; consider the extensive literature on the effect of advertising on decision-making, and the studies which show that decision-making is influenced by the strategies expressed in soap-opera. But this takes it a level deeper, to a level at which the influences are effected in a manner which we not only DO NOT understand, but CANNOT understand. It's as if the discovery of the \\"unconscious,\\" which showed that our conscious thoughts are not our own, were extended from the individual mind to our entire cultural consciousness. The novel suggests that, regardless of what we think, we are only sheep, manipulated by some among us who are, perhaps unknowingly, the \\"bellwhethers\\" who shape our actions and what we think are \\"our\\" decisions. The \\"bellwhether\\" probably isn't even aware of her/his role. The mechanism of this control is not explained; perhaps not explainable. Whoever learns how to master this will make pawns of us all. This may (or may not, depending on your own concept of the nature of the universe) be a terrifying thought. This is a \\"C4\\" bomb in a \\"firecracker\\" disquise; don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"This is the second Connie Willis book I've read (the first being &quot;To Say Nothing of the Dog&quot;). Like that other book, this is just amazing. Essentially, the book is a mixture of Dilbert-on-steroids, science, history, history of science, humor, and romance. Also like that other book, this one has an underlying theme of the importance of coincidence in our world. Excellent book. Definitely read it."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"This is the best of all Ms. Willis' books, in my opinion. Some of her stories leave me a little melancholy and wishing I could share a little hope with the author. This book, with its picture of *good* people *living* together, left me full of hope for us all. (I loaned it to a friend who's dad was dying to share the hopeful glow.)I love the nooks and crannies that she shows us in her character's personalities and wonderland she shows in every day life. This is not a science fiction book, but I put it right up there with Asimov, Robinson, and RAW (on a good day) for synchronicity, puns, fate, and purposefully making the best of what the universe hands you."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"I suppose the other reviewers are right in that this isn't really science fiction - but it's an absolutely delightful read regardless of genre. One of my favorite things about Connie Willis' books are her fantastic characters and in this aspect she doesn't stray in the least with Bellwether. Being a fairly short book and one that doesn't let up in the least, it's an excellent way to spend a saturday afternoon."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"A strong book that kept getting better as it progressed. This is the second Connie Willis novel I have read, the first being the Doomsday Book. This book fell a little short of her Hugo &amp; Nebula award winner, but still a very good book. Reading through this book has given me the feeling that she has worked in Corporate America. Here portrayal of management's lack of common sense and inept practices will hit home for any Science/Engineering company employee (see dilbert). I would highly suggest this book for anyone in one of those fields...."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Although the plot lacks major twists, I couldn't keep it down. Brilliant characters. You know them immediately, you never ask &quot;Who's this Elaine again?&quot;. Except for the main one, the characters are offbeat or completely over the edge, which makes this a brilliant social satire. After 200 pages, I no longer believed the plot would come to a satisfactory ending - I was wrong. In the end it all comes together. Little things scattered throughout the book suddenly made enormous sense. Absolutely worth the read. If your company is obsessed with paperwork, the humour will kill you. Beware: This is no sci-fi."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"A compilation of well researched fad history woven with Ms. Willis' understanding of scientific corporate behavior. Unfortunately for corporate America, her understanding is fairly accurate for most organizations, which makes the description of corporate management's behavior identifiable to a large readership, scientific and non-scientific.The Author's ability to link fads with corporate social behavior is somewhat superficial but effective. But then the entire book is light reading for groupies against corporate bureaucracy, i.e., the cartoon character &quot;Dilbert&quot;, et. al.Categorizing the book as &quot;Science Fiction&quot;, however, is somewhat of a stretch even if the author is touted by the Denver Post as &quot;One of Science Fiction's Best Writers.&quot;"},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"This book was fun and I truly enjoyed the fads anecdotes. As a social scientist (in communications), I loved the portrayal of social science research, as well as Willis' understanding of the Eureka moment. It was so refreshing to see scientists and their work treated so well. This is the kind of book that needs to be written more often.I find the argument that this is not science fiction intersting. Ultimately, if this is not science fiction, I don't care. I want more of it. As Carl Sagan asked, &quot;What kind of a world is this where a large proportion of the country believes in transporters and phasers, yet cannot understand the laws of motion or the mechanics of photosynthesis?&quot; (I paraphrase, but read his &quot;The Demon-Haunted World&quot; if you need the exact words). Even the portrayal of the 'geek' biologist was positive.For the record - I hate to be around smoke (I have asthma), but I hate even more the cruelty I have seen against smokers. After they finish with the smokers, they'll be after the fat people and then we're all in trouble."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"This is a nice story, and a good introduction to the work of Connie Willis."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"After reading the Doomsday book, I was not prepared for such a light-hearted and witty book on fads, chaos theory with just a dollop of romance. After the large scale carnage of the Doomsday book, it was a relief to find everybody surviving at the end of this one ( more or less retaining their sanity)!I give this book 5 stars because I think it is a lot harder to write a funny book than it is to write an apocalyptic one. I also have a deep respect for authors who explore different writing styles and subjects. Can't wait to get hold of another of her books..I'm sure it will be as refreshingly different."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"I started reading &quot;Bellwether&quot; a chapter a day, and that didn't help it. I was able to enjoy it only after I had a whole day to spend with it, and it made me laugh joyously. Its humour needs your attention to enjoy it.Though wholesomely entertaining, I found &quot;Bellwether&quot; a little too light-hearted for its own good. The easy laughs and predictable outcomes made it too similar to most entertainment out there. The literary structure was also too obvious, constantly going on about how scientific breaktroughs are made by accident, all kinds of trends and fads we are drowining on, and how the source of rivers don't seem like too much of a thing.All in all, this is light fare, but intelligent. If you're looking for something smart to get you laughing, this a read you won't regret."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"This was a book club pick and although it began a bit slow, overall it was a good read. I would recommend it to a friend."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Still the best book on fads. Read it like it's going out of style.This is Connie Willis' most fun work"},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"I loved this book! It's so much fun and smart at the same time. This is the third book I've read by Connie Willis. I liked \\"To Say Nothing of the Dog\\" once I got used to the pace (sometimes it reminded me of a Marx Brothers movie) but all the history was really interesting. What doesn't Connie Willis know about?I also read Lincoln's Dreams, but, although it was original, it was reptitive and slow.I read Bellwether in 2 days, just couldn't put it down. And now I know something about Chaos Theory. And I know I want to read more Connie Willis."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"I already owned this book in paperback but couldn't find it so I bought it on the kindle. It is just that good of a novella. I would highly recommend this book for anyone, anywhere."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Connie Willis' Bellwether remains as fresh, funny and absorbing as it was on its a publication. A wonderful sendoff of the corporate and scientific bureaucracies as well as world's easiest introduction to Chaos Theory, I plan to use it again in my UNLV upper division Science Fiction class."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"This book has probably the most infuriating character in a recent book. It annoyed me that the rude, disdainful and thoughtless Flip got away with her actions. I was also irritated at Sandra, the prtagonist, for accepting Flip's behavior without giving her a good shake. A couple of times, I almost put the book aside. What kept me reading were the interesting factoids included about fads. Later on, when the sheep took center stage, the book was actually laugh-aloud funny. Glad I managed to persevere."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"It's hard to whole-heartedly laugh at the humor in Bellwether, as it's probably too close to a nerve for most of its readers daily lives. The way Willis takes on subjects as disparate as corporate policy, the politics of research, fads and trends, and (of course) sheep should be recognizable for many folks out there.It's possibly a little bit slight, and I didn't think it was as complete as a book like _To Say Nothing of the Dog_, but it's still well worth the time to read. Particularly recommended for people who have read Willis before or people who have a career interest in research."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Dr. Sandy Foster works for HiTek Corporation, researching the phenomenon of the fad--her current preoccupations revolve around why women bobbed their hair in the 1920s and, more practical to her status as HiTek employee, how to fill out the monstrously huge funding application without flying off the handle at the grossly inept, fad-following clerical assistant, Flip. When she meets Dr. Bennett O'Reilly, a chaos theorist, Sandy thinks she has met the one person immune to the herd instinct who may finally provide the insight needed to crack the fad conundrum. As they embark upon a chance project combining both their strengths observing the habits of a flock of not-so-terribly-bright sheep, Sandy discovers that she is following a fad far older than any of the fads she has previously analysed and hits upon an answer that ties all of the story's strengths and sidebars into a clever satisfying conclusion.Bellwether is the first Connie Willis novel I have read; I found her style straight humorous and thoroughly engaging. All the characters entertain; even the most stereotypical---Flip, Management, the &quot;time-out&quot; moms and the aghast waiters from Boulder's trendiest coffee shops and restaraunts manage to convey the lemming effect quite realistically and yet imaginatively. Willis' depiction of HiTek's paperwork debacle, use of synergistic phrases as motivation tools and the overkill touchy-feely employee relations meetings typifies real life in big corporation in a way that more frightening than Hallowe'en.If you are looking for a short novel that satirizes the media effect on modern life, amuses, yet doesn't get too perplexing, &quot;Bellwether&quot; is just such a read. Based on this reading experience and the positive comments provided by the other reviewers, another Connie Willis novel will find its way into my shopping cart again soon. If you are in the mood for fun, do read it."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"This is a light and breezy read. It is humorous and somewhat satiric. What it is not, is science fiction. It is, however, about a group of scientists, and it is definitely fiction. The book is written in an imaginative way, with each chapter beginning with a paragraph giving information about a particular fad that caught the imagination of society at one time or another. Written quite tongue in cheek, the book is a funny and light-hearted look at life, love, corporate dysfunction, and the herd mentality society sometimes adopts. While the book is not at all what I had expected, I rather enjoyed it.The main protagonist is Sandra Foster, a social scientist who studies fads, tracking down their origins and analyzing what they mean. She works for the HiTek Corporation, a company laden with a surfeit of corporate bureaucracy. So does Bennett O'Reilly, a chaos theorist, whom Sandra meets when a package goes astray within the work place. They eventually join forces and begin working together on a special project with a flock of sheep as their guinea pigs. The book basically shows how chaos serves to unite these two in a way that they could not have imagined."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"This is not science fiction as we know it. It explained to me the bellwether phenomenon, which I was not aware of. I think that most of the conclusions in this novel are actually true. It is a very fast read and the story is enclosed in a relatively short form. The book is written from the point of view of a scientist who does research on fads in a big institute (the institute resembles rather a corporation to me, not a scientific environment I am used to, but, after all, the \\"science fiction\\" tag gives the author some room here). The research, although it seems to go completely wrong at the beginning, is a big success at the end. Sandra, the main protagonist, couples forces (and falls in love; the love story is funny, too) with another scientist, Bennett, who works on chaos theory. The solution of the problem involves some sheep and an incredibly messy mail clerk. Good laugh, entertaining with a twist (it can actually make the reader stop and think for a moment)."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Somewhat lighter than her usual style and very funny. Her Dilbertian portrayal of the workplace, and in particular the relationship between those obsessed with their jobs and those obsessed with themselves, is instantly recognizable. One wonders where she worked. I particularly liked the concept of people acting as chaos vortices, again an instantly recognizable concept. My only problem with this book was that at times it is so cruelly accurate that I felt guilty at laughing."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Bellwether is a novel about some of the folks who work at HiTek corporation, a humorously portrayed workplace whose bureaucracy and dysfunctional operations seem to be ripped right from the pages of Dilbert. The primary characters are researchers who scramble to keep up with the changes in the paperwork they are required to file to obtain funding for their projects. They are joined by a hilariously written gofer who does just about everything except the tasks she is given.Connie Willis hits the nail on the head with her portrayal of our society as a herd mentality bent on following the latest trend without thinking about what they are doing or why. At many points in the story her satire would have had me laughing out loud had it not been so soberingly dead-on. In the midst of this insanity, a researcher attempts to discover where fads originate and becomes intrigued by a coworker who seems to be &quot;immune&quot; to them. Their resulting collaboration injects notions from chaos theory into her fad research and, in the end, yields a clever answer.There is nothing profound about the conclusion that Willis comes to - in fact, it is as much tongue-in-cheek as anything in this story. She makes some minor points regarding chaos theory and the behavior of nonlinear systems, but nothing earth-shattering - this is far from being hard science fiction. Rather, I found it a clever and very enjoyable tale of the chaos that goes on in our everyday lives, both in the workplace and our personal lives, and how some semblance of order emerges from that chaos.I you're looking for something light and humorous, yet clever and thoughtful, give Bellwether a read. I truly enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"What a great book. Ms Willis has achieved a fun, lighthearted, very readable novel that obviously entertains, and pokes fun at Management, fads, and fashion. On a larger scale it just pokes fun at the human race in general.Connie really deserves a great deal of credit for the research that went into this one. Each chapter, thirty or so, is begun with a one or two paragraph synopsis of some fad from its birth to its death (if it died.) Each of these little stories is charming if not outright hilarious.It sports a fun plot where Sandy is researching how fads get started. She is tormented by the same office ignorance that you and I face daily, and she deals with the same idiots in her social life that you and I do. Yes the ending is a little Hollywoodish, but this work was not meant to be a War and Peace. It's just fun. Deal with it.I think it's a stretch to call this science fiction. Other than it being about scientist, there are really no elements that would fit it into this category. That does not indicate any disappointment, but is does concern me that categorization could frighten off a significant number of readers who would otherwise just adore this book.It was enjoyable enough for a five star rating, but the lack of any deeper meaning or prompting for introspection requires that I give it the highest rating possible for fluff. I love cotton candy, but it is after-all, insubstantial."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"This was a very enjoyable story that didn't seem to take itself too seriously. It was a nice touch adding the little tidbits at the beginning of each chapter about various fads that have come and gone throughout history, though I did not always agree with her commentary about them. Her underlying message about how many people in our culture are unable to think with much originality and are not even aware of their predicament was well founded. As a school teacher I see this everyday in the microcosm of my classroom. Her portrayal of corporate mentality has a certain Dilbert-like quality to it that I'm afraid may not be as exaggerated as I hope it is. The only thing I found irksome - and this is a small quibble - It seemed that every waitress/waiter/and assistant she encountered rolled their eyes at the drop of a hat! I would be fuming if I ran into as many rude people as our intrepid scientist did."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"On the surface Bellwether appears to be a simple love story embedded in a satire of modern office life. Beneath that surface, however, lies an intricate web of links and patterns based on chaos theory and information. The story contains a collection of random events that, somehow, end up leading to a seemingly inevitable conclusion. It is not WHAT happens that matters here, but HOW it comes about.This is my favorite Willis book, and one of my favorite science fiction books. (It's fiction about science ... somehow that ought to qualify it as a member the genre.)"},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"This book doesn't really shine the first time you read it. I mean, it shines, like all her stuff does. And it lingers in your mind, and replays significant scenes now and then when you're not paying attention. But it doesn't really shine the first time you read it. And not the second, or even the third. It really starts to shine when you start to be able to pick out the triggers, to watch the patterns unfold before your eyes, to see everything they're talking about and looking for happening in their own life--that's when the story goes supernova. I've lost track of how many times I've read this book. I stole my mother's copy, and won't give it back (it's okay, she stole my copy of &quot;After You'd Gone,&quot; and gave it away, so we're even.). I don't even need to read it now, I could probably recite it from memory by now, but I still do, still pick it up and roll the words around in my head, play with the phrases. No one writes like Connie Willis."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"I really liked Bellwether. It deals with one of my favourite subjects, chaos theory, among other things. In it, Connie Willis manages to work the plot so that everything the protagonist experiences, is part of the realization the character has at the end. All of the pieces of the puzzle are there, and only once it had been solved at the end, did I truly appreciate how Willis has woven it into the book. The tone is light, and there is a lot of comedy, but to a serious purpose. The elements of the protagonist's life chaotically intertwine with the scientific exploration of the book, and this merging of them is part of the book's point. It is both immensely enjoyable to read, and one of the finest science fiction books I've read."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"This is a great book by a great writer. Connie Willis is great at dropping you into complicated situations with complicated characters, yet by the end of the story everything is clear and it has all paid off. This is a story about scientists, statisticians, and most importantly the stupidity of working in the corporate world. It is also laugh-out-loud funny. I can not give it a higher recomendation."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"This is a great book, and I highly recommend it. It is laugh out loud funny. It is an easy read, with questionable &quot;science&quot; but tons of character (I mean the book has character, not that the characters are well developed).I think you will find that the comments on trend setting and following, the direct comparison of human behavior to that of sheep, and the charicature characters (like &quot;Flip&quot;), a little enlightening and VERY amusing.Good airplane reading. Easy to pick up and put down during a trip or when you are busy."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Ms. Willis has done it again! This time she takes on research science as Mammon, trendiness as the bankrupt betrayal of independent thinking and management fads de jour. As a management consultant, I roared with laughter at her genteel but merciless portrayal of wholly inept, unimaginative and doom-to-failure Management. It is in her character of Flip, however, that Ms. Willis delivers a character who is a cross between a uberslacker and deus machina. Fun, easy, literate reading. More, please!"},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"I think Connie Willis is the best writer of English prose alive today. Her other books, in particular &quot;Lincoln's Dreams,&quot; are astoundingly beautiful and lyrical, serious books told in a vivid voice that draws pictures, scenarios and characters together with what seems like effortless grace. She is like a breath of cool clear air after the stuffiness of a closed room. &quot;Bellwether,&quot; however, is about as subtle as a grocery cart at it careens around the heroine's self-conscious pre-occupation with fads and trends. I must admit, however, there were several things i liked: Flip the office assistant; the little girl's use of a map to tell a story about her Barbie doll; the scene in the cafeteria where everyone has to come up with Dilbertesque slogans. But overall, the book is a disappointment, albiet minor. It's also fast and easy so you might as well read it. My husband, btw, liked it more than I did, especially the bits about bread pudding, the longevity of the angel/devil's food cake fads, po-mo pink, Malibu Beach House Barbie, Alice Blue, diorama wigs and, of course, Billy Ray and the sheep."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"I thought long and hard as to why the humor in this book (and the very similar \\"Passage\\") didn't work for me, when at the same time I found \\"To say nothing of the dog\\" by the same author to be hilariously funny.And I think I got it: The uneven mood of this book made me treat as if it was simple fiction instead of satire, with unfortunate results.You see, Bellwether's cast is divided between \\"serious\\" characters - such as the heroine and her love interest, and \\"parody\\" characters - most everybody else. The serious characters' thoughts, desires and actions tend to be realistic, plausible and, well - serious. The rest of the book\`s characters act in an exaggerated, over-the-top manner - a tried and true satiric device - supposedly in order to stress the inherent absurdity of the stereotypes they represent.And it backfires:The presence of those serious characters - coupled with most readers' familiarity with the academic/office environment - makes it rather hard to read the story as satire. Time and again I found myself annoyed by depictions of characters which I felt were flat, silly and totally unrealistic. \\"Of course they are! It's supposed to be a parody!\\" I kept telling myself, but to no avail.Another satiric device the writer employs - namely, repeatedly presenting the same ludicrous event in order to highlight its silliness - also fails to deliver, coming off as simply aggravating more often then not.In short: If you already read and enjoyed \\"Passage\\", you should ignore my review and buy this book. If, on the other hand, you only read Willis's more evenly-mooded \\"Doomsday book\\" or \\"To say nothing of the dog\\" you may be in for a nasty surprise."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"I am not a big fan of science fiction in general, but this book I couldn't put down. It is both humorous and fascinating, especially for enthusiasts of chaos theory or fads. The narrative voice and realistic characters add the humor. I definitely recommend this book.Word Ninja"},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Bellwether combines the idiocy of office doublespeak with the absurdity of today's trend-following society while still expecting you to think. Our heroine studies fads, in the hope that she might discover how they start. She collaborates with a fellow scientist studying chaos theory who loses his funding. How do you combine fads and chaos theory? As the title tell you, by studying sheep - chaos and group behavior all rolled into one. The story isn't particularly complex, but the telling is interesting and entertaining.If you work in an office where giving something a name is more important than content, don't (care to) understand the difference between latte and cappuccino or wonder why the fashion world brought back the seventies, give this book a try."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"This is a formulaic love story set in what is supposed to be a research institution. The author has clearly done a lot of reading and found a lot of trivia about fads, and drops short infobites about fads in history into the text throughout. Unfortunately the plot moves slowly, the writing is competant in a breezey way and the researchers don't appear to do any real research. As a researcher myself I was disappointed in the shallow portrayal of science. Apart from the rather unlikely ways in which the main characters conduct their research (going to the public library to find general books on sheep? Sorting newspaper clippings but never having any idea of a theoretical approach?) there are just silly factual mistakes, like when the protagonist is said to have a double major in her PhD.William Gibson's Pattern Recognition is about the same general ideas but is much better written with a more engaging and less clich&eacute;ed plot."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"I was able to meet Connie at a local sci-fi writers convention a few years back before I even read a novel of hers. One of the stands had this book there and I figured I would give it a try since Connie seemed like such an awesome person and I loved it. Its a nice easy read and enjoyable at the same time. It quickly brings you into the story and like a fishermans net - catches you quite completely.I have bought several copies since then to give to friends who I am trying to introduce to Connies' writing and each one has enjoyed this book. While it may not be exact on what a researchers world is, it has more information in it then many other books out there. Very rarely do you read a good book that is fictional that teaches you something at the same time."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Bellwether was a fun and funny read. I wouldn't classify this one as science fiction, but just a nice, funny story. Actually, science was a back drop for the story rather than being the story. There weren't strings of one-liners, but I realized I read most of it with a smile interrupted with some laugh out loud moments. A lot of the trends mentioned reminded me of years gone by and the silliness of fads, many of which I participated. I liked and cared about most of the characters and was pulling for them. If you are looking for some light entertainment, this one will deliver. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"I love Bellwether! Connie Willis makes a \\"soft\\" sci-fi story about a trend researcher in a \\"Hi-Tech\\" company, who sets to finds out where trends come from. It makes fun of Office work, High-tech, coffee shops and romance.It's written in a fun, funny manner, a bit like chik-lit meets social sci-fi really. Her sense of humour is great, and it's a short and fun book, definitely one of her best."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Connie Willis displays the same subtly whacky sense of characterization in \\"Bellwether\\" as she shared with us in \\"To Say Nothing of the Dog\\". This time, however, the setting is corporate America with its \\"management style of the week\\", administrators who shouldn't, and clerical staff who won't. Although not a life-and-death plot like \\"Doomsday Book\\", I found myself caring for the future of Sandra and the others as they tried to bring sense out of research lab chaos. This story should be required reading for anyone who has to cope with manipulators, poor managers, and the other strange characters to be found at work every day. But be prepared to laugh out loud."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"It's amazing that every book Connie Willis writes is completely different from any other. My personal favorites are her time travel books, particularly &quot;To Say Nothing of the Dog.&quot; In length, Bellwether falls between her short stories and her longer novels. You can't read this with the same mentality you read her long novels. This is really a light and fun long-short-story. Each chapter begins with an interesting paragraph detailing the rise and fall of a fad from some period of history. I enjoyed the book for those alone. The story itself was entertaining, but not riveting. The ending was wonderful and was the highlight of the book for me. (I was so relaxed I didn't see it coming!) All in all, an enjoyable little book."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"In one regard, a reader never knows quite what to expect from one of Connie Willis's books. She ranges from time-traveling parody of Victorian humorist Jerome K. Jerome to contemplations on the afterlife. What is certain, however, is that the story will be intriguing, the approach to the subject fresh and interesting, the characters memorable, and the writing intelligent.BELLWETHER is no exception. The story of two scientists who combine their respective disciplines -- the study of fads and chaos theory -- is entertaining in its own right, but sly social commentary on a variety of topics adds a satisfying layer.While I enjoy SF, the focus is so intensely placed on the &quot;idea&quot; that I often feel the characters are little more than chess pieces moving through the plot. In BELLWETHER, the characters are every bit as interesting as the puzzles that absorb their attention. In fact, the scientific breakthrough revealed in the title could be regarded as an acknowledgement that, in life as well as art, very often it's character that drives the plot."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"I can't remember when I have laughed so much. If you have everworked for a large corporation you will relate to the characters in this book (especially &quot;Management&quot;). The sheep are pretty funny too."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"&quot;Bellwether&quot; is a fun and frivolous read, but also quite engaging satire. Her characters are likeable and appealing. Not one of her more poignant novels (like Doomsday book), Willis nevertheless manages to convey some real emotion along with her commentary. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"I thought the information about fads in the beginning of each chapter was really interesting. It was cool how it related to each chapter, and while I was reading I was also learning. The story line was never slow and it kept me wondering what would happen next. As in the topic, the events are unexpected and that makes it interesting."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. The fad facts made me laugh, and I actually work for a big corporation that obviously took pointers from Hi-Tech's staff meetings. Ms. Willis' strength is her characters. Satire is very difficult, and not everyone is going to agree with the author's stand, but I find it the most rewarding to read because it makes me think of my own believes and habits. If a books can do that and make me laugh, I'll read it again."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"This book centers on a sociologist studyings fads, but it is really about humanity, insanity (of the everyday kind), and political correctness. It is well researched, well plotted, and well written. I have read it 3 times, and I have only had the book 6 monthes. Willis's is among the funniest and sharpest writers of our day, and her humor is at it's peak in this novel. Buy this book, and read it whenever you have a particularly &quot;Dilbert&quot; day at work, or whenever you need to laugh at the foibles of living in modern day America."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"I like Connie Willis, I read all her books but this one is my way-out-in-front favorite so far. I could not put it down and hoped it would never end. Her humor in this story is imaginative, subtle, ironic and hilarious, never trite, but very tongue in cheek. A real knee slapping, laugh-out-loud kind of book. I had no idea she could be so brilliant. It is a fine commentary on the absurdity of our times. The characters are so real; they reminded me of lots of kinky folks I know. I really loved it."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Connie Willis just became one of my favorite authors. I've read and loved Lincoln's Dreams, To Say Nothing of the Dog, Doomsday Book, and now Bellwether. I recommend them all.Bellwether is clever and biting satire. It's a wonderful comedy featuring a few sane and balanced people trying to survive in a world of incompetent, sheep-like trend followers. That they find love amongst this chaos and develop a thought-provoking hypothesis about scientific discovery makes this novel additionally a love story and science fiction -- added bonuses for us readers!This is not science fiction as some may normally think of science fiction. It's a light-hearted social satire, love story, and comedy that takes place in an environment of scientific research. It's well-written, with a great plot and great characters. I can't imagine who would not like this book!Which of Ms. Willis' books will I read next? I don't know, but I can't wait."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"When I was writing about Iain Banks and how he is one of my favorite authors, I started to make a list of who the others were. Long time followers of my comments could probably identify them better than I can, but here goes: Jonathan Carroll, P.G. Wodehouse, Tom Holt, Iain Banks, Tim Powers, Philip K. Dick, and Robertson Davies (Davies being the most recent addition). I looked at that list and knew something was wrong, and it did not take me more than a minute to identify the problem--where were the women? A problem? At least somewhat. I've never been one to totally segregate my reading, nor one to feel it a necessity to be the model of diversity in my reading choices, but I knew that I was over-looking someone. My top ten novel and short story lists both contain work by women (A.S. Byatt, Octavia Butler, and James Tiptree, Jr., to be exact), but although I like these individual works, I was not a \\"fan\\" of any of them in quite the same way as my male list. At the time I pondered it, and let it drop.One chapter into Bellwether, as the grin slowly grew on my face, I was reminded of my previous exercise. For I am a fan of Connie Willis--I would donate my time to design a web site for her, to write an article about her, or conduct an interview and transcribe it. Not only is she one of the finest writers that the field has ever had, but her ideas are always interesting and the stories often amusing.Take the case in point. Sandra Foster is a scientist for HiTek, Inc. studying trends and fads (things like Pet Rocks and Hula Hoops), trying to determine the causal relationship. The fad problem is a stickler, but Sandra's real nemesis is Flip, a true Gen X slacker who, in her role as mail clerk (or interdepartmental assistant) is the foil of the best laid funding plans.This is comedy writing at its finest. Willis manages to combine wordplay, cynicism, juxtaposition, running gags, ironic detachment, sarcasm, misunderstandings, and physical humor in a short 247 pages (the leading, or space between the lines, and font size are great enough here that I suspect Bellwether to be close in length to novella rather than novel). But what keeps the story interesting is the concept of trends and chaos--the mixture of public obsessions with scientific theory. Bellwether is great science fiction."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"The hero of Bellwether is Sandra, a sociologist for the massive conglomerate company, HiTek. What, exactly, HiTek produces--if anything--is shrouded in mystery (one is almost reminded of &quot;Memoirs found in a Bathtub&quot; by Lem, or perhaps even an upbeat Kafka), but it's abundantly clear it's got it's share of modern problems. Chief among them are paperwork and a catastrophically incompetent, branded, multi-color mohawked, duct tape-wearing, glorified mail clerk named Flip.As the story opens (and progresses, and even ends), Sandra is researching trends--especially WHY they start and, in her mind, why they're usually of little or no significance to humanity: &quot;why doesn't thinking for oneself or being nice for a change ever become a trend?&quot; she wonders (for myself, I finished the book in the food court of the local mall and found myself wondering about the current trends of clunky-heeled shoes, floppy-legged jeans and Mendi bracelets/necklaces). Through a series of random events, the initus being a misdelivered package by the oft-promoted but never competent Flip, she is brought into contact with a chaos theorist who is so UN-trendy that a friendship is immediately formed (note: Dr. Ben is not ANTI-trend, as Sandra quickly points out, like the hippies growing long hair in protest of the short buzzcuts of the 50's, but seems IMMUNE to them).At first, she is merely curious as to why he, of all people, seems so impervious to trends, and then discovers--in a flurry of ridiculous but easily recognized management and social trends--that chaos theory and the sociology of trends are actually much more linked than either of them had originally thought. That is, until Flip looses Dr. Ben's funding form (and, of course, Management believes the claim of the mohawked, duct taped lackey that she never GOT it), and enter the sheep, stage left...As an amateur student of sociology, I personally loved the book and the fun it poked at modern society. However, sometimes Ms. Willis's character's fads DID get a bit out of hand, and the trends in the book seemed TOO trendy. Flip, of course, being a main character SHOULD have the latest trend, like putting swatches of duct tape around a brand of the letter &quot;I&quot; between her eyes and going off on an anti-smoking campaign. However, when EVERYONE starts rolling their eyes, flipping their hair, and sporting swatches of tape just like Flip-and I mean EVERYONE-the book looses some of it's realism. Even within trends, there's got to be room for individual variation (like KAKHI pants that completely cover the wearer's shoes vs. denim). Also, sometimes my reality got in the way of the book. For example, as &quot;Dilbertian&quot; as HiTek may be as a company, and though I know first hand and through the works of Mr. Scott Adams that MOST companies, no matter how big or small, have complete dunderheads making decisions, it took me the longest time to be convinced that Flip--with her appearance alone, to say nothing of her inability to do her work, etc--would ever be EMPLOYED by any large company, let alone PROMOTED... Multiple times.&quot;Bellwether&quot;, like Ms. Willis's other works (I especially enjoyed &quot;Doomsday Book&quot; and &quot;Uncharted Territory&quot;) is a fine read, desipite the occasional difficulty I had in &quot;willingly suspending disbelief.&quot; I recommend it highly. I ESPECIALLY recommend it to anyone who has ever gone to the mall and wondered why on earth people (especially teens who, like sheep, tend to travel in tight herds and follow their own bellwether) feel the need to do what everyone else is doing."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"I really admire Connie Willis' talents. She is usually pigeonholed as a science fiction author, but she is really much more than that.BELLWETHER is a short novel that involves a group of scientific researchers doing work for a dysfunctional corporation. Willis has great fun skewering office life, and the herd-like tendency of society to blindly follow trends, no matter how silly they may seem. Most of this novel is quite funny, but it's also filled to the brim with a lot of interesting historical and scientific ideas.If you enjoy intelligently written satire, I think BELLWETHER will be right up your alley. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and believe this novel, which is easy to read and finish, serves as a nice introduction to Willis' writing style. If you enjoyed this novel, I would recommend one of Willis' longer works, TO SAY NOTHING OF THE DOG."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Maybe it's not science fiction, but Bellwether is a marvelous update of one of the lesser-known fairy tales. Equal parts satirical social commentary, satirical business commentary, comedy of manners, and love story, Bellwether is set in a hilariously dysfunctional supposedly scientific research facility.Connie Willis demonstrates her usual deftness with plot and characters. Bellwether is a lovely light summer vacation-type story, very well-written and just serious enough. Each chapter has a brief discussion of a historical fad, which of which is no less ludicrous than the rapidly changing fads of food or personal ornamentation that run through the story."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"During the summer of 1960, I was assigned to assist a professor in the Social Psychology Department at the University of Missouri with a project on the grocery-buying habits of central Missouri housewives. That was in the days of punch cards and a big mainframe computer that occupied a room in the College of Business Administration that was about the size of the house I now live in.Willis' Bellwether is much more about the social sciences than it is about the physical sciences, which may be why some reviewers were unhappy with it. From the perspect of a social historian who works in a large bureaucracy, it comes through as an excellent satire."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Since having this title recommended to me through Amazon, I have since added Connie Willis to my list of favorite authors. I have recommended this book to many friends and have handed out a copy or two. No one has been disatisfied yet! It's a great blend of smart writing and a slice of contemporary life with a bit of science and romance thrown in. It reminds me a bit of the movie Office Space in it's look at corporate life."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"When will America's critics wake up and recognize Ms. Willis for what she is? She stays in the SciFi ghetto where her many fans are happy to have her but where the larger crowd of general readers will never hear of her. Willis can hold her own with the best of them. Doomsday Book was a moving drama which offered wise thoughts on the roles of science and religion in society. Bellwether is wonderful social satire. C'mon you eggheads! Time to wake up and smell the genius!"},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"This is the kind of book you can't keep to yourself. After I read it I forced it on as many friends as I could, who in turn lent it out to their friends and co-workers. By the time I got it back probably 20 people had read it and loved it. I won't get into details of the plot, as lots of others have done that, but suffice it to say that this is a brilliant read. I often had to stop reading because I was laughing so hard, and I tried (unsuccessfully) to take several days to read it so it wouldn't end so quickly. Connie Willis is wickedly funny, and spot-on in her depiction of &quot;New Management&quot;, as anyone who has worked in a large institution or corporation will attest. I Flip-ed for this book!"},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"&quot;Bellwether&quot; is an amusing, light read, but it is hardly science fiction.Sandra is a sociologist studying fads. Bennett is a physicist specializing in chaos-theory working in animal behavior. Together using an interdisciplinary approach, they try to define the chaotic nature of faddish behavior in mammalian populations by studying a herd of sheep. All this against the background of a &quot;science&quot; factory, and the ultimately, hip population of Boulder, Colorado.Willis's prose is good, the story is light, breezy, and funny as she pokes fun at every target within range. The author's treatment of the main character's friends and colleagues is particularly funny. They are all technically sound and socially impossible. I found the capsule summaries of various fads and discussion of the serendipitous nature of some important science discoveries interesting.This story is however without any depth and could have been written as a short story. The end was apparent before half the novel was read. In addition, it can only be called science fiction because the main characters are scientists and it is a work of fiction.&quot;Bellwether&quot; is humorous. It reminds me of Po Bronson's The First $20M is the Hardest', although not quite as dark. It's a quick read that will keep you smiling."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"I knew I would enjoy this novel after reading the first 3 or 4 pages. The history of science and the stories of scientific discovery scattered throughout the book was something that I felt really added to this story dealing with scientific discovery itself. The first third of the book moves along steadily. The humor gets a little 'same-y' throughout the rest of the book, however, as the same jokes are recycled. The resolution is satisfying even though it's a bit unbelieveable. I mean, haven't typical Hollywood happy endings become a fad? Still, I liked the book overall. This was my first Connie Willis novel but it won't be my last.I have to take issue with couple of things . First of all, how many times do we have to read about people rolling their eyes and sighing? And it seems that not all people roll their eyes but mostly clerks and waiters/waitresses, according to Ms. Willis. And of course the notion that the anti-smoking movement, even taken to extremes, is a fad is completely ludicrous. The notion that anyone who is anti-smoking does not think for themselves is also preposterous. According to Ms. Willis it seems that if there is something everyone is doing then it's a fad and this is just not the case in issues like environmentalism, anti-smoking, human rights, etc. which are fueled by passion. Yes, things taken to an extreme viewpoint are dangerous but Ms. Willis' writing in 'Bellwether' is much too black and white to be credible."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"I read two, three pages of reviews on Amazon last week. As a result, I purchased the book over the weekend--from the SF rack. I read it. I actually expected a story with a plot-line integrating and explaining Mandelbrot diagrams and chaos theory. No such luck.Okay, this book was breezy, maybe too breezy. Sometimes the non-stop semi-diary style killed me. I read the first forty pages. What's the point? Are the characters trying to make a point? Where are the conflicts that shape a narrative other than good doctor Sandra Foster's disgust with the irritant, Flip (daily), and with the ivory tower-ed, nameless \\"Management?\\" Dr. Foster's search for the origins of fads is just not compelling enough for this reader. The fad anecdotes at the beginning of each chapter are informative; although the song, \\"Feelings,\\" did not hit the charts till 1976; sorry, Ms. Willis.On to page 50, 60, 100 and so on. Still the cute, clever, repetitive prose and no compelling story. One begins to take shape between pages 130 and 200: Dr. Foster must find funding for a project or lose a job at HiTek. Her (non)relationship with Dr.Bennett, a fellow researcher just doesn't elicit much sympathy nor generate any sparks. What difference does what Bennett wears or does not wear make? Flip is an incompetent, semi-literate flake. So? I pressed on. There's got to be more to this story than the silliness of this Dilbertesque universe.Finally, the obligatory, slap-stick \\"chase scene.\\" Sheep (heavy symbolism) stampede into the corporate office and management reaches the end of its rope with Drs. Foster and Bennett.By page 230, things began to fall in place. At that point, I just wanted this book to end. I get it: chaos leads to brilliant discovery/revelation/epiphany and all is right with the world (I won't spoil the bellwether point of the story). And true love is rewarded, etc.Should I mention the deux ex machina subplot-ending?At any rate, didn't the late John Kennedy Toole say as much and brilliantly in _A Confederacy of Dunces_? At the center of chaos reigns a perfect order.If you enjoy Trivial Pursuit and all things pop from different cultures, this is for you. In that case, author Willis connects the trivia dots with a love story of sorts woven into the narrative."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"I was looking for something a little different and downloaded this after a quick scan of the description.The pacing is incredibly slow and the characters are barely half-dimensional. Young people are ALL (and I mean EVERY...SINGLE...ONE) depicted as rude, slow and lazy. And all the standard academic stereotypes make appearances just as if they were on a checklist: Dullard management, sniping coworker, harried working mother, poorly dressed professor, etc.I thought that it must have been a self-published effort and was willing to at least give the author credit for starting and finishing the book. That's not the case; the author is quite experienced and well-published.And as the book \\"develops\\" we still learn nothing about any of these people. But at least...nothing interesting ever happens.Can't help but think that this was nothing more than a little fluff project written during a brief down period between more substantial projects. It certainly was not worth my time or money."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"...heavy on bureaucracy and light on satire.Take all the plot typically found in a three-panel Dilbert cartoon -- stretch it out to a thin 247 pages -- and you have Bellwether.So despite the fact that I'm fascinated with fads, emergent systems, chaos theory, etc., the book failed to hold my interest.Given the high praise that Connie Willis has received for her other books, I'll assume that this was a rare misfire."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"This is an attempt at a Katherine-Hepburn/Spencer-Tracy sort of romantic farce. The Hepburn character is a sociologist researching trying to discover why flappers bobbed their hair in the twenties. This circumstance affords the author the opportunity to skewer various fads circulating in the middle nineties. One problem is that Ms. Willis and her heroine define &quot;fad&quot; very loosely and arbitrarily: for example, a running theme is that legislation which prohibits smoking in public places is a pernicious and monumentally unjust fad--smokers with persecution complexes will be sympathetic, the rest of us simply annoyed. Another problem is that, unlike her Tracy character, whom she exalts for his imperviousness, the author is herself very susceptible to insidious fads of language: I found one &quot;hopefully&quot; pretending to mean &quot;I hope,&quot; two &quot;oxymoron&quot;s used incorrectly (an oxymoron is by definition not just any contradiction in terms, but a deliberate literary device), and one &quot;just that&quot; (a perfectly correct but obnoxious rhetorical mannerism prevalent in the eighties). Overall, the prose is glib and perfunctory. The climax and denouement of &quot;The Bellwether&quot; are predictable, unconvincing, unsatisfying, and forced. (On the other hand, the protest about libraries throwing out classics that happen not to have been checked out lately to make room for tens of copies of worthless ephemeral bestsellers is very much on the mark.)"},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Connie Willis is a talented writer, and some of the individual pieces and passages in this novel are very clever. In *Bellwether*, she includes a lot of fun little historical facts relating to the history of fads, but she then ruins the lighthearted satirical mood (for me) by harping again and again in quasi-curmudgeonly fashion on &quot;anti-smoking&quot; as nothing more than &quot;another aversion fad&quot; apparently perpetrated by airheads and idiots. This makes me suspect that she's a smoker who feels herself persecuted, so she's used this book as a bully pulpit to brand those who want to eliminate smoke from public places as mere fad followers who don't &quot;think for themselves.&quot; Phooey. In taking this tack, I think she blew it (so to speak). Basically, I think that when writing satire, the author/protagonist either has to be extremely self-deprecating (like Dave Barry), or else must be prepared to have one's sympathetic audience limited to those who share his or her own personal likes/dislikes/prejudices (as overtly political satirists do). I found that Willis ultimately comes across as elitist in a sneering rather than clever way, and the sometimes interesting plot line and intermittent splashes or humor simply are not enough to transcend this overall negativity."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Often missclassified by libraries, this is not science fiction but rather fiction about scientists and about corporate life. If you want more on jargon, consult http://www.thespewfactor.com/ and read You Look Nice Today by Stanley Bing or A Shortage of Engineers by Robert Grossbach.Each chapter of this splendid and well-researched read, with the exception of three, is headed by a description of a fad. The three errors are dancing mania (public health problem not a fad), coueism (still in existance in the Church of Religious Science), and ouija board (used to communicate with the dead). Why the errors? carelessness or indifference on the writer's part? a deliberate puzzle? My own guess is that she simply forgot until some copy editor calling an hour before the deadline demanded three more fads."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Let's be clear: There is no reason to fault a science-fiction writer for not writing science fiction, but there is every reason to fault a novel that purports to be about science and isn't. If you want an exciting, light, very readable book that makes you feel you are taking part in an important scientific discovery and teaches you something about science without taxing your powers of concentration, read Watson's &quot;Double Helix&quot;. (It may comfort you to know that some consider &quot;Double Helix&quot; as much fiction as &quot;Bellwether&quot;. I can't say, but if &quot;Double Helix&quot; is fiction, it is certainly better fiction.)The anti-anti-smoking tract obtrusively interlaced into the plot (such as it is) of &quot;Bellwether&quot; is not funny or witty or even believable. The author's protagonists, the one a sociologist, the other a scientist (though the author seems insensible of the distinction) are portrayed as non-smokers who are not the least bit discomfited by close-range cigarette smoke. Here's the straight dope, smokers: If any such persons exist in real life, they are strange physiological freaks. (Want to be honest? Next time don't ask, &quot;Do you mind if I smoke?&quot; Ask either, &quot;Are you a smoker too?&quot; or, &quot;Will you suffer my smoking mutely?&quot;)"},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"I read this book for a Book Club and was disappointed because it really is not discussion material. There is one clever idea about society having bellwether individuals which is belabored to death. This book is adequate for it's genre - that being low-brow sci-fi with some slap-stick humor. Other than that it is formulaic and repetitive. Even for summer reading it's a lightweight. I give it two stars because it does have one good idea, and it is a nice example of how to stick tightly to a formula when writing fiction."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"This is a carefully researched novel which had my wife and I rolling with laughter. While, strictly speaking, not science fiction, it is certainly speculative fiction. Nice analysis of fads, and a glimpse of chaos theory which could have been better explained. However, such an explanation would have made this book heavy and dull."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"The scientist-heroine of Connie Willis's superb take on research institutions, management bungling, and chaos theory is pursuing a bunch of seemingly-unrelated historical links, looking for something common to them all. What she finds is delightful, funny, clever, and quintessentially Connie Willis. Bellwether, like all of the author's work, transcends genre and goes for the jugular: simply, a very good, unforgettable read. Willis is unique, like no other, and should not be buried in the science-fiction section of bookstores. In the best of bookstores (in the best of all possible worlds, as one philospher once said... ), she would be hand-sold by booksellers who read and love books. Jo Manning (drmwk@juno.com"},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"This book was really a fun read, but it went on just a little too long. Or maybe it covered it's own tracks once too often.The characters are truly colorful, and the story sets up fast. At the beginning, you feel like you want to settle in for a good long read. Along the way, notes about fads and fetishes from ancient times until today are splashed throughout the book. Descriptions of todays cool coffeehouse chic are hilarious.The first time you read about the research company and it's backwards way of moving forward, you will be laughing out loud. The second time, you may smile. After that, you get really tired of covering the same flat ground. In my opinion, the story screamed for virtual reality: a more three- dimensional view of research funding and corporate life (there's no shortage of satire material there.)The most uncomfortable part of the book is that the ending is disappointingly predictable. Despite this drawback, the story stays with you: after reading the Bellwether, you can't stop looking for bellwethers wherever you go."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"This book is not for lovers of hard core sci-fi. In fact, it has few elements of traditional sci-fi.What Bellwether does contain is an entertaining plot, given substance by a subtext of chaos theory in action, sympathetic and realistic characters, and satirical humor. Willis takes aim at fads and trends, modern romance, and corporate lifestyles, and she delivers the goods.Douglas Coupland + John Irving x Kurt Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Most reviewers here are saying what I wanted to say about this book, pointing out that it is social satire, not science fiction, and it contains hilarious dialog and a perfect sendup of corporate culture. The descriptions of fads heading each chapter are fascinating. So, I'm just chiming in with those who loved it.Apparently some reviewers think that a lighthearted representation of dense scientific theory is not appropriate, but I thought that was perhaps the most amazing aspect of this tightly written book. Rarely has so much laughter been wrapped around such complex ideas."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"I was well into this book, still waiting for an SF element to kick in, when I finally realized that it wasn't going to happen. What can we call this-- romantic satirical physics fiction? There's a cute little love story, some sharp satire from the world of research science, some nice application of chaos theory and, well, not much else. Ultimately this is fluff, but well written, well informed, and funny fluff."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"Prior to picking this up, I'd read and greatly enjoyed two of Willis' other books:To Say Nothing of the DogandDoomsday Book. However, despite the science fiction packaging, this one is a completely different kettle of fish -- and not in a good way. It's basically a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy blended with an unsuccessful social satire. The heroine is a sociologist working for some kind of research firm (how this firm actually makes money is entirely unclear) who is attempting to isolate what triggers social fads in general, and hair bobbing in particular. She's kind of a Sally Sad Sack, smart and sensible but never sticking up for herself even when she knows she's been wronged. The question is whether she will succumb to the attention of a trend-following rancher, or pursue a decidedly untrendy physicist working on chaos theory. Just as the answer to that is entirely obvious the first time we meet the characters involved, so too is the satire entirely obvious and dead on the page.About 1/3 of the satire is directed at the firm the heroine works for, but making fun of giant companies is like shooting fish in a barrel, and there's nothing remotely fresh or funny about Willis' efforts here. However, if you think jokes revolving around how the \\"Simplified Funding Application Form\\" is actually longer than the original form, then maybe you'll get some giggles out of this. Personally, I found it all pretty tedious. Similarly, there is a lot of oversatirization of trends which mainly comes off as cranky and dated, rather than light fun. Indeed, it reads all too much like an author working out their frustration with modern society. Overall, quite disappointing, considering how much I enjoyed the other books of hers I'd read."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"I love this book to death! It's marketed as science fiction -- mainly because Connie Willis is a science-fiction author -- but I don't think it really is. It's a novel about science and scientists. It's also a wacky, screwball romantic comedy. It's a great deal of fun! Lighthearted and funny, but it also deals with some deeper issues -- specifically, the nature of scientific discovery. It was a joy to read."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"BELLWETHER was recommended to me a few years ago when the bureaucracy was too much with me late and soon. Since then, I've given copies to friends when they need comic relief from corporate culture or trendiness of any kind. This satire of contemporary manners is not searing and it will not solve a reader's own issues, but it is fun to watch Willis kickbox the major annoyances of our lives. That this is classified as science fiction is a stretch; it follows fictitious scientific research at a high tech firm in the present day without alien intervention, genetics gone mad, time travel or alternative history. So much is it in the present day that many of the over-the-top trends that the one scientist studies or is otherwise annoyed by are many of those we're still enduring or by now are waving, gratefully, good-bye. Think flavored coffee drinks and angels, name brand catalogue clothes and expensive ugly sandals. Lest we never forget, Barbie dolls. This wouldn't be Connie Willis without a Disney idea of an adult flirtation, but this time the characters aren't unduly sappy. I find it a little odd that Willis decides to illustrate her protagonist's good nature in rejecting the politically correct by subtly promoting smokers' rights. Smoking transcends the political despite the tobacco lobby--it is NOT a good choice no matter what and smoke-free workplaces and restaurants are examples of social progress in the very late 20th century. This book deserves three and a half stars, but since there are no &quot;halvsies&quot; allowed and since it is worth passing around, it gets 4."},{"Title":"Bellwether","review":"If you're looking for your first Connie Willis book, read The Doomsday Book, To Say Nothing of the Dog, or Passage first. Any of those three are so much better than this. But, Bellwether is fun, sometimes funny, and a lightweight read. It's short enough to blow through, uncomplicated enough not to require flipping back to be sure you didn't miss anything. Anyone who works in an office will recognize all of the office characters and politics - they're universal sure gags we all love to identify with."},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"I very much enjoyed this story and the series of Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency books by Alexander McCall Smith.

The simple, straightforward way in which he has his characters think and speak makes the mind pictures he draws funnier than they would be if he wrote more elaborately. I found this book to be the funniest one yet. Each reader will respond differently as to any given book, but I love the low key humor that comes from Smith's hand.In this episode, we find Mma Makutsi moving into a \\"home\\" of her own. She's come a long way from her extremely humble beginnings in Bobonong. Mma Potokwane wants Mr J.L.B. Matekoni to make a parachute jump, and she and Mma Ramotswe talk wedding plans. Then there are the four suitors of the wealthy Mma Hologna. She would like to know who wants her for her and who wants her for her money. She and Precious Ramotswe have the following conversation upon first meeting:\\"You are very kind to see me,\\" (Mma Hologna) said as she sat down on the chair in front of Mma Ramotswe's desk. \\"I can imagine how busy you must be.\\"\\"Sometimes I am busy,\\" said Mma Ramotswe. \\"And then sometimes I am not. I am not busy today. I am just sitting here.\\"\\"That is very good,\\" said Mma Hologna. \\"It is good just to sit sometimes. I like to do that, if I get the chance. I just sit.\\"\\"There is a lot to be said for that,\\" said Mma Ramotswe. \\"Although we would not want people to do it all the time, would we?\\"\\"Oh no,\\" said Mma Hologna hurriedly. \\"I would never recommend that.\\"This kind of exchange happens often in the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series. I find them extraordinarily insightful and hilariously funny in the simple way in which they portray the depth of basic human communication and societal rituals, like manners. In the Botswana of Mma Ramotswe, having good manners is extremely important.I continue to be impressed by how well AMS understands the human psyche, both male and female. The women in this series are particularly wise and clever in the way in which they can manipulate the men in their lives. There are two delightful instances in Full Cupboard where Mma Makutsi and Mma Ramotswe use psychology extremely well to alter circumstances for a better outcome.

He was both an hereditary ruler and an elected official. Mma Ramotswe had no outstanding matters to investigate as the book begins. She wants her house and business and that of her fiance to remain typical of old Botswana, exceedingly friendly. Her fiance, Mr. Maketoni, says they will get married next year or maybe the year after that.If the matron of the orphan farm wrote a book, she would call it How to Run an Orphan Farm. Mr. Maketoni heads the matron's list of supporters. He is credited with chasing a snake away into the bush. The matron wants Mr. Maketoni to parachute from an airplane as a fundraising stunt. In the old Botswana people were still willing to do things without prospect of reward. Mr. Maketoni offers to fix the butcher's Rover car. He discovers a rival garage has been guilty of fraud when purporting to repair the Rover. The parachute jump is announced in the newspaper.The characters of the stories are like an ensemble. It is determined that Charles, one of the apprentices, will do the jump in place of Mr. Maketoni. Mma Ramatoswe's assistant tells her that Mr. Maketoni is miserable. It seems that he is perplexed about what to do about the butcher's Rover car. Mr. Maketoni does not like conflict. The matron knows the man, the mechanic responsible for the problems with the butcher's car. She confronts him. He is a living illustration of the saying that all bullies are cowards at heart. The matron solves Mr. Maketoni's dilemma.The matron feels that Mr. Maketoni is a man who needs to be organized by a woman. It is decided that his wedding will be held at the Orphan Farm.

They were not fulfilled. The book , while occasionally clever, never really held my interest and was not compelling. Maybe the earlier ones are better, but reading this one did not inspire me to find out."},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"This is the fifth No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency novel, and by now author Smith has gotten the formula down pat. He has a series of things which never seem to change from book to book: the main character, Precious Ramotswe, and her sidekick Mma Makutsi. Mma and Rra are apparently Mrs. and Mr. in Botswana. The author adopts the conceit that there's no need for him to explain things like this to you; you should already know. This is similar to the late Patrick O'Brian, who never explained any of the terms, nautical or just obsolete, that he used in his Aubrey/Maturin novels. Usually, in each of these books, there's a problem, perhaps two or three, and the author follows the characters around as they deal with them.In the current story, as much as there's a detective story here it's that Mma Ramotswe has been hired to investigate a series of suitors for the hand of a local, wealthy businesswoman. In a separate story-thread, there's the question of whether Mma Ramotswe's fiance, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni (he's always referred to that way) should jump out of an airplane with parachute attached for the purpose of raising money for the local orphanage, where he does chores for the woman who runs the place, fixing machinery and so forth. And lastly there's the question of the impending marriage between Mma Ramotswe and Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, and when that will occur (if ever).Smith is rather practiced at this now, and this is a worthwhile entry in the series. It's not the most exciting book in the series, and the series isn't the most exciting one in the book world by any stretch of the imagination, but the books are fun, including this one."},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"One of the best parts of Alexander McCall Smith's series is that each book improves in terms of character definition and advancing the plot. Book 5 integrates Precious Ramotswe with the other characters in a more realistic and intriguing way. The author hints at the distinctions we must draw between manipulation and persuasion (in the character of Mma Potokwane), fear and caution (with Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni's never-ending engagement to Mma Ramotswe), and speaking one's mind and biting one's tongue (aptly expressed in the character of Mma Makutsi.)Fans of the series who may by this time be frustrated with a lack of resolution to certain issues, will be slightly pacified in this book. McCall Smith highlights some of the more minor, yet regular, characters, filing out the world of Mma Ramotswe's Botswana. This book manages to be endearing without the sense of condescension that some complain about with the first book. By Book 3, the author seems to have pulled up his proverbial chair and can now dialogue comfortably with his characters. The Full Cupboard of Life continues this trend and promises to bring the story to an enriching and delightful end in the final two books of the series."},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"Don't you just wish the whole world was as polite and heartwarming as the characters of the #1 Ladies Detective Agency series? In this excellent 5th entry of the series, our favorite folks from Botswana deal with problems associated with cold feet leading into a marriage, intentions of a set of male suitors, and parachute jumping. The wisdom of Mma Ramotswe guides the reader through more of life's lessons along the way. Can she help her fiance save face but avoid danger as he got persuaded into a situation he didn't want? Of course she can. Mma Ramotswe and her assistant Mma Makutsi can do anything!

If you are looking for a book with mystery plots, twisted characters and thrilling endings, this is not a book for you.I recommend this book because the genuine characters in the book. They live in a simple village where everyone knows everybody and you can tell the good from the bad. People do things base on trust. And they can rely on each other. They might not have all the luxuries as we do: having showers in one's own home is considered well off. Yet, these people seem to have relationships based on trust and friendship rather than basing on money,Yes, they have cunningness too, such as those cheating mechanics from First Motor and those liar suitors that only had money in mind when they proposed, but even those problems were easily solved, as if only happened in a perfect fairy tale setting. I am not sure if this is intentional, or if this is really how Botswana people are.The cleverness of the characters, the goodness and genuine of the people and the warm feeling you have after reading this book - all three are reasons to give this book a 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"While not my favorite of the series, there is still much to cherish in the fifth installment of the No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. Precious is concerned Mr J.L.B. Metekoni will never go through with his promise of marriage, and Mr J.L.B. has his own concerns about a fundraising stunt he gets roped into. The main case Precious takes is the weakest part of the book seeing as she's to investigate the intentions of four suitors to a wealthy business woman, yet at the end of the book had only seen two and the story concluded. However, this small complaint didn't detract from the overall enjoyment of a series that continues to warm the heart and soul."},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"With each book I fall more in love with the writing of Alexander McCall Smith.

Smith seems more interested in portraying the humanity of his African characters.Mma \\"Precious\\" Ramotswe runs the No. 1 Ladies' Detective agency, but her principal case in this episode deals with an affair of the heart. She is hired to do a background check on five possible suitors for a woman who has acquired a small fortune running a hair-braiding franchise. Smith also deals with Mma Ramotswe's personal life. The man in her life, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, has been bullied into volunteering for a parachute jump by the \\"traditional-sized\\" Mma Potokwane, a domineering orphanage administrator. Matekoni is also dragging his feet in respect to setting a wedding date.J.L.B. Matekoni manages an automotive repair shop next to Precious's detective agency. The two apprentices who work for him cause him additional grief because of their obsession with girls and loud music and because of their sloppy work habits.Smith characters can inspire humor and pathos. Ramotswe's assistant, for instance, has a brother who died of AIDS, but emulating Precious Ramotswe, she has pulled herself up by the bootstraps and scored a 97 on her secretarial exam. AND she knows shorthand, a skill not every secretarial graduate can lay claim to.I haven't read any of the other books in the series, but I plan to go back and start at the beginning with THE NO. 1 LADIES DETECTIVE AGENCY. The humility of Precious Ramotswe and her fellow characters is refreshing to say the least. American mystery writers could learn something from Alexander McCall Smith."},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"I have read the other books in this series and I still glance every now and then at the author's name and bio to assure myself that it was indeed written by a man and not a woman.

It's as if the author wrote this one sleeping. There is only one small case, and in the end Precious marries JLB Maketoni. The admittedly wonderful characters from past books are present, but they are warmed over. There is no growth in their characters or their lives. Some, like the two children Maketoni adopts are dropped with only one or two mentions in passing. I did not finish the book except to check the last few pages. I recommend reading the first book. That was the truly memorable one."},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"First the bad news. Full Cupboard, the fifth book in this charming series, is a major disappointment, dropping off in quality in almost all aspects. If it were the last book in the series, I'd tell fans to simply skip it and hang on to the fond memories of books one through four. Now the good news. While Cupboard is painfully disappointing, number six in the series, In the Company of Cheerful Women, returns full-heartedly to the quality of the rest of the books. So the drop-off is only temporary.That said, there isn't much else to say about this one beyond the recommendation to simply skim it for the basic plot and then move on quickly to the next one. Full Cupboard seems tired and incomplete. As if Smith were either no longer interested in the series and its characters or as if he sent in a very rough draft to get the publisher off his back. The gentle humor, the fond warmth, the small insights into the people and place of Botswana are all seriously lacking here. The mysteries, while never a major part of the previous books, have here been shrunk down to almost nothing and certainly nothing the reader cares much about. The personal side of the book, always a prevalent aspect, here focuses on Mr. Matekoni's long delay in asking Precious to marry him, a problem that is far too drawn out, far too predictable in its conclusion, and therefore just not very compelling. Suffice to say that readers won't miss much if they skip this one altogether, but if they feel the need to read the series in order, they should skim right through it. As for those new to the series, this is definitely not the book to start with. Less because of plot (the first four books are somewhat recapped and anyway the plots aren't all that important to the series) than because it stands out as so much worse than the other. The series is highly recommended; this book not at all."},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"FABULOUS!

I sadly found myself straying from the read and not as interested in the story line. Although the same cleverness is there, especially in the solution to Maketoni's promised fund-raising parachute jump, I kept wanting to know how all the marriage candidates for the rich hairdresser who employs Mma Ramotswe will match up.

The relative simplicity of these stories is in stark contrast to the complex plots and characters of much of today's detective fiction, and, frankly, it is a real pleasure just to enjoy some good, wholesome episodes set in a different place and not bathed in blood. The references to life and the traditions and culture of Botswana are reminiscent of Tony Hillerman and the adventures of Jim Chee and The Legendary Lieutenant in Navajo country, with Smith giving us a glimpse of what amounts to a different time and place.

Ramotswe is becoming slightly despairing of ever getting a firm wedding date from the gentlemanly but passive J.L.B. Matekoni. And poor Mr. Matekoni grapples with double-trouble...on one hand, Mma. Potokwani is pressuring him to help with a fundraiser for the orphanage...BY JUMPING FROM AN AIRPLANE. On the other hand, he's outraged over the shoddy work down by a fellow car repair shop, and feels it is his duty to confront the ethically challenged owner. Mma. Ramotswe also has an interesting case of her own, investigating the would-be husbands to a rich business woman.If you've never read the series, then the paragraph above should be pretty incomprehensible to you. And that is as it should be. This series rewards careful devotion and it must be read from the start! While the plots are not as complex and fraught with action as say THE LORD OF THE RINGS or even a multi-generational epic from someone like John Jakes...they DO take you through the seemingly mundane but nonetheless very rewarding lives of some folks in Botswana who are very, very interesting to learn about.This book has all the by now familiar patterns and tone of all of Alexander McCall Smith's works in the series. A crisp, clean evocation of the land. An appreciation of the fact that not all modern thoughts and ideas are superior to the \\"old ways.\\" An affection for all his characters that readily carries to the reader. A meandering style that seems to be leading virtually nowhere, but is capable of landing with an emotional impact. Gentle mysteries. And the ability to make us root for these ordinary folk as they grapple with such ordinary yet immediately identifiable problems and quandaries. I feel the characters in these books are really like old friends, and each time I visit with them, it's a treat.So, if you're a fan, the 2nd paragraph of this book ought to be enough to make you want to dive in to the series again. You know what I mean when I describe the tone of the books...and you know you want to see what our old friends are up to!If you've not read the series, I hope you'll take all the subsequent paragraphs as my little plea to give it a try. They are delicate little books...easily devoured and enjoyed, but they linger just a little bit for a long time.I don't know how McCall Smith does it...but this elderly Scotsman depicts these African men and particularly women with such care, his style never ceases to amaze me, and always leaves me wanting more.All the books in the series are HIGHLY recommended (at least through Part 5...that's as far as I've gotten.)"},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"I began with book one and couldn't set it down.

The plot is no plot at all. It is a big rich slice of the cake we call life seen through the critical eyes of a woman and tasted through her own tongue and mouth, a woman who sort of deconstructs and reconstruct the world around her for our pleasure. She explores the characters and behaviors of simple people because that is her job, being a private detective, and she has the trust of several other people which enables her to bring into the picture, her picture, all the hues and details the others can contribute. It is also a novel in which several types of women are the media we need to capture the world. These women are different but they have one common point: their enterprising spirit, even faith, that makes them do things, even risky things, and take the lead around themselves, gathering people and blazing the trails that will bring other people out of the bush to take and follow some road or path to the future, their future, that can only be that of everyone, since everyone has to take part and the future of each one of them, of us, has to be part of the future of everyone else. It may take a whole village to educate a child, but it often only takes a few people to set a whole village on the prowl for good and progress. This vision is so African that we can taste the cake of the last few pages and the sweet and pungent feeling it leaves on our tongue. Africa, and Botswana, is a continent where a grain of salt or a lump of sugar can make the difference between sadness and happiness, bleakness and joy. When a man has not reached the level when he may become wasteful, he knows how to appreciate the smaller pleasures of life, like that cup of tea my Buddhist monk students prepared and offered me after the two hours class I had spent with them teaching them the English of Buddhism.

Precious Ramotswe, proprietor of The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, and perhaps the only female detective in all of Africa, with the exception of her assistant, Mma Makutsi. Mma Ramotswe's is an extremely intelligent woman who possesses a keen perception of the human character. She is also a good person with a kind heart and a strong set of values. Most inspiring, however, is her deep and abiding love for Africa, and for Botswana and its people in particular. \\"They are my people, my brothers and sisters. It is my duty to help them to solve the mysteries of their lives. I strongly suggest that any potential reader who has not already been introduced to our protagonist, read \\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\" and other prior books in the series. While not absolutely necessary, it will certainly enhance your experience with Mma Ramotswe and her country.Fortunately Mma Ramotswe and Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, Gaborone's best mechanic, are still planning to wed and both are in good health, as are their two adopted children. Alas, their wedding date has still not been set. And if I am anxious about their very prolonged engagement, well imagine how the lady involved with the procrastinating fiance feels. She doesn't want to pressure him, however, as he has enough problems to contend with at the moment. He is concerned about getting out of a promise to make a parachute jump, which Mma Potokwani finagled him into, in the name of charity. And he is also being distracted by a predicament with a business rival at First Class Motors.Case-wise, a wealthy beauty salon entrepreneur hires Mma Ramotswe to discover which of her many suitors are after her considerable fortune, and what their true motives for matrimony are. And assistant detective Makutsi's 'Kalahari Typing School for Men' is doing so well, she can afford to move...to a house with running water.As most readers of the series know by now, this is not an ordinary crime novel/police procedural. Nor is it an edge-of-your-seat mystery thriller. Mma. Ramotswe is a private detective, but she manages to solve mysteries without the use of guns and violence, preferring to use unorthodox solutions instead.The narrative is written simply, in a clear, uncluttered style. And our Number One Detective is a pure delight, as are the people she deals with, and their everyday problems which she helps them resolve.JANA"},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"For some reason (perhaps because of the way this series gets classified) I thought these were mysteries. There really isn't much in the way of mystery in this book, at least, despite the fact that the lead character is a detective.The Botswana (country just north of South Africa -- home of the Kalahari desert) setting is a major component of this series. It's hard to imagine the same story told elsewhere. The background in this story -- whose name is never actually mentioned -- is the AIDS crisis in this area, which accounts for the orphans in the story and presumably a brother of one of the character who dies after a long illness. Much of the book concerns the culture in Botswana, particularly the tension between the traditional culture and new ways (not-so-thin women are described as being traditionally shaped, for example, and modesty is a traditional value). In a way, this is an African version of Jan Karon's world -- where people know and care about each other, and the villains -- such as there are -- get dealt with gently.There are several gentle plots moving through the book -- the main character's is tiring of her very long engagement to a very decent man who is afraid to commit; this man gets bull-dozed by a matriarch running an orphanage into agreeing to skydive for a benefit and doesn't know how to get out of it; a customer comes to the detective and wants to know how she can tell which of her suiters are interested in her for her money, etc.I intend to read more in the series, but if you're only interested in reading real mysteries or strongly plotted novels, be warned. This is a thoughtful book about another culture and the wisdom to be learned from other cultures."},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"This whole series is a treasure to behold.

For anyone who loves the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series, this is a gorgeously written end to the series, which ties up all the loose ends nicely. It is less concerned with Precious Ramotswe's detective work than the personal lives of Precious, Mr. J.L.B. Matakone, Precious' secretary, etc. A lovely, life-affirming book. I recommend all the books in this series---truly wonderful, joyful prose, for mystery lovers and literary lovers alike.Another thing you will appreciate about these books is their detailed look into the daily life of Botswana."},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"Life is good. Precious Ramotswe is back. Of traditional build and generous heart she's the indefatigable, irresistible proprietress of Botswana's No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency.Fifth in the highly acclaimed series by Alexander McCall Smith &quot;The Full Cupboard Of Life&quot; finds Mma Ramotswe disconcerted by her long engagement to Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, a true gentleman and the best mechanic in Botswana. She wonders if she will forever be an engaged lady, &quot;a status somewhere between spinsterhood and marriage.&quot;Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni is also distracted.. His two apprentices are disappointments, apparently unable or unwilling to comprehend the high standards required of them in such trustworthy positions. He fears that their lackadaisical work will cause &quot;great sadness among the cars of Botswana.&quot; He also faces a frightening parachute jump, the brainchild of Mma Potokwani.Orphan farm matron Mma Potokwani is formidable. She, too, is of generous proportions, a state that only hinders when she attempts to bend over - a minor inconvenience since she is aware that &quot;Men wanted women whose shape reminded them of good things on the table.&quot;So, blessed with self-esteem and grit that matches her girth she presses on. Using a sweet cake wreathed with raisins as enticement she coaxes Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni into agreeing to jump from a plane as a fund-raiser for the orphans. Thus, the honest, gentle mechanic is reminded again that women are more clever than men. He yearns to disabuse her of this dangerous plan. Yet he fully realizes the difficulty in standing up to women - &quot;it appeared to make little difference.&quot;Mma Potokwani also tackles Botswana's's longest engagement, urging Mma Ramotswe to set a wedding date. When Mma Ramotswe demurs, explaining that Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni likes to consider things for long periods of time, Mma Potokwani counters with, &quot;That is a weakness......there are some men who need to be organized by women.&quot;Mma Ramotswe agrees with this logic much to the distress of her assistant, Mma Makutsi, who views the orphan home matron as the kind of forceful woman who would exploit a man's gentle nature.Of course, Mma Makutsi would never have the temerity to voice disapproval, even though she is the successful head of a school (engagingly chronicled in &quot;The Kalahari Typing School For Men,&quot;). In addition, her thoughts are occupied by the purchase of a home. No longer must she perform her daily ablutions at an outdoor tap.Her mind also turns to the Agency's latest client who has a problem she envies - four suitors. Mma Holonga is a wealthy woman who made a fortune through hair styling salons and a mixture called Special Girl Hair Braiding Preparation. While Mma Holonga may be adept at hair braiding she knows little about men. She asks Mma Ramotswe to investigate and discover which men are interested in her money and which are interested in her. A challenge, indeed.Botswana is a place where all worries wash away with a steaming cup of bush tea, where it's a pleasure to sit in the sun and talk. &quot;The Full Cupboard of Life&quot; offers wit and wisdom on every page. Read it and you will find yourself very much like Botswanans on happy occasions - ululating with pleasure.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"Like many others, I'm a big fan of the Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency series, but this is a really poor entry that barely even bothers to go through the motions. First of all, Mma Ramotswe has only one case to deal with, a wealthy woman who wants her four suitors checked out to eliminate any golddiggers. The first two she checks out are interesting enough, a bible-thumper seeking to reform bar girls, and a slick radio DJ. But Smith doesn't even get around to the other two, and wraps up that storyline in a very abrupt way. Another plotline revolves around Mr. J.L.B. Matakoni and a dishonest competitor garage, but this is small potatoes that doesn't really amount to much. A third plotline involves Mr. J.L.B. Matakoni's getting dragooned into a parachute jump to raise money for the orphanage, again, doesn't amount to much. The last major plotline concerns the marriage between Mma Ramotswe and Mr. J.L.B. Matakoni -- or rather, the lack thereof. The resolution to this is completely anti-climatic and doesn't do justice to the event. One might forgive the weak plotting if there was some really juicy character development, but there isn't. Even worse, some major characters almost totally disappear: Mma Makutsi has very little role, and the two orphan children adopted by Mr. J.L.B. Matakoni appear only once or twice. The book's got the same warmth and humor as the rest of the series, but it's all sort of perfunctory. One doesn't get nearly the same feel for the country and people. The overall is like looking forward to a weekend visit with old friends, only to find them totally distracted and distant. Big bummer of a book."},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"I loved this whole series, the characters continue to enchant me, but I think the story lines are getting soft and repetitious. That's what happens when writers keep using the same characters over and over: they either grow or shrink. If you want to read the year's best novel, something powerful, historical, exotic, try James Dalesandro's &quot;1906&quot;, about the great San Francisco Earthquake. His portrayal of Enrico Caruso, who sang in San Francisco the night before the disaster and survived, is worth the price alone."},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"Precious Ramotswe and her number one Ladies Detective Agency are back in this wonderful observation on life. As one would expect of a Ladies Detective Agency, much of the mystery to be discovered is gentle, who is the apprentice in J L B Matekoni's Tlokweng Rd Speedy Motors seeing? A Rich married lady it seems, but what is happening at Mr J L B Matekoni's old house, and why is her car going there? Who has broken into Mma Ramotswe's home, and where did the large pumpkin come from. Just what happened to Mma Ramotswe's wonderful van, and why is there someone from her life come back again, and what does he want.This is lovely observation of life, and on lives well-lived. Some of the mysteries in this book are suble, and the outcomes equally so. It is never tacitly explained who broke into Mma Ramotswe's home, but it is fairly clear by the end if you read between the lines. There is also a very philosophical bent to these novels which is touched on at the beginning when Mma Ramotswe sees a burglary in progress. Sometimes things aren't as they seem, and while the thief gets away, she herself stands accused - this situation happens later in the novel, and Precious is able to transfer that feeling to the accused and assist him. Good deeds bring good things, generally.The thing I love most about these books is the gentle way things are resolved. Sometimes through doing almost nothing things become clear. There are no gun fights, no car chases (as such anyway) and generally no horrible suspense, yet there are mysteries to be sloved, and issues to be resolve, and they are done in the traditaionl African way.Lovely gentle humour - a really fun and satisfaying read. I would highly recommned this series!"},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"The Full Cupboard of Life (2003) is the fifth novel in The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, following The Kalahari Typing School for Men. In the previous volume, Mma Makutsi was successful in her typing school, but not in romance. The two orphans have adjusted to living with Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, but Puso was still a little moody. The owner of the competing detective agency gave up and moved out.In this novel, Precious gets a rich client who wants to be married and asks her to check out the final four applicants. Mma Holonga has been very successful and owns a chain of hair salons and other businesses. Now she is forty and unmarried, but she knows that any possible marital candidates will be aware of her wealth.Precious' fiance, Mr. J.L.B Matekoni, is asked to parachute out of a plane to raise money to send a poor talented orphan to a Cape Town singing competition. Then he discovers that a classic Rover has been sadly mistreated by the \\"mechanics\\" of First Class Motors. He arranges for the car to be brought into his garage for remedial work, but Precious recommends that he also put a stop to these fraudulent practices.Mma Makutsi is moving into another home with interior plumbing. Although it is only half a house -- the better half in her opinion -- she will also have half the yard and trees. She can even install a shower; no more washing under the neighbor's water tap. If only her brother had survived to enjoy the new home.This novel continues the adventures -- and misadventures -- of Precious and of her friends and loved ones. Again we read of patriotism and family loyalties, sensibility and pragmatism, and deep understanding of the people of Botswana as shown in Precious and friends. We also read of water main shortages, unpaved roads and backwater villages, but Precious has faith that the people and government will continue to solve these and other problem areas.Highly recommended to McCall Smith fans and to anyone else who enjoys tales of interesting people in faraway places.-Bill Jordin"},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"Precious Ramotswe is beginning to wonder if her fiance, Mr. J.L.B.

Mma Potokwane, the formidable matron of the orphan farm, is pressuring Mr. Matekoni to take a parachute jump for charity. Mma Makutsi, Mma Ramotswe's capable assistant, is excitedly making plans to move into a new home. Meanwhile, tongues are wagging as to why Mma Ramotswe and Mr. J. L. B.

She retains Mma Ramotswe to investigate a group of potential suitors to determine whether they are more interested in marrying her or her money.The author weaves these and other stories together seamlessly into a whimsical, funny, warm, and touching novel. Once again, Mma Ramotswe waxes ecstatic about how lucky she is to live in the noble country of Botswana with its physical beauty and its long-standing traditions of kindness and neighborliness.As I read this series, I cannot help but be struck by how such simply written books can be so moving and engrossing, and by how thoroughly captivating the characters are.

In short, he's a pushover to some people. He's held off marrying Mma Precious Ramotswe, although long pledged to do so, but when he's asked to parachute from an aircraft to benefit the local orphanage, he almost readily agrees. His keeps his manifest terror at the prospect of jumping from an aircraft well hidden. His feelings are less restrained, however, when he discovers poor workmanship by fellow mechanics. Money wasted is money lost and the reputations of auto repairmen are vital.Money is an issue for Mma Holonga, as well. She has money - lots of it. She's a successful businesswoman.

A formidable and delicate task, the President of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency still embarks on another client's quest. As always, it brings her into confrontation with some of life's universal truths.McCall Smith's own powers of observing the world are well demonstrated in this fifth volume of Botswana life. With a clear grasp of the ways of the men and women of this remote African nation, he vividly portrays a life largely alien to our own. Haste is scorned and honesty and manners warmly endorsed. Mma Ramotswe's \\"traditional build\\" is starkly contrasted with the flash trim figures gaudily clothed by today's girls. Superficial thinking has no place in detective work, and Mma Ramotswe has no time for shallow reasoning. The author's Scots ancestry has much bearing in his thinking, but it's not dour Calvinism. McCall Smith's wit is unmatched among today's writers. His ability to cram many vital concepts in his brief narrations is excellent. The books, especially this one, are readable at many levels. Human frailties, dismays and despairs are well mixed with brilliant successes, unexpected achievements and deep love. This book is one of those brilliant successes.

Precious Ramotswe gets a new case for the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency--a woman made wealthy by her hair braiding salons has decided to take a husband and has four suitors. Mma. Ramotswe is hired to determine which is most suitable and which might only be after her money.Author Alexander McCall Smith uses this boyfriend investigation as a jumping off point to consider relationships between men and women. As always, the focus is on Botswanna (a country in southern Africa) with a rich interplay between the traditional culture of this nation and changing society. Intriguing characters, especially Mma. Ramotswe and her secretary/assistant detective, Mma. Makutsi add depth to the story. The lessons aren't especially surprising--men need women to tell them what to do and can't really be trusted to know their own minds--but are told in such a charming way that they seem filled with wisdom.Africa has become the forgotten continent. It seems that we hear about it only in the context of the terrible AIDS epidemic (which is not ignored but ony briefly touched on in this story) or genocide and civil war. McCall Smith takes a different and refreshing tack. Without excessively idealizing the continent, the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series suggests that Africa is filled with people much like ourselves--but different enough that we can learn about them, and about ourselves, by watching and listening as they go about their daily lives.McCall Smith uses a simple writing style, almost as if creating a fairy tale, that simultaneously highlights the differences between his Botswanna and U.S./U.K. society and also reminds us of humanity's universality."},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"Mma Ramotswe is back in fine form, still engaged and still unwed, in Alexander McCall Smith's fifth book in the &quot;Number 1 Ladies' Detective Agency&quot; series.

Meanwhile, Mma Ramotswe has business to attend to. A lady who owns a profitable network of hair braiding salons has four admirers, and wonders if they're after her affections or her money. Mma Ramotswe is hired to find out. As for her assistant detective, Mma Makutsi, the Kalahari Typing School for Men is thriving, and Mma Makutsi is in the middle of moving into her own home with -- of all things -- running water. Things are definitely looking up.&quot;The Full Cupboard of Life&quot; is a delightful addition to the series, but plotwise, it's the weakest of the five so far. The one case Mma Ramotswe is involved in, checking out the four suitors of her client, seems to be almost an afterthought to the plot. In this case, Mma Ramotswe seems less like a detective than an advisor to the lovelorn; and she realizes after solving the case to something less than her client's satisfaction, that even though people may ask your advice, they are going to do just what they intended to do anyway.Despite the anemic plot, &quot;The Full Cupboard of Life&quot; is a delightful read, another paean to the continent bursting with life and color that Smith loves so much.

So I eagerly awaited the fifth installment, &quot;The Full Cupboard of Life.&quot; This novel does not disappoint. Its apparently simplistic use of language still manages to evoke a powerful and alluring image of Mma Ramotswe's beloved Botswana. As with the previous four novels, the &quot;mysteries&quot; of &quot;The Full Cupboard&quot; are slight and are revealed at a leisurely pace. Mma Ramotswe's primary case seems to be to weed out the undesirable suitors of a rich female client. Divining the machinations of the human heart is delicate work and Mma Ramotswe, as ever, proves herself capable to the task.I'm dismayed, though, at previous reviews which cite a lack of plot or &quot;mystery&quot; in &quot;The Full Cupboard.&quot; It bears remembering that the manifesto of Precious Ramotswe's agency was she would not attempt violent or bloody crimes. Also consider that most, if not all readers who review her exploits on this page are probably Western. Mma Ramotswe introduces her readers to the rhythms and social consciousness of her Botswana. For me, the novels provide glimpses into a world whose manners and social niceties may clash with or seem jarring to a Western sensibility. Presumably the stories are set in modern times yet there is no mention of mobile phones or e-mail or the Internet. Human relations, talking face to face is key and, of necessity, sets a story at a slower pace.So let's celebrate Mma Ramotswe, Mma Makutsi and the enigmatic (and gun-shy) Mr. J.L.B.

As an avid Precious Ramotswe fan this book was like a fast food version of the series I've grown to love. There were parts that made me laugh but I feel that the character development was a bit overdone this time around if there is such a thing. Precious didn't seem to be at the center of the book. The book felt rushed. I just knew that the something I was missing would come and it never did. Nice ending but it didn't make up for other things I was missing. I love Precious for her outlook on life as a woman and as a black African. That Mr. McCall Smith is able to capture this is nothing short of amazing. However, this time around I felt Precious' words and those around her were forced. The beauty of the previous books has been on solving mysteries with compassion, common sense, and a deep love for the surrounding country of Botswana. I didn't get a feel for the mystery part of the equation this time around. There was only one mystery that seemed thrown in for good measure and then not even really solved. I know it's hard for an outhor to constantly live up to making each book better than the last but I have a favor to ask of Mr. McCall Smith. Please let Precious and all of her supporting cast do what they do best--be themselves. Many of us feel like we know this woman and all those that surround her so please bring her back to her natural element---being the No. 1 Ladies Detective that Botswana has to offer. I don't consider this a bad book but would only recommend it if you've already enjoyed the previous books, then you can overlook this tiny stumble.

I enjoyed this book so much, I stayed up well past my bedtime to read it. This series is so delightful, that I'm trying to get everyone I know to read it! If you haven't start it today!In this installment, Mma Makutsi, the secretary, assistant manager, and assistant director as well as typing instructor, is doing so much better financially that she is able to move to a much better area of town. In this chapter of the book there is a beautiful description of Mma Makutsi bathing at the shared tap that really brought home to me the utter poverty in which Mma Makutsi lived in order to supply money for her family \\"back home.\\" She really matured in this book and I hope to see some wonderful stories about her in the future.In fact, Precious almost took back seat in this book. Her stories are not as big or detailed, but they are important. Hired by a rich woman to discover the real reason behind her suitors' interest in her, Precious begin investigating them individually. She has issues with letting her personal opinions get in the way, however, and is shocked by a revelation at the end of the book. I think much of Precious's problem with this assignment is her own lengthy engagement to Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. The surprise ending to the book, puts everything together for Precious, though, and leaves the reader waiting impatiently for the next book.Finally, the story surrounding Mr. J.L. B. Matekoni is humorous and sweet. He is pressured into agreeing to consider a parachute jump by the ever-more-involved head of the orphan home, Mma Potokwane (sp?). The older apprentice ends up taking over the arduous task and enjoying himself very much.Lots of allegory and allusion in this book, but it's all subtle and understated. Again, the love of country, landscape and simple way of life pervades the main characters' actions and thoughts.

Readers in far away countries also get a glimpse into the traditional ways of old Botswana. Brew yourself a cup of bush tea (rooibos) and catch up with old friends. Karen Woodworth-Roman"},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"We now return to Botswana, &quot;the fortunate country.&quot; At least according to Mma Ramotswe, founder and chief detective of the No 1. Ladies' Detective Agency. Mma Ramotswe lives in Gabarone, the only city in this country the size of Texas, where the hustle and bustle for a foreigner seems like a race between two snails. But for someone like the traditionally sized Mma, it is still too frantic, causing her to long for weekend visits to her village home. For all Batswana, Mma believes, &quot;those quiet days in the village would prove to be the best time for them.&quot;So we know that, although many hours may pass, not a great deal will occur. We will relax and drink bush tea and think carefully about things, knowing that the facts of the case will present themselves with clarity after a suitable wait.Mma Ramotswe is feeling that it may be time for her fianc&eacute;, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, to make good on his promise to marry her. Money is no object. The good Mma has cattle left to her by her father. But Mr. Matekoni, proprietor of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, is caught up in events in his own life, such as being asked to do a sponsored parachute jump by the very convincing Mma Potokwani, matron of the orphan farm. His intentions are good, but he is a little unclear when it comes to the details of the actual wedding and the setting of a date.Since time passes very, very slowly in Botswana, each of the delightful books in this series by Alexander McCall Smith, who grew up in the region, gives a gracefully unfolding panorama of small, seemingly insignificant happenings in the lives of its central characters. In so doing he illustrates what Mma Ramotswe would teach if she were a teacher and not the proprietress of a successful sleuthing service. If you slow down and look at each thing lovingly and carefully, you will find the answers you seek.In this case, the highly respected Mma has been asked to examine the motives of the four suitors of another dynamic woman, Mma Holonga, owner of a chain of hair braiding emporia. Mma Holonga, being successful, is also wealthy, and fears her suitors may be interested only in her money. So she has consulted with Mma Ramotswe, who promises to investigate each man with care and try to determine who is most sincere in his interest. &quot;Men are always looking at women and judging them,&quot; Mma Ramotswe declares with delight, &quot;Now we have the chance to do some judging back.&quot;In the end, Mma Ramotswe's labors on behalf of Mma Holonga will backfire, in a curious and fitting way, so that she will be bemused but not befuddled. And Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni will find himself moved towards that inevitable moment of tying the knot with Mma Ramotswe, not against his will but in spite of his tardiness in dealing with details. And this will also be all right because &quot;there is no other lady I would ever wish to marry.&quot;In the midst of all this high intrigue and unbridled romance, Mma Ramotswe's secretary finds a new home and Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni's apprentice comes into his own. And the choir sings Nkosi Sikeleli Afrika, &quot;the sweet voices of the children rising through the branches of the tree above them, and filling the still, clear air with sound.&quot;--- Reviewed by Barbara Bamberger Scott (editor@awomanswrite.com)"},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"The subtitle should be &quot;More of the Same.&quot; Same (admirable) characters, same tea, same tiny white van, same predicaments.

The events by all of these characters weave together like a tapestry. These books are short but say much.Mma Potkwane, the matron of the orphans farm, guards the farm and its children like a mother lion. She is always looking for help and donations to benefit this farm and its children. She talks Rra J.L.B. Matekoni into jumping from an airplane in a parachute. Many people will come and donate money to see this which will be put to good use at the farm and for the kids. Mma Potkwane does a lot of good but she is loud and pushy. Rra J.L.B. Matekoni does not want to parachute to earth; he is terrified to, but also does not like to say no to Mma Potokwane. He will ask Mma Ramotswe to beg him off.Rra J.LB. Matekoni,soft spoken, easy going, and a pushover for people is a mechanic, the best, who loves cars. He hates seeing a beautiful piece of machinery abused. He works on a beautiful, expensive old car and fixes it back to what it once was. The owner is delighted, the earlier mechanic did a bad job. Rra J.L.B. Matekoni put this car to right and loved doing this job. He felt it was sacriligious the poor job the other mechanic performed.

Late in the book she does express some remorse that she did so, but when the &quot;trickery&quot; occurred I found it to be jarring and out of character for the kind-hearted and highly moral Mma Ramotswe. I just didn't believe she would do such a thing -- solving her problem by placing the apprentice in great jeopardy.

Smith uses the detective agency as a backdrop, to discuss the morality and ethics of Botswana, as a microcosm of the whole world.Because Botswana is a relatively small country, much of it being desert, the Botswanians tend to know each other, all over the country. This intimacy of course is less in the urban environments than in the more traditional rural areas. Nonetheless, by American standards, even the urban life is rather suburban if not rural in appearance.The issues that Smith concentrates on are the feelings that are universal in virtually every society. While there are specific nuances in each country, and within a country, in each region, still, there are certain things, that are common to all. Men will always seek the love of women. Women will always be more selective than men in choosing their mate.In Botswana, the meeting of the traditional versus the contemporary is deeply explored. The role of women in the Botswanian society is investigated and parsed. There are many types of women in Botswana, as there are many types of women in any part of the world.But Smith also finds, that there are similarities between men and women, and that these similarities are universal and accepted by almost all societies. By using Botswana, as a developing third world nation, Smith allows the reader to look back at the early days of his/her own country, and then see how far their country has come, from inception, to today. While the detective plots lend an interesting backdrop to Smith's message, the real concentration in all of Smith's books in this series are the way in which people do treat others, and the way in which they should treat others. The book provides another wonderful view of cross-cultural interactions and perspectives."},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"I get the sense from reading Alexander McCall Smith's Twitter feed (@McCallSmith) that he is as humane and wise and civilized as his character Precious Ramotswe, who solves problems large and small in her capacity as the proprietress of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency in Gabarone, Botswana. In this 5th installment in the series Mma Ramotswe is hired to look into the backgrounds of a rich woman's numerous suitors. Meanwhile, her colleague Mma Makutsi, relatively flush with cash from her new typing school business, is moving into a new home, which will have its own running water. And Mma Ramotswe cleverly but quietly outwits Mma Potokwane, indomitable matron of the orphan farm, who has gone too far this time in bending Mma Ramotswe's fianc&eacute;, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, to her will. As usual, McCall Smith's prose is simple and lovely, his characters rendered with great affection. And as usual one comes away from the novel refreshed, feeling better about the lot of man. It is the author's peculiar magic, making us feel this way.-- Debra Hamel"},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"This is the fifth in the series of cozy mystery novels featuring Precious Ramotswe, owner of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency of Gabrone, Botswana. This series is very heavy on the 'cozy' and very light on the 'mystery', so those looking for a real puzzler need to look elsewhere. The attraction to this series are the gentle stories involving Mma Ramotswe, her family and friends. Any mystery aspects are resolved by Mma Ramotswe and her secretary/assistant detective Mma Makutsi asking questions and keenly observing those involved.As this installment opens Mma Ramotswe is beginning of ever changing her status as an engaged woman to that of a married one. Her fiance of long standing (much too long standing in her opinion), Mr J. L. B Matekoni has still not mentioned an actual date for the wedding to take place, and now there seems to be too much on his mind for him to get around to it any time soon. Mma Ramotswe has issues of her own to distract her as well, including a client who has marital concerns of her own. Somehow, in her own quiet way, Mma Ramotswe will manage to sort everything out in the end."},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"The setting and description of life and customs in this part of Africa was for me the best part of the novel. Though I was desperate for something to read on a trans-Atlantic flight, I just did not get into this book quickly or for long periods of time. The narrative was a little disjointed, and the series of \\"mysteries\\" never required a lot of investigation, so there wasn't a lot of suspense. The one concerning the good/bad doctor was obvious to me straight away and I was surprised Lady Detective Ramotswe didn't figure it out sooner. The tone of the novel is nice and gentle, sometimes bordering on the naive. Still worth reading for something a little different. For another British mystery set in an exotic locale, tryMurder in the Raw: A Rex Graves Mystery (Rex Graves Mystery)by C.S.

It seemed like a great conclusion to a wonderful series. I can't imagine what will happen next. But I will certainly be reading to find out."},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"When I read the previous book in the series (The Kalahari Typing School for Men), it was clearly the least mysterious of the books in this series to that point: it had the fewest detective cases, instead moving forward the personal lives of the major characters (especially Mma Kutsi). With this, the fifth installment, Smith lowers the mystery quotient even further. The book contains only one detective case (albeit a fun one: find out which of a rich woman's suitors will make the best husband!) and spends relatively little time even on it.This time, the focus returns to Mma Ramotswe's and Mr JLB Matekoni's personal lives. Despite the lack of mystery, the book is a pleasant escape into one of Africa's best-governed and wealthiest countries, with characters you can enjoy and respect. And the book has a fine ending!I made the mistake of reading this installment just a couple of months after the last one: it's better to leave a more time between books in this series, else Mma Ramotswe's musing on the marvels of Botswana (especially the OLD Botswana) can start to feel tired. But given a little rest, this is a relaxing ride back to Jaborone. I'll readthe next book, just not right away.If you're new to the series, don't start here: go back toThe No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. This isn't Agatha Christie: the detective's history actually matters here. And I always listen to the audiobook version (published by Recorded Books), narrated by Lisette Lecat. She is a pleasure to listen to."},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"I think the thing I like most about this series (other than the consistently good writing) is that there is no straining to put the detectives in dangerous situations, no effort to up the body count or indeed to have a body count in each book. This detective does the things that most detectives do--evaluates character, looks for lost things and most importantly lives her life. It's the views into her life that keep me coming back. I had wondered how long the engagement would go on before Precious Ramotswe would ask when she would cease to be an engaged lady and become a wife. That's one of the focuses of this book and I'm not going to tell you what happens.

What a delightful read for a hot summer day under a tree in the back yard. It also brought back happy memories of my travels in Africa. Since the focus is more on character & setting than on plot or mystery, it was especially enjoyable to me.Now that I have made the acquaintance of Mme Ramotswe so late in the game, I am determined to get her life story straight by getting all the other books in the series and reading them in the correct order.So much one hears of Africa is doom and gloom, hopelessness, poverty & war; it is a nice change to read about its people having what we westerners would consider a normal life."},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"I find myself short of the appropriate words to describe this simply unique and special series. \\"Unique?\\" \\"Special?\\" How banal, and yet in this particular case, how very true.Like all of the books in this captivating series, we return to Botswana and ease into the life of Precious Ramotswe, proprietess of the Women's Detective Agency, and her fiance, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, who is a superb mechanic. Here again is Mma Makutsi, still preening after all these years over her final score of 97% at the secretarial school. Here, too, are the vain, skirt-chasing apprentice mechanics, the bane of Mr. Matekoni's life, and all the other doings we know so well.In this particular story, Mma Ramotswe is getting a tad distressed about just how long it is taking Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni to actually get around to marrying her. As she remarks many times, men cannot be pushed or told what to do--and yet...The perfect way to enjoy this book is to take one's tiny white van, drive it home to the verandah, and sip a good, strong cup of bush tea while the pumpkin stew is cooking.

The client needed to know who was after her money and who was truly interested in her for who she was. In addition, Mma Ramotswe was also having a dilemma of her own as her fiancee, Mr. Matekoni did not seem to be in any hurry to fix a date for their wedding and she was getting tired of waiting. In this book, Mma Potokwane, the owner of the orphanage that Mr. Matekoni frequently went was getting pushier than ever.It seems like the \\"No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency\\" has evolved from its very first book. In his first two installments, the author seemd to play a bigger emphasis on cases for Mma Ramotswe to solve wherelse the next three books were focused primarily on the book's characters. In this fifth installemtn, readers would get to know the characters more intimately, their strengths as well as flaws. The way the author wrote was very personal and I can't but help feel that I know the characters personally. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"Alexander McCall Smith writes with such sweetness & nostalgia that I long to visit the Botswana of Mma Ramotswe so that I can witness the way of life that created such an spiritually interesting and inspirational person. Mma Ramotswe operates her business by using her inborn instincts of intuition and implementing knowledge of human psychology and behavior. Her detective agency is successful because she knows how to read people and how to treat them in order to obtain the desired results; that is, the information she needs to solve her case. In this book, Mma Ramotswe is asked to help a wealthy female entrepenuer decide whom to marry. The client already has a list of names but wants to learn more about their character & motives before she settles on her lifemate.Mma Ramotswe is herself dealing with a dilemma. What can she do to help her fiance' Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni decide on a wedding date. They have been engaged for quite some time now, but he still has not suggested that they proceed to the next step in their relationship. Since Mr. Matekoni suffers from depression and Mma Ramotswe has been told by his doctors to avoid placing additional stresses on him, she cannot bring up the subject.Meanwhile, the head of the local orphanage where Mr. Matekoni donates his skill in the expertise of engine repair, has no such qualms about stressing him out and makes a shocking and dangerous request of him. Mr. Matekoni finds it extremely difficult to say no to this demanding and manipulative woman. This time though she has gone too far. She has asked Mr. Maketoni to jump out of airplane with a parachute to raise money for the orphanage. Mr. Matekoni, ever the polite gentleman, doesn't outright say \\"NO\\" to this request, and instead, says, \\"we'll see\\". Mrs. Potokwane jumps the gun and takes this as \\"yes\\", and the next day there is an ad in the local paper announcing the event. Soon the news is the talk of the town.Read this wonderful book (part of a series of 5, so far) to find out if Mr. Matekoni does, indeed make the jump and if he also takes the plunge and marries his longtime fiance' Mma Precious Ramotswe."},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"An entertaining read though not as entertaining as the previous novels.

So, five stars for us!But readers new to Mma Ramotswe and her compatriots should probably start at an earlier point in the series: preferably at the beginning. The satisfying climax Smith provides, complete with bits of text from hymns, would probably have novices wondering about the fuss over these books. The fuss is about characters who develop depth in throughout low-key, but engrossingly real, plots and about narrative that evokes an interest about Africa that transcends mere curiousity.From the way that main characters are finally situated in their stories it seems that this was probably intended to be the final book in the series. For that reason, alone, I urge readers not to begin here. You'll pick up all the details you need, but you will not enjoy the texture of stories woven together, the colors of what I think was meant to be a sunset for these stories. Begin elsewhere.The rest of us can take heart that the author has at least implied that these characters may have more stories to tell, after all.

Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"The Full Cupboard of Life is the fifth book in the series that features Mma Precious Ramotswe as the owner of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency in Botswana. The story features Precious, Mr J.L.B. Maketoni (her fianc&eacute;), Mma Makutsi (her assistant and the assistant manager of Mr Maketoni's garage), and Mma Potokwame (the matron of the orphan farm where Mr Maketoni helps out).If you have not read any books in the series, I suggest that you look instead to begin with the first one (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency) and work your way through them in the order of their publication (Tears of the Giraffe, Morality for Beautiful Girls, and The Kalahari Typing School for Men). All of those books are better than this one, and provide helpful context for The Full Cupboard of Life.The Full Cupboard for Life has one detective case in it. Mma Holonga is a successful entrepreneur who has developed a number of beauty parlors for braiding hair in interesting ways and also has created a special formula for treating the hair for braiding. At 40, she realizes that she lacks a husband and child . . . and decides to at least find a husband. But she doesn't want one who is after her money! So she hires Precious to check out her four suitors, beginning with the one she likes best. The case is delicate because Precious is well known in Botswana as a detective, and must avoid having the suitors realize that she is checking them out for Mma Holonga.Most of the book, however, focuses on the personal lives of the others. Precious finally asks her fianc&eacute; when they will marry, and he answers that it will be a year or two before he can save the money for a large wedding. When she offers to sell some cattle to hasten the happy day, he declines her offer. When will they ever marry?As usual, Mma Potokwame has plans for Mr J.L.B. Maketoni that will help the orphans. Precious is kept busy helping Mr J.L.B. Maketoni deflect and deal with those plans. In the process, Precious employs some of the classic methods of psychology to influence men to do what she wants them to do.This book moves further away from the roots of the series. Except for one brief encounter with a snake, wild Africa plays no role in the story. The detective agency is almost an after-thought in the story's development. The one assignment is given as limited a space as is possible.But Mr. Smith has created some delightful characters, and those who care about the characters will enjoy seeing them move on with their lives.I hope that in future books Mr. Smith will once again put several detective cases in the story . . . and let wild Africa appear again as a character."},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"In his fifth novel about the #1 Ladies Detective Agency, run by Mma Precious Ramotswe, author Alexander McCall Smith presents the full cupboard of Botswana life in all its richness.

Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"I have had the pleasure of reading all five installments of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency successively over the past couple of weeks. It was a great way to compare the books to each other while the prior one is still fresh in the memory. I enjoyed this one the least of the five book series. It is still an enjoyable read with all the characters that we have come to know and love in Precious Ramotswe's world but this book seemed to have less focus and was less compelling. The writing remains superb, as McCall Smith elegantly describes the African landscape and the unique &quot;old Botswana&quot; way of looking at life. He continues making commentaries on life and society, especially the interactions between women and men through the musings of the central characters. In this story, mystery and the solving of the mysteries seems to take a backseat to the personal lives of the characters and we are focused on Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni and his reluctance to get married as well as other problems that arise. The main mystery involves Mma Holonga a rich salon chain owner who is looking for a husband who is not only interested in her money. As usual the character of Mma Makutsi, adds a humorous as well as insightful touch to the plot. I would not recommend that this be the first book you read in the series as the characters are well established by now and the reader would miss the nuances portrayed in the story. In all, an enjoyable book but not my favorite in the series."},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"In his fifth novel about the #1 Ladies Detective Agency, run by Mma Precious Ramotswe, author Alexander McCall Smith presents the full cupboard of Botswana life in all its richness.

Mma Ramotswe is the traditional Botswana lady, full of simple (though never simplistic) insights. I liked #1, fell in love with Tears of the Giraffe, and have not looked back since.Here's the thing about this series: It's engaging, it's interesting, it evokes Africa so that you feel the hot dust in your throat and the sun on your shoulders and the cool of the shade. It shames most Americans because of our excess and lack of appreciation for something like running water. It reminds us that courtesy and kindness are international and timeless. And always, always, Mma Ramotswe makes an observation that, even though seemingly simple and obvious, makes you say \\"of course!\\" and often makes you smile and appreciate things you might otherwise overlook."},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"Like many others, I'm a big fan of the Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency series, but this is a really poor entry that barely even bothers to go through the motions. First of all, Mma Ramotswe has only one case to deal with, a wealthy woman who wants her four suitors checked out to eliminate any golddiggers. The first two she checks out are interesting enough, a bible-thumper seeking to reform bar girls, and a slick radio DJ. But Smith doesn't even get around to the other two, and wraps up that storyline in a very abrupt way. Another plotline revolves around Mr. J.L.B. Matakoni and a dishonest competitor garage, but this is small potatoes that doesn't really amount to much. A third plotline involves Mr. J.L.B. Matakoni's getting dragooned into a parachute jump to raise money for the orphanage, again, doesn't amount to much. The last major plotline concerns the marriage between Mma Ramotswe and Mr. J.L.B. Matakoni -- or rather, the lack thereof. The resolution to this is completely anti-climatic and doesn't do justice to the event. One might forgive the weak plotting if there was some really juicy character development, but there isn't. Even worse, some major characters almost totally disappear: Mma Makutsi has very little role, and the two orphan children adopted by Mr. J.L.B. Matakoni appear only once or twice. The book's got the same warmth and humor as the rest of the series, but it's all sort of perfunctory. One doesn't get nearly the same feel for the country and people. The overall is like looking forward to a weekend visit with old friends, only to find them totally distracted and distant. Big bummer of a book."},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"A relaxing book, filled with sly chuckles, and jardl;y any sustained detection, rather a polite and persistent inquiry like the later novels of Agatha Christie--BY THE PRICKING OF MY THUMBS for example, or POSTERN OF FATE. However, it is not senility that deters A. McC. Smith from supplying the thrills and clues, but his constantly attentive gaze on the characterization of his heroine, and his by no means hypercritical look at contemporary Botswana. We who have never seen the place, and probably bever will, have been given a tremendous gift by this fine author. He has taken us on invisible wings inside a society and culture so different than our own as to be truly 'foreign,' and yet he has shown us that life mirrors life, even if you've never taxied to a landing in a little place supplied by the Kalahari Flying Club.By the way, as a sidelight, a Chicagoland friend told me that McCall Smith based the relationship of Precious Ramotswe and J L B Matekoni on that of our own Oprah Winfrey and Stedman Graham! The same dynamic seems to be in play, Precious' nervous impatience, mixed with her steely fortitude, in contrast to her fiancee's seemingly laissez-faire philosophy toward taking the next step--in both cases, setting an actual wedding date. It's not so farfetched because apparently McCall Smith was introduced to Oprah through the offices of Joanne (HARRY POTTER) Rowling, who lives in Edinburgh nearby the author of the LADIES DETECTIVE AGENCY series."},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"This is the fifth of a contracted 8 books in the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series. The first book in the series broke out of genre limitations and was as much an astute and charming literary experience as it was a detective's story. The next three books offered more time with the enjoyable protagonist and regular characters in the surprising world of contemporary Botswanna, but they no longer held the surprise of the first book, and the mysteries devolved into simpler puzzle that were more comments on the human condition than challenging plots.THE FULL CUPBOARD OF LIFE springs back with a lot of the energy of the first book. True, there is only one detective case that gets attention in the plot, plus the mystery of Mr. JLB Matekoni's intentions as Mma Ramotswe's fianc&eacute;e-will he ever name the wedding date-but this volume buzzes with the character development, gentle humor, cultural backdrop and insight into human ironies that blasted the first book to international attention. There are twist endings to both questions posed to Mma Ramotswe. In the meantime, things are looking up for her associate, Mma Makutsi, whose entrepreneurship has brought her comfort in life though as yet has yielded a love interest, and there is much to be learned about the wiles of Mma Potokwani, the orphanage manager who knows how to get what she needs for her just causes. The author is true to his characters and their world, and works a spell with his graceful prose. The country he describes is astounding."},{"Title":"The Full Cupboard of Life (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency)","review":"Mma Ramotswe is so clever, so insightful and yet she can not understand why after the proposal of marriage from J.L.B Matekoni he has not attempted to set a date for the wedding.

It helps to read them in order but not essential. None of these books is a long read so they are a good choice for a snowy afternoon or a plane ride. Precious Ramotswe is not a traditional woman sleuth but rather a solver of problems through a variety of gentle techniques. In this book we find the challenges of helping a woman select among multiple mates, getting Precious's fiance to the altar, and the request from the local orphanage for help with an unsual fundraising rquest.

In this book Precious is hired to check out prospective husbands for a wealthy woman who owns a chain of hair braiding salons. There is a great deal of information on African life and culture interspersed with Precious' relationships with others in her life including her fiance, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni.

Definitely it is good enough for the purpose. I am glad to have it.The canonical order of the books appears to be the same as in most Protestant collections. Presumably the text is from the Codex Ambrosianus, which I think is excellent. This book is missing a few portions of 1 & 2 Chronicles, as I think Ambrosianus is also. Chapter numbers are given by Aramaic numerals (letters), and verse numbers are given by 1, 2, 3, et cetera.I have noticed on only two pages (11 & 10) that the ink looks smudged or splattered, and only in three small areas. If one is fluent enough in Aramaic, then these might not impede reading. For the most part it looks clear and nicely formatted.It was first published in 1954 by the Trinitarian Bible Society.This print edition of the Peshitta Tanakh is great!"},{"Title":"Aramaic Old Testament: Commonly Known As the 'peshitta Tanakh'","review":"It is awful hard to find an Aramaic Old Testament that reflects the ancient Peshitta text. Happily this one does and it uses East Syriac/Nestorian script instead of the block script found in our Hebrew Tanakhs. Having said that, the script is small, sometimes smudged, and difficult to read. Sometimes the pointing cannot be seen at all. Since I use mine only for comparison of critical texts, the inferior printing is satisfactory. However, it will not make very suitable reading for someone who wants to analyze the Aramaic text, chapter and verse. It seems that inexpensive readable Aramaic Peshitta Tanakhs are in short supply here in the West."},{"Title":"Aramaic Old Testament: Commonly Known As the 'peshitta Tanakh'","review":"I hope that the Aramaic Bible Society will publish a complete Aramaic Bible along with the Apocrypha, at least for its historical value. I want all 27 books of the Western canon too, please. Vowel points and clear, unblemished text would also help, especially for beginners of the language, such as myself and others. Some like myself and others want to return to the ancient Natzarean path that Yeshua from Natzaret and His disciples lived.Now I will rant on to the negative review of this document. The aforementioned title of this review describes this book. This book is a replication of a 1954 Trinitarian Bible Society edition of the Aramaic Tanakh. It wouldn't surprise me if the Apocrypha was removed by the choice of the TBS, a heavily Protestant organization. No, the Apocrypha isn't scripture, but should be there for its history. Not everyone will agree, but I will leave that to the individual's choice and Yahweh's Spirit of Holiness for conviction.There is one plus I will mention: a wide margin for notetaking. But this may not be necessary, only had the size of the text been larger.The United Bible Society edition of the Aramaic Bible isn't that great. Only raw consonants in the Tanakh, and faded consonants and vowels in the Apocrypha and Renewed Covenant don't help either.Many Messianics/Nazarenes are dissatisfied with the Greek New Testament traditions as well as the flaws (some purposeful) in the Masoretic Tanakhs.It is my hope that this long forgotten language be restored. It isn't as strong as Hebrew, but it's a sister of Hebrew. Wasn't Aramaic the lingua franca of Israel in the first century of the common era? Would a restoration of Aramaic be only a journey to the past? Or will it open the eyes of many churchians and thus lead them to a proper Semitic understanding of their faith? And wouldn't this allow conviction from Yahweh's Spirit for them to repent of practicing the heathen traditions they have been taught, and teach, and still practice?Yeshua didn't start Christianity, and neither did Shaul from Tarshish (Paul the emissary). Constantine, the old pagan wolf, did at the council of Nicea in March 325 CE! This anti-Semitic heathen threw all Jewish believers in Yeshua away from the council. This started Churchianity and also the split of the \\"Church\\" and the \\"Synagogue.\\" Now it's time for the Jew and the non-Jew to repent of their wickednesses and be Israel once again in the Yeshua the Messiah.Back to the point: Hebrew has been restored, and I believe that Aramaic should as well. Amen."},{"Title":"The giraffe-hunters","review":"Since this book is written in the mid 1800's, I think it gives the reader a true picture of a hunt in Africa at that time. The group of hunters has several interesting and different adventures as they cross vast areas of Africa in their quest to bring back two live giraffes (or as they call them camelopards). Great descriptions of the terrain and different tribes they run across."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"The authenticity of detail hit me over and again, describing not only how it felt to be Jewish in white anglo-saxon Prodestant Tennessee, but the way everyone was: open armed but not altogether open minded, graciously phrasing back-talk, helpful when you least expected it, back-stabbing the same way, and sugar-coating every topic but money. When it came to money, you didn't pay protection after the fact, like industrial cities; you first worked for permission. Fabulously The Jew Store tells this tale! True to my own memory is the white woman whose lemon merangue pie was acclaimed, only it was her cook's. The cook, called that but doing cleaning, gardening, child rearing, and everyting else. Learning to listen backwards if you wanted to know what someone was actually saying, as in \\"we're so glad you came over and didn't even call!\\" The sugar-coated talk from mean, angry men. The social standing that harked to who-knew-where... This was the small mill town I grew up in in NC, too. It produced the fragile sounding Southern-belle diction that was good for date bait 'up north,' as her daughter found out; but that belied the resolve of strong, smart women with wonderful senses of humor, as shown in her characters. Anyone who grew up in a small mill town in the South prior to -- say 1970 --- met plenty of folks just like these. How glorious to have this touching volume of remembrances."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"This is an exquisitely written memoir that reads like fiction. What a talent to take what is true and create a story! In the 1920's, my grandparents ran a \\"Jew store\\" in Lawrenceville, Virgina, but left after a year during which the KKK made it known they were unwelcome. My grandfather became a \\"Jew peddler\\" in North Carolina, and much of this story rang true with the tales I was told as a child. Residents looked on the \\"Jew peddler\\" with suspicion, but also with awe because he brought the big city with him. He was expected to be sophisticated; his opinions were taken seriously. During the Great Depression, one North Caroina farmer gave his daughter to my grandfather because she was starving. He took her home to Norfolk, Virginia, to raise with his own five children, and a life-long relationship ensued.My book club enjoyed this book and had a lively discussion."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"This was a definite surprise me novel.

Stella Suberman's vivid descriptions of her Russian immigrant parents' adjustment to this life include unflinching examinations of the prejudices and imperfections of the community they join as well as those the couple bring with them. So much happens to the family in the course of this memoir that the narrative is as compelling as a good novel. The dilemmas the family faces are so convincingly rendered--Where will Joey get the training necessary for his bar mitzvah? Will Miriam marry a gentile?--that I was occasionally moved to tears. By the time you reach the end of the book, you will miss some of these people, as if they have become part of your own story."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"Oy, such a movie this book would make!

My grandfather was also a Russian Jew who left New York in the 1920's. He moved the family down to LaFeria, Texas (near the Mexican border) to pursue his dream of being a citrus farmer. Later he opened a small grocery store/gas station. I always thought it was strange that he would leave New York and a Jewish lifestyle. Yet, after reading this book I realized that some people have dreams to step out of the comforts of what is familiar to them. I now think of Mr. Bronson and my grandfather as pioneers of their time."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"Set in rural Tennessee during the 1920s, this affectionate and sparkling memoir nonetheless also emphasizes the racism and xenophobia lurking not too far beneath the smiling surface of a sleepy, pre-Depression southern town. The description of the &quot;immigrant pool&quot; in New York City--and the oppressive working and living conditions that led Suberman's parents to their emigration southward-- is also fascinating. This would make a wonderful movie: the people and their motivations really come to life. While her tone is upbeat and even inspirational, Suberman's vision of the old days doesn't attempt to deny the bad. There's a message for today here: every community is hurt by fear and hatred of strangers; and every community can begin to heal in an atmosphere of tolerance and good-will."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"For me this story was personal, for it is actually my family's story. I have heard the anecdotes before at get-togethers, but now presented in this manner I have come to better understand my own history. Despite my obvious personal bias, I found the book to be engaging, humorous, tragic, and full of love. My grandfather (the character of Joey) passed away this summer, and it was only after reading this book that I began to come to terms with his death. I hope those who read this book are touched by its sparkle. I truly believe that the emotions it contains are meaningful to anyone who has ever dreamed before. Thank you Aunt Stella. Love."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"I always appreciate a book that's polished, that shines with the right word in every line. Stella Suberman surely worked long hours to get this book just right. There is a smile on every page, along with an occasional pain, but you'll come away just damn glad you got to know this family. It's truly a triumphant book, a classic with the best of them. I haven't been so glad I read a book in years."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"This is a well written, engrossing personal story that represents a very specific subset of Jewish families who relocated to small towns in the American south to run dry goods stores in the early 20th Century. I bought the book because my father's family was one of these families who hid and denied their Jewishness, unlike the family described in this story who remained observant and dealt with the consequences. This was a really meaningful book for me that shed a little light on a corner of my own family history which has lived in darkness."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"The Jew Store was both charming and telling. The author was insightful, but always kind and her humor was gentle."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"This book evokes memories of my own family history. Although the author grew up in a small town in the South in the 1920s and early 30s, I related to the experience as my grandfather set up a store 100 miles away from New York City in a small town. The author's father opened a store in a small rural Tennessee town in 1920. My family stayed in that town and I grew up there. In the 1960s, I often worked as a clerk and stock boy in that store.The experience of the author was one of a certain amount of isolation; her family was the only Jewish family in a small town in Tennessee. My family, on the other hand, although a minority, was part of a small Jewish community. My community was indeed small as I was the only Jew in my HS class. However, I least I had a small community of Jews, indeed there was a vibrant synagogue and Jewish children in other grades in the school. The author's family faced a fair amount of antisemitism whereas I faced only a very small amount, certainly not enough to have made much of a difference in my life.This book tells of events that occured before the author was born or when she was too young to remember. Accordingly, much of this book is written from family legend rather than her own recollections. Of course, as she grew older, she recounts events from memory. Were some stories, therefore slightly embellished? Who knows??!! But then again, does it really matter? This book gives a touching taste of what it was like to be Jewish in the rural South many decades ago. It recounts family squabbles and relationships that all immigrant Jewish families shared. It touches us by showing how outsiders can slowly gain the trust of a community and become part of the community. Finally, this book shows the heartache of a family choosing between remaining in a community that it has grown to love or uprooting itself to fight assimilation. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"It gave a fascinating glimpse into Jewish and non-Jewish lifein the South in the 1920's, while at the same time making us care verydeeply not only for the Bronson family but for others in the town.

I am an aged non-jewish, Christian citizen of the &quot;unnamed&quot; Tennesse community today.Certainly, the only Jewish person in town was perceived as being different, but not despised or even looked down upon. Everyone did attend their respective Christian church regularly in those days- (wish that it were true today). Jewish families did not attend any of the church services and consequently were perceived as &quot;different&quot; but absolutely not &quot;anti&quot;. Since there were no organized Jewish religious activity in the town, I recall that one very popular teen aged Jewish young lady regularly attended the Christian youth service on Sunday night at our church. She was well received and joined in the social and religious discussions of the group.I would like to respectfully suggest the the author is and was a little paranoic in her perceptions of the feedback of the community. Citizens of Jewish decendency have been among our most honorable, distinguished, patriotic, philanthropic and law-abiding citizens and have been so-perceived by all of the residents of the community. I would suggest that the author return to the town of her youth today and observe a most loved Jewish gentlemen and lady leading our Arts and Cultural activities with much pride and respect. Others have been in charge of charitable drives for funds, still others elected to city and county official offices. Yes, our community has profitted from its heritage of Jewish citizentry.Yes again. I would invite the author to return to the &quot;Diadem of Dixie&quot; and see for herself one of the finest communities in America, perhaps partly built by her family's touching us."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"I found this book enjoyable and educational. I enjoyed the story of Stella's family. Her parents, loving, hard working. I was born in the 60's and grew up in a city with many Jewish families. I never knew this went on so few years before.

The family are the only Jews in the community. Eventually the store succeeds but the interesting part of the book is the conflict their religion caused within the family. Eventually the mother wanted her children to marry within their faith and the tension it caused. I would have liked more detail on how the family dealt with their religion since they were the only family in a conservative community and vica versa."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"Good read. It was tough enough to arrive in America and live among the Jews in the Lower East Side of New York, but moving to Tenn. and being the only Jewish Family in town certainly brough many challenges to this small family. Although they did make friends and work along side their neighbors, they were still labeled as the keepers of the \\"Jew Store\\". It brings characters to many of the stories told by grandparents and great grandparents about the trials and difficulties of becoming part of a new and different homeland. Keeping in mind that this family chose to move to Tenn...one must realize that not all immigrants had to deal with the extremes this family had, but, the struggle between husband and wife regarding their ideas of \\"faith\\" and tradition were well written and kept me interested until the end. You don't have to be Jewish to enjoy this book...If you have any knowledge of \\"Yiddish\\" you'll get through many of the passages without difficulty but all \\"Yiddish\\" is translated along the way. I would recommend it...it's based on a true story written by the youngest child which I found to be an extra bonus. I give it 4 stars since I personally felt I knew how it would end well before I came to the last page."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"I come from a Georgia Jewish family although my father couldn't quite handle it and I was born in New York.

For me, it made a small town in rural Tennesse in the 1920s a real place with real people. I have never lived there, or then, but now I feel as if I had."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"This is truly remarkable story of Jewish life in a small southern town in the 1920s. It not only vividly captures the relationships between all of the ethnic groups in the town (jews, gentiles, blacks) but paints a powerful vision of what life was really like back then. The relationships between the main characters, their thoughts, goals, aspirations and motivations are captured beautifully in this novel. I felt like I was back in rural Tennessee in the 1920s as I read this book."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"Stella Suberman is sixteen years older than I am, and much of the action in this narrative takes place before she was born. Call it a full generation before me. My recollections are not hers. I conjecture that the differences are perceptual although it is possible that the sociology changed that much in a generation. My town was in Mississippi, although I went to high school in Gibson County Tennessee not far from \\"Concordia.\\"I don't recall a single dry goods store in my small town (5000 people), and there were several, that was not owned by Jews. They were not ever called \\"Jew Stores\\" to my recollection, and until this book set me to thinking, I had never remarked the fact that no goyim were in the dry goods business in small town Mississippi.Maybe that says more about my \\"raisin'\\" than about the sociology of my town, but I can recall no overt discrimination *against* jews until I grew up and moved to New York. Years later, it came to my attention that there was a \\"jewish discount\\" among the merchants in Mississippi that was not extended to goyim, but that is another investigation for another time.I am intrigued with the fact that the Bronson family encountered such intense discrimination so shortly before I became sentient. Stella Suberman's account, although filtered through the perception of her parents, rings true, and reads like a novel. We have come a long way, but there is still a long way to go. Assuming that assimulation is our goal."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"I enjoyed the book. I read it for a book club.

I have just begun it but the topic is interesting. I know that already since this family was a pioneering Jewish family in the US South who I am sure had a lot of prejudice to overcome. I am reading it for a book group-good book for book group discussions."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"Based on earlier recommendations here, I selected this for my book group to read. While the story was entertaining and evoked memories of stories told by some of my older relatives, I felt that it was not particularly well written, and would have benefited from some serious editing. The author used language repetitiously, and there was no particularly grace or eloquence to her writing style. Although it was a good chronicle of the family's life, as a literary work, it left me wishing for something richer."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"My main criticism of the author is that so much of what she writes about is really a second-hand memoir. She was too young (or not even born) when the events she writes about occurred. She does evoke a feeling for the lonesomeness of her family in a totally unfamiliar situation, but there are too many disconnected memories that are not very interesting. She deals with all her characters superficially. It just seemed to me an amateurishly written book."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"&quot;For a real bargain, while you're making a living, you should also make a life.&quot; That was Aaron Bronson's motto. Well, Russian Jewish immigrant Bronson did both, &quot;in spades,&quot; as he would say. His daughter, Stella Suberman, has now written a book, and she's done it &quot;in spades.&quot;This warm memoir of her family's experiences as the first Jews to live in Concordia, Tennessee, is vibrant with wit and cogent with commentary about 1920s life in a small Southern town.Rather than a pejorative title, Ms. Suberman says &quot;the Jew store&quot; is what people really called such shops, businesses owned by Jews who catered to farmhands, share croppers, and factory hands, offering them inexpensive clothes, piece goods, and linens. &quot;They didn't know about political correctness in those days,&quot; she said, &quot;that is just what it was called.&quot;Seeing opportunity in the South, Aaron Bronson, his wife, Reba, and their two children, Joey and Miriam (Stella was not yet born) set out from New York City to open a dry goods store. Upon arriving in Concordia, population 5,381, the family was taken in by voluble, independent Miss Brookie.Reba, who came with a mood that was &quot;like a thing on her chest,&quot; was ill-at-ease, fearing the Ku Klux Klan, and people who believed Jews had horns on their heads. Later, she faced what she considered to be an even greater terror: Joey might not have a bar mitzvah and Miriam might be in love with a Gentile.On the other hand, Aaron took to the town immediately and opened &quot;Bronson's Low-Priced Store,&quot; so identified by gilt lettering on the windows. His elation at having his own business knew no bounds; Reba described him as &quot;Flying with the birdies.&quot;Aaron's shop flourished, as did he, becoming the first to hire a black as a salesperson. In years to come, he would make invaluable contributions to his Depression wracked community.Detente preceded affection as the townsfolk overcame their initial skepticism of Jewish people and grew to view the Bronson family as neighbors and friends. Miss Brookie gave Miriam piano lessons and attempted to enlist Reba in a battle to do away with child labor in the local shoe factory.Nonetheless, In 1933 Reba held sway and, although Aaron thought of Concordia as home, he agreed to take their three children and return to New York City, where he would open a garage and each child would eventually marry within the Jewish faith.Stella Suberman has turned a poignant family remembrance into a rich, sometimes funny, always touching story. In addition, she has shed light on a little known facet of Jewish/American history."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"This jewel of a book richly deserves five stars. The author's depiction of a Jewish family living in a small town in Tennessee in the 1920s is beautifully written. Especially impressive is the way the author wrote about anti-semitism without exploiting the issue for dramatic effect. (Compare this memoir, set in the 1920s, with moronic modern flicks like &quot;School Ties&quot; in which students at a boarding school in the 1950s shout at a Jewish student, &quot;We hate you because you're Jewish.&quot; Give me a break.)Just as the author's family's Jewishness is dealt with subtly, so are the townspeople drawn: all of them seem genuine, not stereotyped. So restrained is the author, yet so talented, that a low-key but powerful scene toward the end of the book sneaked up on me: I found that I had tears running down my face as I read. I miss the townspeople and the author's family. I wish I could go back in time and drive to that town and find all of them still there.This memoir is far superior to the overrated Angela's Ashes; The Jew Store is the book that should have won the Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"The life of the Bronson's in a typical 1920's midsouth rural town is not so different than what many baby boomers experienced as Gentiles in middle America in the 1950's. As I read I could hear in my mind's eye the rhetoric of fear, disapproval and sometimes hate that the good Christians of our town reflected in their covert and even overt behaviors regarding Jews, Blacks, Asians and yes, Catholics. It is not to different than what we hear Southern Baptist Ministers saying about Muslims after 9/11. Suberman's character development of the towns people with which he endured is classically detailed. She brought Ms. Brookie to life for me. I was immediately able to identify the Ms. Brookie in our town. Besides great characters the book taught me a great deal about the phenomenom of a [Jewish] Store. My family routinely shopped in them because they had what farm families needed at the price they could afford. I just didn't know that is what they were. Although most have not survived this midwest rural city of 160,000 folks still have a few and I still shop in them because they still have what I want at the best price. towns. Thank you Ms. Superman for a good read, some nostalgia and a new awareness of the ignorance of many who sit in our town's church pews every Sunday."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"I read &quot;The Jew Store&quot; after seeing author Stella Suberman on Booktv. I was impressed with her, as she is young looking and quick thinking into her ninth decade.Her story relates an unusual childhood, growing up in a small Tennessee town in the 20s and 30s where her immigrant parents ran a dry-goods business that catered to the lower income residents. They were the only Jewish residents, occupying a unique niche in the life of the area. Her sunny-natured, optimistic father flourished there, becoming southern in speech and outlook. The adjustment was harder for her sensitive, traditional mother. For Stella and her older sister and brother, there was no question of adjustment, as life in Tennessee was the only life they knew, and they were generally accepted and able to take root.Suberman is a wonderful writer, as one might expect for a &quot;retired editor&quot; of many years experience. Her style is vividly descriptive, with a perfect balance of the characters' inward and outward lives. &quot;The Jew Store&quot; is a joy to read. Suberman's book deserves the highest recommendation and will appeal to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"I don't usually take book recommendations, even from friends, so I want to thank Phil for \\"foisting\\" this book on me -- I am very glad I took his word for it this time. This book really took me by surprise; as both history and memoir, this is definitely NOT my usual \\"type.\\"Reading almost like a novel for all its southern warmth and charm, this memoir evokes a vivid time and place that will never exist again. Through her delightful and unforgettable characters, Suberman tells the story of a family who never quite finds a home -- until, too late, they realize Concordia -- the pseudonymous town in which her family lived -- had perhaps been home all along.This is a book about Jews in small towns, but it is also a book about strangers of all kinds, and towns of all kinds. Its lessons are never trite or cheap; in fact, the lessons here, if there are any, are bittersweet with right and wrong choices of all kinds.This is the story of a family that could be any family, and about the kind of success that goes beyond the material -- that forges a lasting legacy for generations to come.

Born myself to a Russian Jewish immigrant father; and a first generation Jewish mother in post World War II Bronx, I recognized each person in her story as archetypes. Suberman's family is very familiar to me, down to their choice of language, attitudes, and alternately suffocating/ indifferent family ties. Suberman appears to fault her mother Reba for wanting her children to retain Jewish cultural and religious traditions. She is portrayed unfairly as a nervous, sometimes shrewish woman who drove her son away from home just so he could be bar mitvah, and who drove the entire family from an otherwise blissful life in Concordia just to prevent Miriam from marrying a non-Jew. Father Aaron, on the other hand, who was ready to assimilate completely for an easier American way of life for his children, is the hero of her piece. &quot;The Jew Store,&quot; is an important tale of genuine family and community values, against a backdrop of the type of situational American values depicted so well by Mark Twain. The character that is most pivotal and interesting, Miss Brookie, is the least explored, probably because she was long dead when Suberman started to write and she had no heirs. What made her open her home and heart so wide to this family? I still want to know!"},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"Imagine being raised in rural Tennessee in the 1920s, the child of a Jewish storekeeper. Imagine this child, quiet and observant, watching, always watching and listening. She listens to family stories well enough to begin her tale prior to her own birth. It's a different tale of anti-Semitism, one that only someone who lived it on intimate terms would be in a position to tell.Engaging writing and a believable narrator contribute to the book's value."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"This is a charming memoir, not a great literary history, so you will like this book a lot if you approach it with that in mind. It sheds a more personal light on the immigrant experience than many scholarly works on the same subject, especially that of the Russian Jewish peddler trying to make it in the south as a shop-owner. The tension between Jewish families' desires to fit in and the prerequisites of assimilation, versus this family's desire to maintain a Jewish identity but not at the cost of alienation, keeps the pages moving. The generational conflicts of the Roaring Twenties, the Klan, the economic collapse of the Great Depression all give the reader a slice of small-town America in an era that doesn't get much attention any more. I found it delightful."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"I saw Mrs. Suberman on C-Span and decided to buy the book and I absolutely loved it. I am not Jewish but have Jewish friends and have never been able to understand the prejudice some people have. It was so heartwarming to see how the people in Concordia eventually embraced the Bronson's. I sympathized with Mrs. Bronson because I was &quot;exiled&quot; in Mississippi for seven years."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"The Jew Store is written from the memories of the author and her family. It is original in that it presents a view of life in Tennessee before and during the Great Depression from the viewpoint of a Jewish family who moves to a small town to open a low price store. While I cringed about some of the interaction between the townspeople and the Jews, it was also heartwarming to read the human interactions that developed between them. I read the book in two days because I was very engaged in the plot. I liked it so much that I bought a paperback edition of the book to send to my sister who will recognize some of the traits of the mother in the story and will be able to see a bit of our mother in her."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"This book was a very fast read and one I could not put down. Full of interesting, well-developed characters living in a town that the author made you feel like you were in. What a fascinating tale of one family's adventure of relocating from NYC to NW Tennessee not far too long after their c arrival from Russia at Ellis Island. Apparently, they were not the only one's, as many small towns throughout the South and the Midwest featured one Jewish family who set out to open their own dry goods store - some of which developed into large regional department store chains. The memoir touched on differences (and worse) between races, religions, and ethnicities, as well as, child labor, the Depression and more, but it moved swiftly along with its colorful characters. It was a fun read full of both Yidishisms and Southernisms. I do declare that it will bring you *naches*.

Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"This is (to me) a rather sad story of a difficult marriage between a husband determined to abandon religious observance and a wife who struggled to maintain Jewish tradition. Even in the wife's native New York, life was difficult; her workplace was full of anti-Semitism, Sabbath observance was impossible because the five-day week had not yet become the norm, and women were given no Jewish education (not even knowledge of Hebrew).The husband dragged the family to a small town in the South so he could start his own business. The wife struggled even more; she managed to avoid eating pork or cooking with lard but otherwise was unable to function religiously, since they were the only Jewish family in town. On the positive side, the natives were mostly friendly- so much so that if the family had not left after a decade or so, their children probably would have happily married Southern Christians and given their parents Christian grandchildren.From my particular point of view (which is closer to the wife's) my reaction to this story is: this book is another example of why the good old days weren't."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"Although I am not finished reading The Jew Store, I find Suberman's style of writing captivating and very entertaining. The characters as described in the book are richly embossed with a dramatic yet humorous description.

The voice of the narrator, an adult recounting the lives of her family members throughout the Great Depression, is flawless in tone and voice. The story gives us a rare perspective: that of immigrant Jews trying to maintain their Jewish traditions while fitting into the culture of the Christian South at a time when Blacks were not allowed to participate fully in the society and the Ku Klux Klan (made up of the town's leaders) served as a shadowy force that kept Blacks, Jews and others &#34;in their place.&#34; The characters are well drawn-- from Stella's brother and sister, mother and father to the neighbors and New York relatives who serve as contrasts to the nuclear family."},{"Title":"The Jew Store, a Family Memoir","review":"Have not received this book yet, \\"The Jew Store\\", and still looking forward to it.

After a few e-mail exchanges I was told about the Indian Christian Mystic Sundar Singh. This biography from A.J. Appasamy, who knew the Mystic during his many travels, wrote a very easy to read book that pages fly by.Sundar Singh was born September 3, 1889 in a rich Sikh family from Punjab India. As a child he wanted to know the truth &amp; questioned his local teachers. They told him that he would get the answer in time, but Sundar had a quick mind &amp; would not except the standard answers:&quot;Excuse me, but I cannot believe this, for if I am a part of Brahma (Godhead or Ultimate Reality), or am myself Brahma, then I should be incapable of having any Maya (illusion). But if Maya is possible in Brahma, then Brahma is no longer Brahma, for he has been subordinated to Maya. Hence Maya is stronger than Brahma himself, &amp; Maya will then not be Maya but will be a reality that has overcome Brahma, &amp; we shall have to think of Brahma himself as Maya, &amp; this is blasphemy.&quot;Sundar wanted the truth so much that he states:...I prayed that if there was a God at all He would reveal Himself to me, &amp; show me the way of salvation, &amp; end this unrest of my soul. I firmly made up my mind that, if this prayer was not answered, I would before daylight go down to the railway, &amp; place my head on the line before the incoming train.&quot;Then instead of Krishna or Buddha, Jesus Christ appeared to him &amp; he became a Christian Sadhu (Holy Man, Wandering Friar, or Religious Teacher). He then spread the Gospel around India into Nepal &amp; Tibetan boarder. Later in his life he visited England, Burma, China, Japan, America, Australia, Switzerland, Germany, Scandinavia, &amp; Holland where many heard of him.Sundar's teachings were very simple, to the point, &amp; like Jesus Christ, he used many parables. He was associated with the Church of England, but did not become a priest in order to reach all the religions &amp; many Christian denominations. He had many mystical visions seeing the saints around Jesus Christ &amp; meet a Christian hermit around Tibet named Maharishi, who claimed he was over 200 years old. Many don't know if this was a vision, a real hermit who was just old, or if Sundar made it up.After trying for years to make it into Tibet (he normally visited the outskirts), he finally made it in 1929, only to disappear.The book discusses his teachings, main sayings, &amp; other important information that gives a good picture of Sundar."},{"Title":"Sundar Singh: A biography","review":"For us, Christian or otherwise, who are so conditioned to the Western rationalist worldview, the life of Sundar Singh is a refreshing, albeit sobering, rebuke of our shallow self-centered materialism...His is the story of a man who modeled the life and message of Jesus Christ with such clarity and integrity that those who accept him are profoundly challenged and changed by his testimony, and those who reject him are put to foolish silence by the fruit of his life, their arrogant critiques overthrown by Divine love in action and by the reality of the Presence of the true God expressed once again in a living breathing saint. This biography, most of the other writings about Sundar Singh, and all of his own writings are worth reading, more than once, by anyone who is sincerely searching to discover the heart of Truth, and who needs to find some rest from the unrelenting argument about religion and faith that presently is dominating the culture."},{"Title":"Sundar Singh: A biography","review":"I have read at least six biographies of Sundar Singh(SS), and this biography is probably the best. The book 'The Sadhu' by Streeter and Appasamy(published in the early 1920's, soon after SS visited Oxford) covers some aspects of SS's spiritual life a bit more rigorously, but this book touches on most of the important aspects of SS's life and gives a very fair account of the life of one of the greatest Christians to emerge from India. I first read this book in 1959, and still continue to read it from time to time for my spiritual benefit. What one has to bear in mind is that Appasamy and his father(who was a Hindu convert), knew SS for several years and he has spent several days, on different occasions,as an invited guest in their house. As a consequence, Appasamy writes from personal experience of the life and spiritual mind-set of SS.SS was a 'Christan mystic' in the true sense of the word, and an Oxford PhD theologian like Appasamy knows how to sift 'the wheat from the chaff'. When I first read Appasamy's book in 1959, I was an undergraduate in Sri Lanka, but since then I have gained a PhD and ScD from Cambridge University,UK, and have travelled worldwide as a research scientist, and have spent quite a few years at Tyndale House,a world famous Theological Library at Cambridge, and have read the biographies of several leading Christians, and still consider SS, as seen through the eyes of Appasamy, as one of the most illuminating biographies of a great Christian. i would thoroughly recommend this biography."},{"Title":"Sundar Singh: A biography","review":"I found Sundar Singh to be an interesting man. He was definitely not a man whose first love was money. He truly had a heart for God. Through all the suffering he went through, he still found within himself the ability to praise God.

First, it is very rare and unique--a must for comic collectors and afficiandos. Second, it is a prime example of Nixon propaganda. Third, but most important, it was illustrated by the great Geo Wildman!Wildman, a lifelong resident of Connecticut, studied advertising at what is now the Paire College of Art. During the 1950s, he was a successful commercial artist, first working for an ad agency, and then becoming a freelance artist. During this time, he began producing freelance comic book art for Charlton Press in Derby, Connecticut.When King Comics ceased publication of their POPEYE title, Charlton acquired the rights. Longtime writer-artist Bud Sagendorf was busy with the daily and Sunday newspaper comics, and declined the job of continuing. George Wildman was offered a contract to produce the POPEYE illustrations, with prolific Joe Gill writing scripts. The first Charlton issue of POPEYE appears in 1969, the final one in 1977. Wildman was hired as assistant editor to Sal Gentile, and in 1971 was promoted to managing editor, and eventually executive editor. Assistant editor Nicola Cuti wrote several of the later POPEYE scripts for Charlton.Wildman's tenure as editor continued through 1985, while Western Publishing picked up POPEYE under their Gold Key and/or Whitman trademarks. Bill Pearson, by then assistant editor at Charlton, began writing scripts, and Wildman produced illustrations while off-duty from Charlton. Their crowning achievement was the epic 50th anniversary special published in 1979.Thanks to the Robert Altman POPEYE movie, a demand for Popeye-related merchandise led to Wildman's working for Random House, illustrating a classic \\"Pop-Up Book\\" which became a best-seller and later a display at the Smithsonian Institution. Wildman was also invited to produce a painted wooden Easter egg for the White House Easter event, his egg also now housed in the Smithsonian. Around this time, the National Cartoonists Society awarded him \\"Best Cartoonist, Humor Division.\\"Western Publishing ceased its comics line in the early 1980s, and Wildman retired from Charlton Comics in 1985, moving into a freelance comic book and children's book illustration career. His pencils, inks and paints graced publications featuring Disney, Hanna-Barbara, Harvey and Warner Brothers characters along with countless designs for various businesses.In 1994, George and wife Trudy Wildman were honored in a gala festival in Chester, Illinois, celebrating the 100th birthday of the creator of Popeye, Elzie Crisler Segar. Wildman received the Popeye Fan Club's Lifetime Achievement Award and performed a sketching show to a standing-room-only crowd. A return visit to Chester in 2004, to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Popeye, found Wildman teamed with Hy Eisman, the writer-artist of the Sunday POPEYE newspaper strip since 1994.Today, Wildman and son Karl operate their own advertising agency, producing computer animation, greeting cards, and a wide variety of products. Wildman's work is seen regularly in the \\"Hidden Pictures\\" publications of HIGHLIGHTS FOR CHILDREN. He celebrated his 80th birthday in 2007 and continues to receive mail from Popeye fans around the world."},{"Title":"Arab seafaring in the Indian Ocean in ancient and early medieval times (Princeton oriental studies)","review":"This classic masterpiece deserved reprinted more than anything else and it is done with an excellent expansion, especially on narrated accounts of travellers and geographers of the time.

(Lacan said: All speech is demand, the demand for love). Kristeva is considered a genius in her field, and highly respected in France (where all this work goes on nowadays). Here she is presented in translation so that the English-reading world can enjoy her work.The interest in such theories of language, semiotics, post-structuralism and psychoanalysis is slim in the English speaking world, and this is unfortunate. Not enough scholars of language look to Lacan and Kristeva, but they should. The text is difficult, and even more so in translation, but it is worth struggling through. However, for the reader with little background in the subject matter, penetrating Kristeva's work may be almost impossible without guidance.This book is subtitled 'a semiotic approach to literature and art'. What Kristeva does is apply her theories to the area of aesthetics, especially her specialty area of the novel. Unfortunately, her studies are naturally based on the French novel (19th century), so readers unfamiliar with novellists such as Mallarme might have a problem following this aspect of her work."},{"Title":"Gift Wrapped Baby (Love and Laughter # 57)","review":"Back cover reads:Found: One Baby under Christmas TreeHallie St. John knew her way around babies--she'd practically raised her three stepsisters--but finding one under her Christmas tree had her stumped.She discovered that the little pink bundle was meant for her neighbor Nate Hawksmoor, who didn't know a thing about babies--except, obviously, how to make them.

In the previous volume, the Queen's Navy and the Royal Constabulary arrested Prince Bascal and his pirate crew and returned them to Earth for trial before the Queen. They were sentenced to exile on the worlds of Barnard's Star, some 5.9 light-years away, for a period of one thousand years.In this novel, the QSS Newhope departs the Solar System, carrying Bascal, the newly elected king of the Barnard system, and his subjects to their new home. Only twenty of the &eacute;migr&eacute;s are active while the others are stored in the memory cores of the fax system. With a travel time of a century, even the working crew will spend much of the voyage in storage.King Bascal, however, elects to stay active during the entire trip, spending the time in learning new things, planning his kingdom and, hopefully, gaining wisdom. Captain Xmary and First Mate Conrad alternate active periods to supervise ship activities. Other crew members are active occasionally to refine ship systems and repair en route damage.After reaching the Barnard system and decelerating into a useful orbit, the crew start feeding a suitable space rock into the matter buffer of an oversized fax system to produce the components for a shipyard. Then they put together a space habitat in orbit around planet two. Finally, they start terraforming the planet.In this story, the colonists encounter and overcome many difficulties, but their most intractable problem is the production of fax systems. Conrad continues to be a close advisor to Bascal, but they become increasingly distance as the king becomes more ruthless in his approach. Conrad and Xmary become lovers, but are often apart for decades at a time.This story portrays the descent of Bascal into hubris. When the colony gets into deep trouble, the king refuses to consider any plan that would require help from the Queendom of Sol. He uses the excuse of their exile, but he is really obsessed with proving his own worth.In the framing story, Radmer and Bruno enter the Lune atmosphere and land on the Aden Plateau above the town of Timoch. The sphere rolls into an old watch tower on the edge of the plateau, saving them from a disastrous roll down the long slope. Unfortunately, their descent has been seen by the enemy and they are pursued as they flee toward Timoch.Highly recommended for McCarthy fans and for anyone else who enjoys hard science fiction with cutting edge technology and interesting speculations on the social and personal consequences thereof.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Lost in Transmission","review":"I picked up this book on a whim, based on the strange summary of immortals cast out of their home, and unaware that there were two previous books tied to this story. I would recommend that you pick up 'The Collapsium' and 'The Wellstone' before delving into 'Lost in Transmission', but know that the book stands formidably on its own.I tend to avoid so-called 'hard scifi' books because I prefer a good story to a clever bit of scientific extrapolation. I find hard scifi books to dwelve too much into scientific exposition, as they seem to be too much in love with their own concepts to care about their characters.This is partly true of Lost in Transmission, but it's far from annoying. The science displayed in this novel is, to be frank, absolutely stunning and well worth the expositions, especially as its workings have major consequences on the rest of the story. Not only does McCarthy tackle a frighteningly original and awe-inspiring concept, but he takes the time to think on its consequences on human life.And that's what stands so perfectly at the core of this novel... It's the way the technology forms the basis of a fascinating study on human psychology, of a humanity that has no more material need and knows immortality. The protagonists are given this gift, then it slowly falls away from them as the story progresses.The structure of the novel might seem disjointed, but it is perfectly appropriate for the nature of the story, that of the life of an immortal. The main character changes his mind a few times, gets close then drifts away from friends and lovers... In that regard, the story's pace is perfect for an immortal life, if quite unconventional.Another thing I found awesome with this novel is the fact that there is no Bad Guy and Good Guy in this story. This means less drama at times, but as a whole, the story is much more satisfying for it.All in all, I found much more than I expected from Lost in Transmission, and I heartily recommend it to fans of good scifi, hard or otherwise."},{"Title":"Lost in Transmission","review":"In the twenty-sixth century earth time, mankind has achieved immortality through the fax and duplicating clones that can be used at a moment's notice. In such a society the children have no hope of making a mark because what can they do that their older and wiser parents can't? Some young rebels turn to piracy, revolution and other acts of violence that upsets the status quo. These rebels are caught and their punishment is to take the OSS Newhope to a world light years away and colonize it for a thousand years.The former rebels make it to planet P2 and at first it looks like they will have the freedom to pursue their dreams. However, the planet is short on tracer metals needed to keep people healthy and young. As the technology wears out, there is nothing to replace it and for the first time these immortals know what final death is. One brave former revolutionary conceives of a plan to rescue some of the population but it is history that will judge whether he is a hero or a pirate.In LOST IN TRANSMISSION readers will find that immortality leads to stagnation and a need for the status quo, a situation that drives the second generation of immortals into rebellion so they can break free of the social constraints. The irony is that when they \\"grow up\\" in tens of centuries they are much like their parents except for a few \\"old\\" revolutionaries who are not content with their situation and intend to change it (sounds like the love children of the sixties). Will McCarthy has written a fascinating book about a future the audience hopes will never come true.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Lost in Transmission","review":"Lost in Transmission is the third of Wil McCarthy's novels set a few centuries in the future in the Queendom of Sol (and successor states). I have enjoyed all these novels, and I feel they are improving as the series continues. One reason for this may be the increasing dark tone -- the first novel was in some ways a Tom Swiftian tour of fun technology, while the subsequent novels have focussed increasingly on the human problems of McCarthy's future. I rank Lost in Transmission one of the best SF novels of 2004.All three books are set in a wondrous technological future, based largely on programmable matter and on instantaneous matter transmission. Crucially, the latter wonder also leads to near immortality: one can be maintained at any desired age by filtering software in the \\"faxes,\\" and one can be reinstantiated from stored copies in case of accident. In the first two novels, we saw how this bounty led to near-utopian conditions, but how human nature represented the snake in that garden. The first novel, The Collapsium, is an episodic story in which the great scientist Bruno de Towaji thrice saves the Solar System from destruction. Here the problem is human jealousy and the great power available from such high tech. In the second novel, The Wellstone, Bruno's son Bascal and his friends, frustrated by the place of youth in a world of immortals, play a number of increasingly dangerous pranks, and end up exiled to Barnard's Star.Lost in Transmission, then, is the story of the journey to Barnard's Star and the effort to colonize one of the planets of that star. The main character, as in The Wellstone, is Bascal's close friend Conrad Mursk. Conrad is First Mate of the Newhope, their starship. His lover Xiomara Li Weng, or Xmary, is the Captain. Bascal is the leader of the expedition and will be King once the new planet is reached. Conrad himself is a rather stolid young man, though perhaps not so stolid as he seems to think. His goal is to be an architect. He often feels pushed into Bascal's shadow: the other man is much more overtly brilliant, a poet, and a more energetic leader. But this relationship evolves a great deal throughout this book.The journey to Barnard's Star takes a number of mostly uneventful decades. Conrad and most of the others spend the bulk of their time stored in fax memory, but Bascal stays \\"awake\\" the whole way. This more or less drives him mad. Once at the new planet, the group is faced with the job of terraforming a rather un-Earthlike place. They do this in part by altering themselves, in part by changing the planet and its fauna. They also colonize (to a small extent) the star system.Here lies the heart of the novel, for it turns out that despite the incredibly high technology at hand, the colonists are resource-limited. Over time, it becomes harder and harder to guarantee regular fax updates, or even resurrection from accidents. Class divisions arise. Some people choose to alter themselves -- to flying forms, or to centaurs, or trolls: not always with happy results. Children are \\"born\\" from fax machines into an adolescent body, also with less than always happy results. Bascal's grip on his Kingdom depends more and more on the use of force.I thought the novel was a very effective look at real limits to a seemingly miraculous technology. I found its treatment of economic problems well thought out, and its treatment of the personal problems of people living hundreds of years is also worthwhile. (Conrad's off again, on again, relationship with Xmary, and his increasingly difficult relationship with Bascal, being especially well done.) McCarthy's writing is strong as well -- he maintains a sardonic, sometimes funny, sometimes mordant tone throughout. He has fun with altering his third person voice on occasion -- quite effectively, I thought. As I said, one of my favorite books of the year.This novel and its predecessor are each framed with chapters set in the future of both, after Conrad, much changed and much older, has returned to the Solar System. The home planet, it is clear, has gone through some terrible times of its own, reflecting yet further complications of the Queendom's very high tech level. In the next novel, we are told, Conrad will \\"save the world... in a manner of speaking\\". I look forward eagerly to that story."},{"Title":"Lost in Transmission","review":"This is the third book in McCarthy's _Queendom_of_Sol_ series, and the first I picked up (the first two in the series are not available in ebook editions!). As a standalone work, it works: the characters are vivid from the outset, so any missed characterization is unnecessary to the appreciation of this story. Moreover, it takes place in something of a discontinuity with the prior two books: the authors of the Children's Revolution are exiled to Barnard's star... so it doesn't take place in the context of Sol at all.The Queendom of Sol series is a whimsical mix ofHoly Fire(Bruce Stirling) Kim Stanley Robinson'sMars Trilogy, and Michael Moorcock'sThe Dancers at the End of Time. Death has been defeated by advanced technology. People can record quantum images of themselves, restore from backup, fax themselves across the solar system. It's fun stuff. But it doesn't entirely apply in this particular story about the colonization of a new planet where resources are scarce and getting scarcer, and children (and revolutionaries) are doomed to recreate the authoritarian regimes they rebelled against.McCarthy is ambitious in this series, tackling large spans of time, historical forces, scientific speculation, and parallel stories all while attempting to keep the traditional character based story on track. The pacing is occasionally erratic, and the necessity of selecting widely disparate times and places for the individual scenes undercuts the dramatic power of interpersonal tension. Like many books attempting to explore immortality, the reader must suffer characters who are sometimes tired of dealing with life, jaded, and generally afflicted by ennui. This also contributes to problems in pacing.One other quibble is that McCarthy, despite the virtuoso display of craft, falls victim to a surprising number of \\"As You Know, Bob\\" moments. He does so almost self-consciously, as though confessing to a small but necessary blunder. Most of the time, however, he is extraordinarily adept at conveying his background and scientific speculation, so these occasional exceptions seem rather glaring.Overall, I found this particular story a bit less interesting than the concluding book in the series (To Crush the Moon), in part because the characters in this story simply weren't as much fun as those left behind at Sol.All these quibbles aside, McCarthy's ambition is successfully achieved: a large-scale novel on a human-sized stage. Fans of character-centric SF will find as much to love as hard-SF readers looking for plausible, adventurous science. If you're looking for \\"the good stuff\\" in contemporary science fiction, you should be reading Wil McCarthy."},{"Title":"Lost in Transmission","review":"Some reviewers have commented that this book stands well on it's own. I wouldn't know, because I've avidly read The Collapsium and The Wellstone, which are just about my favorite books of all time. Amazingly, Lost In Transmission maintains that same level of kick-in-the-brain wonder.Fleeing from an oppressive Utopia, the children of the first immortals seek a world where THEY can be leaders and visionaries. But building a new society is a lot harder than it looks, and many tears will be shed before they finally get it right, and as immortals they, too, must live through the future their own actions have created.

The prologue and the epilogue are from the same span of time, but the rest, and more interesting parts of the book form a story that clearly takes place much earlier.

But his proposed solution in the sequel, \\"Lost in Transmission,\\" doesn't really address the problem. Adolescents do grow up into adults, after all, and the youthful characters carried over from the first novel rapidly assume adult behaviors and a social dynamic that doesn't distinguish them from their parents. They could just as easily have turned out that way by staying in their home solar system.Moreover, while the Queendom's physical and biological technologies are quite impressive, its understanding of psychology seems unaccountably deficient. You'd think with all the knowledge and resources at its disposal, the Queendom could have found ways to bring up children in emotionally satisfying ways instead of kicking them out on doomed interstellar colonizing expeditions. And if the youngsters still insisted on going any way, why couldn't some relatively unobtrusive but capable elders (for example, someone like Robert Heinlein's Lazarus Long) have tagged along in advisory positions?McCarthy technological vision is often quite intriguing, but this novel shows that he needs to do some more work before I will find his portrayal of a negligibly senescent society plausible."},{"Title":"The Man-Eating Tigers of Sundarbans","review":"Men's fear and fascination of monsters have been with us since the dawn of time, and while the imagination of our forefathers was the main source for describing these beasts under the sea, up the snowy mountains or deep in the jungle, our technological and scientific age helped us to unravel a lot of these mysteries,and sadly bringing a lot of nature's animals to the brink of extinction in the process.Yet, this fascination, and apprehension remain with us to this day.While Jaws was responsible for keeping a lot of people out of the water for a while, me included, the portrayal of the great white shark was too over sensualized to be scientifically accurate, something author Peter Benchely tried desperately to redress years later.The man eating Lions of Tsavo, were real yet a rarity in the history of man against 'beast, a historical incident that was all but forgotten, to be revived later with the film Ghost and Darkness.Yet there is another animal out there, and most specifically in the Sundarban region of India, bordering Bangladesh, who also feasts on people each year, and who very little is known about, a mystery as dense as the region it inhabits,(one of the last true wilderness in the world,) the majestic tiger.And to that end, Sy Montgomery has done a wondeful job in investigating this elusive animal, writing a unique book of its kind, that is part natural history, part detective story.The Sundarban tigers are unlike any tigers in India, or in the world. They regularily attack humans, even snatching people from boats in the middle of the river.They are both feared and revered by the locals as creatures of divine power/source(a phenomenon that in itself has allowed many wild animals to coexist in relative peace with humans)However, the plight of the tiger is one tragic story, (some subspecies extinct while others following suit in an alraming speed) and the impression I got from Montgomery's book is not one of fear, although there are some scary moments in the book,tracking the elusive tiger, but one of respect for this beautiful creature. An impression that convinced me these attacks were against people going inside the tiger's territory, invading its lair, as opposed to the well documented cases of man-eating leopards and wolfs that boldly invade human's territory.Saving the Tiger at all costs is another impression I got from this book, a need that becomes ever more pressing, realizing the relenteless onslaught from loss of territory or poaching the tiger faces every day.By all account buy this book, and I guarantee you too will be fascinated by the story of when that beautiful animal do what it is instinctively programmed to do to survive."},{"Title":"The Man-Eating Tigers of Sundarbans","review":"I have already read (and eventually bought )\\"Spell of the Tiger\\" also by Sy Montgomery, and notice she wrote this one with illustrations for young people. When I (age 71!) began to read it, it was like a ride on the boat and a walk in the Sunderbans itself. Sy certainly would enthrall a young reader. She describes the Sunderbans and the men and women who live daily with danger. She tells how the people do not hate, though they fear, the tiger, whom they honor as a god. Without the tiger, the forest would not exist. They believe the tiger is protector of the forest, and he is. I highly recommend the book and hope it is a success.

This book may be of peripheral interest only to those in academia who are wildlife experts or interested in minutiae regarding Bangladesh.This book holds nothing for a wildlife \\"enthusiast\\" who keeps tuning the pages hoping for something of interest to occur before the last page. It dosen't. Not even on the last page.For those who are interested in fascinating stories of tiger behavior, maneaters or India in the years between 1920 to WWII; the books by Jim Corbett are touchingly tragic, human, tense, humorous and fascinating Vinjets (Spelling?).....short stories, which fill each book and will be re read by the owners of the book every few years for life."},{"Title":"The Man-Eating Tigers of Sundarbans","review":"an author whose personal agenda raises questions about the credibility of victims and their family-members, often the source of her information.

Philip II was somewhat of a connoisseur on art, who enjoyed the works of Bosch and Titian, but who happened to overlook the genius of El Greco. Another interesting detail in the book is Philip II's enthusiasm for hunting.The book gives a good overview on Philip II's numerous wives and children (he was married 4 times and some of his children were stillborn). It also allows one to understand the period under which the Netherlands was ruled by the Spanish as well as of the \\"taming\\" of the New World, as well as the aftermath of the Armada disaster.King Philip II preferred a very centralized government. He was an indefatigable ruler who did an incredible amount of paperwork.Philip II is portrayed as an enlightened ruler who at times showed incredible mercy to his subjects. He even dressed like the common man and did not require subjects to bow down to him as did other monarchs. This was the quintessence of \\"Spanish nobility.\\""},{"Title":"Philip II","review":"Geoffrey Parker wrote tight, leaving nothing extra or unneeded in &quot;Philip II&quot; which I rate a very concise story of the man behind the king.Parker drew from good research and could have included other aspects which may and may not have been true but he chose the journalistic route which leaves the reader with a stronger sense of knowing King Philip II, one of the most influential monarchs in the world. Parker's text gives thought to the effects of Philip's daily habits and events in his life which still have an effect in Spain and parts of the then Spanish Empire. Parker's effort reads well and should be included on the list of any serious follower of old or modern Spain, or of any countries effected by its empire.I read through it in four brisk sittings.Mike McIlvain"},{"Title":"Philip II","review":"I am shocked there are not more books about the personal life of this interesting person in history. This book gives a very good picture of Philip II and the forces that shaped him and the religion that governed every aspect of his life, loves and holy causes. Because of his long reign, and dealings with all the important persons of the 16th century, his personal attitudes shaped so much by his childhood, influenced the political, social and religious tide of that time.

Roughly based on a play by Celine, author of Death on the Installment Plan, Chum drags us laughing through the lust, murder, and rape that the inhabitants of a small fishing village in the Bering Sea call recreation. Spitzer is a shockingly good student of human nature, and maybe that's why he can make us laugh at this stuff. Not haw haw academic &quot;how clever&quot; laughter. I mean really laugh as he spins his tale in the language of nasty porno and exploitation movies. Spitzer writes in American. Be afraid."},{"Title":"Chum","review":"Mark Spitzer is genius. Chum's message is deep and hidden under a steaming pile of bile and goo; and he forces you to dig through it to find it. This is the most skillful writing of any author living. Kudos Mr. Spitzer, my chum, my chummy chummy chum."},{"Title":"Chum","review":"The reviews and comments I had read about Mark Spitzer's novel CHUM intrigued me -- so I thought I would check it out. I was sorely disappointed in this book. The only character for whom I felt even mild, brief sympathetic feelings was the nun who appeared on one or two pages. Everyone else in this story is completely dispicable. The 'warning' on the inner jacket flap about the story being 'sex-obsessed, scatological, deeply offensive, violent...(&c;)' is pretty accurate. The overall effect was like reading the toilet-seat fantasies of some adolescent...I thought Spitzer's writing was skillful -- it just amazes me that he chose to focus his talents on such drivel. The quotes on the back comparing the novel to Melville (calling CHUM 'the Moby Dick of the millenium') and the work of Tom Robbins, and offering poshumous (always a safe gift) approval from the likes of Kafka, Kierkegaard and Ingmar Bergman were ludicrous at best.The violence and degradation of women depicted in this book reminds me of nothing less than some of the more depraved 'underground' comics of the 1960s. What humor I found within its pages was not enough to redeem it. Sorry to be so negative, but that's how I feel.For a vibrant, imaginative -- and by no means 'tame' -- story in a similar vein, check out Mark Richard's marvelous novel FISHBOY. It burns with the surreal qualities that I think Spitzer was shooting for (perhaps an unfortunate choice of words) in this book, and it's not nearly so morally reprehensible."},{"Title":"Blue Dragon White Tiger: Taoist Rites of Passage (Asian Spirituality, Taoist Studies)","review":"&quot;Blue Dragon White Tiger&quot; is an in-depth description and explanantion of the underlying philosphies that have permeated Chinese culture from antiquity to the present day. This is not an exhaustive history, but an exploration of the major philosophies/practices that underpin Chinese society and cultural norms. Chief among these are the yin/yang concepts of the &quot;I Ching&quot; and the five-element (wood, fire, metal, water, earth) system of natural processes of change. My teacher Michael Saso is an initiated Taoist priest and ordained Buddhist priest, so he is able to give us a look at the various rites of passage of Chinese culture such as birth, death, marriage and the annual cycle of festivals from the inside out. He not only describes rituals as an observer, but understands the underlying energetic processes such as Taoist emptying that inform and empower the rites. This level of understanding is rare in the West, to say the least. While there are surely descriptions of these rites elsewhere, the inner meaning based on experience from practicing the Taoist alchemical inner transformation and emptying yogas eludes the most educated and astute scholar-observer. It is precisely this meaning that the author provides. He ends with an overview of the state of religion in China today. Each chapter has notes and a select bibliography, however there is no index."},{"Title":"Blue Dragon White Tiger: Taoist Rites of Passage (Asian Spirituality, Taoist Studies)","review":"While I agree completely with the previous reviewer's enthusiasm, prospective readers should be aware that the &quot;Taoist Rites of Passage&quot; subtitle is slightly misleading. Although Michael Saso is best known for excellent works on Taoism in modern Taiwan (and latterly the mainland), &quot;Blue Dragon White Tiger&quot; is a description of the ritual life of Chinese popular religion (Confucian and Buddhist as well as Taoist), which closely relates the practices to underlying philosophical and cosmological concepts. I have found nothing at once so comprehensive and concise in English.Taoism, which most broadly and effectively incorporates distinctly Chinese concepts, does receive the major attention. These portions of the book cover some of the same material as Saso's earlier &quot;Taoism and the Rite of Cosmic Renewal&quot; (1972, revised 1989) and &quot;The Teachings of Taoist Master Chuang&quot; (1978; corrected edition as &quot;Taoist Master Chuang,&quot; 2000). Taoism as a living religion has been seriously studied only in the last few decades, and Saso is a leading figure in this field. He has also worked on classical Taoist texts, non-Taoist popular beliefs, and Chinese Buddhism, however, so he is not presenting his own narrow specialization as the whole of Chinese religion.The publisher informs us that &quot;camera-ready copy was supplied by the author,&quot; which gives the reader some confidence that the Chinese characters and the many charts, diagrams, and illustrations have been inserted at the right places. It may also account for some inconsistencies in layout, and possibly some less than sparkling passages on non-Chinese subjects.As mentioned, Saso's reports on Chinese practices, and the beliefs associated with them by at least some Chinese, are based on solid research and personal experience. The author acknowledges the assistance of various Chinese scholars and ritual specialists, and of western Sinologists, including several of the Jesuits who had assisted his earlier fieldwork on Taiwan with Master Chuang. It is, however, fairly obvious who DIDN'T check the text for errors. In a passage comparing rituals of adult status on page 134, his references to Judaism confuse Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement -- part of a &quot;world-renewal&quot; ritual of a type familiar to Saso!) with the Bar Mitzvah (presenting a 13-year-old male as an adult for some important religious purposes). Not a big problem, but a sudden jolt to the reader who is aware of the difference. And a lost chance for an interesting comparison."},{"Title":"Blue Dragon White Tiger: Taoist Rites of Passage (Asian Spirituality, Taoist Studies)","review":"The book is useful for western readers who are interested in Taoism (Taiwan only). However, I agree with some previous comments that the sub-title \\"Blue Dragon White Tiger\\" is not necessary. By the way, we Chinese say \\"Green Dragon White Tiger\\" actually, Green means East, Trees and wood, Growing etc while White means West, Metal and Fading etc. Most Feng-shui masters use the above theory as well as Taoist priests.If you want to know more about Taoism in academic aspects, I'd like to recommend \\"Daoist Identity - History, Lineage, and Ritual\\" edited by Livia Kohn."},{"Title":"Russkii Kalambur: 1,200 Kalamburov Starykh I Sovremennykh","review":"The collection includes puns of almost all well-known Russian writers -- from Pushkin to Mandelshtam."},{"Title":"Russkii Kalambur: 1,200 Kalamburov Starykh I Sovremennykh","review":"The book is a collection of erotic POEMS in Russian (there is no English translation).

Mortimer seems to know very little about Arabic culture, including some curiously persistent misspellings of even very common words. But what the author lacks (or pretends to lack?) in terms of prior knowledge is amply compensated for by the tenderness and honesty of his writing and his deepening liking of Yemen, in combination with a subdued, but sustained critique of his own place in the world. Mortimer's lack of judgment is refreshing, particularly in combination with a sweet sense of wonder at the people, places and events Mortimer stumbles across. Part travelogue, part making-of, part social history, part self-discovery, this elegant book left this reader with warm feelings for its author and even warmer feelings for the Yemenis he encounters in one way or another. An enjoyable read about liminal people and places in and from a magnificent, complex, and usually overlooked corner of the Arabian peninsula."},{"Title":"The European Tribe","review":"Phillips' travels, which occurred before the fall of Communism, cover Morocco, Gibralter, Spain, France, Italy, Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, Poland, Norway, and the Soviet Union.Any travel narrative needs a 'hook' or a theme, and Phillips' is to seek out things that he can particularly relate to, as an Englishman of Black descent. He identifies with the plight of European Jews, and in other countries he highlights encounters with local Blacks. He seems to be straining for material at times, and oddly, rarely goes out of his way to seek out the local Black community, instead relying on happenstance. Yet, as he points out, the results of the Caribbean diaspora are everywhere: Even in northern Norway, he encounters another emigrant from the English-speaking Caribbean. Norway is also the occasion where the author loses his temper due to one-too-many racist incidents, and the target of his eruption is, of all things, a Norwegian customs officer. Phillips is paranoid about the revival of fascism in Europe, but perhaps that's understandable as he recounts racist slights and insults (some quite shocking to this white reader) that occur during his travels, as well as from his life in the US and UK."},{"Title":"The European Tribe","review":"I stumbled across &quot;European Tribe&quot; and decided to read it not only because it was written by someone born in my island (St.Kitts &amp; Nevis), but because it describes places that I long to visit. Caryl Phillips uses a thought provoking style to tell of his travel around the world. As I journeyed with him I enjoyed his vivid and frank language and also his analysis of the different cultures. I also appreciate Caryl Phillips' use and revelation of historical facts and theories to tell his story. I will recommend &quot;European Tribe&quot; to anyone interested in a black man's expereince with various cultures of the world."},{"Title":"The European Tribe","review":"In his narrative, The European Tribe, Caryl Phillips writes about his experiences as a black British intellectual traveling mostly in Europe. He starts in Casablanca and works his way north visiting such places as Paris, Venice, and Amsterdam, finishing up in Russia before returning to England. This book was originally written in the early eighties, so Phillips is describing some places still behind the Iron Curtain. But this edition does include an afterword written in 1999. In his rational way, Phillips comments in the afterword, &quot;Europeans are human beings. They are subject to the same insecurities, the same inability to forgive, the same prejudices, the same disturbing nationalism, the same cruelties, as any other people&quot; (132). This is a good travelogue, but it is also an enlightening book for people whose main reading about the black experience has been from the viewpoint of African-Americans."},{"Title":"Hysterectomy? The Best or Worst Thing That Ever Happened to Me?: A Collection of Women's Personal Experiences","review":"Two years ago, I did not read hysterectomy stories. Friends told me not to read &quot;that stuff&quot;, since I was so strong, and mine would be a breeze. Much of medical literature even suggests that women who have problems post surgery are just &quot;problem women.&quot;Unfortunately, my surgery was not a breeze. Turns out a hysterectomy was actually counterindicated for my problems, the surgeon did not have the proper skills, and I am now faced with years of diminished quality of life and possible delicate restorative surgery which may or may not work.I don't think information or stories in this book are meant to &quot;scare&quot;, but to help women ask the right questions, demand proper care and assessment and make an informed decision. Good doctors welcome informed and inquisitive patients. I highly recommend this book to anyone contemplating hysterectomy."},{"Title":"Hysterectomy?

The Best or Worst Thing That Ever Happened to Me?: A Collection of Women's Personal Experiences","review":"In her first book, Your Guide to Hysterectomy, Ovary Removal &amp; Hormone Replacement, Elizabeth Plourde dared to express what is sadly often inadmissable in our culture - the outrage, pain and loss she experienced when waking from surgery to find that necessary and vital feminine organs were removed without her consent. She, like untold numbers of women, was launched into an challenged existance of physical disability, when unnaturally deprived of her critical hormone-producing ovaries, in particular.During her recovery, she began an unprecendented process of research into the effects of complete hysterectomy, that spanned 16 years, coming up with valuable information on the potential long term effects of ovary removal, which are rarely available to women who are seeking to understand all dimensions of this surgical process.At the conclusion of this first book, Elizabeth invited women to share their stories with her, and thus compiled Hysterectomy? The Best or Worst Thing that Ever Happened to Me?In creating this book, she has also given a forum to many other women ,to describe, and often process, their experiences after having surgery involving reproductive organ removal. A spectrum of stories result - some describing apparently beneficial results from hysterectomy, yet more describing very sobering consequences. These stories do not connote exaggeration and fear-mongering - they are narrations of personal life experience which all searching readers would do well to access.Sustaining a hysterectomy, or deciding to have a hysterectomy, is monumental - although the numbers of this procedure done in this country defies that fact. Elizabeth Plourde is valiant in challenging the normalizing perception of this surgery, and in doing so, may spare countless numbers of women untold suffering, help to shift the paradigm amongst medical practitioners and validate women's rights to own and name their truths, despite social disapproval.Thank you, Elizabeth Plourde, for your courage, dedication and perseverence! This is a book that has desperately needed to be written, and gives a critical voice, and a precious value, to many."},{"Title":"Hysterectomy?

I couldn't finish reading it because some of the letters were so depressing. I did read about 80%. My feeling is the author received more \\"worst experience\\" letters because she received a greater response from those is support groups. I personally believe that one belongs to a support group because they are in distress and need others in their situation to offer support.It didn't change my mind about surgery BUT it did help me to come up with questions for my doctor."},{"Title":"Hysterectomy?

Other books claiming an easy way have been superficial and omitted much detail. If other reviews have been critical of this book, perhaps it is because the subject is difficult.The book gives a good balance between practical guidance on writing a Windows application with MSVC++, and explanation of the theory behind it. It briefly covers the C++ language itself, but is better suited to C++ programmers wishing to write for Windows. It uses the MFC method throughout and doesn't waste time on old-fashioned API methods. Of course the 24 hours are not consecutive, but I found that each of the 24 chapters takes about an hour as claimed, and this structure helps the reader to plan a manageable programme of learning the subject. It also serves as a useful reference book after completing the course."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Visual C++ 6 in 24 Hours","review":"There are almost no pictures, and no screen results of the sample programs it uses in examples.

I found &quot;Teach Yourself C++ in 21 Days&quot;, the old non-visual C++ 5.0, to be a good book (by a different author)...so there's proof that this format works for learning a C++ style language, but this author failed to teach anything.

With more difficulty than should have been necessary, I made it all the way through most of chapter 8, at which time it became a complete waste.The author skips from topic to topic and does not explain the fundamentals behind major concepts. Multiple pages are used to list every property for different controls and yet space cannot be found to explain basic ideas.This is a typical example of a good concept (learn something without reading a book that's too heavy to carry) that was not implemented well.

In general the book will give you the basic steps to create the example applications in each chapter. Trying to create an application that is not in the book will very quickly send you looking for other resources. I found more information on the web than I did in this book.The author does a lot of do this, do that instruction with little explanation of the exact reasons for the task. There are numerous errors which requires some creative interpretaion in order to figure out. Overall the book could have been better written to the level of developer it is intended for, and definately could have done with a coursory edit.A good example of what is missing in the book is Chapter 5, Button Contols. The author explains the different buttons and button properties and has you generate a sample application. What is missing in the chapter is how to actually retrieve check box and radio box values to use in other parts of your application. Even the Visual Studio help files are vague on this topic, which may explain the problem with the book.In short I can not recommend this book. It contains too many errors, there is a lot of missing information, and explanations are almost non-existant.

On page 179, Mickey Williams offers excellent advice, regarding Device Contexts (DC), to not &quot;hard-code any dimensions into your program.&quot; On implementing DC printing (Hour 21, page 334), Williams again cautions &quot;programs written for Windows should be hardware independent.&quot; Unfortunately, Mr. Williams immediately forgets his wise advice, implementing his device dependant Hour 21 example on Printing, complete with hard-coded device dimensions. Hour 21 is an excellent example of how not to do it. On completing this and other chapters, you may at times wonder why the examples don't work. Williams too often forgets to inform readers on the details of his thoughts, creating a troubling learning experience.

The author constantly introduces concepts without explaining them in the afore; assuming you know, which is contrary to it not assuming any programming exp. In addition, many instances he says &quot;you can...&quot;, but doesn't tell you HOW; or why, etc.It's amazing how the Variables--probably the most important concept in programming--section is only 2/3 pages long (that includes discussions on how much space they take in RAM).

The result is that the reader is constantly fishing through previous chapters thinking &quot;where did I see that explained before?&quot; I spent hours searching for such details.

It is a mathematics text that develops the full depth of the theory.It is typical in math grad school to have a semester long course in real analysis (measure theory, Lebesgue integration, convergence theorems, Fourier analysis, L^p spaces, and some stuff on differentiation). After that you're ready for a proper course in probability and random processes (probability spaces as measure spaces, martingales, all the assorted bounds, large deviation theorems).I ran across this book while looking for a statistics book to follow up from here. Barra begins by defining a statistical space as a sigma algebra with some family of probability measures on it, and follows this up by defining a dominated statistical space as one where there is a single measure in terms of which we can define all the probability measures of integrals of some functions (the densities). He spends three chapters setting up this careful apparatus (including the definition of Fisher information) before moving on to hypothesis testing.My only argument with this book is his lack of counterexamples. The exercises seem reasonable, but he does not, for instance, give an example of a statistical space which is not dominated."},{"Title":"Stepping Up to Power: The Political Journey of American Women","review":"Former Lt. Gov. Harriet Woods presents her insights into the changes she has witnessed over past decades. Particular insights are presented on changes in how the public regards women in politics.It was only three decades ago when few were concerned with how the majority of women felt on issues, according to Ms. Woods. Few women existed in such professional occupations as physician and attorney. (In 1960, 95% of law degrees were awarded to men. Today, about one third of law school graduates are female.) The use of contraceptives then was a crime. The term &quot;domestic violence&quot; had yet to enter our collective vocabulary. Readers unfamiliar with this past will marvel as they read how far women, as a group, have advanced in some (but definitely not all) areas within one generation.These times are described along with the career of Harriet Woods. Entering politics over public inattentiveness to her complaints over a loose manhole, Harriet Woods continued her activism when appointed to a City Council vacancy. From there, she was elected to the Missouri State Senate in 1976, served as Lt. Governor, and then led the National Womens Political Caucus.Harriet Woods did not at first want to be identified as a&quot;women's issues&quot; politician. She soon learned there was a substantial need for her to advocate women's issues. Fortunately she also was able to make her mark in others areas, such as drafting and passing model nursing home reform legislation.The 1960s opened new discussions regarding the status of women, Harriet Woods writes. More women entered politics. Even today, though, very few women with small children are politically active. Harriet Woods notes that 85% of female office holders are over 40 years in age. By comparison, 28% of male office holders are age 40 or younger.The role of women in politics has changed dramatically in Harriet Woods's lifetime. This book is an excellent record of those changes written by someone who both observed and participated in these changes."},{"Title":"Stepping Up to Power: The Political Journey of American Women","review":"This book fills a gap in political literature and should be required reading for all those involved in politics at the grassroots level as well as numerous political science classes. The emergence of women into the political mainstream was probably the most important political trend in the United States in the last half of the 20th century and is one sure to continue into the 21st century. It is important not only because when we have men and women serving together in government, we have better government; but it is incredibly important to the status of women throughout the world. This book is essential because of the importance of its subject. In detailing her struggles in politics, Woods gives excellent practical advice and perspective to women politicians trying to get elected, women office holders trying to impact the political process of city, county, state and federal governments, and also to men to better understand the particular differences and benefits to working together. Whether she is talking about her early struggles in the Missouri legislature or the impact of the Anita Hill hearings during Clarence Thomas' Supreme Court confirmation process, Woods makes these events jump alive for us and helps us gain perspective on the critical impact women have had and can have as partners in the governmental process. This book assumed an added poignance for me because during my reading of it, the plane crash occurred that claimed the life of Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan. It is interesting to hear Woods' references to him in this book. Clearly, I highly recommend this book for all involved in the political process, both men and women. As a man, we cannot afford to allow the talents of our daughters, wife, mother, grandmothers, aunts and friends to be ignored and unrealized. The opportunity to now expand the role of women in government may be one which will have the most impact in improving our political system here in the United States and around the world."},{"Title":"Stepping Up to Power: The Political Journey of American Women","review":"A really interesting account of women's (slow) progress into politics from someone who lived it.

She headed up the Women's Poltical Caucus and made it a credible force for women in politics, she opened many doors for women who came later. For me, with a new interest in politics and a desire to see women play a greater role in our democracy - Harriet's story is important and necessary background."},{"Title":"Stepping Up to Power: The Political Journey of American Women","review":"Harriett Woods tells it like it is for women in politics..she's been there...and also for women who want a voice and action in the world of power.

The book proves to be well written and narrative of the battle provides interesting insights and perceptions. The book remains relatively unbias in nature. The author writes critically about leaders of both armies while understanding that sometimes, mistakes happens! The author provides good background material to the battle before and after.I am not sure what the previous reviewer wrote when complaining about lacks of maps. I thought 18 maps provided in the book was more then enough.This book belong in Civil War library of anyone who have such an interest."},{"Title":"Shiloh: Bloody April","review":"Wiley Sword's \\"Shiloh: Bloody April\\" has been in my library for 30 years now. Every so often I take it down and read through it again, partly to refresh my knowledge of the battle and partly to remind myself what good historical narrative is. Like all good modern historians, Sword weaves together a third-person account of this critical battle with excerpts from diaries and letters written by the participants. While more recent accounts of the Battle of Shiloh have delved even deeper into the primary documents, Sword's book remains a classic both for the extensive research that went into it and for its clear and concise prose."},{"Title":"Shiloh: Bloody April","review":"Sword has written a well-researched and detailed history of the battle. There's a good balance between coverage of military movements and personal stories. My only complaint is the same that I have for every other book of this type - not enough maps to give the reader a totally clear picture of events. Nevertheless, I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in the battle of Shiloh."},{"Title":"Shiloh: Bloody April","review":"The title gives you my thoughts on this book. No library should be considered complete unless it contains a copy of this book. This is the original \\"definitive\\" study on Shiloh and has never become dated. Sword combines excellent scholarship with readable informative writing. This produces an enjoyable learning experience for a person new to the battle and the experienced student.Shiloh is the first large battle of the war. This resulted in a learning experience for both sides, officers and enlisted men. These inexperience soldiers showed how brave they could be. At the sametime, they showed how important training and experience is. This horrific two-day battle shocked Americans, as they took the first step toward understanding the real price of war.The battlefield is wooded broken land. The battle is a confused affaire fought over a three-mile front. The battle lines are never a stable as units move forward or fall back. Shiloh never has the long stable battle lines of Gettysburg. In the hands of a less skilled author, the battle can quickly become incomprehensible. Sword's skill couple with an intelligent design of chapters and excellent maps keeps this from happening.While first published in 1974, a \\"Corrected Edition\\" was released in 2001. This edition contains information that was not available in 1974. This is only a consideration if you are buying on the secondary market. The \\"Corrected Edition\\" is clearly marked and contains a special preface by Wiley Sword."},{"Title":"Shiloh: Bloody April","review":"Too many modern Civil War historians fail to describe the essence of the battles: the fighting and the killing. They spend lots of space on the personalities of the generals and the movements of the armies and regiments, but way too often they fail to convey any real sense of the drama that takes place when the soldiers actually open fire. Sword is one of the few exceptions. His narrative enables you to visualise what the fighting might have been like and he leaves you in no doubt as to how the battle was fought.In addition to being a wonderful storyteller, Sword is a first-rate researcher, and his narrative is superbly documented throughout. This is by far the best book on the battle of Shiloh. Others may have dug up a few letters or diaries that Sword missed, but none of them can present their research like Sword. He certainly deserves 5 stars. My only criticism is that maps could have been better. The terrain with the woods and open fields should have been shown more clearly and some more maps showing the situation along the whole front would have made the book even better. That said, I still think that the maps are adequate and helps you understand how the battle unfolded."},{"Title":"Shiloh: Bloody April","review":"From the dust cover of Wiley Sword's \\"Shiloh: Bloody April\\" the reader is told that Wiley Sword graduated from the University of Michigan and still lives and works in Michigan. In Brigadier General S.L.A. Marshall's forward to Mr. Sword's book, the reader learns that Sword is not a professional writer nor has he any personal military experience, but rather Mr. Sword is a Civil War hobbyist. Shiloh has always been a topic that fascinated Mr. Sword; hence, his book: \\"Shiloh: Bloody April\\".Near the end of his book, Sword recalls Grant's premise that \\"Shiloh was the severest battle at the West during the war, and but few equaled it for hard, determined fighting\\" (p. 438). Still later Sword includes another statement from Grant's memoirs: \\"The Battle of Shiloh . . . has been perhaps less understood, or to state the case more accurately, more persistently misunderstood than any other engagement between National and Confederate troops during the entire rebellion\\" (p. 440). These two notions are key to understanding Sword's thesis. Sword's objective, he writes, is \\". . . to present the story of Shiloh as accurately and objectively as possible without regard to personalities or partisanship\\" (p. xi). Herein, Sword is stating that it is his intention to impress upon the reader the severity of the fighting in that battle and to dispel the misunderstandings that have persisted about Shiloh.Shiloh was not an insignificant battle fought in the backwaters of western Tennessee. Shiloh was not a draw; as such, it was more than a Southern victory on the first day and a Southern reverse on the second day. Accordingly, Wiley Sword's thesis is that Shiloh was a major, strategic defeat for the South. To underscore that purpose, and his thesis, Sword chose as his epigraph a passage from Bruce Catton's \\"This Hallowed Ground\\": \\"On paper, Shiloh was a draw, actually it was one of the decisive battles of the war, it was a battle the Confederacy simply had to win. For it had been a blow struck to restore a disastrously lost balance, a desperate attempt to reestablish the Confederate frontier in the Kentucky - Ohio Valley. It had failed, and the fact that it had come so close to being a dazzling victory did not offset the failure. . . .\\" (p. xxi).Sword begins his narrative with a preliminary overview of the sequence of events that culminated in the battle of Shiloh. Sword introduces the major characters (their aims and objectives: personal, political, or military) who set the stage for this momentous battle. Sword also describes the physical features of the battlefield.In the overview, Sword also describes the mission of the Federal army in Tennessee. The campaigns of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson are briefly related. Sword also touches on how Major General Halleck was jealous of his immediate subordinate Major General Ulysses S. Grant's successes at Fort Henry and Fort Donelson. Sword relates how the Federals came to be located at Pittsburg Landing. Using Sherman's words, wherein Sherman recounts how the land at Pittsburg Landing was extremely well suited to be a campground and how it was the lowest landing still above water on the flooded Tennessee River, Sword reveals the happenstance choice was General William T. Sherman's.Sword then begins to explain the direness of the Confederate's position. \\"From Columbus to Bowling Green, Kentucky, and beyond to the Cumberland Mountains, Johnston and his general's were compelled to order the Confederacy's armies withdrawn\\" (p. 49). Sword reveals that President Jefferson Davis had to defend General Albert S. Johnston from declaimers in Richmond who were demanding that Johnston be replaced. Sword details the circumstances leading to General P.G.T. Beauregard's arrival at Corinth, Mississippi. Sword recounts the March 23, 1862 meeting between Generals Johnston, Beauregard, Bragg, and Polk and the reorganization of the structure of Confederate forces in the West.According to Sword, Johnston received his marching orders from President Davis and General Robert E. Lee on or about April 1. Sword says: \\"Davis wrote, \`if you can meet the division of the enemy moving from the Tennessee before it can make a junction with that advancing from Nashville the future will be brighter'\\" (p. 91). Lee advised \\"\`. . . when your army is united, to deal a blow at the enemy in your front, if possible, before his rear gets up from Nashville'\\" (p. 91). Sword shows that Johnston's mission was explicit: strike Grant before Buell was on the scene.Sword proceeds to give a minutely detailed account of events from April 3 to April 7. He writes about the many obstacles and delays the Confederates encountered on their march to Pittsburg Landing. Sword also writes about the failure of the Federal command to note the approach of the Confederate army despite warnings from junior officers.Quoting from personal letters and memoirs of Shiloh veterans, Sword recounts in vivid detail how Grant's army was almost overwhelmingly surprised by Johnston's attack on April 6. Sword also points out that Confederate battle plan requiring the \\"deployment of Hardee's, Bragg's, and Polk's corps in three tandem lines, was one of the battle's worst mistakes\\" (p. 96). The tandem arrangement of the corps made for constant confusion in the dense thickets. This order, plus the supplemental order(s) to attack towards the sound of the heaviest fighting, the loss of General Johnston at a critical point in the battle, the steadfastness of Brigadier General Benjamin Prentiss at a sunken road (henceforth known as the \`Hornet's Nest'), and the Confederate's mistaking a Union brigade (Stuart's) as a division prevented the Confederates from completely routing the Federals on the first day of battle.Sword continues to call forth the voices of Shiloh's veterans in order to recall the horror and misery those soldiers endured throughout the night of April 6. Troops on both sides were kept awake by the constant booming of Union naval guns. A persistent drizzle further antagonized the Union troops, who had abandoned their camps to the Rebels, and the wounded and dying lying between the lines.Sword spends only two chapters recounting the fighting that occurred on April 7. Sword relates that Buell's army and General Lew Wallace's wandering division finally arrived during the night. At dawn, on April 7, the tables were turned, and Beauregard was surprised by Grant's counterattack. The Confederates were forced to grudgingly give up the ground they had fought so hard for the day before. Sword has Sherman recount that his career very nearly ended there as he described his close brush with death when General Nathan B. Forrest drove back pursuing Yankees with the cavalry charge that ended the battle.In his final chapter, entitled \\"War is Horrible,\\" Sword recounts how each army nursed its wounds and prepared for the next battle. Sword paraphrases Catton's valued opinion about the importance of the battle and quotes General Bragg's lament about how near the Confederates had come to winning. It is here also that Sword restates his thesis when he writes: \\"The fact that the Confederacy had come close to succeeding did not compensate for the utter failure to achieve these results. There after the South was further ensnarled in what one early student of the battle termed \`the wasting war of defense.' For these reasons Shiloh must be regarded as one of the most decisive battles of the Civil War, and of history\\" (p. 438). Sword concludes his book by touching on the many personal and professional \`what if issues' that emanated from the battle.Sword's most significant accomplishment, and perhaps his most haunting, is his ability to convey the fear, fury, and confusion that must have been so prevalent during the battle of Shiloh. He accomplishes this by consistently using the eyewitness accounts of the participants themselves. This reflects Sword's heavy reliance on primary sources and documentation (both published and unpublished). Even General Marshall acknowledges that Sword successfully taps into the primal elements of battle that transcend time and place and are elemental on all fields of battle.Sword's book is also well illustrated. It contains eighteen maps and thirty-eight photographs. The maps are serviceable but do not include terrain features, other than streams and roads, to illustrate the ruggedness of the terrain. Sword overcomes this deficiency with his verbal description of the contested ground. Less satisfactory are Sword's footnotes. These are somewhat cumbersome and confusing. It is difficult to cross-reference a particular citation and then understand the abbreviations used.Despite his thesis, Wiley Sword fails to fully explain why this battle was so pivotal. On this point James L. McDonough's \\"Shiloh: In Hell Before Night\\" is much more successful. Wiley's account does not satisfactorily show where Shiloh figures into the greater scheme of subsequent Civil War campaigns that secured control of the Mississippi River Valley for the Union. Wiley Sword does not mention the fall of Corinth or New Orleans, nor does he mention that Shiloh was a key step towards the Union capture of Vicksburg. McDonough does all of this very well. However, Wiley's book is a good complement to McDonough's book. Both authors have shortcomings that are off set by the work of the other. Wiley Sword's book makes a valuable contribution to fount of literature about the Civil War in general and about the battle of Shiloh in particular."},{"Title":"The Teacher's Funeral","review":"I got hooked on Richard Peck after reading A Year Down Yonder, and A Long Way From Chicago.

One of the most lauded authors of fiction for young adults, Peck has received a National Humanities Medal, the Newbery Medal, and a Newbery Honor. Each richly deserved.Equally merited is the Tony nomination gifted voice performer Dylan Baker received. His narration of this story set in 1904 Indiana is warm and moving. As an adult Russell Ciulver looks back on the year he was 15 when all he wanted was to cut out of backwoods Indiana and head for the Dakotas. Then it seemed opportunity knocked: \\"If your teacher has to die,\\" says Russell, \\"August isn't a bad time of year for it.\\"Surely, he thought a new teacher wouldn't be hired for the half dozen students at Hominy Ridge School. He was forced to think again as his older sister, Tansy, was appointed to the post. She took it on with relish. As many a younger brother would, Russell decided it was time for a little subversion, such as a snake in her desk or a fire in the boy's privy plus sundry other bits of irritation.Tansy was not about to be thwarted, certainly not by Russell.This is a story the entire family will enjoy.

Keep in mind this is exactly what it says on the cover, a comedy, not a historical novel. This is a perfect read aloud as kids and adults will love the comments about school being up hill both ways \\"As it was in those days.\\" We have read Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn, The Yearling, as well as freshly written novels about farming communities such as Dust. All fabulous in their own right and this one fits right up there with these. My three boys who are 12, 10 and 8 loved to make connections with the exagerated stories told to them by both their grandfathers and the hardships, and adventures of their rural childhoods.

I personally think it shouldn't be considered a comedy, seeing as I only recall laughing at a couple parts. Nonetheless, it was one of the more interesting historical fiction books I've encountered.The story is based in rural Indiana, 1904, where Russell lives with his dad, older sister Tansy, younger brother Lloyd and old Aunt Maud. In August, just before school is scheduled to begin, the ancient schoolhouse teacher, Ms. Myrt, drops dead. This sudden death of the only schoolhouse teacher in the small town brings hope to Russell and his friends that school will be canceled for good.No such luck. To his dismay, Ms. Mryt's former position is taken over by none other than his bossy and controlling older sister Tansy. With less than ten students in the one room schoolhouse, a dream of running away to the glorious Dakotas to pursue, and a fun-sucking older sister to control it all, it is sure to be an interesting eighth grade year for Russell.I didn't think there was anything very special or intriguing about the author Richard Peck's style of writing. In fact, if it weren't for me being obligated to read a historical fiction book, I'd have ditched The Teacher's Funeral after reading two pages. Yes, it did get a bit more interesting as I got into it, but barely. I couldn't relate to this story to my life the least bit. The main character and I are both in middle school, but that's about it."},{"Title":"The Teacher's Funeral","review":"LOL historical one-room school humor. 1904 silly in the southern hills of Indiana. A difficult read when your wife is in the room, since she asked I read all the parts aloud that I laughed through.

And he sent back for a blanket.\\"Russel is the 15 yr old main character who is wise to the world and ready to end his education a year earlier than the law requires in Indiana for a life of farm machinery in the Dakotas.

But in Peck humorous style, after a laughable first Indiana road accident between horse and motor, the worst of all possible teacher replacements is announced. I'll not spoil the fun.Along the way you meet the hilarious community of pioneer farm community misfits ever assembled. Kids and adults alike. Some have nicknames like Flopears, Little Britches, and JW (Just Worthless, the dog). Others have proper names: Aunt Fanny Hamline a large woman, Baz Ellenbogen the gravedigger, the Tarbox clan, and some Indiana historic names like Mr. Owen. Even funnier is their fast-paced shenanigans, like Aunt Maud Singleterry's record-setting catapult from the family wagon. And Richard Peck is an expert in producing hilarious zingers right in the middle of a paragraph that comes so unexpected.I read another Indiana story by this author, \\"Here Lies the Librarian,\\" and would recommend it also. Seems Peck likes killing off Indiana book lovers in fiction.There is plenty of factual history in the book, presented in a fun way. You, and the kids, will not notice the fact they are learning about the early days of Indiana history while reading this book. Adults with a bit of Hoosier history knowledge will find even more fun Indiana trivia slipped between the dialogue. What fun.Every school library should have this, especially the Midwest/Great Lakes, and most emphatically INDIANA, public, private, school, homeschooling, and all.

It is too bad that this author hasn't visited either the twenty third or twenty fourth centuries in quite some time, because they did some fairly decent work. As some of the other reviewers have pointed out, this one definitely has a very slow paced beginning to it but that is soon worked out as the plot turns from a plodding setup into a well paced conclusion.Capitalizing on the Star Trek The Next Generation first season episode, &quot;The Big Goodbye,&quot; the author brings forth some non canon knowledge of the Jaradan race which was never actually seen in the episode. This too was unfortunate as I've always found insectoid races to be an interesting aspect in the Star Trek universe but one that is only practically used in the novels but given the latest technology, we're now able to see them, such as one of the species of Xindi in the third season opener of Enterprise, &quot;The Expanse.&quot;As cover art goes, this early STNG novel has fairly decent cover art but it's nothing too spectacular. Of note though is that the images of Riker and Crusher are &quot;realistic,&quot; unlike the cartoon like covers of old.The premise:The Enterprise is ordered to Jarada to negotiate an exchange of Ambassadors when the Jarada, a mysterious race of insectoid beings that possess an extreme devotion to protocol seemingly come out of their reclusive nature and offer to open diplomatic relations. Upon arrival at Jarada, Captain Picard and crew suddenly find that the Jarada are being uncharacteristically friendly. Without preamble, the Jarada change their demeanor and Commander Riker and the rest of his away team are cut off from the Enterprise. At the same time, the Jarada attack the Enterprise.What follows from there is, as stated above, a slow starter that has a well paced finished as Picard must find a way to rescue his away team and salvage any hopes of a diplomatic relationship with the Jarada.I'd definitely recommend this early STNG novel as it makes an excellent addition to your Star Trek library. {ssintrepid}"},{"Title":"Imbalance (Star Trek The Next Generation, No 22)","review":"The Star Trek (The next generation) are sent to Beltaxiyan Minor to negotiate a treaty with the insectoids there. Typical of all Star Trek novels I have read and seen, something goes terrably wrong. The Insectoid race lives and thinks a hive metastability which complicates relationships. Individually, it seems, each crew member on the away team gets into serious trouble. The odds are against them, but somehow (surprise surprise) they pull it off in the end. The thesis is archetypal Star Trek: They ain't like us, but in some ways they are exactly like us, we just need to understand them. I think the author pulls that off okay. Some reviews said is started slow. Maybe so, but I enjoyed the writing enough all the way through.If you like Star Trek stories I think you will like this one as well. Good, but not brilliant by any means."},{"Title":"Imbalance (Star Trek The Next Generation, No 22)","review":"I really hate ripping on books, but how can I say positive things about this book? It felt like I was reading filler the entire time. Adding descriptions to make a word count can be good, but only rarely. The foreshadowing(what little there was) was obvious and made the end a Duh! moment. Luckily the pace of the book picks up at around page 230, so the last 50 pages aren't complete torture.Only read this book if you are one of those people that must read every book in the series and in order.(Like me)"},{"Title":"Imbalance (Star Trek The Next Generation, No 22)","review":"Perhaps those who gave Imbalance only one star didn't stick around to finish it. It does start slowly, painfully slowly. However, it picks up soon and has some fine scenes. Riker, Worf, Keiko, and Crusher each find themselves alone and trapped on an alien world, with the former three in particular undergoing interesting, tension building adventures. In the end, the only major complaints to be had are a too petty O'Brien and a deus ex machina via transporter.There are no deep revelations or insights here, just a pleasant read with some fun images that will linger - like that of Riker becoming a human toboggan."},{"Title":"Imbalance (Star Trek The Next Generation, No 22)","review":"If I could give this book zero stars, I would. This piece of trash should never had made the shelves. One would think that the editors of Pocket Books would have screened this novel and put a stop once they found how bad this is. Hopefully, V.E.

Also, those who rate this one star are also dead on the money."},{"Title":"Imbalance (Star Trek The Next Generation, No 22)","review":"And in the case of this book, some of those details are just devilishly WRONG. Other than those few details, this is a fairly middle of the road Next Generation novel; the pace is a bit slow at times, although it does pick up at others, and the basic plot is fairly standard Next Generation fare, so if the idea of a Vulcan commissioner demonstrating unadulterated impatience, to the point of repeatedly requesting information without allowing enough time from the previous request to pass for it to be POSSIBLE for an answer to have been received doesn't strike you as illogically emotional; if the characterization of Miles O'Brien as a surly, possessive, jealous, chauvinistic jerk doesn't strike you as completely out of character, AND if you're willing to believe that birth control technology hasn't improved sufficiently by the 24th century to make unplanned pregnancies EXTREMELY rare, but that in fact both Molly O'Brien AND Wesley Crusher were the result of unplanned, accidental pregnancies, then by all means, consider this a three star review.

The plot builts up slowly, then when the readers expect a surprise at the end, they're left empty-handed except for a corny hypothesis"},{"Title":"Imbalance (Star Trek The Next Generation, No 22)","review":"This book is a sequel to the Next Generation episode \\"The Big Goodbye.\\" In that episode, the Enterprise is en route to make contact with the Jarada, an insect-like species that demands that they be addressed in a precise manner in their language. Furthermore, their language is difficult for humans and they will only allow the greeting to be stated by Captain Picard.In this story, the Enterprise is traveling to the home world of the Jarada in an attempt to get them to join the Federation. The primary officers of the Enterprise are puzzled that the contacts and events initially go very well, the Jarada seem rather lax for a species known for the precision of their interactions with others. Several teams are transported down to the surface and the Jarada deliberately sabotage their communicators so that the Enterprise can no longer retrieve them.Furthermore, chaos breaks out between the Jarada and the Enterprise crew members on the surface must battle the odds in order to survive long enough to be rescued. Jaradan ships attack the Enterprise and all contact with Jaradan officials on the surface is lost. After far too lengthy adventures on the surface by some crew of the Enterprise and some rather simple actions on the part of the medical staff of the Enterprise, order is restored among the Jarada.This story is extremely weak for two primary reasons. The first is that the action of Riker and Worf in moving through tunnels goes on far too long, reaching the point of boredom for the reader. Secondly, the affliction that the Jarada suffer from has baffled their best scientific minds, yet the Enterprise medical team quickly learns that it is caused by a simple mineral deficiency. It is absurd that any society capable of space flight would be unable to determine when a serious illness is being caused by a mineral deficiency. Statistical medical techniques make it very easy to solve such problems. Finally, even though there is little building of tension to the climactic events, those events happen so suddenly and simply that it lands with a very soft thud."},{"Title":"Imbalance (Star Trek The Next Generation, No 22)","review":"I read Imbalance when I was about 14, maybe 13, and I absolutely loved it.

The author was able to take a portion of John Dee's diaries and not only modernize the wording and name of places but also translate some of the Greek and Latin passages. Hence it creates a down to earth but yet scholarly edition of John Dee's Diaries. What really impressed me about this book were the references at the end of the chapters. Not only does Fenton list numerous sources where to gather more information but also goes a bit more in detail about what is going on in the life of Dr. John Dee. At the end of the book there is a \\"biographical guide.\\" This part of the book is not only interesting but also invaluable. It lists all the major characters that were involved in John Dee's diaries and shows when they were born, died, and gives a brief description of the person. The only thing that kept me from giving this book five stars was the author's attitude towards Edward Kelly. Edward Fenton often portrays Kelly as a trickster (which he may very well have been) but seems to add his opinion at the wrong times when there appears to be no real evidence suggesting his opinion. Other than that one minor flaw I recommend this book to the student, teacher, casual reader, philosopher, & even to the mage.

Recomendet"},{"Title":"Software Product-Line Engineering: A Family-Based Software Development Process","review":"This book really deserves two separate ratings. The first five chapters introduce domain engineering in general. If you are new to the idea of family-based software development, or need some convincing of its intended benefits, this section isn't bad. The two case studies presented gloss over some of the complicated concepts while providing too much technical detail in others. For example, the important but non-trivial job of creating the &quot;decision model&quot; for the domain is given minimal coverage. On the other hand, every class in the JAVA code used to illustrate one example is explained individually. I'd give this section a 3-star rating as an introduction to domain engineering.The rest of the book is an incredibly detailed reference into the authors' implementation of the FAST process. They spend two chapters bringing the reader up-to-speed on the process modeling technique called PASTA. Then they provide almost 200 pages of reference information (also included on CD-ROM) on the specifics of FAST. If you are looking for a recipe to use to try domain analysis and implementation in your company, this section covers it. If nothing else, you'll see a very well defined process modeling notation in action, one that can be used in many applications. Without any personal experience implementing the process, I hesitate to rate this section. But if the process works as well as this section is detailed, I'd give it at least 4 stars.Its hard to say from their examples how well the FAST process will scale to industrial-size domains. But the authors have presented an easily read book with enough detail that a motivated software engineer may be able to win management support and give domain engineering a try."},{"Title":"Software Product-Line Engineering: A Family-Based Software Development Process","review":"I've just about never worked on commercial software that was shipped in only one form. There have been variations in the platform configurations, in the functional options, or in the generation of product. This book addresses the process of building families of software products, the kind that derive generally similar sets of functionality from a shared code base, i.e., the majority of commercial software in my experience.The authors start with an obvious premise, but a premise that's overlooked far too often. They start by saying that their approach does not work in all cases, and may not work in yours - if only such honesty were more common! Although it makes the third, or fourth, or tenth member of the product family easier to develop, it incurs design and implementation costs up front. Despite long term economies, the first few family members might actually cost more than with one-off design techniques. The first step in this methodology is to decide whether the next steps will actually do you any good.After that, though, I find this to be only an ordinary presentation of software design methodology. Although it adds steps for analyzing product families to the standard software development cycle, those steps are only a small part of the whole. At least 90% of the cycle is the same for a one-off project as for one where massive reuse is a major design goal, but the authors present the entire cycle in detail. I'd even say excruciating detail. The second half of the book, 200 pages or so, presents the methodology one step at a time, often one step per page, with forms to be filled out at each step: formal pre- and post-conditions, lists of involved participant, artifacts generated or modified at each step, and on and on and on.Despite it's overwhelming mass of detail, I find it systematically lacking in one major respect. The first pass over the process is only a small part of any long-lived project. After that, every successive design cycle takes the entire result of the previous cycle as input. In some sense, acknowledgement of the past is the first and biggest requirement, where the past consists of all code and documentation artifacts from the previous effort. \\"Green field\\" construction is a rarity in the software world, but a premise of most design methodologies, this one included. The second major weakness in this book may just be a matter of editorial choice: it addresses the organizational aspects of the project only, with few (if any) tips for the technologist creating a line of products. The techniques of design for flexibility, especially for variation over time, cover whole ranges of topics that aren't part of this dicsussion.So we're left with a mass of imposing organizational detail, with reams of families of forms and formalities. These could become oppressive if not handled in a context-sensitive way, but the authors say little about tailoring the process to different environments.

There is ample background, and the actual inscriptions are presented, and analyzed in considerable detail. Its worth owning, if you're an archaeology buff.Let me just warn people that real archaeologists, real Egyptologists don't have a whole lot of respect for the author of this book anymore. A lot of conventions in translation have sort of moved on since his time. In the movie &quot;Stargate,&quot; they make fun of him a little. This is because people don't really use his writings anymore. This book itself is okay as far as it goes, but you need to be very careful of what Budge says.Look for &quot;Egyptian Grammar&quot; by Sir Alan Gardiner. That's the standard textbook, used by real Egyptologists. The magazine KMT is good to know about, too. It's all about ancient Egypt, and is easy to find online.If you enjoy this type of puzzle-solving, let me recommend a few titles. &quot;The Decipherment of Linear B,&quot; by John Chadwick, &quot;Breaking the Maya Code&quot; by Michael Coe, and &quot;The Origins of the Mithraic Mysteries&quot; by David Ulansey are all still in print. &quot;Forgotten Scripts&quot; by Cyrus Gordon, and &quot;Voices in Stone&quot; by Ernst Doblhofer are harder to find, but if you ask your local librarian to search for them using interlibrary loan services, he or she will probably find them. It's really worth it... Also, there are still a few ancient scripts out there that no one has deciphered yet. The Indus Valley Script, the Easter Island Script, and the Meroitic script are three of them. The Meroitic script could shed light someday on the issue of how much contact there was between Ancient Egypt and pre-historic Africa. The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, at www.mfa.org, has the best collection around on Meroe, and Meroitic, if anyone's interested. A good book for that script is &quot;Ancient African Civilizations,&quot; edited by Stanley Burstein, which contains several useful chapters.Well, happy deciphering to you!"},{"Title":"The Rosetta stone","review":"A republication of the first edition, published in 1929, this book provides the English translations of the hieroglyphic, demotic and Greek texts as well as the original Greek and hieroglyphic inscriptions, as they appear on the Rosetta Stone. It also describes its discovery and its arrival in London. The author briefly explains the coptic alphabet and tells the history of the decipherment by Thomas Young and Jean-Franois Champollion. Finally, in the last section are the English translations of the decrees of Canopus and of Memphis. Interesting to all persons curious about the Rosetta Stone and particularly those needing its inscriptions."},{"Title":"The Rosetta stone","review":"found the book somewhat out of date, and too technical for the ordinary reader. It could do with a detailed modern summary to set it in its proper time and context"},{"Title":"The Rosetta stone","review":"Since I didn't find a more compelling book to read about this subject, such as \\"The Keys of Egypt\\", I read this little book. Most of the book are just translations of the original writings in the Rosetta Stone so just a few words are dedicated to the most interesting part, the story to decipher the egyptian hieroglyphics. Despite of that, I learned a lot with this book, although I wanted more."},{"Title":"The Rosetta stone","review":"I dislike giving a fixed rating to a book, as this one would get five stars if you want an inexpensive collection of the actual texts of the Rosetta stone and other copies of the same inscription. As a source of the current understanding of ancient Egypt it would get two stars: the book's scholarship is outdated, including its approach to the history of the finding and decipherment of the stone.Many quotes are untranslated, and you are expected to be able to read a bit of French, German, Greek, and Latin, or skip over those few paragraphs. Having studied only the latter three of those, and too long ago to do much good, I ended up missing most of the quotes.This review was written just after the election of George W. Bush to the presidency of the United States, and it is amazing how much the proclimation of the Rosetta Stone sounds like Bush's program; reducing taxes, beefing up the military against potential threats, punishment of those who opposed his father, professions of faith, and positioning the new leader as a benefactor of the common people."},{"Title":"The Rosetta stone","review":"I like this book, because it is informative, and it has a copy of the Coptic alphabet on page 247.

However, Gunnar is out of pocket, leaving Sunny Childs in charge of both the operational and financial operations of the company. While trying to ransom a stolen painting for a client, Sunny's perp is shot and the painting remains missing. She also learns that Gunnar has cashed a $100K CD that was used as collateral on a credit line at the bank.The bank calls in the loan, giving Sunny four days to pay back the debt or they will foreclose the business. When she reports to her client that the painting was stolen, she cuts a deal to find the painting in exchange for a $100K. Sunny is determined to save the company and regain the painting, regardless of the obstacles tossed her way by dangerous felons who will kill anyone who crosses their path.Readers will like the tough Sunny, who is an amalgam (not of DC and Marvel) of Scarpetta, Blake, and Milhorne. The convoluted plot yields many suspects, false trails, and red herrings, thereby guaranteeing an exhilarating how and who-done-it. Ruth Birmingham has started a terrific series that brings alive the mean streets of Atlanta.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Atlanta Graves","review":"I read this book after I'd read the author's two following books about Sunny.

Sunny, part owner and operative for Peachtree Investigations is hired to retrieve a stolen painting. She spends much of her time fronting for absent boss, and Peachtree Investigations founder, Gunnar Brushwood, trying to keep the business solvent, pleasing her mother and dumping her married lover. Set in Atlanta, Sunny moves easily from Dunwoody and glitzy benefits to a ride on Marta to crime-ridden Southwest Atlanta. Author Ruth Birmingham offers a glimpse of Atlanta that makes you feel like she knows the territory (with one glaring error -- a character who majored in Criminal Justice at Georgia Tech). Like many mysteries, the title does not have any real relation to the plot but Sunny may eventually develop into a well-rounded character who could sustain a series."},{"Title":"Atlanta Graves","review":"This is my second Ruth Birmingham book. After reading this author earlier this year, I was looking forward to another entertaining read, which is what I got. Entertaining, but not enthralling. The book centers around Sunny Childs, an Atlanta private investigator who finds herself as the go between in a case involving a stolen painting and the ransom for it's return. After the &quot;drop&quot; goes wrong, Sunny finds herself right in the middle of the case and the stakes are raised when murder occurs. Add to this Sunny's attempt to save the firm from financial ruin and you have an entertaining but not very deep plot."},{"Title":"Atlanta Graves","review":"This is a fine debut detective novel by Ruth Birmingham, and it makes me look forward to reading more of her work. Her protagonist, Sunny Childs, PI, is clever, feisty, and always interesting, and the story is well-plotted, full of interesing twists and turns.Birmingham succeeds in creating a tone that is hip and humorous and overall her style does resemble that of Sue Grafton. There's certainly room for more great mysteries with female protagonists, though, isn't there? It's also great fun to see a detective series set in Atlanta, a dynamic, cosmopolitan, and historic city.The only drawback I found was the laborious &quot;let me tell you how I did it before I kill you&quot; passage toward the end of the book. I suppose this is pretty standard fare for detective novels, but I would like to think that this feature could be minimized.Otherwise, congratlations to Ms. Birmingham for her inaugural effort."},{"Title":"Atlanta Graves","review":"This is an excellent book that is very similar to the V.I.

Lecky takes on Freud and Pavlov, arguing that they are dependent on faulty metaphors. Lecky holds that &quot;people can only be true to themselves. Individuals will behave in a way that is consistent with their self concept, even if this behavior is otherwise unrewarding to them&quot;Anyone serious about understanding the psychology of the Self should read this book--not once, but several times."},{"Title":"Self-consistency,: A theory of personality;","review":"This book is a 10,000 carat diamond in the rough.First, the rough:Too much of it is a spot-on criticism of the flaws of Behaviorism, written at a time when being critical of Behaviorism was the surest path to professional suicide as an academic psychologist.Much of the rest is a description of personality inventories Lecky worked on, and which have little modern relevance, and little relevance to the theories expounded in this book.Now, the diamond:A small sub-section of this book, perhaps the final third of it, expounds Lecky's theory of self-consistency: that one of the most basic instincts guiding learning and the formation of identity and personality is the need to form an integrated and self-consistent map of reality. And that for good reason, once this map is formed, its continuing consistency is generally more important than its accuracy.These theories, developed in the 20s and 30s, and published in this book in 1945, presaged Leon Festinger's Cognitive Dissonance Theory by 11 years.In essence, Cognitive Dissonance is merely a restatement of Self-Consistency Theory, and one which is much poorer for it's limited scope: where Lecky described the instinct which drives people to be internally consistent, Festinger only described people's reactions to inconsistency.All modern research in dissonance that I've read so far has supported or been consistent with Lecky's basic theory, and I consistently find that theories and research based on Dissonance become clearer and more powerful when re-described in terms of self-consistency.If you can find a cheap copy, I recommend this book to anybody interested in personality, dissonance theory, learning, therapy, or persuasion. As I'm writing this, though, it's $600 on Amazon. At those prices, I still recommend it to anybody actively researching dissonance."},{"Title":"Home Territories: Media, Mobility and Identity (Comedia)","review":"I received the book very soon and I am very happy with it.

Many books on these topics are just too wordy and intimidating. Kissell's brevity is helpful without sacrificing content.The content and graphics are simple and straight forward, not spending too much time getting deep into engineering level discussion. I also like the order in which the material is presented, it has a natural flow that keeps the average reader from having to flip back and forth through the book to make sense of it.My recommendations to improve the book would be to:1. Add some additional practice problems and also outline some practical laboratory exercises to reinforce the text.2. Make references to other material that delve deeper into the theory behind the basics. Something similar to &quot;For more information on this topic...Kissell's other works are equally well written, and prove his capabilities of deeper level discussion on industrial technology.

There are great recipes in it like I was hoping. Also, the lifestyle advice and the 21 day plan are all very practical and doable and simply focus on getting more produce & fiber in your life and exercising more.

I am forty years old and the last program I tried was Dr. Phil's, to no avail. This book changed everything. I learned that well being is not just physical but emotional and spiritual also. The recipes were realistic and my family loved them. The authors touched on many great tips that perhaps we all know are correct, just hard to put into practice. This was also made easy to digest by a 21 day program that was easy to follow. (Not a bunch of prepacked food to buy, meetings to attend and money to spend).

For me a real smoothie is all fruit."},{"Title":"Jamba Juice Power","review":"I was hoping to find more recipes in this book than it has. I'm a Jamba Juice junkie and wanted to make smoothies like they make them. I was hoping to find more about smoothies and more input from author Kirk Perron. It appears the bulk of the book was written by freelance writer, Stan Dembecki, which is okay, but is he a smoothie expert like Kirk? I guess it depends on what you are looking for. This book seems to be more of a lifstyle book. If that is what you are looking for, it's okay."},{"Title":"Jamba Juice Power","review":"Whether a novice or a nutrition guru, after reading this fun and energetic book, you will undoubtedly learn something about yourself and about the world of food around you. Mr. Perron and Mr. Dembecki have given us an easy-to-read, easier-to-understand book that \\"blends\\" the daunting subject of nutritional science with common sense, offering the reader information everyone should know about the food they choose to eat, and a simple and relatively short ?21 Day? plan to begin acting on this new information. Jamba Juice Power is not new diet book. It does offer many smoothie recipes, so many, in fact, that I thought it might also be called a cookbook of sorts. But what would you expect from the man who built more than 350 (and counting) smoothie stores across America? Jamba Juice Power is a practical approach to understanding the importance of what we feed our bodies with while presenting to the reader a no-nonsense plan to see for themselves how small adjustments in their daily diet and daily routines can drastically improve energy, enthusiasm and overall wellbeing. Read this book if you are a daily visitor to Jamba Juice or have never even seen a Jamba Juice store, it will mean a great deal to both of you."},{"Title":"Jamba Juice Power","review":"I'm a big fan of Jamba Juice and would see this book offered in their juice bars and sometimes skim through it. After I moved and was no longer within walking distance from a Jamba Juice, I decided to purchase the book through an Amazon seller (the best, less expensive way to go). While there is nothing in this book that is revolutionary or \\"wow\\" producing, it offers easy smoothie (and some juice) recipes and a fun 21-day lifestyle changing plan.The first part gives basic nutritional information on fruits, veggies, and supplement boosts. It goes into what to shop for (low fat, green veggies--the usual stuff) and what vitamins and nutrients certain foods contain. Nothing new or surprising here except it warns not to eat more than a can of tuna per month due to mercury content. Per month? Is that correct?The parts of the book that are unique are the 21-day lifestyle program and the smoothie and juice recipes. The plan gives nutritional tips and meal recommendations (it promotes the 5-6 small meals a day idea), plus activities to do for body, mind, and spirit. The activities are simple and painless enough--taking a walk on your lunch break, dancing, soaking in a tub in Epsom salts, enjoying nature. The difficulty I had with it is that it recommends a different smoothie recipe and meals each day. These smoothies use different fruits, juices, sherbet flavors, or yogurt. You can't really stock up on all the fruits you need and use them every few days without them going bad unless you freeze them or only buy enough for one or two smoothies at a time (and who wants to go to the grocery every day). If I get, for example, blueberries and strawberries to combine with orange juice for the Orange Oomph smoothie, I want to make that smoothie each day until I use up the fruit. The same goes for the meals.The smoothies are tasty--although mine never come out as thick as Jamba Juices. I liked the recipes that contain sherbet rather than frozen yogurt as I make a smoothie in the morning and put in a refrigerator at work for 4-5 hours before drinking for lunch. The smoothies made with frozen yogurt do not look appealing after sitting in the fridge. Also, the dates did not chop up at all in my blender, so I stopped using the recipes that used them.Most of the recipes combine a cup of one fruit, a half cup of another, a cup of juice, a cup of sherbet and ice. You could easily make your own recipes that would be tasty, too. There are a few juice recipes (far more smoothies, though) so, if you want to follow the 21-day plan to a 'T', you'll need a juicer. If you're flexible and willing to substitute, a blender is probably sufficient. The book gives suggestions on which blender or juicer to buy.Jamba Power is a fun book and, if you get it for the affordable price from the Amazon sellers, it is worth it for the recipes. I don't think it is worth full-price though because the information and ideas are just basic stuff and tasty smoothies like the ones in this book can be made by experimenting with different fruits, juices, sherbets, and yogurt on your own."},{"Title":"Jamba Juice Power","review":"Wish we had a jamba Juice store nearby, I'd visit it often.

So on the one hand you can't get the drinks anymore since they are off the menu, nor can you get the recipes for them. Maybe JJ is thinking they'll bring those drinks back once in a while to play coercive games with consumers a la the economically-cyclical mcRib game..?Lame. Super duper lame.Also, the juice recipes are OK but they are what you'd find in any/all juicing books, so it's nothing new if you have been juicing for even a short while. For example, carrot apple beet juice is standard issue and what anyone would do if they've been juicing for longer than a month.My recommendation is if this is your first juicing book it's probably good enough for you.Otherwise if you have another juicing book, skip this book as it is redundant and derivative.And if you don't have a juicer, well this books is unhelpful so you should then go get one and experiment. There's plenty of better recipes on the web. Sometimes you can a juicer at thrift stores but really you want an Omega auger type, they are truly the best and easier to use than champion.

Jack Dodd, a schoolmate of the Hardy's, asks Frank and Joe to solve a family mystery involving a treasure hidden during Pilgrim times. However, after Jack and his father are accused of stealing cars along the Shore Road, they disappear. Did the Dodds go onto hiding so that they could search for the treasure? Did they run away because they are guilty? Or were they kidnapped to make it look as if they ran away? Frank, Joe and Chet work to find the answer and solve the mysteries. This book was quite good; it has a realistic plot, plenty of action and was generally enjoyable. Nonetheless, I prefer the original edition to the revised. The original edition was better written as to the flow of the book and the language used. The Pilgrim mystery, which was not a part of the original, felt tacked on and was not woven into the story very well in my opinion. Both editions are worth reading and since they are only similar in their basic plot and only slightly similar in their endings, I think that most fans could read one and then not feel bored reading the second one later. However, if you're only going to read one, I'd say to go with the original."},{"Title":"The Shore Road Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 6)","review":"A string of car robberies have piqued the Hardy Boy's interest. It appears as though the car thieves regularly elude the police even when the police are hot on their trail. When the Hardy Boys put their minds to the mystery what they discover is that the car crooks are even cleverer than they could ever have suspected.We follow the Hardy Boys as they try to prove that the Dodds, who car thieves framed and then disappeared, had nothing to do with the thefts. Eventually the Hardy Boys discover that the car thieves have plans far more nefarious than simply stealing cars.While searching for the car thieves the boys also learn that there is a Dodd family mystery involving missing treasure. The boys also wonder what the mysterious spider-man has to do with the mystery. And why does a certain farmer always seem to be plowing his fields without lights in the middle of the night? As the story nears its conclusion the boys will use a car as a Trojan horse to attempt to trap the thieves. What will happen when the thieves discover the boys? There are many mysteries for the boys to solve. The boys learn that their father has an important mystery of his own, but in the end it turns out that their father's mystery and theirs may be related.This mystery is one of the most intriguing Hardy Boys mysteries. The author managed to change a simple car theft story into a puzzle for the Hardy Boys. The author also mixed in additional story elements to be sure that it would be relatively difficult for the Hardy Boys to solve the mystery.As a side note, this mystery has a cave as a key element. It appears that the author was in a cave mood, because caves appeared in each of the previous four stories, and continue to appear in the next stories. Just goes to show how versatile caves can be.Though the Hardy Boys series is written in a relatively archaic fashion, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent. The stories were once recommended for children ages 10 to 14. As children are exposed to more violence and seem to require greater levels of stimulation, the recommended age range has move to 9 to 12. I think any child capable of reading some of the challenging words in these books will enjoy them, regardless of how tame most of the action may be. Once a child has reached age 12 or so the stories may be of less interest, but given the combination of mystery and action, these books remain good safe choices for parents who want to know what their children are reading."},{"Title":"The Shore Road Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 6)","review":"The Shore Road Mystery re-write wasn't nearly as good as the original, wherein Frank and Joe bought a used fancy car, fixed it up, and hid in the trunk. Their Trojan Horse technique carried them right into the lair of the auto thieves; after numerous exciting brushes with danger, they were able to escape and bring back the police.The re-write wasn't nearly as tense. It's possible that was purposeful. At the end of the original, Fenton Hardy muted his pride for his sons' accomplishment with the admonition that their tactic had simply been too dangerous, and they could have been seriously injured or worse.But that's what made the book good. Kids enjoy stories of that nature because nothing like that ever happens to teens in real life. Really, how many teams of teen-brother detectives do you think are operating in the USA just now, solving crimes and mysteries every other week (while owning cars, motorcycles, ice boats, airplanes, you name it)? This is fiction, it's escapism, it's fun and it's supposed to be."},{"Title":"The Shore Road Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 6)","review":"I finished this book in 5 hours and I usually take two days. It was amazing how they were always on the go and that you have to go along with them for the ride. It starts out that there have been car thefts on Shore Road and the Hardy Boys decide to solve the case. Then their friend Jack Dodd has a Pilgrim Mystery for them to solve. Then the Dodds are accused of stealing the cars. They get out from bail. Then they disappear. The Hardy Boys suspect they've been kidnapped. Then with the help of their friend Chet they set out to solve the Mystery! Very Good suspeneseful book that has you screaming for more!"},{"Title":"The Shore Road Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 6)","review":"This is yet another example of how revising the original degrades quality. This book was substantially \\"updated\\" in 1964 from the depression-era original, and much is lost in in the process.In the original, a ring of car thieves is stealing cars (I guess they are pretty much doing what you'd expect a ring of car thieves to do, all right). They ply their illict trade along Shore Road which, in 1931, is a barely-improved, dark, lonely, winding cliff road rising and switchbacking above the crashing turbulence of Bayport Bay.Why anyone in their right mind would park there is anybody's guess.But, park there they do. So the boys devise an outstanding ruse (devising ruses is a great way to sharpen your pronunciation of s sounds, too). They by an old junk car which is very ornate but which has a really crummy engine. They then \\"pimp the ride\\" by hammering out dents, painting it, polishing it, and getting really spiffy spoked wheels and wide whitewall tires.Then they hide in the boot in the back, park it along Shore Road, and wait to get stolen. And they do.Well, that was in 1930. In 1964 they pick up a touch-tone phone, call the police and report a stolen '64 Ford Falcon. They tell the police that the blue exhaust is a dead giveaway.Now, honestly, which is more exciting??"},{"Title":"The Shore Road Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 6)","review":"Greatly entertaining tale for youth and a nostalgic revisit for those of us who read every Hardy Boys episode so many years ago!"},{"Title":"The Shore Road Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 6)","review":"My son is 8 years old.

As with other HB books they are easy to read and brings you back to simpler time when life was good."},{"Title":"The Shore Road Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 6)","review":"Oh, Great. I spent a long time wishing for this book. When I finally read it I was overcome by sheer disappointment. The plot lacked any suspense, and did not have many twists in it.This is the story:Frank and Joe go galloping off to catch car thieves after witnessing a theft take place before their very eyes. Soon they are also engaged in finding a long lost Pilgrim treasure, and aid their friends the Dodds in proving their innocence in the car thefts. Later they soon discover the cases are connected. (Just like all the other HB novels...)I encourage all fans to just borrow it from the library instead of spending a few bucks buying it. Unless you're an avid fan and a collector of the series.

There are better book1s than this. ~"},{"Title":"The Shore Road Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 6)","review":"This is not a comprehensive review of \\"The Shore Road\\" mystery, but rather some comments about the Kindle Edition.I will say that \\"The Shore Road Mystery\\" is fairly typical of the Hardy Boys novels. Not among the best, in my opinion, but certainly not the worst; 3.5 stars. The books in this series are adventure romps. Not too serious, but a lot of fun. A good gateway series for young readers (and old nostalgia junkies).The Kindle Edition:This is my third Hardy Boys book on Kindle.The Kindle Edition gets my approval for including the line-drawings from the hardcovers. However, the cover illustration is not included. The 'cover' of the Kindle Edition is the title page of the hardcover. Perhaps the colors in the cover make it too difficult to render on Kindle.I give demerits for the number and type of typos in the books. This Kindle Edition, as well as \\"The Missing Chums\\", has far too many typos that were introduced during the conversion to electronic format. A common example is that the text \\"Joe!\\" from the hardcover is rendered as \\"Joel\\" in the Kindle. It seems obvious to me that the publisher ran the book through a scanner, did an Optical Character Recognition, then maybe some quick cleanup editing and called it 'good'. I estimate I saw 40 - 50 typos of this nature in the text.This Kindle Edition could have been 5-star if the publisher had included the cover illustration somehow, and if the proofreading had been done right. The publisher needs to invest more effort into the Kindle Edition if they insist on charging the same price as the hardcover."},{"Title":"The Shore Road Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 6)","review":"After I finished The Shore Road Mystery, I did'nt think it was actually that great, even after I spent about the whole year wishing so hard i would be able to read this book.

It chronicles two brothers and their friends adventures as they solve mysteries of all imaginable kinds.

They entertain, and stimulate the mind with mystery and suspense from a more realistic standpoint. Too many books today are dungeons and dragons, or witches and warlocks types and kids dont need to read that garbage. Put a book in a kids hand that is clean, wholesome and will broaden their vocabulary with words that will make sense if used in everyday language."},{"Title":"The Shore Road Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 6)","review":"The sixth installment of the Hardy Boys is a fantastic mystery. I figured that by the time I got this far into the series the characters would be dull, the plot line monotonous, and one book would read like the other. This is not the case! This was a fast-paced book, new characters interspersed with the usual cast; though only Frank, Joe, and Chet are the central characters in this tale.Cars are being stolen in Bayport and adjacent cities and the crooks use the Shore Road to make their getaway. The Hardy's friend Jack Dodd and his dad are framed for the robberies, and subsequently jump bail (or do they). With their dad, Fenton, away in New York the Hardy Boys work on the case themselves from the land, sea, and air. Mysterious farmers, secret caves, and the Dodds heritage all play a part in this fun mystery.Why didn't I read these when I was a kid?"},{"Title":"The Shore Road Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 6)","review":"This book was Super!

In almost every case, the original editions were much superior, and 2) Not researching the books, and assuming that all the HB volumes are basically of equal quality. This is very untrue, and the thing to do is to be selective. These two pitfalls must be avoided if one really wants to enjoy the classic Hardy Boys at their best.I have researched and then read several installments in the venerable series which enjoy the highest reputations among true and informed HB aficionados. Next I applied my own personal evaluation to each book.O.K. then, and what of this installment -- The Shore Road Mystery? Suffice it to say that if one had a skinny bookcase, w/shelves only wide enough to fit several volumes across, and if one wanted to reserve the top shelf in that case for only the best of Hardy Boys adventures -- The Shore Road Mystery belongs there."},{"Title":"The Shore Road Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 6)","review":"i thought the book was great but i felt the author picked on joe too much. the plot was excellent and the way the hardys figue out who the criminals are and out-smart them is fantastic. it's a must read"},{"Title":"The Cowboy Boot Book","review":"This is a book that works on many levels making it a great introduction to the history, art, and craft of cowboy bootmaking. It quotes Jack Reed, the only owner of a one-man boot shop left in Texas, saying it takes 372 steps to make cowboy boots, but is not detailed enough to list them all. Until I read this book, I had no idea that there was a market in vintage cowboy boots. I found out that original ornate tops can be fitted with a replaced foot to bring old boots back to life. Jim Arndt's photographs of boots, bootmakers, and boot collectors are outstanding throughout and really bring the book to life. The beginning of the book does an admirable job tracing the history of cowboy boots back to the old Texas-to-Kansas cattle drives of the post-Civil War era. This is followed by a great A - Z directory of the various skins that have been used to make the boots including characteristics, care, and current availability. The next section is a great history of the major boot making factories and the people behind them with chapters on Justin, Nocona, Tony Lama, Lucchese, and Rocketbuster. The rest of the book covers the rest of the cowboy boot business and personalities. Included are descriptions of individual bootmakers and cowboy boot collectors. Each is lavishly illustrated with pictures of them and their boots. The author and photographer are avid collectors and their collections are covered in this section of the book. The book ends with an outline of the retail side of the industry. Major sellers of new and vintage boots are described and a state-by-state Store Guide is included. Of course, not every state has a custom bootmaker or a vintage cowboy boot store, but you can still find the nearest one if this book has convinced you that you are ready for the next step above looking in the Yellow Pages under Western Apparel. The only place where I felt this book went too far is when they say in the caption to a photograph: &quot;the details of this pair of boots could be compared to a fine oil painting.&quot; But if you want a basic knowledge of cowboy boots, or love to look at cowboy boots either in a store or on other people's feet this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Cowboy Boot Book","review":"Yep, I'm a boot wearin' Jewish cowboy! (A doctor, in fact!) I started Country &amp; Western line dancing a couple years ago, and from there I got into boots. Been wearin' 'em ever since!That said, I was totally blown away by the unbelievable hand-made boots in this book. Spectacularly photographed, they appear as works of art. (I see that the same authors are publishing a book later this year called &quot;The Art of the Boot&quot;. You know I'll be buying a copy!). I personally have a couple pairs of wonderful Tony Lama boots that fit like a glove, but the boots in this book are in a different class entirely - we're talking ten times more expensive than anything you might find on the shelf at a western wear store.It'll be a while before I can afford any of the boots in this book, but it's nice to admire them, and appreciate the craftsmanship and dedication that went into making them."},{"Title":"The Cowboy Boot Book","review":"Filled with great photographs and lots of info, this book is a visual kick in the butt as well as an interesting look at wearers and makers of boots. (Surprise inside - Imelda wasn't the only one with a problem.) The author's interest in the fancy, short boots of the 40's is apparent in the book; after all, they are fascinating to look at. On the other hand, there is not a lot of history associated with the development of the cowboy boot as an article of working clothing, or how it became a touchstone of American culture. In a nutshell, the book is a magnificent coffee table work that is much too informative to leave in the living room. There is nothing else quite like it in print and it is a must have for anyone into things Western."},{"Title":"The Cowboy Boot Book","review":"If your're looking to buy this book then you've probably heard of the legendary book titled &quot;Texas Boots&quot; now out of print. Don't fret--this book is better. Whereas the older book was mostly black and white, this one has beautiful color pictures, and most of the bootmakers listed here are still alive. In fact, if you buy this book don't bother to consider &quot;The Art of the Boot&quot; by the same author as the two books are about the same, except that Art costs more and has a few more pictures, but the Cowboy Boot Book has a much better history of the cowboy boot."},{"Title":"The Cowboy Boot Book","review":"This is Tyler & Jim's first \\"boot book\\" and it has turned more people into boot collectors and bootmakers than any other.I think it's because of the great personal stories it tells ...and the portrait Jim took of each maker.

I've been dealing with a \\"fertility challenge\\" for almost two years and have read several excellent books on the subject--this certainly was NOT one of them. It made me feel low and depressed and that was not my goal! I felt it was choppy and didn't flow in its content. Every sentence had God or Lord in it and every paragraph seemed to have biblical references and quotes. Too much. If you would like to read upbeat and happy books on the subject of infertility, I strongly recommend \\"Laughin' Fertility\\" by Lisa Safran and \\"Girlfriend to Girlfriend, a Fertility Companion\\" by Kristen Magnacca. Those books actually made me smile, which I really need right now! I've never written one of these reviews, but I felt so strongly about this book that I had to comment on it.

Intimately and personably written, When Empty Arms Become aHeavy Burden delivers solid facts and detailed information. With moments of true-to-life humor, it addresses the moral, marital and spiritualchallenges involved in the struggle to have children.Giving the topic a unique perspective, Glahn has teamed up with co-author,William Cutrer, M.D., a physician who also holds a graduate-level theologydegree. Using numerous case histories as well as Glahn's personal testimony, they provide knowledgeable advice and answers to many of the key questions infertility patients ask. They focus much of their efforts on the emotional and spiritual struggles, though they also detail medical issues.The book begins with a focus on dynamics in the marriage relationship, discussing the different ways wives and husbands typically handle thestress and grieving process: &quot;Why do I feel like I'm going crazy?&quot; &quot;How do we keep romance alive?&quot; The authors provide appropriate (sometimes amusing) responses to well-meaning friends and family who just can't say anything right. Using examples and insights from the Bible, they address the painful question so many of us ask, &quot;Why,God?&quot;The book ends with several chapters devoted to the latest high-tech fertility treatments, including donor insemination, donor eggs and surrogacy, as well as the ethical considerations involved. Secondary infertility, adoption, and the option of living childfree are also addressed. Each chapter concludes with a list of thought-provokingquestions for couples' discussion. To help those who desire to personally research certain issues, the authors also provide a list of resources for further reading. Of particular interest are the on-line resources they include.Weaving logic and emotion, facts and feelings, Glahn and Cutrer send a message of encouragement and hope to those who ask &quot;What if God nevergives us children?&quot;"},{"Title":"When Empty Arms Become a Heavy Burden: Encouragement for Couples Facing Infertility","review":"This is the first book I have read that really, really addresses the emotional aspects of infertility (not the medical/technical ones) and has answers for how to deal with them.

I especially appreciated her comments on those dealing with secondary infertility."},{"Title":"When Empty Arms Become a Heavy Burden: Encouragement for Couples Facing Infertility","review":"Striving to support and comfort acquaintances, friends and family when they are hurting emotionally is a desire people often feel inadequate and ill-prepared to fulfill. Having a loved one who for years had known the struggles, disappointments and intensity of infertility treatment caused an internal yearning to better perceive the aching in my friend's heart. Although reading about these experiences could never give the same understanding as having personal involvement, &quot;When Empty Arms Become a Heavy Burden&quot;, co-written by Sandra Glahn and Dr. William Cutrer, provides the reader with knowledge that equips a more informed listener, gives a better sense of compassion and sensitivity and encourages the confidence to know that sometimes efforts to comprehend and feel some of the hurting one's pain along with them, is far more helpful than words of advice offered. This is a great book for anyone living through the heartaches of infertility or for those who hope to reach out in support and answer the call &quot;to bear one another's burdens&quot;. Also a benefit realized in reading this book is that the Biblical principles referenced can be used as precepts of guidance in other personal struggles, as well. This is a book full of encouragement for the discouraged; and in addition, this writing will lend wisdom to the influence projected into another's life."},{"Title":"When Empty Arms Become a Heavy Burden: Encouragement for Couples Facing Infertility","review":"I wish I had read this book six years ago--at the beginning of my infertility journey.

Some of those questions we have asked, such as:-Should we consider high-tech fertility treatments?-What about donor insemination? Donor eggs?-How do we respond to nosy friends and relatives?-Where can we go for the best advice?-How can God allow this to happen?And there are other questions which you may find in your search for answers.

The theory in this book is the most comprehensive model for OD I've ever seen. Simons' model incorporates all functional areas of business. He does an excellent job of looking at the whole organizational picture. This is where many authors have fallen short with theories that only cover one or two functional areas of business leaving you to guess at how to incorporate the rest. This cross-functional approach to OD is not just refreshing; it's quite necessary in today's business environment.Simons' theory is based on levers and sliders. Easy to understand and easy to visualize. Part of the value of the book is that the theory is backed up with practical implementation examples. Like any good learning resource (a.k.a. text book) each chapter provides us with a summary and action steps. I give this book an A+ and consider it a \\"must read\\" for anyone in the OD field. It is also recommended for management teams looking to assess their organization design. Using this book will provide the understanding you need to get started."},{"Title":"Levers Of Organization Design: How Managers Use Accountability Systems For Greater Performance And Commitment","review":"Unlike subtitles of so many other recently published business books, the one for Levers of Organization Design correctly identifies its author's primary objective: to explain \\"how managers use accountability systems\\" to achieve \\"greater performance and commitment.\\" Simons thoroughly and brilliantly responds to questions such as these:What are the nature and extent of tensions of organization design or redesign?How to get \\"span of attention\\" in proper alignment?What is an appropriate \\"unit structure\\"? Why?Which diagnostic control systems can be most effective? How?Why are interactive networks essential?How to establish and then strengthen them?How should shared responsibilities be determined and then managed?Then, how to sustain productive collaboration?Which \\"levers\\" of organizational design are most effective? Why?Which examples best illustrate how to make appropriate adjustment of them?What are the most effective strategies and tactics when designing organizations for performance?According to research which Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton provide in The Strategy-Focused Organization, only 5% of the workforce understand their company's strategy, only 25% of managers have incentives linked to strategy, 60% of organizations don't link budgets to strategy, and 85% of executive teams spend less than one hour per month discussing strategy. If true, these are chilling statistics which suggest that few decision-makers in any organization (regardless of its size or nature) would be able to answer, clearly and realistically, each of the questions listed previously. Hence the urgency of their reading Simons' book. I also urge them to check out the several works co-authored by Kaplan and Norton."},{"Title":"Levers Of Organization Design: How Managers Use Accountability Systems For Greater Performance And Commitment","review":"A first-rate book on the subject of organizational design.Chapters focus on:- tensions of organization design;- aligning span of attention;- unit structure;- diagnostic control systems;- interactive networks;- shared responsibilities;- examples of adjusting the levers; and- designing organizations for performance.Central to this book are four key factors that guide effective design decisions: customer definition, critical performance variables, creative tension, and commitment to others.The book offers great insights and guidance to design an organization that influences how people perform, focus their attention, and how their efforts can be aligned with strategy. Rich in content and value! Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Levers Of Organization Design: How Managers Use Accountability Systems For Greater Performance And Commitment","review":"There are some books that grip once attention, and make you think deeply about everything that you know and understand, of how organisations function. Robert congratulations! Your arguments are compelling and disturbing because I have to find ways to relate the material to my clients.Span of ControlThe most often used concept in organisations is span of control. You pointed out that this narrow definition is not enough when you consider the design of organisations. I find myself wondering how managers within different parts of the organisation define their span of control. Is IT the business of IT, or who is responsible for implementing IT? Who takes ownership for data quality?Span of accountabilityYour discussion on measurement is interesting and enlightening and through my experience I can validate that people use more output measures than input and throughput measures when assigning accountabilities. It is clear that the level and the volume of measures matters.Span of InfluenceThis is a challenging measure and will confront leaders and managers to reflect about the level of influence they have over operating units.

When they arrived, to my suprise, they are not coil bound at all, but each postcard is loose and kept inside the box. This was great, as I was planning on putting some of these in frames around the house anyways.The price....let me tell you, they are worth it. If you work it out, thats about 17 each, where most generic postcards go for $1 or more. The artwork covers all the features and shorts from Pixar to date, including their upcoming feature Cars.After showing these to my animation collegues, they agree, this is one purchase you cannot be without if you are a lover of Pixar's work."},{"Title":"The Art of Pixar: 100 Collectible Postcards","review":"This was a great set of postcards, real high quality paper stock.

Nice quality!"},{"Title":"The Art of Pixar: 100 Collectible Postcards","review":"I am in love with these postcards. They come in a beautiful box with a ribbon all the way under th postcards so they lift out perfectly. The pictures are crisp and fun to look at. It is funny to see some of the movie posters from different countries that are included as postcards. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because the top postcard, which is a picture of a bug, arrived with a red stain across the middle from where the ribbon had rested. There is a blank red card at the bottom which would have worked as a perfect protector on the top. Otherwise, they are WONDERFUL. They are almost too perfect to use for my new postcard hobby. I may have to get another set."},{"Title":"The Art of Pixar: 100 Collectible Postcards","review":"The postcards are beautifully constructed and decorated. There are a few dud cards that you would never really use, but the majority of them are well designed.These are classy post cards, and the price isn't bad either.The only complaint is the box they came in was slightly crushed, I don't think the storage box was built strong enough to be shipped well, but all the cards still came in good shape."},{"Title":"The Art of Pixar: 100 Collectible Postcards","review":"I live in Norway and have been looking for this box for about five years, so finding it here on amazon.com, at this price, with such a swift handling was what we here would call a feather in amazon's hat.

The pictures are fun. Obviously only early Pixar movies (primarily Cars, Monsters Inc., and the Toy Story s) and some additional cartoon sketches.

In fact, I had so much faith that I bought 2 sets - one to keep for myself and the other to actually use as postcards to send to other deserving acquaintances who are fellow aficionados!The images presented range from initial drafts to superbly finished characters.

Great service and product!"},{"Title":"The Art of Pixar: 100 Collectible Postcards","review":"It's a decent value, 100 sturdy postcards for around $13. These are not printed on cheap paper like most post cards. Seriously, it's as if they knew that to get a person to spend $13 on postcards, they better be able to handle some actual wear and tear. They come in a nice looking box, loose.If you're looking for postcards to use in the mail, these are excellent. As I said before, they're printed on sturdy card stock. The images used are stills from the films or sketches of characters and scenes from the films during the planning stages, and a handful of pictures that look like they were drawn by children. Great stuff, honestly.I purchased these to use as postcards, especially since it's kind of hard to find postcards out here. It can be done but the choices are slim. I like to send the occasional post card to my preschool students to encourage them to use the postal service and send along a little cheer (who doesn't like getting a postcard?), so I sought these out with that purpose.I would recommend these for anyone who enjoys Pixar art, who wants to collect these for just looking at and/or wants to have a supply of high quality postcards on hand."},{"Title":"The Art of Pixar: 100 Collectible Postcards","review":"Yes I knew the size before I actually bought this, but I didn't realize it was so small.

The 100 postcards come in a little cardboard box that I think would be useful to hold things in after the postcards are gone. The postcards range from concept Pixar drawings to film images. The back lets you know what it is and from what movie as well as who the artist was.The only issue I see is that unless you are a huge Pixar fan, you won't necessarily be able to place what movie or short the image came from. These would be great as thank you card for kids to use. It is a more green alternative than sending a regular-sized card within an envelope and like I said earlier, the box can be re-used."},{"Title":"The Art of Pixar: 100 Collectible Postcards","review":"I got this for a friend who is very nostalgic and loves Disney/Pixar.

I ordered these to send out to kids in my Awana Club at church, but ended up keeping several to frame as artwork for my studio.

They do take a full stamp to mail though - as opposed to a postcard stamp (due to their thickness, weight, and size)"},{"Title":"The Art of Pixar: 100 Collectible Postcards","review":"I agree with other reviewers that these Pixar postcards are on heavy weight paper. If I were teaching broadcasting or storytelling, many of the cards would be perfect to show students conception through production; however, I would have preferred full color--final copy of each postcard scene. I know most people who love animation will be thrilled to receive any of these cards, so don't let me sway you if you are a fanatic about all things Pixar."},{"Title":"The Art of Pixar: 100 Collectible Postcards","review":"I originally bought these because they were such a good price and I wanted to send them off for Postcrossing. WRONG. After going through them, I decided I had to buy a set to keep for myself!There are NO duplicates- all 100 postcards are original.

Movies I found cards from include A Bug's Life, Cars, Geri's Game, Monster's Inc, Toy Story (1 & 2), The Incredibles, One Man Band, The Adventures of Andre and Wally B, Finding Nemo, Knick Knack, Red's Dream, Boundin', For the Birds, and Tin Toy, but I may be missing some as there are so many to go through.I would very highly recommend these cards for anyone."},{"Title":"The Art of Pixar: 100 Collectible Postcards","review":"I ordered these postcards because I do something called \\"Postcrossing\\" where you exchange postcards from people all over the world so I needed a good amount of nice postcards to get started.

Not only are the cards thick and extremely durable, each card has a unique image from any Pixar film or short from Toy Story to Cars. Thankfully, I don't have to choose to send any of these to anyone. I am keeping and hanging them all in more places then my room.

To me, each one is a piece of art. You could honestly choose any one at random, frame it, and hang it and it would look impressive. The paper is sturdy and seems to be of high quality. And the price is UNBEATABLE.I bought this along withThe Art of Vintage Marvel: 100 Collectible Postcards, which was equally impressive with a similar box (both sets being from the same publisher), and I highly recommend buying them together."},{"Title":"The Art of Pixar: 100 Collectible Postcards","review":"I really like these postcards.

No one was expecting hand written thanks you for their little votes of encouragement along the way so it turned into a total hit. These cards are really nice quality and the artwork on most of them are really neat. You simply can not beat the price of getting 100 cards for this amount and I paired them up with Pixar stamps from the USPS which was cool. You have no idea how much you can make someone's day by sending them a little note on a postcard when they least expect it!"},{"Title":"The Art of Pixar: 100 Collectible Postcards","review":"You get more than you pay for here, which isn't easy these days.

Infact, I bought multiple boxes for all the Disney fans in my life. I would say 8 out of 10 of the postcards are super-cute. The other ones are kind of random and dont really seem very Disney-ish to me, but theyre still too cute."},{"Title":"The Ranks of the Black Order","review":"From its arresting cover portrait to its Peckinpaughesque finale, this unusual graphic novel sucks you back to the '70s, when there were still Nazis on the run and European terrorist groups like Brigade Rossei and Bader-Meinhoff were still active. It starts with the massacre of entire Spanish village by a mysterious group of old men. We soon learn that these men-a mix of Spanish, Italian, French, German, Belgian, and soforth-were all fascist militants in Spain, and that they have formed their own geriatric terrorist organization. A British newspaperman, once a member of an International Brigade, learns of this and vows to fight them by reassembling his old group of friends in true \\"we getting the band back together\\" fashion. What ensues is a long and frustrating chase across Europe in which ethics blur and ends start to justify means. It's a bleak story that calls into question the very notion of principles. The artwork and coloring is excellent throughout. The characters are all given distinctively craggy faces and the \\"action\\" sequences are extremely vivid and realistic. Gray and brown tones mute everything in keeping with the bleak tone of the story. Those interested in this should also check out Vittorio Giardino' graphic spy series (Hungarian Rhapsody, Orient Gateway, and No Parasan), which features Max Friedman, an ex-brigade member."},{"Title":"Choice Centered Tarot","review":"If you read a couple of reviews on other tarot books here at amazon.com, you'll probably see a lot of people recomending &quot;Choice centered tarot&quot; at some point. The reason behind this is this books challenging approach, based mainly on inner and outer focus rather than on positive or negative meanings. But that is only a part of what goes on in Ms Fairfield's book. There are brilliant essays on how to choose a deck (don't only expect the usual &quot;choose one that resonates with you&quot; approach here, you may realise quite a few things about your political views depending on which deck you choose), how to design a spread, how to read for groups and numerology, apart from card definitions diferent to the usual ones. I am not saying that these explanations contradict what other books may give on the subject. Rather, thet are complementary (and from my experience, they work specially well for &quot;here and now&quot; questions). In spite of this all, this is an easy book to read, and it will specially suit intermediate tarot students (but can be read by everyone)."},{"Title":"Choice Centered Tarot","review":"Fairfield's take on the Tarot is a little different than what most of us are used to. She bases her meanings for the Minor Arcana solely on numerology rather than visual cues; her meanings for the cards are based on what the numbers mean to her. The result is an unusually positive meaning for each card--a little bit politically correct, IMHO. 5 of Pentacles? You're not having financial trouble, you're just going through a period of re-adjustment! *chuckle* While I'm sure these meanings would give a different slant to a tarot reading, I don't use them much because some of them differ vastly from the traditional meanings and from the artwork in my decks. I'm more story- and picture- oriented than number-oriented; I want to look at a card and sense its meaning intuitively, rather than having to look up a number in a book. The card itself, rather than any book, is the biggest clue to its meaning--at least the way I work. But there is room for all opinions, and besides, this book would work well if you were reading a deck with pips, or an ordinary playing card deck. Fairfield's system wasn't my cup of tea, but that doesn't mean it won't be yours. The true treasure of this book is the last several chapters, which focus on doing readings. She provides suggestions about creating your own layouts, using the tarot for dream analysis, using the tarot to clarify yourself in a discussion, etc. She encourages the reader to do things her/his own way. And I can't argue with that."},{"Title":"Choice Centered Tarot","review":"I've been reading the tarot for over 15 years and this is one of the best books on the subject that I have found. It's one of the first that I recommend to others, and one of the first I go to for reference. It is not the typical book that just lists each card with a predetermined meaning, but it covers how to read, numerology, symbols, layouts and more. I'd recommend this book for both experienced and beginning readers."},{"Title":"Choice Centered Tarot","review":"\\"The only limit to the ways the Tarot can be used is your own imagination. Each life event, each emotional interaction, each inner awareness, presents us with an opportunity to understand ourselves and our Universe better. Every new problem or question is a challenge; with each challenge we discover new ways of using the Tarot.\\" - From the bookAuthor Gail Fairfield advocates a choice-centered approach to Tarot, which encourages Tarot readers and querents (\\"readees\\" as she calls them) to use the cards for making better life decisions. In her book Everyday Tarot, Fairfield explains the structure of a Tarot deck, the development of number (such as \\"Two-ness\\"), the four suits, designing a layout (card spread) and more.An excellent book for both Tarot beginners and experienced readers, Everyday Tarot provides an overview of the Major and Minor Arcana. According to Fairfield, every card is neutral in value, i.e. neither good nor bad in and of itself. However, the meaning of the card can be stretched along the entire spectrum of positive or negative. She likens cards to rain: rain is neutral, but too much can cause a disastrous flood and too little can cause a drought. Determining whether a card is to be interpreted positively or negatively depends largely on a querent's personality, question, and spread position.Regarding reversals, Fairfield doesn't feel that the basic card meaning is affected, although the way an individual experiences the concept may change quite a bit. Upright cards indicate that an individual is experiencing the concept in a public, clear, objective or obvious way. Reversals, however, indicate that an individual is experiencing the concept in a more subtle, private, subjective, internal way.For each suit and card, the author provides General/Neutral meanings as well as Positive, Negative, Upright, and reversed.Arguable the most intriguing part of Everyday Tarot is the development of number throughout the Minor Arcana. Fairfield groups all the Minors in sets of three, except the 10's and Kings. These groups describe four different cycles-each having a particular level. She explains that every triad contains THIS, THAT, and THE OTHER. THIS refers to something new that is established, THAT challenges, confronts, changes or expands THIS and THE OTHER resolves and integrates the interaction between THIS and THAT. For example, Aces start the first cycle of three (the conceptual level) and are THIS, while Two-ness solidifies or confirms the direction of the Ace (THAT). Three-ness (THE OTHER) then unifies the aggressive energy of the One/Ace with the stabilizing energy of the Two. (The way she explains these groupings and cycles are easier than it sounds.)The 10's are described as \\"hesitating\\" and aren't included in the triads or cycles. The Kings represent a completion point, and thus are outside of the triads as well.Everyday Tarot also includes information on the reading process, choosing a Tarot deck based on symbols, ways to use the cards, and expanding your reading skills.Personally, I found a lot of new, helpful information in this book. For example, I hadn't considered numerical values all that much when performing Tarot readings, but Fairfield's methods are so sensible and accessible, that I've started employing her system. I am also enjoying exploring reversals as internalized versions of cards as opposed to interpreting them merely as blocks, hindrances, or opposites of upright meanings. Everyday Tarot has also provided me additional insight regarding the suit of Wands. Fairfield considers Wands the suit of \\"Self\\", representing personal growth, awareness, and personal direction. It's the suit asking, \\"Who am I and where am I going?\\"I've highlighted my copy of Everyday Tarot to death, and refer to it often. Overall, it's probably the best Tarot book that I've read thus far. Fairfield writes in the engaging style of a fellow reader as opposed to some high-minded \\"expert\\" pontificating in brittle prose. Her explanations are clear, her organization is tight, and her methods are empowering to both the reader and the querent. At 153 pages, it's not a huge book, but it's packed with immediately useful information and new ways of looking at-and using-the Tarot."},{"Title":"Choice Centered Tarot","review":"Gail Fairfield's \\"Choice Centered Tarot\\" is one of my top 5 tarot books. Rather than a lot of superstitious fatalism, Fairfield offers us a worldview that embraces taking personal responsibility for our choices in the present moment in order to CREATE our futures. The tarot is presented as a tool for gaining insights into those choices so we can be more informed and conscious. The section on choosing a deck based on how certain facets of humanity are depicted in the card images is very helpful and thought-provoking. The section on designing your own layouts is deeply empowering! When I first read \\"Choice Centered Tarot\\" in the 1980s, it made a huge impact on my tarot work AND on my personal philosophy of life. It still does. Get it and use it!!!"},{"Title":"Choice Centered Tarot","review":"If you're looking for an intelligent, well thought out and organized guide to using tarot cards, this is the best I've ever found. It is not, strictly speaking, a traditional, Waite-deck, 'fortune-telling' approach. Originally published under the title, 'Choice Centered Tarot', this allows one to use the tarot as a guide to reflection, choice-making and everyday living. It can be used for creative projects and busting out of mental ruts. It is also easy to read, use and understand, and it's fun."},{"Title":"Choice Centered Tarot","review":"I've been reading for over 30 years, and this is *still* my absolute favorite tarot book. I like the different approach she takes to it, addressing symbolism and numerology, rather than just the meanings of the cards. I'm thinking about starting to teach classes and, if people can still get it, this is the book I'll use."},{"Title":"Dark Dreams","review":"Roy Hazelwood is a colleague of well-known FBI profilers Robert Ressler and John Douglas. Like those two men, Hazelwood spent much of his FBI career working in the subterranean Behavioral Science Unit at the FBI's National Academy in Quantico, VA. Now retired and working in private practice, Hazelwood has written his second book on the topic of sexually violent criminals. As always, these books are not for the faint of heart, but for those who are fascinated with the criminal mind, there are few people who can speak with more authority or knowledge than Roy Hazelwood. Hazelwood's first book, The Evil That Men Do, was partially a biography, but this book focuses almost exclusively on various cases that he has been involved with. Chapters are devoted to serial rapists, revenge murders, profiling and equivocal deaths, among others.Hazelwood spent years instructing police and law enforcement professionals about sexual violence and those who commit such acts. Unsurprisingly, in this book he is as much a teacher as he is a storyteller, trying to bring the reader along down twisted, tortuous paths into the minds of sexual offenders. I feel that his approach is both a strength and a weakness. Sometimes this book reads like a PowerPoint presentation; the reader can literally see the bullet points. It can also be a very perfunctory book. I found myself often wanting more details or longer explanations. The truth is that most people read these kinds of books for entertainment rather than edification. While Hazelwood surely knows that, he decided to keep his approach free from sensationalism or extraneous detail. I respect him for that, but I honestly think the book suffers a bit from this sometimes dry and clinical approach. Say what you will about the big egos of Robert Ressler or John Douglas, but both of those men write gripping, almost conversational &quot;off-the-record&quot; accounts.Stephen Michaud is Hazelwood's co-writer, but I question how much time he spent on this book. I've read some of Michaud's other works and I know him to be a good writer, so I was surprised that there aren't many traces of his hand in this book. A good editor would have been welcome here, too. But this is nitpicking. Readers turn to Hazelwood for expert information and discussion on the rarest of criminals and crimes, and Hazelwood delivers. One of the best chapters covers equivocal deaths, or situations where it is not immediately possible to determine whether death resulted from suicide, homicide, or accident. Here Hazelwood shines, looking under every stone and coming up with convincing answers. His discussion on linkage analysis - whether or not a set or series of crimes was committed by the same offender - is similarly riveting.Even though Hazelwood's book often reads like a college textbook, the tales he tells are so interesting that most readers will easily overlook any flaws or oversights. Anyone wanting to understand sexual violence can hardly do better than to turn to Roy Hazelwood."},{"Title":"Dark Dreams","review":"This book is terrifyingly fascinating! It delves deep within the minds of those who commit the unspeakable and discusses it without sugar coating a thing. I have taken a lot of classes on crime and deviance and I went into this book thinking I wouldn't be scared or emotionally affected. Wrong! I was still shocked by what some people out there do- and perhaps more shocking- why they do it. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in the field of criminal profiling, criminal law, or even a true crime buff looking for a new addition to their library."},{"Title":"Dark Dreams","review":"Eoy Hazelwood describes his experiences and shares his knowledge of sex criminals from his job in the FBI profiling unit (the 'behevioral science unit' of 'The Silence of the Lambs'). Roy does a terrific job of describing what the job really is, what are it's different aspects and what it takes (training nd the type of person who'd be good at the job). He also gives us many detailed descriptions of many cases he was involved in during his long career both as an FBI agent and as a private consultant.My only advice is not to read this book before going to bed, especially if you're a woman..."},{"Title":"Dark Dreams","review":"The books written by Hazelwood and other former FBI profilers, such as John Douglas, are just wonderfully creepy. I can no longer read fiction mysteries after reading this book. The truth is so much more frightening than fiction!! I recommend this bookhighly to true crime fans, whether they be law enforcement professionals or, like me, fans of the genre. This is a frightening book that looks sexual violence straight in the eye. It is filled with scary factual detail. I recommend you hunker down with this book with the doors and windows locked!!!"},{"Title":"Dark Dreams","review":"The information presented by Roy Hazelwood and Stephen Michaud is of a type obviously found only first-hand. The pathologies are explored and explained so detailedly, that these monsters almost seem to make sense after a while. Anyone interested in forensic psychology, especially those cases dealing with a sexually aberrant patholgy, will find this a must read!"},{"Title":"Dark Dreams","review":"I sent the following e-mail to Roy after reading his book. I'll share it with you to give you some idea how much I enjoyed his book. In addition to being a great learning tool, it was also a very entertaining book.Roy, I just returned to work from vacation. While on vacation I read your new book, DARK DREAMS! GREAT BOOK!!! This really is a textbook for investigators! As you know, I supervise a group of sexual assault investigators for a mid-size Sheriff's Department in California. As I read your book, I highlighted specific points so I could return to them later and share them with my troops. I now own a book full of yellow highlights. What a great insight! As I think back on past cases, I see where having this information may have been a big help. My next step is to request my department buy a copy of your book and make it mandatory reading for all our sex and homicide investigators.Thanks for a great book. I've recommended it to people in my department and other departments, as well as my retired law enforcement friends. I'm sure this book will be making the rounds. I'll have to keep careful track of it so I don't lose it. Any cop worth his salt will want this book in his/her library.Bob"},{"Title":"Dark Dreams","review":"I love reading Non-fiction books, and this was my first on this subject. It was honest, and mystifying, and also horryifing. It was unreal to hear some of the sick things people do! Hazelwood went into the explainations of why some people do these things and certain charisitcs of them. It was a different view, taking you into the psychology of these sick minds. Eventhough I don't have other books to compare to, I can say that I reccomend this book to an interested reader, and that I will look forward to reading more of Hazlewood's work!"},{"Title":"Dark Dreams","review":"This is the first true crime book I ever read and it effectively hooked me on the genre. This book will especially appeal to readers with short attention spans who easily grow bored with true crime novels that focus on one particular killer.There are a ton of different cases in this book, each one more bizarre and engrossing than the last, so the authors don't go on and on at length about each and every case. From the woman who let her husband kidnap a girl to keep as a sex slave (for a reason that left me gaping) to the rapist who would force his victims to read aloud pre-written scripts he wrote at specified intervals (\\"Honey, do we have enough money to get the kids' teeth fixed this year?\\"), this book is frightening, bizarre, and utterly engrossing. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dark Dreams","review":"Dark Dreams is a book that is absolutely for mature readers its content is not child friendly. Roy Hazelwood spent sixteen years as a member of the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit. During this time he worked on many shocking cases but that's not all, he also did research on deviant behaviors this book shows some of what he discovered. Throughout the book Hazelwood gives many examples of horrifying real life crimes that he examined. The twenty-one year old woman with no history of arrest or psychiatric problems who while working at a funeral home developed a romantic interest with a corpse. Crime knows no age, thee boys of the ages seven, nine, and ten took a female playmate and forced her to perform oral on them and they took found objects and penetrated her vaginally and anally. The book went into some detail about the crimes and the explanation of some of the reasons for the crimes and what types of behaviors that lead a person to commit them. When I finish the book I still had some unanswered questions. Don't get me wrong the book was great and I would recommend it to anyone who is mature enough to handle its contents but I wish Hazelwood had gone into greater detail."},{"Title":"Dark Dreams","review":"Awesome book! What more can I say...I couldn't put this one down!Roy Hazelwood and Stephen Michaud did an excellent job with this one.

This book is fantastic!He teaches you as you go, giving examples and vivid stories to back up what you are learning.2. There is so much information packed into this book. Hazelwood does very well at explaining difficult subjects without becoming confusing.3. Unlike some other comments regarding John Douglas, Roy Hazelwood in no way portrays himself as arrogant or self-absorbed.Cons:1. While a variety of sinister crimes are discussed, there is a predominence of sexually related crimes.2. There is so much information packed into this book you may want to read it slow, or read it multiple times to take it all in."},{"Title":"Dark Dreams","review":"'DARK DREAMS' BY F.B.I PROFILER ROY HAZELWOOD AND STEPHEN MICHAUD WAS A FAIRLY GOOD READ.

What a disapointment.The book is all over the place and spends too much time trying to articulate the half-baked psychology of the writers. One particular example of stunning hypocrisy is their obsession with blaming &quot;Detective&quot; magazines as a source of inspiration for the sadistic killers they portray. They then proceed to describe the crimes in high school level writing and place lurid photos in their book, just like the &quot;Detective&quot; magazines they find at fault. Does a paperback or hardcover make them exempt from their own argument?They use specific cases for much of the book, but never fail to throw in &quot;one case in...&quot; or &quot;one criminal did this...&quot; that read like anonymous internet hoax stories or urban legends.The most frightening aspect of the book is that these guys are the supposed &quot;experts&quot; in charge of keeping us safe from criminals they describe.I'm from the Seattle area, and after reading this book, by these experts, it is no longer a mystery to me how the Green River Killer was able to avoid detection by our police for so long.Skip this turkey."},{"Title":"Dark Dreams","review":"This book was very informative.

Make them prove it.&quot;First I had to go to the web to find any qualifications for Hazelwood. Second I still have no clue as to his educational background. Third lots of good rubbernecking details but lacking sadly on proof of any of his statements. I can tell you what I saw working in 14 years of Forensic Psych but it doesn't mean I am right without hard stats to prove my point. He doesn't yield them. Might they be locked in a safe somewhere because I haven't seen valid proof of some of his theories yet. I can't say they are wrong but I can't say they are right. I need numbers to back up what he says. He also has a very &quot;Christian&quot; start using one of the early Christian writers to exemplify his model of certain behavior. It didn't fly. The parallels were too vague and too cultural centric of a Purtain background. At no time did I feel he was an impartial observer but had an agenda to &quot;prove&quot; something. If he didn't it was the strong impression the book gave. There were some interesting theories that would have been better presented in another manner.Is it worth the read? For all the faults, yes. It does present some interesting theories that while they might be unfounded in the end [give me some hard stats please] are worth examining."},{"Title":"Dark Dreams","review":"Don't wait for the paperback- Sometimes you buy a book and the first few chapters are sooo good and then it drops off, NOT this one. From page one to the last few chapters this book is pure experience-NON stop. They drive home some subjects over and over, but in different scenarios. Half way through I ordered The Evil That Men Do, because I was sure it would be just as good (same writers). If you're a True Crime/Serial Killer fan this one should not be missed- new names and new cases."},{"Title":"Dark Dreams","review":"You will not be able to put this book down.

RH deserves better than his co-author and I hope he ditches him and finds an actual author when he writes another book.The above is my opinion."},{"Title":"Dark Dreams","review":"When I first started reading this book, I was expecting a typical True Crime book. Most True Crime books focus on the Crimes committed by a Criminal, however Dark Dreams goes onto explain what motivates these criminals, and provides some insight into why they committ crimes.Dark Dreams does detail crimes, but does not explain them entirly. I would've liked to read more details about the crimes.This Book Was a Fascinating Read, I'd suggest it to anyone.Roy Hazelwood and Stephen G.

Serial rapes and murders are the topic. It is amazing how &quot;predictable&quot; the offenders can be. That's how the FBI and other agencies are able to so successfully &quot;profile&quot; the suspects and eventually (usually) catch them."},{"Title":"Dark Dreams","review":"This book was a terrific read. I finished it in three quick sittings, I just kept turning the pages.

Just make sure you have not eaten lunch just before you start reading."},{"Title":"Dark Dreams","review":"An excellent book that offers depth and perception into the criminal mind, Dark Dreams is a harsh, disturbing but ultimately mesmerizing book. The author's unquestioned authority in this area lends breadth to his analyses, certainly, but it his is writing style that gives the work a horrifying immediacy.Although excellent for libraries, it should be noted that this is not a book for young readers. The material is candid and at times grotesque. Recommended reference for mature students."},{"Title":"Dark Dreams","review":"For some reason I thought this was a book about the science behind criminal profiling. I was mostly wrong.

Hazelwood and Michaud are all over the map giving you a little bit of this, a little taste of that. I would have preferred a single-topic book."},{"Title":"Dark Dreams","review":"Hazelwood is one of the pioneers of criminal profiling, and in this book he shows how serial killer behavior is motivated by deviant sexual desires. Simply put, the killer has a sexual fantasy he wants to fulfill; the profiler has to uncover that fantasy to help catch him. The authors chronicle many notable cases and dissect the thought processes that brought these killers to commit their crimes. Fascinating and blood-curdling!"},{"Title":"Dark Dreams","review":"Roy Hazelwood is the premier profiler. If ever you considered a career in this field, this book is a MUST read.

This book is a great refernce book that is a repeat read. It is RAW and detailed. Although the crimes are gruesome, the details and evidence must be told to give the reader insight on how a Profiler uses his skills to try to present motive to open a case.

I found it analytical as well as intriging. He also talks about 'reasons' as best he could - but then again - it's hard to really understand the motivation of why people do these things.I am just about done with this book - I can't believe for being over 200 pages - how non-stop it's been for me."},{"Title":"Dark Dreams","review":"Sexual violence & homicide are tough enough subjects to deal with but I can only imagine how tough it may be to try to put those experiences down on paper in such a way that the reader not only can feel like part of it but also kept at arms length as to not totally be swept up in the brutalness of it all. I felt the author did a great job in this aspect. He was able to describe to us not only the situation but how it looked to different people and not only that but to give insight into the minds of the perpetrators.As for the gory side of the subject manner I though the author did a great job of presenting it so to me it was not over the top or gross. Other people might not be able to read it for that and that is fine but I saw no problem with the book. I would recomend this book to the right person and you know if you are actually that person."},{"Title":"Dark Dreams","review":"I started reading about serial killers after the sniper deaths in Washington D.C. and Maryland. \\"Dark Dreams\\" is an interesting and horrifying look into the minds of serial killers, mostly American, although there is the obligatory chapter on Jack the Ripper.In a previously read book, \\"Serial Killers\\" by Joel Norris, the author attempted both a psychological and biological profile of these murderers with emphasis on both nature and upbringing. Hazelwood and Michaud do not attempt to decipher the 'why' of serial killers in \\"Dark Dreams.\\" They concentrate on the different types of 'how,' and what the 'how' reveals about the serial killer.For instance, one of the authors' major themes is the narcissism of serial killers. Many of them come to believe that they are too smart for the police to catch, and start taking unnecessary chances. Some even write taunting letters to the police, e.g. the Zodiac Killer, or commit a crime under the very noses of their pursuers. An example of the latter type of behavior was demonstrated by the stalker, Andrew Johnstone, who stole his victim's underwear out of a Salvation Army box that the police had under twenty-four hour surveillance. The authors point out that a safer method to obtain the same result would have been to steal his victim's bras off of her clothesline.A few other common characteristics of serial killers that the authors spend some time with are their ritualistic behavior, their employment of paid or compliant partners to 'practice' on, and their use of detective magazines as 'how to' manuals. A range of deviant behaviors including fetishism, necrophilia, sadism, masochism, and autoeroticism are touched upon although the authors concentrate on ritualistic sexual sadists as \\"the most resourceful, destructive, and elusive of all deviant offenders.\\"One of the authors, Roy Hazelwood\\" also co-authored a book on \\"Autoerotic Fatalities\\" and \\"Dark Dreams\\" follows up on this theme and explains how profilers determine whether a particular death is suicide, homicide, or an unfortunate accident.How would you interpret the case where a teen-age boy's nude body was discovered hanging inside a vertical sewer pipe, his face covered in duct tape, and his grandfather's watch taped inside his mouth? Read the chapter on \\"Equivocal Deaths\\" and learn how FBI profiler and co-author, Roy Hazelwood determined exactly what had occurred.This book is a dark journey into the human mind, quite graphic at times, and should probably be stamped \\"For mature readers only.\\""},{"Title":"Weight Watchers Stir-Fry to Szechuan: 100 Classic Chinese Recipes","review":"This is a fabulous Chinese cookbook, not only for Weight Watchers members but also for those interested in the taste of Chinese cooking without all the extra fat and calories.

She is a joy to read and repays second and third perusals. The oral narrative quality of her writing places her squarely in the company of the best of her Southern contemporaries. She shares their great gifts. By all means, don't deny yourself the pleasure of reading her work."},{"Title":"Zora Neale Hurston : Novels and Stories : Jonah's Gourd Vine / Their Eyes Were Watching God / Moses, Man of the Mountain / Seraph on the Suwanee / Selected Stories (Library of America)","review":"Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston is a bittersweet novel that emphasizes the relationship between nature and human life. The protagonist, Janie Mae Crawford, begins the novel by returning to Eatonville, a small town where all her thoughts and emotions were once considered worthless. She is reunited with her closest friend, Phoebe Watson, and relates to her the story of why she suddenly disappeared years ago. Through this unfolding of Janie's intriguing yet depressing life story, the reader is able to witness how society can corrupt the harmony of nature and also the joy of human life.Before Janie moved to Eatonville, an all black town, she lived with her Nanny. At sixteen, Janie was already imagining what marriage was like. She would sit underneath her blossomed pear tree and witness a bee singing calmly while getting nectar out of each flower. She longed to be loved and cared for like the blossom, but she did not know where or how to find her singing bee. Her Nanny grew worried that her young granddaughter would be taken advantage of by men; so therefore, Janie's marriage was arranged.Zora Neale Hurston uses symbolism throughout her novel to allow the reader to discover her message. She uses the bee and the blossom to emphasize the harmony and unity that should exist in not only marriage but in life. Hurston travels through many marriages and downfalls of Janie's life, but accentuates her persistence and strength to find her independence and joy.Written in only seven weeks, this romantic classic has the ability to give the reader insight of how a woman, like Janie, lived in a society where men were considered dominate. The setting of this book takes place in the past where women were viewed as frail - lacking in both opinion and power. Hurston portrays that women deserve independence and respect through Janie, the female hero. In addition, the style of the novel is written as a frame story, creating parallels to the traditions of black culture. The custom of oral tradition is shown in the beginning of this novel when Janie begins to explain to Phoebe her story, \\"You can tell \`em what Ah say if you wants to. Dat's just de same as me \`cause mah tongue is in mah friend's mouf.\\" This style of writing not only captures the reader into vivid imagination and strong emotions, but also indirectly enlightens the reader about the culture of a small African American society.Their Eyes Were Watching God is a book that emphasizes love, joy, and adventure. Although it may not interest many men, for it is more of a feminist novel, women would be more inclined to relate and sympathize with Janie's story. This book encourages the reader not to become trapped in society's expectations but to become independent and to pursue his or her own aspirations."},{"Title":"Zora Neale Hurston : Novels and Stories : Jonah's Gourd Vine / Their Eyes Were Watching God / Moses, Man of the Mountain / Seraph on the Suwanee / Selected Stories (Library of America)","review":"Zora Neale Hurston is, without a doubt, one of the giants of literature of the last century.

Now, for the first time, this volume serves the reader the whole pie.Whether Hurston studied the practice of Voodoo in the Caribbean, the folkways of African-Americans in the Old South, or the interrelationships of the races in the society of her time (especially in the trial of Ruby McCollum, which she covered for the Pittsburgh Courier), she tackled her subject with a degree of enthusiasm that is seldom matched."},{"Title":"Zora Neale Hurston : Novels and Stories : Jonah's Gourd Vine / Their Eyes Were Watching God / Moses, Man of the Mountain / Seraph on the Suwanee / Selected Stories (Library of America)","review":"I was so delighted wiith this read that I finished it in a week.

Heidel wrote this book in order to appeal to a wide audience rather than just students of Akkadian, so there is no cuneiform or transcripted Akkadian, just the English translation. He introduces us to the background and then takes us through the Epic of Gilgamesh. Further chapters very carefully contrast parts of the Gilgamesh and other Mesopotamian literature to the stories of the bible. Heidel concentrates on the view of death and the afterlife and the Mesopotamiam Flood stories versus Noah. I found it very interesting if somewhat heavy going at times as I'm not a student in this field, and just familiarising myself with this type of literature. Luckily, Heidel was extremely careful to present a well annotated and referenced book so that readers can check up on each detail for themselves.However, there is one problem: the whole look of this book is off-putting. Written in double-spaced, small Arial font, it looks like a research paper that has inexplicably been wrapped in a glossy cover. It's not easy on the eye at all and I found the presentation quite distracting. Also, compared to some of the more recent translations, (eg Stephanie Dalley)this particular translation of the Epic of Gilgamesh is not very reader friendly as the English is very old fashioned.Overall I would say that the content will appeal to a wide range of readers, but the overall look of the book could do with a bit of an overhaul."},{"Title":"The Gilgamesh epic and Old Testament parallels","review":"I read Gilgamesh after I read the Iliad and they Oddyssey, and now i see where Homer got most of his ideas. I sat down with the notion that Gilgamesh would be a hard read; that it would take me forever to finish. However, it turns out that the actual epic is only a 100 pages, and version i got was filled with other poems that corresponded with the epic.I thought that this was a wonderful story, and a worthwhile read if you've ever read anything by Homer or even the Bible, because this is the root of it all. The story is sad, erotic and wonderful all at the same time, and i highly recommend it for any age reader."},{"Title":"The Gilgamesh epic and Old Testament parallels","review":"This is the second translation of the Gilgamesh epic that I have read recently, the other being translated by Benjamin R. Foster. Each of them has their strong points, but overall I prefer the Foster translation. The Foster translation is much more recent(2001), and benefits from additional pieces of the epic being found. The Heidel translation is from 1946 and for that reason has more gaps than the Foster translation. Heidel also translates the racier portions of the epic into Latin rather than English which is troublesome for non-scholars.That being said, there are some very good things about this book which make it worthwhile. Heidel does an excellent job of informing the reader of what the source is for each part of the translation, as well as for the related material that he presents. His sections on 'Death and the Afterlife', and 'The Story Of The Flood' where he compares the Mesopotamian works with those of the Old Testament are much better than the discussion given with the Foster translation in my opinion. In addition, Rivkah Scharf Kluger uses Heidel's translation for most of her work presented in \\"The Archetypal Significance of Gilgamesh\\", which give those interested in a large amount of discussion all based on the same translation.One last comment on the book itself is that the typeface used is rather small, and not very easy on the eyes."},{"Title":"The Gilgamesh epic and Old Testament parallels","review":"Interesting to see the comparison of the biblical account of Noah's Ark and the older Gilgamesh story. A good read for those interested in the origins of biblical stories."},{"Title":"Marbles: Identification and Price Guide (Schiffer Book for Collectors)","review":"Easier to use than some of the other marble &quot;standards.&quot; It is well organized and the values, based on the condition of the marble, are with the marbles. Some of the other books have you constantly flipping from back to front to find a value. The different types of antique handmade marbles are logically grouped for the most part and the machine made marbles are divided by manufacturer.There is even a section with examples from contemporary marble artists. My one complaint would be that there should be an index to make finding of the great many types of machine made marbles easier. Until something better comes along, I carry this with me to auctions, flea markets, antique shows or anywhere else I think there might be an opportunity to buy, sell or trade marbles."},{"Title":"Marbles: Identification and Price Guide (Schiffer Book for Collectors)","review":"I really have absolutely nothing against this wonderful work and in fact have nothing by praise. Of the many marble books out there, and there are many you will note, this one is at the top of the list for shear teaching power. It is also the one book (if you are silly enough to just carry one) that you should take with you to auctions and sales. I say this because of the ease of finding what you are looking for. At an auction or sale you simply do not have several hours to ponder and research...you need information and you need it fast. This work allows you to do that due to its wonderful organization.Now, if you are interested in marbles, old marbles, and who isn't, then this is what I would term as a keystone or base book. It gives you a wonderful starting point to further your research. All the various machine marbles are covered; or at least most of them and the author has given us a good start at understanding, identification and source of the old clay marbles. I will state at this time though, that if you are interested in specialty marbles, such as clay, then you probably will need supplemental books to go along with this work. No one book can cover ever aspect of this fascinating subject...it would be impossible.Also, let me warn you as to the pricing provided here. This is a good starting point and gives good information as to how to evaluate any given marble or category of marble, but DO NOT come under the impression that value is static. The cost or value of any given piece can vary greatly and change almost from day to day. Also geography has a lot to do with it. I know from personal experience that prices for any given item can swing tremendously from the East Coast to the Midwest. If you pay say one hundred dollars and think you are getting a bargain at the time, don't expect to triple your money in some other state or some other time. Like any antique or collectable, any given item is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it or is willing to part with it for.All in all though, this is one of the best and if you interests lie in this direction, then you certainly should have a copy of this one in your possession. I have been particularly impressed with the quality of photographs provided in this volume.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Marbles: Identification and Price Guide (Schiffer Book for Collectors)","review":"Great Marble book.

It also has many black and white - hand-drawn pictures for identification. This book does NOT include any management information (ie. uses, importance, establishment rates/methods, etc...). A very detailed scientific publication."},{"Title":"Lord, Have Mercy","review":"There is something phenomenal about Scott Hahn. Almost every book he writes seems to be the definitive book on the subject. Lord, Have Mercy is probably not his best book, but it is the best book I have read on the topic of sacramental Confession.Hahn seems to have done it all: the Old Testament pre-history of confession (going back to Adam and Eve), the New Testament origins of the sacrament, the history (from patristic times to the present), the theological and spiritual reasons why confession is necessary, and a common-sense guide to best practice for penitents; he ends with an up-to-date and very comprehensive examination of conscience. Along the way, he demolishes every significant argument against the validity and efficacy of the sacrament.All of this is done in Hahn's simple, easy-to-read style, which makes deep theological and exegetical issues comprehensible to almost everyone. Above all, he writes everything in the context of the overwhelming mercy of God. And all in about 200 pages, including sources and references.To add fun along the way, we also get his delightful word-play subtitles, for those who, like myself, agree with Isaac Asimov that the play on words is the noblest form of wit.All in all, this is the perfect book on Confession to recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"The Symbolic Rose","review":"This is one of my favorite books on symbolism through the ages. Barbara Seward didn't miss many of the rose's meanings from its classical origins through Dante and his predecessors to Eliot, Yeats, and James Joyce's brilliant reworkings.

Bravo.... if only more scholarly studies could be so rewarding while being so fun to read....."},{"Title":"Conduct Unbecoming: Gays and Lesbians in the U.S. Military","review":"Author Shilts has written the seminal work on gays and lesbians in the military. Should not be missed by those interested in American history. I read this book at a time in my life when I was incredibly lonely and sad about my station in life, and, though not gay, I was filled with hope and the promise of a better day by Randy Shilts work.I can't recommend this book highly enough. One of the great books on American history."},{"Title":"Conduct Unbecoming: Gays and Lesbians in the U.S. Military","review":"Shilts uses his investigative journalism background to craft a compelling argument for the free service of all of those who volunteer to serve. He gives a window into the feelings and motivations of gays in the military and those who serve with them. The progression of the events and documentation of changes in attitude seem to lead toward a future where gays can serve openly. I found the parallels drawn between the situation of gay soldiers now and the situation of black soldiers before the 1950's to be especially convincing."},{"Title":"Conduct Unbecoming: Gays and Lesbians in the U.S. Military","review":"I bought 2 more of these as gifts after I read this about 10 years ago.

In Sacrifice a young woman named Ann crashes on jungle-like planet and sees the Alien in the jungle. Terrified, she runs until she stumbles on a little town, protected by a wall, that harbors dark and dangerous secrets... Will she find out what they are doing? Or will they first find out her secrets... The art in Sacrifice is truly fantastic, different than most of the art in these comics. The writing is also fantastic, and even though there is not much action, the story moves along pretty quickly, with the reader wondering what's going to happen. Then in Salvation(sorry I'm going out of order, I read Sacrifice first) a space crewman finds God on a desolate island with only some monkey natives, him, and his captain, who may not live much longer. And also what was in the storage hold that made their ship go down? What was the captain so afraid of? Possibly the best Alien story I have ever read,(on a par with Genocide) this one is more action oriented, so get ready for an action-packed conclusion! The art is o.k.,(not much detail) but that does NOT stop the stories fast paced action. A MUST for Aliens fans! Overall this is great story-telling together. 5 stars and a Grade: A+"},{"Title":"Aliens: Salvation and Sacrifice","review":"This is the Aliens book with a good balance of action and a different kind of drama: religion. Both parts of the book involve a character isolated from their friends and left to fend themselves from the Alien menace. The art is both unique. In Aliens salvation we get a simple yet stylish art technique, involving lots of shadows much like AvP Eternal. In Aliens sacrifice the art is cover art quality, and this is an entire comic we're talking about! Its rare to find such good quality art in comics, but Aliens Sacrifice has it. Salvation is the more action oriented of the two, and the dialogue style and the character of Selkirk mold it into something that will leave you completely awed at the very end, it also has an alien 3 feel to it but not in that bad way. Sacrifice is the more drama oriented one, dealing with human spirituality and its will to survive. The ending is something different, considering this is a book with religion in it, I was glad it had a twist that nobody could imagine the main character would do. Overall, both stories are great and I promise that their endings will move you in one way or another. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Aliens: Salvation and Sacrifice","review":"Aliens: Salvation and Sacrifice collects two one-shots by Dark Horse Comics that coincidentally deal with not only the marauding Alien \\"Bugs\\", but also with Religious faith being tested under extreme conditions....Part one, Salvation, by Dave Gibbons, Mike Mignola, and Kevin Nowlan revolves around a marooned duo, trapped on a planet with the Alien cargo their ship was carrying. As if the Aliens weren't bad enough, one of the men is stone-cold crazy, while the other clings to his religious beliefs for justification of the things he must do to survive. Mignola and Nowlan's art is gorgeous, and I've never been a fan of Dave Gibbons' writing, but his story is gripping, and the feeling of impending doom he creates is palpable.Part II, Sacrifice, deals with another marooned shipwreck survivor, this time a woman, who stumbles across another group of survivors, who have a faustian pact with the lone Alien who haunts the jungle outside their crude compound. Did I mention that the woman, Ann, is a Priest? She's been dealing with memories of seeing her mother murdered by an Alien over 20 years ago, and she sees this as her chance at redemption. Writer Peter Milligan does a great job, and the art, by painter Paul Johnson, is staggeringly beautiful. I've never seen the Aliens so well-depicted! You truly get a sense of the awe and fear that these creatures could inspire.All in all, Salvation and Sacrifice is an amazing example of what could be done with these creatures in the Comic format. (Try reading it while listening to Elliot Goldenthal's score for Alien 3- It'll crank the creepy factor up to 11!)"},{"Title":"Aliens: Salvation and Sacrifice","review":"SalvationGreat artwork by Mignola - if you like Hellboy, you'll like this - and interesting story as well. It's a rather short read and while it isn't mind-blowing, it's good enough. It could be the basis for a movie. It also has one of the best covers in comic book history (no less), but that cover isn't the one represented here (I bought these books in separate editions). The only problem I have with this story is the \\"religiousness\\" of the main character. He isn't as much religious as he is nuts, and the fact that he can't even recite the Our Father prayer correctly doesn't make his religiousness sound very credible. I was disappointed by that because I thought the idea of mixing the alien universe and religion was a great idea, very much like what Fincher did with Alien 3, to some degree, and I wanted more of that. There is no epic, existential introspection about God and the existence of evil and aliens or anything; there is just a loon who poses as religious. It could be understood as offensive to religious people had it not been so remote from actual religious people (mainly in that they know the Our Father...). A valid effort.SacrificeVery different artwork this time, and an even darker story. Once again, religious themes abound, but again, no epic dilemma of Godly proportions, and a rather atheistic conclusion, for better or worse. I liked that the story went darker than one might expect, but I was again disappointed by what was done with the religious aspect of it all. There is also the matter of the alien's behaviour, which is questionable. I am not 100% convinced that the story makes sense in view of what we know about the aliens. Here, one alien assumes the role of some kind of Satan to whom life is sacrificed - which is an interesting approach - but fails to convince, for practical reasons. Symbology is nice but cannot work at the expense of common sense. The story offers an explanation for this, but it's merely speculation and it again fails to convince. Within the logic of the aliens, it doesn't quite make sense for that alien to behave this way (I can't go into details without spoiling it for you). Let's just say it doesn't correspond to what aliens traditionally do and are meant to do. Not a bad story, but not one I'd recommend to alien fans beyond mere curiosity."},{"Title":"Aliens: Salvation and Sacrifice","review":"I bought this purely to see mike Mignola's take on the H.R. Giger inspired Alien - and was by no means disappointed. The Comic arrived in lovely condition - no tears or smudges or creases (which is alot more than i can say for a different purchase that was titled 'like new' but anyway) so I'm going to say this seller is a bit more honest than some in regards to the condition status. Can't exactly remember what they put for this item - believe it was 'acceptable' (albeit this was more like a 'like new' item; so you'll definitely receive something in if not better condition than described."},{"Title":"The Thorn of Sexual Abuse: The Gripping Story of a Family's Courage and One Man's Struggle","review":"Too often we are confronted with sex, violence, pain and fear from our television, newspapers, and movies, in realistic but fictional stories.

Sex is a very central part of every culture...it can be beautiful; it can be abused...but it will never, not be a part of the family environment. For many many individuals, their feelings regarding sex have arisen from very early experiences, many of them abusive or inappropriate for the young.

Mostly, they were realized. I fell in love with Mr. Dunworthy and Mary, though not with Kivrin, whose character seemed rather undeveloped. I have to credit Ms. Willis with having the guts to write a dark novel, where not everyone lives happily ever after. However, I was disappointed by the amount of loose ends left over at the end of this novel. Did Ms. Willis simply become tired of the story after five years of writing? Overall, good book worth reading, but I don't expect that it will become a long-lived classic."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I read this book just after it won all the awards. I couldn't put it down. That's not entirely a good thing, considering the fact that it was such an incredible downer. Do we really need another piece of entertainment that chronicles the deaths of so many people? Unlike many who have read this work, I didn't find much within its covers that could be considered humorous. I just remember feeling depressed, covered with mud and exploded bubonic plague bubules when it was finished. It's compellingly written, but, when all's said and done, I didn't feel that there was much to be gained by experiencing this work. The characters were not very memorable, either. I must admit, though, that I've never forgotten the author's descriptions of plague victims' symptoms. Yech"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I don't really understand how this book got the Nebula award. On what grounds? The science fiction is just not there. We never get to learn about the Net. Time paradoxes are never explained to us. On the other hand, the book fails even in common sense issues. Consider for a minute the possibility of time travel becoming a reality. You 'd agree it 'd be the most spectacular achievement in the history of human race. Every mission in the past would be much more special than any mission NASA has ever undertaken. However, in this book, we are supposed to believe that trips in the past are actually run by \\"techs\\" in universities. Have you ever thought of MIT or Cambridge launching a manned mission to Alpha Centauri? Moreover, we are supposedly living in a future where time travel is \\"old news\\". And instead of learning the truth about the really important issues of the past (Who was Jesus Christ for example?) the writer focuses on the Middle Ages Black Death. As anyone cared! On literary grounds, the characters are as cardboard as you can get, and the jokes about \\"running out of toilet paper\\" etc are at least pathetic. And one can't fail to notice that only 10 years after, the book is already dated when it comes to communications. Page after page, people are desperately trying to find a phone. I wonder, weren't there cell phones back in the medieval year 1992?This book is exactly as disappointing as Crichton's Timeline. If you want to read a gem on time travel, try to find the masterpiece \\"The end of Eternity\\" by Isaac Asimov."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Boring! I really, really tried to make it through. After 230 pages nothing had happened so I stopped. Why is this book called science fiction? The only apparent reason is because of the use of time travel, but even that is poorly depicted. The author avoids questions about the &quot;rules&quot; of time travel by simply installing an entity called the &quot;net&quot; that somehow stops problematic things, such as bombs or an encounter that would change history, from travelling back in time. But wouldn't any encounter alter the future? Willis should have read the Bradbury short story, &quot;The sound of thunder,&quot; before writing this. Willis doesn't seem to have put any thought into the time travelling idea, which isn't surprising because it has no place in the book. It's simply a lame excuse to describe a historical encounter. Also, the future could be the 1970's for all the description it is given. As I have said I only reached page 230, but what I read any editor worth his salt would have cut in half. Did you like the 50 pages worth of garbage spent with the characters trying to trace the origins of the virus? Unbelievably dull."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"There are serious narrative lacunae here. The prime agent of the obstacles that make this move forward at all is the mysterious disappearance of a certain Dr. Basingame. Readers with even the slightest sense of plot structure will feel cheated that this disappearance is never explained. By the end of the book the author seems to have quite forgotten it.The prose is drab and perfunctory. \\"Disinterested\\" is used incorrectly to mean \\"uninterested\\" (it really means \\"impartial\\") once, and \\"hopefully\\" is used incorrectly to mean \\"I hope\\" or \\"she hoped\\" four times (\\"hopefully\\" is really an ADVERB). These solecisms are inexcusable. At the very least, an editor ought to have fixed them.I've read many novels having to do with time travel (the best by far is H. G. Wells's classic \\"The Time Machine). This is the first that seems utterly unable to distinguish time from space. The heroine ventures into the fourteenth century in early winter because she wants it to be near Christmas when she arrives! Nearly the whole while she is there she wonders what her compatriots in the twenty-first-century are doing! This sort of the thing is ridiculous--hilariously amateurish, really and, of course, also inexcusable.The very end (inadvertantly reminiscent of \\"Hamlet\\" with bodies strewn about) has a certain dramatic heft, and the heroine's professor's misapprehensions about the era to which they send her are amusing, otherwise I should give this one star instead of two."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"A bit of a spoiler, but let me review what has happened in the first 1/2 of the book. There is an influenza epidemic in the future and the lab is quarantined, so they can't figure out where Kivrin was sent. In the past, Kivrin has recovers from the influenza, but she can't remember the exact location where her pick-up point is supposed to be in order to return to the future. These two plot items are repeated many times. In thriller fiction, a character is supposed to try something different when a course of action fails, not keep attempting the same action over and over again. I may have missed something literary here, but I think more should have happened in the first half of the book! Additionally, Ms. Willis's story depends on plot devices that were unbelievable even when she wrote the book - computers back-up systems (the lack of which plays significantly in the inability of the characters to resolve the story problem) and language tools that translate machine language into understandable words of varying complexity (again, the lack of which, or rather, the inability of anyone but a highly trained technician to decipher the computer's code, plays significantly in the inability of the characters to resolve the story problem.)After finishing the book, I would recommend The Year of Wonders by Geraldine Brooks, the story about a young woman during a plague epidemic in England. Though it is set in the 17th century instead of the 14th, it captures the pathos of the plague epidemic better than Willis's book does."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Historical accuracy of life in the 14th century was excellent, and the plot started out in an exciting way. But after reading several of Connie Willis' books, I discovered there is nothing very exciting about her time travel concepts. There are too many failsafes like the characters not being able to introduce any anachronisms into the past. Anachronisms are what make time travel interesting, (i.e. read Millenium for an exciting time travel novel). Also, too many rules and restrictions about time travel make this novel's ending fall flatter than a pancake. The final chapters would have been incredibly suspenseful had the character Kivrin perished in the 14th century and been found in the 21st century excavation. Then Dunworthy could have gone back to try to change the past in order to save her. Conclusion: This novel gets your anticipation up to fever pitch then lets you down with a disappointing ending."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I read science fiction to be entertained. While I can assume from the great reviews of this book that there is some substance to the material it contains, it was amazingly slow and boring. Obviously there are different ways to review a book besides page-turning entertainment. I am still recovering from a bruised nose from when, during my attempt to get through chapter four, my head suddenly hit the table.Used book, anyone"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is the absolute worst book that I ever read cover to cover. I love time travel stories so I felt compelled to muddle on. Even a 90 year old nun would have thrown this book against the wall at some point and shouted \\"This book Sucks !! \\". It was amateurish at best. The dialog was insanely monotonous and without direction and could have been written by anyone with a sixth grade education. The book I read was 450 pages long but could have been written in about 40 pages. The remaining 410 pages goes in circles around non-events. Nothing happens for tens of pages , then something minor happens, then tens of pages more of dribble. I can't believe ANYONE would give this book more than one star. !!! I can't even believe this thing got published and I consider myself an easy mark and always try to look at the good side of things."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Warning, I might spoil a bit of storyline here.Nice original concept.That said, lots of problems arise because the heroine is rushed to the Middle Ages whilst the main boss in charge of the time machine is off on holiday. And his authorisation is required when her friends want access to the time machine to find out where she is, and help her.See, that's what I do not get. If you have a time machine, then why can't you wait untill everybody who is required to operate the thing is present?It is a time machine. Where is the rush?It makes no sense. If a time machine existed, this is NOT how it would be operated. This is where the book starts to fall apart.For example: The Middle Ages period to which the heroine wants to go is classed 10 - too dangerous. Why do you send a completely unexperienced time traveller to a period you have classified as 'too dangerous'? And alone, too?Imagine this conversation:- \\"Sorry but no time travellers go to a class 10, no matter how experienced they are. That's what 'class 10' means. It is too dangerous for anybody\\"- \\"But I am really interested in the middle ages because I just read a book about it\\"- \\"Well why didn't you say so? Hop in, there you go!\\"In this day and age, someone with no credentials or experience does not even get access to a university's computer; but this is no obstacle when it comes to a time machine.Missed opportunities:There is a plague in the middle ages, and there is a mysterious disease in the present day, just as the heroine is stuck in the past. There could have been a link, like the present day disease really being the plague. As it is, the present day disease turns out to be the flu wearing a funny hat. No link at all.And another missed opportunity: The heroine is lost, plague is approaching, her friends can not find her because they do not know where (and when) she is.However, one of her associates is involved in an archeological dig which operates close to the village where she is. Why did she not plant a message in one of the tombs and let that travel through time?As it is, the archeological dig is a completely pointless sidestory which adds to the book, but not to the story.A dissapointing book, I expected much better."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"amazon recommended this book but i found it very slow paced and drawn-out.

It's also only nominally science fiction. The author avoids time travel paradoxes glibly. It's also shocking to see a sci fi book written in 1992 fail to predict cell phones and email. Not sure why this was so award-winning, but not painful if you're interested in the 14th century."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I read this book 10 years ago yet it still lingers in my mind. Considering that I've read at least 500 books since then says alot. I can not say, however, that I enjoyed this book.Unlike some reviewers, while it wasn't a pleasant experience, I certainly got a lot out of the book. The writing is first rate, as are the descriptions of campus life and life before and during the horror of death from the plague. I learned alot about the art of bell ringing as well.The style is deceivingly simplistic and light. The themes are anything but. There is a race against time love story, and a very tragic, what is the point of life, heart wrenching narrative.It is a very long book, and I was very negative on it after finishing, thinking it a shaggy dog story. Over time, it has grown on me. I won't re-read it, but it is a seminal work that I find creeping in to my sub-concious when reading other works. This is a deep read, but not a jolly good time."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Doomsday Book is one of the best novels, Sci Fi or not, that I have read in years. This is not only a book that you can't put down, but one that will keep you thinking about it for days and weeks after you finish. Excellent, stimulating writing, fabulous characters, an interesting parallel &quot;universe&quot; plot (14th vs 21st century); this is clearly a work culminating an enormous effort from Ms. Willis, whose awards alone identify her as a must read author. I highly recommend this book and have purchased copies to give to a number of people. Five stars is not enough."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"One thing that distinguishes Connie Willis fromother writers is that she does her homework. Doomsday Book is the culmination of five years of research that Willis did on the time period and the Black Death. The end result is a rather dark novel, but one whose characters are not only sympathetic, but mulit-dimensional and well-developed. This is Willis' forte in her writings, and this book is no exception.This peak into fourteenth-century Europe-- during its darkest times was a little too dark for me, I liked the novel, although personally felt that it was a bit too hopeless for my taste. This is my least favorite Willis novel-- which is not to say that this work is bad-- far from it. In fact, Doomsday Book earned her a Hugo and a Nebula award. It's just not to my tastes."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Connie Willis presents a world that is entirely cohorentand self-consistent. Her mannered study of British lifein the 1300s lives alongside the time travel story which provesthat even the most tried and true scifi tropes can be redone wellin the hands of a capable writer. And that she is. The tensionbuilds with a tempo that will keep you turning the pages eventhough you know roughly how the details all get worked out.However, the dramatic tone does float towards overtly and overlymelodramatic once in a while. It's a small smudge on an otherwisewell paced book that convinces the reader that seriously goodscifi can also be a page turner. It's also just a tad longer thanit deserved, but honestly only by 10%. Also check out To SayNothing of the Dog- a book set in the same Willis universe,but is not a direct sequel. If anything, that may be a betterbook than this one. I read them in backward order, accidentally,and there is no reason you have to read these in order."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book deals with time travel to the past. The heroine is the victim of a malfunctioning time machine, which accidently sends her back to a time when the plague was rampant in the communities near Cambridge, England.Her translator also malfunctions at first, causing her to misunderstand the middle English spoken by the natives of the new time(written phonetically for the reader's benefit), but eventually she is able to communicate with them, though she's unable to make much of a difference in their lives.This is a worthy read, to which I return at least once a year(as I do with other fond friends of literature). A good read for a rainy weekend at home!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I am not certain why, but I REALLY enjoyed this book as I have not enjoyed a book since Katherine Neville's The Eight. Just enough twists to keep me unable to figure out what was coming next and characters I could become attached to.

While there, an illness strikes the local population. Back in modern day Oxford a virulent epidemic decimates the team that is supposed to bring her back to the present.With the clock ticking down the pressure is on to bring her back. But she is stranded amongst people she cannot understand and is afraid that she is dying of plague. But how is this possible?This fast paced sci-fi thriller sits amazingly comfortably within the framework of creaky Oxford University Dons on the one hand and within a medieval english Novelette on the other. The science elements are not intrusive. Indeed, they may be a little under explained. The mechanisms are never completely addressed.The whole issue of controls over using time travel, and the in-fighting of university departments is a little difficult to swallow. If it worked I cannot see time travel being abused so casually as it is in this book.That said, it makes for an excellent read. The pace is good and the story from medieval england makes good reading.Excellent read, highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"The effort that it took to write this book is matched by the effort it takes one to get by it. I was upset by this one for days, thinking that I had been &quot;Love Storied.&quot; The matching time lines are un evenly written, and I wonder about some of the triteness. The ones who should suffer, the bells etc.Still it is an eye openerThe characters in the plague years are compeling to the point of family, and death takes on a face that is both understood and soundly cursed. As it should be. In all, a wonderful read, both hopeful and helpless.

It is historical fiction. And it is not very good historical fiction. The Hugo Award began its descent into irrelevancy with this selection and has since lost its credibility as the guarantor of great sci-fi."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I am a big fan of SF and time travel stories, as well as historical fiction. This particular book failed for me on every level. The characters had almost no character at all - personalities consisted of primarily of job descriptions. The movement of the story was, as others have noted, painfully slow. I gave up when the main character's desperate slog to meet an important person to the plot was explained in dull, excruciating detail. The main character repeated and repeated the importance of meeting this person in her sluggish \\"race\\" across a courtyard. The author artificially created \\"tension\\" by explaining that the character was very weak, and could almost not make it. Her silly internal monologue was something like \\"I MUST make it - ohhhh\\". The capper was that she finally made it to the spot, only to find that the important person had arrived to speak to her at her original location and left because she was gone on her wallow across the way! I quit after that - I read the Wikipedia page on the book and my suspicions were confirmed - boring plot, bad ending. I dodged a boredom bullet!This book reminds me of an old time \\"spa\\" which was once recommended to me. The spa consisted of steaming mineral waters soaked in ratty wool and cotton blankets, which were then wrapped around my body. I was then led to a room with 10 or so metal spring beds that must have been from pre-Depression times. I was meant to lay on the bed, wrapped in wet blankets, and \\"relax\\"! I felt like I was an injured soldier in the Crimean War. It was a dull, pleasureless experience that I ended prematurely. So too was this novel."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"First of all this book is not sci fi. There are a few references to time travel, the \\"net\\" and paradoxes and that is the extent of the science. If anything it is fantasy and if that is it's raison d'etre it fails. Other reviewers have commented that it is repetitive. This is true and I think it is because the author just didn't have the desire to flesh out the characters in one of the two settings. Come to think of it she didn't flesh out the characters in the other setting either but she did flesh out the settings themselves. Bad choice. It's like she researched the middle ages and wanted to tell us all about it. Really? How about telling the story of the characters in the context of the middle ages. The main problem is though that the story itself is utterly and completely pointless which you will see if you make it to the end. Really disappointing. I can't believe this book won prizes. It really makes me question the validity of these book prizes."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"It's 2048 AD and, while time travel is possible, it is closely controlled and subject to severe physical restrictions. Kivrin, a young student in the history faculty of twenty-first century Oxford University will be conducting a clandestine research visit to one of the most perilous and least understood periods of Middle Age England - the early fourteenth century just prior to the onset of the bubonic plage, the Black Death that wiped out entire families and villages and decimated the population of England and mainland Europe at the height of its spread.Despite painstaking precautions and careful study of fourteenth century customs, language, religious practice, dress and appropriate etiquette, circumstances in plague-ridden England spiral out of Kivrin's control and she is forced to face the likelihood that she will not make the rendezvous that will allow her to return to the present. At the same time, an unknown epidemic spreads in present day England that seems strangely related to Kivrin's visit to the past and hampers the present day research team's best efforts to rescue Kivrin.I have to give Connie Willis an A+ for a superb imaginative plotline but, for this reader, the execution was lacking. The events in present day England had the potential to be a riveting epidemiological search for an unknown illness that seemed to have its roots in the past. Instead, Willis seemed intent on spinning a needlessly repetitive story that focused on inanities - the quarantine on the university campus was causing concerns that there might be a shortage of toilet paper, for example, or the endless woes of a group of touring American bell-ringers who are unable to perform their full Christmas peal. Colin, one of the younger folks of the tale, is gifted with a vocabulary limited to endless irritating variations of \\"Necrotic!\\" or \\"Apocalyptic!\\"Jumping back and forth from present to past and back again to the present seemed to have the result that neither story-line took firm root. Both stories remained mired in the mundane and neither approached compelling. Even with the rich panorama of medieval England on which to draw, Willis failed to paint a convincing picture of the Middle Ages. Most lovers of historical fiction want much, much more than Willis was able to give. On a more positive note, in the closing chapters Willis created a dark and deeply moving piece of pathos as Kivrin realizes the implications of her own inoculated immunity to the Black Death and her inability to stop the death of those around her.A weak recommendation with the recognition that this is one of those novels on the edge ... some will enjoy and others, like myself, will find \\"Doomsday Book\\" disappointing.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Most of what is wonderful and not so wonderful about this tale has already been covered in previous reviews. All that mars this tale is the almost completely extraneous story of what is going on in the future while Kivrin is trapped in the era of the Black Plague. It is an absolutely maddening series of irritating characters and implausible difficulties, only made more so by the introduction of handbell ringers who I suppose are meant to charm us with their eccentricity. Instead, they are just annoying. My advice: as soon as Kivrin is sent back to 1348, read only the portions of the book set in that time, and only the end of the book when she returns. You will get a beautifully crafted story of human qualities--both base and noble--that are genuinely universal. You won't be quite so removed from the fact that real human beings, people not terribly different from you and from me, suffered and died. But this is the key--some of them prevailed, and that is what lifts this story to its heights."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Although Brad from Denver has already summed up the problems with this book quite nicely, I can't help but take a few jabs of my own. The concept of &quot;character development&quot; completely escapes the author, hence my lack of caring about who died, who is in trouble, etc. Why care? Another problem is the pace of the book. It is, to my knowledge, the slowest book you will ever read. Painfully, remove-your-own-teeth-with-a-screwdriver painful. I tried to bravely make it at least half way, but alas, my mind shut down at one-third. Wretched. This book inexplicably won a prestigious award for science fiction."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"You sadists. Take two freaking minutes and give the poor cow some relief instead of shoving her around or punching her in the nose!She was the only character I truly cared about in this book. The rest of them were boring, idiotic marionettes dancing to the author's awkward plot machinations. And you know what's worst? This book could've been great. Historical fiction meets sci-fi! Instead, we get bad sci-fi and boring historical fiction (though some of the details were interesting).I read about this book in a review as an alternative to another truly bad historical fiction novel, World Without End (Follett). The reviewer said Doomsday Book was a far superior novel about the Black Death. Unfortunately, I thought he meant that as an absolute, but he apparently intended it to be a relative statement: while WWE is god-awful, Doomsday is merely moderately offensive.If you like long, drawn out sci-fi with lots of contrived plot devices, this book is for you. If you came looking for a new twist on historical fiction, and you're used to stellar authors such as Sharon Kay Penman and Colleen McCullough, look elsewhere; this book is NOT it."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I typically spend my summers reading science fiction books that have won both the prestigious Hugo and Nebula awards.By far, the most harrowing of the books that have won both awards that I have previously not read is Connie Willis' Doomsday Book.It is almost impossible to put down. I started it on a Saturday afternoon last summer and I could not stop reading it until I finished it after 3 a.m. that night.The story revolves around a time machine that allows historians to do \\"real time study\\" of important historical events.In Christmas 2054, Oxford history professor James Dunworthy agrees to send his favorite graduate student Kivrin Engle to the Middle Ages, 1320 to be precise, to do field work for her thesis on this highly dangerous but fascinating era of human history.Through an unfortunate incident Kivrin gets sent back to 1348 when the Black Plague was raging through the British countryside. Simultaneously, a suspiciously similar deadly epidemic is coursing through 2054 Oxford, complicating efforts for Dunworthy to rescue his trusted charge.The parallel storytelling is incredibly gripping.The writing is also hysterically funny.Willis has a writing style that includes an impressive attention to detail combined with a subtle ear for dialogue.I had never heard of her or her work before seeing her Doomsday Book on the list of Hugo-Nebula winners. Since then I have also read To Say Nothing Of The Dog which has a similar profile of a time-travel story combined with historical detail and impeccable comic timing, in this case bordering on farce.Doomsday Book is an incredible read and a very enjoyable (but nerve-wracking) experience.PLOT: A.IMAGERY: A.IMPACT: A.WRITING: A+.OVERALL GRADE: A."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Enjoyed this work for the subtle, mostly unnoticeable way in which Willis conveyed her strong themes while apparently just telling a simple story. Almost all her artifice is hidden. In those respects, and in the universality of its messages, &quot;Doomsday&quot; reminds me of Tolkien's work--in particular, of The Lord of the Rings. Like the &quot;Rings&quot;, &quot;Doomsday&quot; moves slowly but inevitably to build emotional impact. It is not as powerful as the &quot;Rings&quot;, but that is perhaps due to its much shorter length.Willis makes us think and feel deeply about the human experience: impetuous youth vs. cautious old age, selfishness vs. altruism in all their many aspects, science/knowledge vs. ignorance. I've read most of the (73!) customer reviews on this site, and they seem to either miss what Willis is going for, or at least not spell it out for the rest of us. I suggest prospective readers pay more attention to the professional instead of the amateur reviews (for this book, at least!)It remains a mystery to me, however, why this book is deemed SF. I suppose that if a predominantly genre writer publishes any work, the industry automatically assigns it to her genre. For me, at least, this novel does not meet the SF test--i.e., that it must be primarily speculative fiction. If I had to place it in any genre, I would call it historical fiction. The simple plot device that allows Willis to work in two time periods more closely resembles &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot; or &quot;The French Lieutenant's Woman&quot; than any work in the SF field. Readers who are expecting or who exclusively enjoy SF are likely to be disappointed. Readers who enjoy a good novel of any kind should find their reading time rewarded."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is the best book I've ever read, but then I'm biased. I love Connie Willis' work. Still, it amazes me how Connie Willis has managed to write such a beautiful, haunting and touching novel. Beyond that, it is believable, enjoyable and heartbreaking. One that stays in the mind and heart forever. I loved this book so much I am constructing a web page devoted solely to worshipping it! If you're interested, the URL will be posted on AltaVista ASAP. Email me for more info."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I must admit I was flummoxed to find so many negative reviews of this book. I inhaled it over the course of two days. I was most iimpressed with its storyline in the Middle Ages--what a refreshing reminder that life in the past was not all chivalric knights and fair princesses. The reality involved lots of nasty things like poverty, casual violence, and disease. In addition, I enjoyed the characters in both story lines. Let's hear it for strong female leads! Also, I didn't find the &quot;future&quot; storyline as bumbling as many. Rather, it often provided a much-needed breather from the heavier historical fare. All in all, a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I liked this book, but there were too many loose ends. The paradoxes which prevent diseases from traveling through the net were too convenient and never adequately explained. What happens after Kirvin, who must be crawling with the plague, enters the net in the final chapter? I think the author deliberately ended the story where she did because the details of how Kirvin and the others are decontaminated ( the paradoxes?)would not bear close scrutiny.I was also troubled by the link between the modern plague and the church yard cemetary. The author implied a link but never developed it. The story would have been better if that plot line had been pursued.I,ve been critical of a book which I have rated highly, but I feel the book could have been a 10 if only a few loose ends were tied together."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Ignore the doomsters, especially the guy who misses the irony of criticising an inaccurate portrayal of the NHS some 50 years or so in the future, and read this book for yourself.This is a classic time travel novel, one that stands out for creating a compelling image of the past, and characters that you really get to care about. Whilst the part of the story set in the near future (2048) is weak, the most important part during the middle ages is superbly done. Ultimately this is a tragic novel, not surprising since the heroine accidentally travels to the middle ages when the black death is rife, yet it resonates with a wonderful humanity."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Just finished reading this after a coast-to-coast round trip, which seems to be the best way to digest this treatise... I agree with previous comments regarding the near future. It's as if this book were written in the 1960's by someone who would have no concept of the communications revolution. Thought it would have been cool if Roche had turned out to be a traveller from even further in the future who happened to cross paths with Kivrin. He would have recognized her origins from her modern English ravings while she was ill, and they could have worked together to aid those they cared about without upsetting the space-time continuum. I could see this being made into a movie assuming improvements to the year 2054 situations and a more satisfying ending."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Ms. Willis writes at a rarefied level, achieving a mastery of art and craft of which most writers can only dream. So it's little wonder that there are some readers who will simply never understand her genius. This is particularly true of &quot;Doomsday Book,&quot; since the subject matter is so challenging, the inevitabilities so hard to face (in regard to the characters' fates). But, clearly, the &quot;10's&quot; outweigh the &quot;3's&quot; every time--especially when it comes to the critics. And the Hugo Awards. And the Nebula Awards. Did I mention Ms. Willis has won more of those awards than anyone? That doesn't happen by accident. Your instincts (the &quot;10's&quot;) are the right ones."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I can't understand how so many people can hate this book; I thought it was one of the best I've ever read. Connie Willis reminds me very much of Jane Austen, combining wickedly comic minor characters with truly sympathetic major characters to produce a novel that is simultaneously hysterical and moving. She also gets her science right. The &quot;made-up&quot; science is internally consistent, and the biology and archaeology are correct. It's possible to predict where the modern plague came from based on the clues early on, although I didn't figure it out myself."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I thought I'd take a look at this book after hearing so much hype, but I really cannot see the reason it has received such praise! I mean, its readable, but not that great! The idea may be somewhat interesting, but the storytelling becomes somewhat irrtating at times (is this supposed to be suspense?)... OK, the characters are succesful to a certain extent, but nothing special. Oh, and the &quot;technical&quot; details are obviously imperfect, but that wasn't what really bothered me (just mentioned it in case you're interested).I probably enjoyed the last part more, because I read it on a transatlantic flight and it really helped me close my eyes a bit... But I did finish it (what do I get for this?)!!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Hello,Is Kate Winslet there?Yes, Kate, you were BORN to play Kivrin Engle in Doomsday Book!Yes, its another &quot;period piece&quot; but listen, there's a catch!This time you're playing a 21st century history student sent back in time to study the 14th century. But something goes wrong and instead of being sent back to 1320, you're sent to 1348 at the beginning of the Black Plague!Think 'Outbreak' meets 'Excalibur' !Its part mystery, and part science fiction thriller, yet it also has the twist of experiencing life in 14th century England.The book was great! Yeah, I'll sent a copy over to you right away. You'll love it!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Willis is a fantastically complex writer, but this is her tour de force. Practically every paragraph is filled with both surface and hidden meaning, which makes repeated reads just as rewarding. Though the book revolves around the Plague of 1348 as it hits England (as well as another fictional, futuristic plague), this is at its heart a Christmas story, and as such as inspirational as any inspirational fiction I've ever read. Minus the syrup, moralizing, or easy solutions.Brilliant!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"My sister Arlene turned me on to The Doomsday Book and I was blown away. I adore an author who does her/his research and Connie Willis is positively diligent in taking real history to weave a magical and believable story around. I bought my own copy and then filled my Amazon.com Wish List full of Connie Willis and began adding a new title to my cart with every order.If you are a picky reader who expects historical facts to be accurate even in a work of fiction then Connie willis will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"For the second time around, I am amazed by the character development in this book and Willis' ability to bring people and situations alive. I lost two nights sleep because I can not put this book down once I start. Although I understand why some authors don't go commercial, this is the one book that would be interesting as a movie (I have the actors picked out!) But then, in the next thought, I would be afraid to go see it since Hollywood ruins the essence of most books like this and is truly unable to leave it as it is. If you want to experience time travel as a reality, or understand the black plague as a part of history, this is the closest thing to it."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I agree with a number of the previous reviews -- the author does a GREAT job of providing details, especially in the 14th century section of the book. It's almost like a Connecticut Yankee, who happens to be a historian, intentionally returns to King Arthur's Court -- except she returns for real, to a small village instead of the king's court, there won't be any knights on bicycles riding to the rescue, no fortuitous eclipses, and all modern conveniences, except a hidden note taker, have been left at home.Willis' skill in putting the reader INTO a setting and making the reader CARE about events is like Stephen King's ability in that regard. There are enough mysteries and plot twists and red herrings and subtle humor to keep the reader happy. Yet, many of the modern characters, and a number of the 14th century characters, are fairly plain. This is understandable in part because reader's perspective in the 14th century half, although the book is written in the third person, is generally limited to the knowledge of the protagonist who is a brief \\"foreign\\" visitor.Yet it's more than that: the characters are given a personality and a role and they pretty much stick to that: this one is the kindly professor, that one is the pretentious academic prima donna. Even the protagonist is easily classified as the \\"kind-hearted, sensitive, and very dedicated student.\\" Aside from choosing this potentially dangerous research, she doesn't face any real difficult decisions about which action to take, or whom to help. She briefly wishes she could import modern medicine through the time portal into the village, but that thought isn't developed. (This would have violated the book's equivalent of a \\"prime directive\\" for time travel.)The medieval part of the book is most interesting: the villagers were facing the imminent death of themselves and most of the people they knew, from a cause they don't understand; while the modern plague causes some deaths, one of the major modern concerns is running out of toilet paper.I was sad to hear that the author's research on which were the common diseases in medieval Europe was lacking.While the length of the book allows Willis ample room to bring the reader into the setting, it was too long, especially in the modern half of the book. Not only is the paperback 578 pages, but Willis uses 43 lines of text per page, while most paperbacks use 28 to 32 lines per page: this is the equivalent of an 800-page book. It's still a moderately quick read because the plot is so engrossing, and it's SO tempting to start skimming when you get to the modern parts of the story. While the writing is consistently very good, it's too long. Definitely do NOT get the unabridged audio."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"\\"The Doomsday Book\\" was my introduction to Connie Willis, an author I have now placed thouroughly on my \\"Trusted\\" list. This is a long book, a dark book, and at times a fairly slow one. (This was, of course, exacerbated by the fact I listened to most of it on tape.) We spend quite a long time it what must really be described a nightmarish dream state in which no character of importance can seem to receive a single straight answer to his or her questions. This (along with some downright painfull discription of both the Flu and the Black Death in three varieties) got under my skin for a while, but then we'd pop out of the rut and get back into the good, interesting stuff. There's a lot of worthwhile insight on the persistance of human nature, how we deal with untenable situations, and the general population of every century with saints, scoundrels, fools, and innocents.Well worth the read - but do *read* it instead of listening to a recording. It will be a much more satisfying experience."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I've read this book over a dozen times, in two languages, and am still moved by it every time I read it. This story of Kivrin, a young university student in the near future in England, who becomes the first person to time travel to the 14th century, jumps between the 1300's and the near future. Yes, as many reviewers have noted, the futuristic portion of the book is somewhat weak and not nearly as interesting as those set in the fourteenth century, but the portions set in the middle ages make you forgive everything else.Kivrin arrives in the fourteenth century ill and confused. She is rescued and taken in by a family in a small village, and engaged to look after the two young daughters of the household. As she comes to know the people in the village, we come to care deeply about the family and the townspeople and their fate in an uncertain time. I've cried everytime I've read this book, and not in a cheap heart-string tugging way, but over the faith and humanity in the face of an ugly time, a message that is as timely as ever. Moreover, Ms. Willis' details about day-to-day life, including religion, medicine, and child-rearing, are fascinating and well fleshed-out.Get past the logical inconsistencies in the modern story. This is a much better book about the middle ages than the scientific gobbledy gook and swashbuckling of \\"Timeline,\\" and a great introduction to one of the worst periods and places in human history."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book is obviously meticulously researched. The detail that Ms. Willis puts into her writing is astounding. I was impressed with the depth of the characters.Kirvin is a history major at Oxford. She wants to go back to 1320 to &quot;research&quot; how people lived. Against the advise of some of her professors, she deeply prepares for her role--even giving herself a head injury to fit her cover story, and then she steps into the net.After she leaves, an unknown virus breaks out at Oxford. As the doctors and professors battle to save people's lives, the stories of these people are woven together with those of the time period Kirvin has traveled to. Nothing is as it seems. She was expecting to be able to follow her plan to completion, but it veers off course when she becomes deathly ill. She realizes then that the people who have taken her in are not just like the people in a text book or even a period novel--they are real people with real, everyday problems and feelings.I don't want to give away anything, but this book is worth a read. Some parts move slowly, but it does pick up at the end. If you pay attention, you can figure the mystery out before everyone else does. I would recommend this book to everyone. I just wish there was a sequel."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"All of the reviews seem to miss the underlying (and very dry) humor woven into the plot - be it the 14th century section or the 21st century.

The bell-ringers, Mrs. Gallstone (?? :-)) and the incredible interweaving of quotes and carol titles at the most appropriate moments. I personally found some of the supporting characters flat and not so well developed, and plot seemed to drag at first - with way too many repitious sections. I do not want to go into too much detail on specific characters, but many of them could have been more developed.The humorous parts were not to be missed."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I have to admit I was awed by the scope and depth of this book. The ideas and themes presented kept me in their grip for days. And though the setting and period are tragic, the tone of the book is hopeful. It doesn't leave you dispairing. Highly recommended. If you like this one, try Lincoln's dreams."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Yet another Connie Willis book that plods along, piling clever detail upon clever detail. Cleverness alone makes for tedious writing. As E.M. Forster commented in his &quot;Aspects of the Novel,&quot; 'The novelist who betrays too much interest in his own method can never be more than interesting.'I'm more than 300 pages into this book, still waiting for something to happen, and I still haven't found a character I can care about. It is emotion that really moves a story forward. Literature succeeds by depth, by going INTO the Human heart - and that is something Willis utterly refuses to do.Writers who want to stay at a superficial level substitute plot (suspense) for character. Think of Sheharazad - the desire to know &quot;what happens next&quot; keeps people awake at night. This &quot;and then, and then, and then&quot; style of writing is also what drives most bestsellers. (It's the kind of cotton candy writing that makes you keep turning the pages, but you feel cheated at the end when you realize that really there was nothing there to get your teeth into.) If that best-seller style is what Willis is aiming for, she's doing it wrong. Not only does she not include enough emotional depth to make you care, she also doesn't substitute enough suspense to make you forget you don't care.I liked her &quot;Bellwether,&quot; because it was short enough to sustain the narrowly developed characters, and was able to function as a lovely little thought experiment. But &quot;Bellwether&quot; is not really a novel, it's more like a novella. I gave up on &quot;What About the Dog&quot; after 100 pages of being bored to tears by her incessant cleverness.I keep hacking away at &quot;The Doomsday Book&quot;, hoping it will get better, but I am finding myself starting to skim whole paragraphs and pages, which is something I can't remember ever having done in my life before. I think this will be the last time I pick up a Willis book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is one great book. Don't get frightened away by SF category. I'm a hardcore SF reader, but this story has nothing to do with SF. But it is wonderfull.Timetravel is a normal thing in a near future. But it's nothing like Stargate or Dr.Who. Ok, it's situated in England, but that's all.Timetravel is a normal thing for historians to go on-site in the year of their interest. The &quot;drop&quot; the reader wil follow is bringing us to the 14 century. And off course something goes wrong. What? No spoiler here!The characters are great, you love mr. Dunworthy and Kirvin from the beginning, and Gillchrist.....yeah, typical guy.And the invention of Conny Willis is &quot;Slippage&quot;. A great way to handle the Timetravel-paradox. (but it could also take all the suspense away! ;-) )Anyway, this book keeps you up all night, so be warned."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I've been reading this book every year at Christmas since it first came out. I'm a huge fan of time travel fiction, but this book, combined with the human elements, and the lovely humour, is really everything I look for in a story. It completely engrosses me, each time I read it. And I find myself utterly moved, no matter that I already know what's going to happen. An amazingly touching, wonderful story."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I can't choose between this book and Gone with the Wind as my favorite book, but this one is great. I read it every year right before Christmas (if you've read it, you know why), and it keeps getting better. I'm not the type to get emotional over books easily, but the last part of it always gets me misty-eyed. The characters are so real that you feel you've met them, and then what they endure is so horrible that you feel every single page. My mom had never read any sci fi or fantasy before, but she loved this book so much that she now wants to try more of the genre."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I enjoyed the story tremendously but like the recent hit movie, Titanic, the Doomsday Book did more than just entertain me. It made me see history in a new way. In stead of just a steam of facts from a textbook it became stories of &quot;real&quot; people that affected &quot;real&quot; lives. The Doomsday Book made the Dark Ages come alive. It was still &quot;Dark&quot;, but now it was also a place where people cared, sarificed, loved, etc. I was touched by her story and I feel sure most would be also."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"One of the best SF novels I've read in years. The gamut of reviews on this book, some highly favorable and some the opposite, prove that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I am a hard SF fan and would not have predicted I would like this book, based on the reviews here, but I loved it. Any SF fan who hasn't read it owes him/herself a try. If you're not fascinated within 20 pages, put it aside. If you're like me and many others, you will not be able to put it down until you've finished it. A book with real heart."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I was surprised to see how polarized the opinions on this book were. Hard-core SF readers apparently hate it because of the TT aspects. Frankly, their long diatribes about how TT simply isn't possible are irrelevant. They just don't get it! Willis was not trying to develop a theory of physics, she was writing a novel.It's depressing that some people believe that for a book to be meaningful it must not describe anything that could not take place in the world as we know it."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I don't understand some of the negative reviews this book has received. It is by FAR my favorite sci-fi type book I have ever read. I loved the characters, and I couldn't want to see what would happen to Kivrin."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Hi Doomsday Book lovers, I love Doomsday Book so much,I am constructing a site just for it and its characters at http://www.angelfire.com/ca3/winterforest.html which is totally dedicated to this beautiful book. If you loved it as much as I do, then I hope my site is going to be satisfactory!For queries please email me ( Louise )Thankyou readers and Amazon!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is a very moving book. Yes, some of the characterizations of the modern day characters are sterotypical. Yes, the book starts out rather slow. I had heard these criticisms before I read this book. But don't let them prevent you from reading one of the best reads around. This book is richly detailed with period nuances that make you smell the stink and feel the hardships of medieval England. You will be drawn into this haunting time. This book has made a lasting imact on me. I read it over a year ago, and I still think of the pitifully described people often. I've never written an endorsement for a book, but I had to come back to pitch this. You'll be glad you bought it."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Connie Willis' best work in my opinion. The Black Death, a terrible trajedy is brought to modern readers like never before. Readers meet the actual people of Medieval times, the common people, not just the clergy and royalty of the history books. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Around six months ago I read Connie Willis' short story \\"Fire Watch\\". That story set me off on a path reading everything of hers I can find. It's hard to say if this is her best. It depends on what mood you're in.This book shares a universe w/ \\"To Say Nothing of the Dog\\", but you by no means need to read that book first. I do agree w/ the amazon recommendation that you get both of them together. These two books back to back must be one of the greatest joys you will ever get as a reader.One of the things that make Connie Willis my favorite writer is her dialog. Whether the character is man, woman, young, old, American, British, Australian, black, white, etc., the dialog comes off authentic. Actually, she writes British so well, I was really surprised to find out she was an American. What I have to say just comes down to this: She more than lives up to the hype. Whether you're a sci-fi fan or not, check this out. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Why do we read Speculative Fiction? The reason I read it is for great stories about wild possibilities - you know, the excitement of a really good \\"what if?\\" Doomsday Book has that punch, that \\"What if?\\" Here it is . . . what if a time traveler accidentally goes back to England during the time of the Plague and people in both the past and the present start getting sick and dying? This opens a whole realm of possibilities and problems of course. Did the plague actually come from the future and infect the past making it an enormous paradox? Did the plague from the past leap to the future and start its run anew?Connie Willis has a gift for characters and her main ones are wonderfully well-defined, alive in their actions and sympathetic for the reader. Kivrin, the historian who is thrust into the past and into the path of the plague, is a fantastic narrator who discovers horror and heroism in a small village where the fate of everyone rests in the hands of a humble priest.Why do we read Historical Fiction? The reason I read it is to experience the past through the telling of a great story - you know, the excitement of really being \\"there.\\" Again, this book satisfies that criteria through page after page of brilliant prose. Connie Willis did her research and more than any other account I've read, she made me experience the true devastation of the disease that nearly wiped out the population of Europe. It may have only killed around a half (wikipedia says 75 million) of the residents of the continent, but that's just because it didn't hit every town and every province. Where it did hit, survivors were rare.I don't cry, but tears came to my eyes several times while reading this book. Hats off to Ms. Willis for writing so powerfully.There have been a lot of complaints about the pacing and if you've read some of my reviews you'll know that I'm a stickler for action moving the plot along. But action isn't just running or fighting, sometimes action is in discovery and dialogue . . . and that's the action of Doomsday Book. The reader has to care about Kivrin. In fact the reader has to become Kivrin, and experience the Plague before the emotional impact can be felt, and that's what the action of this plot does for us . . . we experience life in the past, then illness, then death, and we never know if we're going to be the next to die.There have also been complaints that the storyline of the future isn't as strong as the story in the past. Well, to be frank, it's not supposed to be. The story is about Kivrin and we need to know what's going on in the future because it has the potential to impact Kivrin in many ways. For example, the simple question of whether she can ever be retrieved is paramount to the story. We, as readers, become more emotionally involved with Kivrin based on that knowledge and this is Kivrin's story after all. We also have to know the course of disease in the future for the same reason. Sure the future gets short-shrift on the character development, but how big of a book do you want? Connie Willis didn't write a multi-volume epic, she wrote a powerful and complete story. And she did it well.- CV Rick"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is an example of the kind of book that ensures you are never bored with it. There are two strong main plots, both of which tie together neatly and reasonably realistically. Both of them have at least some surprise, mystery, and suspense. Meanwhile, these plots tie in with several others, including toilet paper supplies, bell ringers, and an overprotective mother splendidly. This also acts to provide some humorous relief to a book that can desperately need it at times"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Once again, Connie Willis shows how well she researches a book before she writes it. Unfortunately, in this book, it appears she wanted to put too much of her research into it. For the most part, the book is gripping. But, as you get near the end, you start to notice that although your eyes are seeing a lot of words, nothing's really happening. First, in the book's &quot;present,&quot; there's really no emotional satisfaction with how things get resolved. Essentially, something happens that allows one of the protagonists to do what he's been trying to do for the last 400 pages or so. Secondly, in the book's &quot;past,&quot; you're pretty darn sure what's going to happen, but it takes forever to get there. Also, once it happens, Willis spends far too much time getting to the point where everything comes together. But, I think the biggest disappointment was that she ends the book too early (yes, I know that seems to contradict my &quot;long and drawn out&quot; comment). I can't say too much here, but just a few more footsteps and a couple of conversations to bring everyone up-to-date would have given the ending a better feel. For the most part, I enjoyed the book. But, it's nowhere near as good as &quot;To Say Nothing of the Dog.&quot;"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I agree with many of the comments I've read about this book being overlong, the characters (especially the &quot;modern&quot; Brits) being largely uninteresting, the sequences in 2054 being boring, etc. etc., but . . . . the description and handling of the plague, the unexpected language difficulties and the scenes in 14th century England somehow were so compelling to make up for the other flaws and make this a definite recommendation. The early scenes where Kristin can't interpret what people are saying (nor they her) was nothing less than chilling. What I can say about this book, unlike most, is that it sticks in your mind for days and weeks afterwards. A truly unique novel."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is an interesting book and the characters are certainly vivid and well portrayed. But in the end, even with time travel, I don't think this is really science fiction. It's a story of people coping with adversity; a deadly virus and the plague. More than anything it portrays life in an English village in the 14th century and vividly describes people getting violently ill. Watch ER instead if that excites you.I'm surprised that it won the Nebula award. A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court has more science in it than this, and is a lot more enjoyable to boot."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is one of the elite novels that won both Hugo and Nebula awards, there are not many of those and they are generally very good books though you and I can always find some titles to be undeserving, c'est la vie. Before starting on reading this novel I looked around Goodreads and Amazon for some consensus of opinion among other readers. I found the prevailing opinion to be on the positive side but it is always interesting to note the negatives also, in case the reviewers hate the same things I do. Among the unfavorable reviews a common criticism seems to be that this book is boring. While I don't quite agree with this sentiment I understand it. We are bored by different things and have different levels of tolerance for certain kinds of plot or pacing.While I enjoy time traveling stories I tend to prefer those with a lots of paradoxes, going back and forth, becoming your own granddad, causing a massive rift in the space time continuum, that sort of thing. My favorite examples of this would be The Man Who Folded Himself by David Gerrold and the short story \\"All You Zombies\\" by Robert A. Heinlein. Any way, just going to one time period and getting yourself in trouble because you are just too damn modern doesn't really do it for me. So Mark Twain's \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" does not do much for me and \\"Timeline\\" by Michael Crichton is possibly the worst time traveling book I have ever read (I like other Crichtons though).Having rambled on thus far I have to confess that I like this book a lot (and I can't italicize it enough!). Connie Willis' prose is nice and smooth, it reminds me of Lois McMaster Bujold's prose style, with just the right amount of elegance and witticism without sacrificing clarity. The novel is immediately accessible from page one, which is always a bonus. This book is clearly character driven, though there are a few clever scifi concepts like the non-mechanical translating device recorder implant etc. Also, as this is generally a dark novel, the occasional interjections of humor is very welcome.The main character Kivrin is a wonderful creation, by the end of the novel I feel like this is a real person I have come to know very well. She is courageous, compassionate, intelligent and vulnerable, Ms Willis certainly puts her through the wringer with this one, poor lass. Back to the \\"boring\\" allegation, there is some pacing or progression problem with this book, at times characters seem to be running around circle not advancing the plot very much. The search for Kivrin's entry point to medieval time also gets a bit tiresome. That said, whether you will find this book intolerably boring will very much depend on how invested are you in the characters and their plight. I am totally sold on them.A very interesting question that the novel raised in my mind is since what happened in the medieval time has already happened as far as we in the present time are concerned, all the characters from that period have been dead ages ago, so does it matter to the visiting time traveller if they die or how they die? I think it does because when they are with you they are just people."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I read this book when it was first published, in 1993, or shortly thereafter in 1994. Not quite sure exactly when, but at the time, the book struck a chord in me, and I had vague memories of it. So when I saw this pop up on my Kindle's recommended list, I decided to check it out again. The number of negative reviews had me scratching my head, because I remembered the book being rather enjoyable, but almost 20 years can affect one's memory.Either way, I don't have my printed version any more, so I decided why not, and just ordered it for my Kindle. Thankfully my memory isn't as bad as I thought, because I again enjoyed this book tremendously.A number of the characters are one-dimensional. But then again, they're not major characters. They're background filler. The mob in the movies that mumbles \\"yada yada yada\\". I certainly didn't expect any character development for these characters, so I'm not surprised there wasn't any. The major character does develop over the course of the book.The ending was a bit rushed, altho I didn't mind the use of the \\"locator\\" device. I guess people are so inured to technology they've forgotten about an ancient device called a \\"magnetic compass\\". I see no reason why an electronic compass couldn't be interfaced to a small screen to provide a \\"breadcrumb trail\\".The first reading of this book impressed me to the point where I wanted to find more about the era depicted. I found two mainstream books, which I still have. One is Ziegler's \\"Black Death\\", and the other is Gottfried's \\"Black Death\\".The Kindle version appears to be an OCR'ed version of printed material, as there are a number of obvious scanning errors that could have easily been corrected."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is one of the most remarkable novels of any kind that I have ever read, and a truly stunning piece of time-travel/historical/science fiction.I started readingDoomsday Bookbecause I'd read Connie Willis'sBlackoutearlier in this year and was anxiously awaiting [book:All Clear]. I knew that DOOMSDAY BOOK was a Hugo and Nebula winning and I knew that Connie Willis was an outstanding writer, so I figured the book was going to be a good one.It was a remarkably good one. I've come across very few books that are both page-turners, and emotionally jarring as well. There have been even fewer books that have moved me to tears multiple times. But this book was one of them. Connie's portrayal of the middle ages during the plague is brutal, and made more so by her impeccable ability to make the reader feel for the characters as if you know them, as if you are there with them experiencing the horrors. You almost wonder if Connie has the ability to travel back in time and used that ability to form the research for this novel.Everything about the work is impressive, from the description and historical details, to the humor she injects, to the style of her writing and the care and effort she clearly puts into it."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is a great vacation read, very fun, great storytelling. Not just Sci Fi, good characters and emotion."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I'm having a very hard time figuring out what I should say about this book. It isn't anywhere near what I usually like from a Sci-Fi author, and yet it was so well written and so engaging that I have to give it a full 5 stars. If you are all out of books from your favorite Sci-Fi author, then give it a try. It helps if you enjoy history fiction and the Middle Ages, but even if you don't, this is worth a try. They say it starts slow, but toward the end I was reading so fast I had to stop myself from skipping paragraphs to find out what happened next. It deserves the awards it received. You will be a better fan of Sci-Fi for reading it."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I have read this book many times over the years. I find the premise fascinating. As a psychologist I really enjoy the characters and how they interact and develop over the course of the story. I also enjoy reading about how Kivrin adjusts to her time travel and the strange people and circumstances she finds in the world she finds herself in. It is so different from what she has been taught to expect. It is a fascinating story.The story back in modern day Oxford is also fascinating. While it is set 35 years in our future, it is not the world we now know will exist. For one thing, no mobile phones. Their communication abilities, now, seem quite clumsy. It is interesting to read about what amounts to an alternate reality of the future.As an academic with a Ph.D. it fascinates me to read about these two worlds. Both are very different from what one would expect. Both are well developed and quite interesting, This book keeps calling me back and I am never disappointed."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Best book I have read in a long, long time. I couldn't put it down. I am puzzled greatly by some of the negative reviews. Kivrin's story spoke to me and I hope it speaks to the rest of you."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I don't know, maybe I'm crazy. But I'm always thinking of time travel and quantum computers and all this stuff that my wife makes fun of me for. In order to satisfy my cravings, I read this book. It is awesome! It's what you want. It's all we geeks want, plausible science-fiction. That's all! We want good characters whom we love, whom we look forward to meeting again at night with our e-book readers. And I loved everyone in here, even the bell-ringing pastor from the middle ages. We also want to learn things. There is more history and education in this book than our history teachers would have realized. It's an emotional and moving experience. It makes you breathe out and say \\"finally! science-fiction that's exciting, fresh and adventurous.\\" This book was obviously written by a true professional writer who gets it and has the talent to back it up. And I love her cover for the time paradoxes, it was so good that it made me realize that it really could go \\"that way\\" in the book. Any sci-fi fan needs to pick this up."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Astoundingly good. I didn't want it to end. Gripping, touching, comical, with characters you come to adore.

I see that Connie Willis has written other books about these time-travelling historians and I will be reading them all!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Had this book for many a year sitting on my bookshelf but never read it. Thanks to the Kindle I finally got to it. Hot a hard scifi book but good neverless. Going to read the rest of her time travel books."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Connie Willis takes on the daunting challenge of entering into the cultural context of the Black Death. She handles the effort with grace, power, and sensitivity. Her characterizations are simple and profound. The inclusion of the character Colin is insightful and effective. His youthful energy, enthusiasm, and penchant for breaking the rules provides just the right balance to the more weighty and tragic themes. Willis does not cut any corners in describing the reality of death and disease, but she manages to not let these passages dominate the overall trajectory of the story. Walking with Kivrin, we see the potential power of a single life lived by self-sacrifice. It is a novel with depth and beauty, one of the best."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I've loved this novel ever since it was published. First read it when I was eleven, and twenty years later, it's just as powerful. Highly recommended if you love time travel, the Middle Ages or even just a story about how people respond to earth-shattering changes."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This was a very compelling read with great twists, lovely prose, and an ability to take the reader to a realistic view of how life may have been in the 1300s. The only problem I had was that the book takes place in 2050. It was written in 1993. This means it was written before the pervasiveness of the internet and mobile phones, so it's a bit of a stretch to read this in 2012 and accept that the characters are as isolated as they are from one another, they are dependent on land lines that frequently do not work because the system is overburdened, and there is no way to get in touch with someone unless they are near said landline. As connected as we all are to one another in 2012, some of the book's central plot devices no longer work.Nevertheless, a fascinating read."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"** spoiler alert **A day after reading this and I'm still mourning the death of Father Roche...I thought this book was perfect just like it is. The story starts at the lab where historian Kivrin will travel back in time to the 1320. Her mentor, Mr. Dunworthy, suspects there is something wrong and advises her she should not time travel but of course, she does, and all things break lose both in the past time and present time.There were several things I enjoyed about the book: the fact that there was an epidemic and how they were dealing with it (made me think of '12 Monkeys'), the way all the characters from both past and present were connected, the way the author took you step by step through the ordeal so that it felt like we were really there trying to figure out where/when Kivrin was and how to make sense of things when nothing does.I think the emotions evoked by the story of this book will stay with me for a long time."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I loved this book, and read its 500+ pages in 3 days (very unusual for me). Not your average science fiction. The future part of the book is entertaining even in the midst of pandemic and tragedy. The past part of the book is a delightful (not to be confused with &quot;happy&quot;) mixture of history, substance, and cold, hard reality. I found myself in tears at the loss of characters I'd grown very attached to or at turns of events that led the story off the beaten path of happy-endingness or anticipated problem resolution; in chuckles and grins over some of the basics of human nature which exist no matter what the century; and in laughter over the sometimes-absurd antics of people who could easily pass for my next-door neighbors, college dorm buddies, family members, supervisors, best friends, or church members. The story's believable, the characters very &quot;real&quot; and well-developed, the situations realistic... these combined with the science fiction elements, made for an extraordinary piece of reading. I will no doubt own several well-worn copies of this book before I turn 30."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This wasn't a perfect book but a very good one. Although there were a few nagging mistakes, the story telling was so good I willingly suspended disbelief and went along for the ride. There were a few times I thought I knew what was happening or was certain the direction the plot would take and I was, happily, wrong every time. This is the type I story you just love to talk over with other people...and there is no way to tell you why without giving some of it away, so get reading! And especially read and enjoy this book before Hollywood gets hold of it and appends a love story, a happy ending, and/or Julia Roberts."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"My Confession: I am not a science fiction person. My father is. He's a nut. Being the only other bibliophile in my family, he's always giving me new sci fi books to read. Sometimes, I'll get through the first three chapters. Sometimes.When he handed me Doomsday Book three years ago, for the first time I was glad for his relentless reading assignments. This is truly one of the most affecting books I've ever read. It's not happy, so don't read this if you're already depressed, or if you just want a light read. It took me about three days to get over this book once I finished.Right now I'm in school to be an epidemiologist, a scientist who studies epidemics. At least once a year I try to re-read Connie Willis's book to remind myself that all the statistics I look at are real people, and scared. I would recommend this book to anyone, but espeically to someone who normally doesn't like Science Fiction."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I honestly couldn't put this book down, and finished it in a week despite it's 578-page length. Sure, it was really drawn-out long and the ending sequence was way too abrupt, but Dunworthy and Kivrin both lead two very, very compelling plotlines. I love the way that Connie Willis wrote the epidemic parts in the future half of the book -- it starts out slowly and really small, and eventually explodes into a full-out epidemic. If you don't like Middle Ages, the Black Plague, or depressing stories, don't read this. If you do, read it! NOW!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I loved &quot;Doomsday Book&quot;; however, if you're expecting plain science-fiction, you might be better off looking for something else. &quot;Doomsday Book&quot; is more historical fiction than science fiction, but well worth a look in any case."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"ALthough there are quite a number of people considered this book a miserable SF, but I have enjoyed it. I guess part of it reflects the loneliness inside me, so I was able to relate it a little. Like &quot;The Snow Queen&quot;, reading this book has built up some &quot;alienness&quot; landscape inside my head as I read about the future and the dark ages. (And I guess I could recommand reading this book during your winter holiday. It should add some mood to it as you read through it. After all, it does for me.) :)"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"A story so wonderful I've seldom read before. It made me feel like I was there in this VERY bad time of human history. Is it SF or fantasy? No, it's better. A woman from the future in a medieval time, with no superpowers, that's how more stories should be written. It has times of happiness, hope and when I came to one part of the story tears were running down my face. At that moment I couldn't read it any further for a couple of days. When I finally closed the book, I wished there would be a sequel to it."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is a wonderful book. The historical detail is fascinating and as for the genre debate, I can think of other SF-shelved books that, similarly, don't have a lot of technology in them.

I also enjoy more high-tech SF such as Red Mars and Fire Upon the Deep that have been mentioned in conjunction with this book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"It seems to me, the vast majority of the complaints given by the 1-3 star raters have to deal with the fact that they were expecting robots, and unrealistic technology-magic. It almost makes me ashamed to read scifi. Anyway, &quot;The Doomsday Book&quot; is endowed with a gripping story, lovable characters, with a deeply moving culmunation of plot. Kirvin's narrative brings fully alive the horror and fear surrounding the black death as many historicals I've read have not. The storyline in the future is, I admit, not nearly so interesting. Read it if you like a good book. Skip it if you want the usual spotty sci-fi narrative."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"First, many of the reviews below contain spoilers. If you haven't read the book but might, be forewarned! Now for my FAQ, minus the spoilers.Q. Is it really sci-fi? A. Any work that is based on speculative science is science fiction. Technology that doesn't exist today (and likely never will) is integral to the plot. It's sci-fi!Q. Were the voters wrong who gave this book a Nebula and Hugo award? A. Of course not! For my money, this is the greatest work in the genre. I wasn't surprised by the Nebula. However, I was by the Hugo. I didn't expect a &quot;low tech&quot; book like this one to be so well received.Q. Will you need a box of tissues next to you when you read it? A. Well, I did. It is without any doubt the most emotionally powerful book in this genre and ranks 2nd on my all time list for most tears shed. Emotionally sensitive readers be forewarned!Q. Is this one of the more impressively well researched novels that I have ever read? A. For my money, yes. Ms. Willis's five years of work in the libraries have paid off completely!Q. Is this a book that would appeal to those who normally don't like sci-fi? A. Absolutely, yes! I would recommend this book to almost everyone.Q. What about all these people who hate this book? A. Well, they have a right to their opinion. However, I strongly disagree with them and am somewhat baffled why they dislike this book so much. I can possibly understand one person I know who &quot;hated&quot; it because it was so incredibly painful for him to read. I will warn you that portions of this book are very tragic. If you can't tolerate tragedy, don't read this book.Q. How many times did I have to put this book down because I was so emotionally moved I needed some time to recover before continuing? A. OK, I don't remember exactly, but I think it was four or five times.Q. Am I a sci-fi &quot;nut&quot; who gives five star reviews to nearly everything he reads? A. Absolutely, no! I am a very critical reader who hasn't fo! und much sci-fi that I have truly liked. Many of the &quot;classics&quot; in the genre that have brought rave reviews I don't particularly care for.Q. OK, do you like this book because it's &quot;low tech&quot;? A. No, it liked it because it's a great book. I have thoroughly enjoyed some well written &quot;hi tech&quot; books, like &quot;Red Mars&quot;.Q. Should YOU read this book? A. Definitely, I give it my highest recommendation!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"_The Doomsday Book_ is the dark flip side to Willis' _To Say Nothing of the Dog_. Where the latter is a lighthearted romp, this _The Doomsday Book_ is a dark trudge through historical comparisons of medieval and near-future interpretations of death and disease.However, theses thematic elements, while present and wonderfully rendered, do not get in the way of the driving plot and sympathetic characterizations. Willis is a world-builder extraordinaire, convincingly reproducing two distinct and flawlessly real depictions of Cambridge, one future, and one distant past.If you pay attention to the prologue, you will know how this books ends. Nevertheless, Willis maintains exquisite tension throughout the novel, making the protagonists' discoveries all the more poignant as the realization of what is happening dawns in each of her characters.Connie Willis is the science fiction writer I recommend to those who say they don't like science fiction. The praise that has been heaped upon _The Doomsday Book_ is thoroughly well-deserved."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book has edged out Ender's Game as the best s.f. book I have ever read. The details are amazing. Whether her description of life in the 14th century is true or not, you'll never forget it."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book really isn't sci-fi - it uses time travel as a way of introducing the middle ages. Anyone expecting technical marvels will be disappointed. Instead this is a very solid, emotional story. I'm a 29-yo male computer engineer and I almost cried at the end. The lack of technical detail didn't bother me. In fact, it was refreshing because so many sci-fi authors try to describe tech in great detail and just end up showing how little they really understand. This book is about the plague, carries a great many details of the 1300's and is a story that educates and involves the reader. The characters are most certainly not cardboard - people who say that just read this book for the wrong reasons. My only nitpick is that the very end (the rescue) was too predictable, and I skimmed most of it because I knew what was going to happen. Perhaps the part I liked the most wa sthe brutal reality of things not going the way of the main characters in either time periods. I've had days like that myself."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is book is really two stories, One that is not really adequate, the future. And one that is so powerful that it makes the story unforgettable, the plague. Attempts at comic relief are rather woeful, and she can be as manipulative as Spielberg. But the power of the desperation in Village is palpable. I have given this book to friends. A keeper. It took me a couple of weeks to get over it."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book was a real page-turner for me, but not just in the sense of &quot;chewing gum for the eyes.&quot; The book is well-written and logical, despite the fact it deals with time-travel. I even used it as a text for a college honors class this fall, and the students had the same reaction I did. The characters are sympathetic and well-drawn. The intricacies of the plot unfold as in a good murder mystery. The details of the two centuries (21st and 14th) are well-researched and accurate. I'm thinking a certain author whose new book on the same idea is receiving extensive media coverage should have taken lessons from Connie Willis!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I am plowing my way through all the Hugo award winners right now and after the sublime lterary quality of works such as Ursula K LeGuin's &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; and Miller's &quot;Canticle for Lebowitz&quot; I am appalled at this choice. The character's are flimsy and the plot, oh dear. Time travel always has it's problems but the solution to avoiding paradoxes here is something a ten year old could have dreamed up. A major portion of the book is spent trying to locate a time traveller in the past, and all the slapstick events that prevent them from doing so. The main character who is claimed as a brilliant student does the most inept job as an historian. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is a good book. I enjoyed the story. Its very rich in details. Willis does not miss anything in terms of laying out the characters and their personalities. And there are a lot of secondary characters who offer some seasoning. My biggest problem with this book is how tedious it can become. Some of the conversations and interactions are unnecessarily long and involved. Key parts of the story are introduced very late. And the first part of the book spends a LOT of time setting up all the people and who they are.The book basically goes back and forth between \\"now\\" and Kivrin in 1348. The \\"now\\" story (which is actually 2055 or 2155, not sure) details the efforts of Kivrin's professors and colleges to rescue her while dealing with the outbreak of a virus. The 1348 story details Kivrin's acclimation to the time period and learning that she is in 1348 and not 1320 like she thought.It takes a really long time to get to the key plot points. And while the foreshadowing is good, its very long winded. This book could have been cut in half from 550 pages to 250 and still been a good story. There are a lot of unnecessary conversations and consternations.The ending, while not surprising, is sad. It gives the book a satisfying emotional punch. Frankly, Book 3 (the final of the \\"books\\" in the novel) is the strongest. The plot progresses at a decent clip. Book 1 and 2 are outright boring at times. There is way too much setup and exposition about insignificant details.A worthy read, just a bit dull at times."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I found the book to be, in one word, boring.The plot doesn't move anywhere, sentences and scenario repeat themselves over the same chapter more than once.The thought of going to church (as one of the characters decides to do), takes more than 10 pages to happen, as she contemplates on whether to do it, or not and then again whether to do it or not, and then again whether to do it or not, and then something happens so she thinks it over AGAIN.WowGoing through 60% of the book, and starting to use the next button looking for the \\"spoken word\\" rather than the thought processes the characters go through makes me wonder if there is even a plot here or just \\"day-to-day\\" actions taking place here.I would say skip this book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Doomsday Book almost drove me crazy. Because Willis' characterization was so strong, I kept plugging away at her first book in her series covering the University of Oxford time traveling academics. But what made me several times wish to abandon the book was the excruciatingly slow plot. The entire story line of the book could be summarized in a brief paragraph. But it is the fascinating characters and their relationships, in addition to the mind-numbing catastrophe that was the Black Death, that makes Willis' book so compelling. Ultimately, it is love that drives the text: the young historian Kivrin who comes to love and cherish the little girls she cares for in the 14th century, the wonderful relationship between young Colin and Mr. Dunworthy, and the love that drives the entire novel - the dogged commitment that Mr. Dunworthy has to bring his young student Kivrin back from the Middle Ages. For these reasons Willis' book merited both Hugo and Nebula wins. But the joy of the book is something the reader has to earn. If there had been a bit more plot or if the plot that's there had moved somewhat faster, this book would have easily merited five stars and have moved me to have read all of Willis' works. As it is, I'm hesitant to attack another plodding though fascinating tome."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is probably the best time-travel novel I've ever read, as well as a convincing evocation of 14th century England during the Black Death. The heroine Kieran from our near-future when time-travel is possible at first has to deal with the limitations even intensive immersion in the 14th English history and culture plus a handy implanted translator do not quite work in the real everyday world of the mid 14th century. The novel predictable turns dark when Kieran discovers she has actually traveled a few years later than the time set and is soon is caught up in a small village dealing with the Black Death with a unlooked for personal involvement with the people she has met and forged friendships with some that changes forever her scholarly outlook of the past.In her own time, university staffers in the time-travel project, not only have to figure out their mistake in the time coordinates so Keiran can return, but deal with a pre-Black Death virus(it really existed)that Keiran unknowingly brought back from an excavation site dating from the early 14th century that early 21st century people have little or no resistance to.Even though this book was published over 15 years ago and I've read it and re-read it(getting the 15th anniversary edition because my paperback is worn from reading and lending), it is relevant to 2009 in view of today's reaction to a possible, but still not real pandemic of the swine flu versus the very deadly Black Death that killed millions.Can't wait for Connie Willis' \\"All Clear\\" which will hopefully publish by year's end."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Connie Willis' Doomsday Book is one of my favorite books of all time. This is something my young adult children can't understand--there is too much sickness and death for them and they think it's a depressing book. But for me, the compelling characters and their concern for each other is redemptive in the midst of both the Black Death of the past and a pandemic in the future. I love the characters, the story and the writing. It is Willis at her best. It is sci fi at its best. I highly recommend it to anyone who can stomach graphic stories about illness."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Well-dressed as a sci-fi/historical fiction novel, this story is actually one which looks at faith and the human condition. The book is a little slow to get started but once in about 100 pages you'll never put it down. The 14th century characters dealing with the Black Death are as modern and poignant as any in contemporary fiction. As the disease progresses, even the time-traveling 21st century student is left awestruck by her inability to save one village. The moving and desperate story of the traveler's account of the events of 1348 brought on tears more than once. All at once, the book is an examination of faith and the continuity of crisis and death which links all centuries. I was deeply affected by this book and I found it difficult to not to get caught up in the unimaginable horror of the largest biomedical disaster of all time."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"If you like time travel and want to learn something (the research into this book was phenomenal) this is the one for you. It has it all- romance, action, intrigue, sorrow and even humor. In a not-so-distant England it seems things have not changed - bad phones (the cell phone would have changed the story dramatically), bad food, dreary, rainy weather, etc. As in many of these tales there are actually two stories - the \\"real\\" story of the time traveler and the other of events in the \\"current\\" time while they are gone. Although they were not quite balanced, they were well done. The \\"current\\" story lacks is a counterpoint to the time travel story - humor vs seriousness, modern vs old, sanitation vs dirt, medicine vs myth.Kivrin, a student, transforms herself (thru much hard work) into a maiden of the 14th century. She learns the language(s), the customs, how to sew, how to eat, how to dress - whatever could be gleamed from books of that time (and there were not many). They are careful to place her in 1320, almost three decades before the Black Plague. But of course, something goes wrong - in this case a wild flu that befuddles the technician and poor Kivrin ends up in 1348, the year the plague reaches England. She herself was sick upon arrival and has no memory of exactly where she arrived which also happens to be the pickup point.She is taken to a local family for care. Her tales of the sheer grinding awfulness of everyday life were vivd and should cure any fool from talking about the \\"good old days\\" prior to industrialization. People literally lived with the elements - the animals, the snow, the rats, the refuse. Their conditions make our public housing seem like a Saddam palace. Yet there were two rays of light: Agnes, a little girl in the house and Father Roche, the illiterate, humble and devout priest of the village. He saw Kirvin when she arrived, seemingly out of nowhere and assumed she was a heavenly traveler. The poignant ending is pure cliche but her interaction with the priest hits hard. My grade - A"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book is not perfect. There are too many characters introduced, too much technical detail for my taste, and takes too long to get to the point in some places.Nevertheless, I am so glad I stuck with it. The ending made it all worthwhile. It's indeliably stamped upon my consciousness. I can still feel it. The raw, intense emotion. The gritty reality. I WAS THERE! I met those characters. They were real. I felt their pain, their anguish. And I will never forget it.This book touched my soul in a deeply profound way.I can't say that this book was fun. But I feel incredibly enriched having read it. It's in my top 5 books of all time, in terms of how much it affected me."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely - for the most part because I got very attached to the characters. The descriptions were vivid (extremely so at times, especially when the author described in great detail the effects of the plague), and I found the plot fast moving and completely engrossing. Time travel was very well implemented in this book. Time travel techniques were discussed in detail, and explained thoroughly. I also loved the way the author paralleled the 21st century with the 14th century. Each character in one century has a parallel character in the other century.My only problem with the book was the occasional [typical] character. Mrs. Gaddison was very one-dimensional - the typical busy body, annoying, and overprotective woman. William was a womanizer, and nothing else. Imeyne was the disapproving old woman, constantly looking for something to be angry about, someone to blame. And Colin, the [typical] kid, was constantly sucking on his candy (and I mean constantly), and using words like: \\"necrotic\\", and \\"apocalyptic\\".The writing style worked really well in this book. At times, I felt the author was writing specifically for British readers, however, on occasion using terms I was unfamiliar with, but which I knew a British reader would instantly pick up on. (Example: anytime someone hung up the phone, the person was said to \\"ring off\\", instead of simply \\"hang up\\").Overall, I found the book to be a fast read, and an engrossing tale. The main theme was the devastation people have to endure in any century, and how humans persevere, and survive incredible hardship. Definitely a worthwhile read for those intrested in the concept of time travel and the idea of experiencing an extremely trying time in human history."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"The Doomsday Book is set in the future, when time travel is a frequent practice for scientific study. A daring young college student named Kivrin travels back in time to the period of the Black Plague. I was expecting this book to be about castles, kings, queens, maybe even a dragon or two, but not so. The activities of the Middle Age characters are very realistic, and extremely detailed. I felt as though I was really there, thanks to Connie Willis' excellent characterization, and easy-to-follow plot. I recommend this book to any sf fan, or anyone wanting to learn more about the Middle Ages."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"First, this book is way too long, considering that, in fact, nothing much happens during all those pages. I agree with those who complained about the pacing. The future parts were irritating and the characters, especially that horrible old woman whose name I can't remember, were quite unrealistic. In reality, I think people, even the medical personality, would be more helpful and understanding in that kind of a situation. The difficulties the Oxford people had seemed quite... well, artificial.The medieval parts were much better, though I'm, of course, not a history expert. Anyway, they seemed realistic and down-to-earth in a good way. Kivrin was probably the only believable &quot;modern&quot; character in the book, and her relations with the village people were described cleverly. I could feel sympathy for Agnes, the priest and all those others; their fate really touched me. The end was anti-climactic in a way, but definitely better than some made-up epic final with no sensible meaning. Willis could keep up the atmosphere right to the end. Points for that."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"The cover of the book, calls itself a tour de force. I could think of less polite ways of saying it, but the best I can do is tour de farce. The book is simply poorly written. The genre is science fiction. However, to be effective, the story needs to be credible. This is not. A real must miss for any lover of SF."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Kivrin is a history student in Oxford in the not-too-distant future. She has spent a year getting ready for a field trip to Oxfordshire in 1320 to study the Middle Ages before the Black Death. She has her inoculations, she has an implanted language decoder, she has trained herself in various aspects of medieval life such as spinning, etc. What could possibly go wrong?In a word, lots. Oxford in this not-too-distant future is in a world where epidemics are feared like - well - the plague. And an epidemic starts to raise its ugly head just when Kivrin is being transported to 1320. The technician setting the time machine knows something has gone wrong, but unfortunately he is one of the first victims of this epidemic, and collapses before he can inform the history faculty members of what exactly is wrong. Kivrin herself arrives in the Middle Ages with a seriously bad case of ... something that she doesn't know what it is.She is rescued and stays with a family of &quot;contemps&quot;, where she can closely study medieval life and in particular, the festive season around Christmas. But this is no ordinary Christmas, because it is NOT 1320. It is 1348, the year that the Black Death came to Oxfordshire at Christmas time.Oxford in the 21st century, meanwhile, has been cordoned off and with all the cases of an unknown and deadly virus, nobody is available to check the time machine and find out what went wrong with Kivrin's &quot;drop&quot; until very, very late.This is one of the finest books that I have read for a while. Descriptions of people, motivations and events are little short of stunning, and the narrative is utterly believable - even allowing for time machines and implanted decoders. The simultaneous epidemics in Oxford in the 21st century and Oxfordshire in 1348 are very well played out, and the sense of anxiety once the reader has been informed that &quot;something&quot; is wrong with the drop doesn't diminish with the several hundred pages it takes to find out what the &quot;something&quot; is - to the contrary.It is a gem of a book, finely crafted. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Like a few other readers who reviewed this book, I ended up reading it shortly before Christmas, which was an odd experience. I think Connie Willis' basic premise for this book is ingenious--time travel with technology that is still dependent on humble human beings to operate it, parallels between the Middle Ages and our supposedly non-superstitious, logical world, and the ageless power of human love. On the surface it is also written in simple language and the &quot;modern&quot; parts of the story sometimes stuck me as simplistic and silly, although I think that may be part of her intention. The &quot;time travel&quot; sections were almost painful to read. The inexorable progress of the plague through the village and its devestation of human live, civilization, and culture was harrowing. There were times when I wanted to stop reading, which rarely happens for me, but I stuck with it because it felt important to stay with the characters. In a culture that thinks itself impervious to disaster but is currently threatened by AIDS and mad cow disease, which are just as sinister and potentially devastating as the plague for the Middle Ages, this book brings the fragility of human being to the forefront."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Yeah, yeah. I know many people were amazed by the character-portraiting in this book. I wasn't, but that's not the point. The point is, if you want to write a book you have to think of a story. This book has none, only a &quot;situation&quot; that is made clear in the first pages. Read on the next 500 or so pages, but do not expect anything else (oh, yes, except more and more endless repetations of the same &quot;comic&quot; conversations taking place in the future - is this the part which is intended to be a comic relief? Jesus!)"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I really was disappointed with this book. It won the Hugo and Nebula? It must have been an off year. It was HUGE and went NO WHERE for Pages on end! I got to page 300+ wondering if anything was ever going to happen. Snooooze..From a literary standpoint, too many of the characters were one-dimensional. This got to be really old, especially since the writer seems to have no editor looking over her shoulder to mention \\"oh you did that bit with the shrewish bible-reading mother already -- three times\\".From a sci-fi standpoint, I almost threw the book against the wall on multiple occasions. The author spent *page* after *page* having people discuss their inability to get ahold of folks easily. Cell phones just ceased to exist. But lord knows we got a time machine over in the lab cause that's *easy*! The guy fishing some where in Scotland? Didn't have a cell phone. The main fellow in the modern age - never had a cell phone or an answering machine. Obviously when they created the non-paradox-creating time machine that can send folks back to 1348, they must have caused all the cell phones and answering machines to just blow up.So essentially, the author did alot of research on the plague in england and decided to create a magic time machine to get someone back there so the environment could be described in vivid detail. That was the whole purpose of the book because nothing else really happens.Oh, and did anyone else notice that the fellow fishing in Scotland never did come back home? Or even get mentioned again? He just disappeared. The poor man is probably still trapped there in Scotland even now. Someone should call him. Oh wait, we can't, that's right."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I purchased this book (The Doomsday Book by Connie Willis) in hardback form several years ago and to date have read it three times and have since purchased it in audio book form two years ago and have listened to it once, and two years ago tried to get it for my Kindle, an (original Kindle E Book first year edition) and at that time it was not available, so I requested Kindle to offer it in E Book format which I was pleased to find out three nights ago 7-21-11 that it is now available.

Connie Willis can write and write well, but the essence of a good book, story, is missing. Also this book ranks low, low, low on the originality scale. To those readers who hold this up as the best book they've ever read: Read more."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I had heard so many good things about this author that after I finally read it I was frankly dumbstruck at how bad I thought this book was. Initially I enjoyed the historical part of the book but there was absolutely no dramatic tension to be found anywhere. It often felt as though I were reading two stories, one in the &quot;present&quot; and the other in the past that were related by nothing more than the attempts to bring the girl back. I didn't understand what the point was of the emergency in the present and what it had to with what was happening during the black plague. The whole read was ultimately boring and left me with a rather bad taste in my mouth.I cannot recommend this book and though I may try another of her books this certainly didn't make me want to try one anytime soon.Blech!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"The author takes an interesting idea and nearly ruins it with sloppy, egregiously repetative suspence devices, a la a hackneyed day-time drama. Some characters with vital information are able to ramble on at length, only to faint just before revealing the information they should have in their first utterance. Other characters are unable to piece together information until long after the reader has, resulting in a &quot;page turner&quot; only to the extent that the reader wishes to find the point where the auther gets on with it.The book also suffers from being published some eight years ago. It describes a future (2054?) that seems technologically stunted given our current reality of the internet/WWW and cell phones. While the author brings us a future capable of time travel this same future lacks cell phones, call waiting, answering machines, pagers and, apparently, personal computers and the Internet. Characters have to wait by the phone for hours fearing they will miss an important call. Other characters cannot be reached because they don't happen to be sitting by the phone. I found this maddening! The author's 2054 felt more like 1954.The story line that takes place in the 14th century is, by comparison, much more enjoyable. However, for all I know, an history major may be has apoplectic about these sections as I was about the &quot;future&quot; sections. Nonetheless, I was glad that it was intended to be historical and not fanciful.Some tight editing and a good screenwriter and this could be an interesting, character driven film. But I'm sure the studios were throwing money at Crichton before his &quot;Timeline&quot; was even published."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"It is 2048, there are time machines. There are no cell phones though.Society is worried about plagues, but they are not worried sending girls back to the 1300s.

There is only one technician who can do it and when he gets sick, there is no backup.The sheer contrivance of the plot and the stupidity of the characters boggles the mind. In some years apparently, the most contrived, implausible work must win the Hugo / Nebula it seems. There are several examples, this is one of them."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Connie Willis keeps snatching defeat out of the jaws of victory. She's clearly got talent. Even at her worst, her work is compulsively readable, with compelling characters and thrilling plot hooks. Why, then, does she insist on smothering her talent with unnecessary verbosity?At half its page count, Doomsday Book would have been a masterpiece. Willis' time travel scenario is elegantly and simply introduced. This isn't hard SF and Willis doesn't pretend that it needs to be - she recognizes that to everyday people, the workings of technology are a mystery not worth unravelling. What matters is how we use the technology available, and Willis' historians, squabbling over how to allocate machine hours and where to send research teams, are a perfectly credible stroke of genius.Which is why it's such a disappointment to see how far Doomsday Book falls of perfection. Willis is either convinced of her readers' stupidity or of her own ability to evoke suspense, because she takes forever to move the plot, which reveals itself in tiny increments and repeats itself ad nauseum. Most readers will have figured out the major plot twists hundreds of pages before Willis' characters do, and be left, not with mounting tension at the rapidly disintegrating situation, but with mounting boredom.The characters are another problem. While the main characters - Kivrin, Dunworthy, Mary Ahrens, Roche and even Colin - are compelling if not particularly original or deep, the secondary characters start off one-dimensional, move on to gross caricatures and get progressively worse from there. The mother of one of Dunworthy's students constantly harangues him over her son's health. This is midly funny, but not when she becomes a Bible-wielding harpy whose every word is a shrill complaint. The son is robust undergraduate with an eye for the ladies. An amusing juxtaposition, but by the end of the book he seems to have Dracula-like powers and is able to charm the wits out of anything in a skirt. Worst of all is Dunworthy's antagonist, a university official so stupid and short-sighted that it is impossible to believe he would have gotten a management position at a garbage dump, much less a university. If Willis had toned down the so-called humor by a few notches, all of these characters could have been believable and perhaps even funny. The characters Kivrin meets in the past are all gross stereotypes, unsalvagable by anything other than a complete rewrite, but at least they don't offend the reader's senses.Willis' problem seems to be one of moderation. She knows how to write humor, albeit of the low, slapstick, Flinstones variety, and she knows how to write about things that are dark and grim. She seems unable, however, of toning either one down, or juxtaposing them in any way that doesn't make Doomsday Book seem like two different books sewn together. Occasionally there are glimpses of her original intention - humor that leavens the darkness, descriptions of sadness that truly affect - but these are few and far between.All that said, there is much to recommend in Doomsday Book. It earned its third star from me for its final segment, in which Willis finally gets the plot moving, tones down the humor, and lets the story and the characters shine through. It's still too long, with too much repitition of already familiar themes, but the ending is quite affecting. And there's no denying that the book held me in its grip - I ended up staying up until 2 AM to finish it.Ultimately, I found Doomsday Book disappointing, mainly because of the glimpses of the better novel it might have been. It's not a must-read novel, and not any better than Willis' frothy and insignificant To Say Nothing of the Dog (which, for all its froth and insignificance, is a better book than this one). Read it if you must, but don't get your hopes up."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"If you plan to read the book, don't read this because it will ruin the best parts of the book for you. The sections in the future were awful - boring, tedious and repetitive. Save for Mr. Dunworthy, I didn't care about any of these characters. The sections in the past were spledid. I grew so attached to the characters that the ending was devastating emotionally. Every time the health of a dying character improved, I hoped they would pull through, only to be hurt time after time. The relationship between Kivrin and Roche was beautiful. Their dignty and actions inspiring. If you plan to read the book, skim the bad story so you can experience the great one."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Yet another Connie Willis book that plods along, piling clever detail upon clever detail. Cleverness alone makes for tedious writing. As E.M. Forster commented in his &quot;Aspects of the Novel,&quot; 'The novelist who betrays too much interest in his own method can never be more than interesting.'I'm more than 300 pages into this book, still waiting for something to happen, and I still haven't found a character I can care about. It is emotion that really moves a story forward. Literature succeeds by depth, by going INTO the Human heart - and that is something Willis utterly refuses to do.Writers who want to stay at a superficial level substitute plot (suspense) for character. Think of Sheharazad - the desire to know &quot;what happens next&quot; keeps people awake at night. This &quot;and then, and then, and then&quot; style of writing is also what drives most bestsellers. (It's the kind of cotton candy writing that makes you keep turning the pages, but you feel cheated at the end when you realize that really there was nothing there to get your teeth into.) If that best-seller style is what Willis is aiming for, she's doing it wrong. Not only does she not include enough emotional depth to make you care, she also doesn't substitute enough suspense to make you forget you don't care.I liked her &quot;Bellwether,&quot; because it was short enough to sustain the narrowly developed characters, and was able to function as a lovely little thought experiment. But &quot;Bellwether&quot; is not really a novel, it's more like a novella. I gave up on &quot;What About the Dog&quot; after 100 pages of being bored to tears by her incessant cleverness.I keep hacking away at &quot;The Doomsday Book&quot;, hoping it will get better, but I am finding myself starting to skim whole paragraphs and pages, which is something I can't remember ever having done in my life before. I think this will be the last time I pick up a Willis book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I enjoyed this book very much and read it in only one day--perhaps it was my own identification with the protagonist, but I found the story, the characters, and the method of presentation (flipping back and forth in time, the use of the journal entries, etc) to be simply terrific.An engaging book that manages to convincingly flip between a medieval setting and the \\"near future\\" setting of the time travelers. Original idea, executed nicely."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"D.B. is a well written novel, written by someone who did all of her homework on Medieval England during the Bubonic Plagues. A history scholar from the twenty-first century is sent back to the fourteenth century for a brief field study. Things go wrong and her clinical study gets too close and personal and her safety and emotional impartiality are compromised. I wanted to give it fewer stars but, grudingly, I had to admit that D.B. was indeed well written. Judging just from this book, I would rather take my chances against the Black Death in England during the fourteenth century than be forced to live in a pedestrian modern British town filled with boring, uninteresting characters. I attribute the over the top praises for this book to the anglophilic biases of book reviewers. Whenever the book focused on the predicaments of the characters in the twenty-first century, I asked myself, &quot;Who cares?&quot; Read the Diamo trilogy by R.A. MacAvoy instead."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I had recently read Connie Willis' &quot;To Say Nothing of the Dog,&quot; which I quite enjoyed ... so I decided to read some of her other books. I am glad I did, as &quot;Doomsday Book&quot; is one of the best books I have read in a long time. I grew so attached to all the fascinating characters in this tragic story that the tears were pouring out of my eyes by the end. It was completely unlike the lighthearted mystery of &quot;To Say Nothing ...&quot; but it was just as compelling. Definitely the sort of book I would want to read over and over and over. Now, if you'll excuse me, I am going to go order it (the copy I have sitting on the desk in front of me was checked out from the library and, tragically, must be returned in a few weeks)."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I find myself quite flabbergasted at the negative reviews on this site. Doomsday Book is, quite possibly, the best book I have ever read -- and I am a *harsh, harsh* literary critic. Connie Willis makes these characters and the time periods -- past and future -- come alive. I was incredibly moved by this novel. It is a powerful story of survival, despair and hope that I don't think I'll ever forget. It felt *real* -- which is one of the highest compliments I can give to a sci-fi novel (though this one is so much more)."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I've been reading Connie Willis for a few years, mostly her wonderful, humorous short stories. When I finally read Doomsday Book, I was very impressed with her ability to develop her characters so that I cared. The book mixes some great middle-ages plague history, not normally a very interesting time, with some modern English time travel. The result is a most powerful novel. When I finished the book I was exhausted. I would definitely recommend it and list it on the top ten books I have read. It still haunts me."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"The Doomsday Book tells a gripping story about time travel, past history, and the problems of technology at the behest of person agrandizement. The beauty of the book is the story. I was reminded of the Oxford school of writing which tends to spare on detail for the sake of a long, flowing and ever absorbing tale.One is taken back into history during the time of the bubonic plague, where the main character is stranded due to selfish concerns from the century of the character's origin. The story switches back and forth between the events of the present, and the life threatening events of the 1340s and 1350s outside of London.The book is long (&lt; 600 pages paperback), but one I could not put down."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book has two basic stories: one about England in the 1300's and the other in the future. I found the middle ages stuff pretty interesting and rather well researched. The future stuff is laughable in its stupidity. The characters spend the bulk of the book on a problem that anyone could have solved with a simple email message. Just skip any chapter about stuff that takes place in the future and this book might be enjoyable."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"After reading all the reviews here, it seems that people are pretty divided on whether they liked this book or not, though it appeared that most were positive. I tend to be in the positive camp. I quite enjoyed this book, for a lot of things. The attention to detail of medeval times is nearly perfect, as far as I can tell. Willis has an almost uncanny ability to portray her characters as such real people, that when the Plague comes (and you it is coming, and you know that everyone is going to die, and yet you hope. Almost like Shute's On the Beach). You can feel the anguish as Kivren is forced to watch all the people she has come close to die off one by one, agonizing, brutal, horrible deaths. Clearly, Willis has done the research and what has emerged is a near perfect masterpiece of writing. It should have won more awards"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I've found from my own reading of Doomsday Book and from a quick perusal of other reviews that it is a love/hate relationship. I myself went through this very same feelings as I pushed through Doomsday Book. Ultimately, though, I found that as the book progressed that it matured in such a way that I was floored by the time I finished.The cons are glaring in the beginning of the book and they almost make you want to put the book down and stop reading. The two major turnoffs for me were the repetitive and annoying characters and the paradox time machine. Willis has a habit of writing her characters really annoying. Some might say that if that was what she intended than she did her job. But when I say annoying I mean I see that they are annoying, but I am annoyed with how strongly Willis pushed them at us. There is only so much Gilchrist, Gaddstone, Imayne and Finch you can take before you get frustrated. But having read a previous book of Willis' (Bellwether) I knew that this is just how she writes. Very quirky and annoying characters that do stuff that people wouldn't normally do. I could only assume that this is done on purpose since it has now happened in both books. It is her style of writing, her quirky storytelling that shines through. The other major con is the paradox time travel machine. It is stated early on that it will not let diseases or bacteria or whatever that would affect history in anyway, and to a lesser extent would not let the person go through if they were to intend to alter it (i.e. assassinate Hitler), yet the obvious assumption that Kivrin could have easily killed anyone unintentionally or changed the paths of many a man or woman (which she undoubtedly did) leaves such a huge whole in the time travel concept that it was hard to get around.It was these two major cons that slowed the book down for me through the first hundred pages, but I pushed on. From there the book grew on me. Willis is classified as sci fi, but her writing certainly is not. Just as many of the other Hugo and Nebula award winners do, Willis' books have sci fi as a loose base and background for the story, with the real action/storyline being the focus of the characters and the plot. The sci fi part is a vessel, nothing more. You are not going to see predictions of technological advances (as many a reviewer has complained about), but you will see a story told and told well. Kivrin in England in 1348, Dunworthy in England in 2055, both dealing with their own catastrophic diseases and going through their own personal ordeals. We are treated to a great story with a lot of history that intertwines so well together that by the time I reached the end I was 100% invested in the characters and what they were going through. I did not want the book to end because I loved living in the Middle Ages through the eyes of Kivrin and the lives of Agnes, Rosemund, Father Roche and company.Overall I couldn't have been more surprised by how the book ended and had my interest completely despite the first 100 pages of repetitive and annoying characters. Because of the first 100 pages I can only give 4 stars, but the book as a whole is just a fantastic book. Don't pick it up thinking you're getting a prediction of the future of technology, or you are going to visit planets and meet aliens. As with most of the Hugo and Nebula winners the sci fi element is simply a vessel to tell the story and nothing more, but be ready for a great story that paints a great, albeit sad, story. A definite recommend if you can push through the first 100 pages.4 stars."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book puts a twist on science fiction... Whereas the genre typically questions our terracentrism and assumptions about other worlds, this is an ironic examination of our modern-day arrogance in regards to our own history: because we \\"know\\" what happened, we believe we understand what happened. Willis blows our \\"grasp\\" on history to bits in \\"Doomsday Book\\" by juxtaposing a freak plague in somewhat-future Oxford with Kivrin's accidental trip back to the Black Plague-ridden 1340s. She asks, even with a point of reference, shared geography, and the dual experience of tragedy, can we ever truly understand the past? From Kivrin's thorough-and-yet-thoroughly-wrong language preparation to modern historians' \\"accepted\\" Plague mortality statistics, we must answer no.The story itself unravels slowly and can be quite frustrating--the error in time calculation is inevitable and obvious from the start. The characters, however, don't catch on until far into the book and the discovery is thwarted over and over...and over, leaving the reader in constant anxiety and irritation. A quick read this is not.What Willis does well is confront and disorient the reader, much like Kivrin and her advisor Dunworthy on their opposite sides of time. We don't understand the \\"contemps\\" of the 1340s until Kivrin does and we're forced to cut through the red tape of the modern bureaucracy along with Dunworthy. All the while, she humanizes the past, making it even more realistic, sympathetic, and not at all laughable in the face of a ridiculous, faithless, arrogant future.While the book is indeed very long, the payoff is well worth it. The final chapters, as the true cost of both plagues is revealed, are poignant and devastating. Kivrin's rescue is as huge a relief as it is a hard slap in the face. Her final quote as the time curtain shimmers closed reminds us of the sometimes-irrational faith we keep in each other, even in the face of what would seem to be a perfect time to lose our religion, as it were.Doomsday Book is perhaps not necessarily for science fiction lovers as it is true history lovers. It preys accurately on our modern pandemic fears and presents the idea that new plague or old--there is a rather disturbing tie-in--we will perhaps be as helpless as the \\"contemps\\" were in the face of the next great contagion. The end will stay with you long after you put the book down, and you'll never mention the Plague casually again."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"A young girl *Kivrin* from the future *2048* is going to be taken back to the year 1320 so she can do research.

Kivrin finds herself watching everyone she has grown close to in that short time sicken and die.Incredibly serious and thought provoking book. You've just got to love the characters. ... Willis does a wonderful job making the book come to life.If you are a fan of Willis' other books, this is a little bit more serious than her others, but still wonderful.

I now own two copies, and I read it every year at Christmas time. Connie Willis has created characters that are easy to love, empathize with, and pull for. Her narrative style draws the reader in and makes them part of the story. At the end of this book every year, I am reminded of true spirit of the season. I hope you like it as much as I do!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"For those of you who want intricate special effects regarding time travel (ala Michael Crichton's Timeline), you will not find it here. Instead we are provided a story with time travel elements that has well developed characters, good historical descriptions, and a great deal of suspense.A student of history is sent back in time to England in the late Middle Ages. Unknown to the student (by the name of Kivrin - what a great name!), the person who sent her back was infected with a virus. The virus causes the technician's judgment to be off and he causes Kivrin to end up in the wrong time period. The technician is so stricken by the virus, that he keeps lapsing in and out of consciousness before he can fully explain to anyone, what went wrong. What's worse is that the virus is causing an epidemic throughout the university so nobody is really able to keep on top of monitoring Kivrin.Meanwhile Kivrin has the same virus as the technician, which apparently not only makes her deathly ill, but also causes her internal translator to not function properly. Thus she is unable to understand anyone and nobody is unable to understand her. I will not give away anything about the time she is in except to say that it is a time where people suspected of being witches are burned. Therefore if Kivrin appears to act strange, she could be in for a lot of trouble.This book has a lot of good going for it. Some things that detracted a little from the story are that the book is supposed to take place in the year 2040 but other than time travel, there is virtually nothing different from today. I am not sure when the book was written but telephones described are very archaic even by today's standard. Additionally, the way Kivrin is sent back in time and left in a great deal of danger does not sound like a \\"routine\\" activity that a university would be engaged in even 40 years into the future."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I still haven't read Greeley's SF claim to fame's first solo novel, Lincoln's Dreams, but based on the quality of her short stories, and this, her second novel, I'm not upset at all that I sprung for a hardback copy of it.Which is a funny way to start a review, but sort of expresses the inexpressable delight that I enjoyed whilst reading Doomsday Book. Frankly, Willis is one of the finest writers I've ever read, in or out of the SF genre. However, I feel that her short work stands up better than her novels, and the novels ain't shabby.What's Doomsday Book about? Kivrin, an eager young historian from 2045 gets the chance of a lifetime to &quot;visit&quot; (that is, time travel) to the Middle-Ages and make first-hand observations. However, the transition doesn't go quite as planned because as soon as Kivrin is sent, the technician in 2045 falls down with a mysterious influenza like disease. Kivrin's mentor in 2045 is suddenly caught in a Seriocomedy of Errors as he tries to have her recalled, while also dealing with a quarantine in his own age. Kivrin, meanwhile, is finding out the hard way that everything her mentor said about the Middle-Ages is true. And she's also finding out that she may not be in exactly the time frame that she originally thought she was.And that's the basic plot without spoilers. The story is told through two protagonists, Kivrin's story in the middle-ages, and her mentor's story in 2045. The point of view is also a very tight third-person subjunctive, which at times can seem repetitive, but is extremely well done.Worth it? Definately."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book had me breaking out in a cold sweat - horrible and wonderful at the same time.

If you thought &quot;To Say Nothing of the Dog&quot; was too lighthearted, give this one a try!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Once I started this book, I could not put it down. But Connie Willis' Doomsday Book is so much more than just a compelling read. It is a time travel story that also succeeds as an historical novel, a parody of academic politics, a medical mystery, a suspense story and a meditation on moral, philosophical and historical themes. Parallel stories play out in the 21st and 14th centuries. The characters - particularly those in the 14th century - are realistically drawn and believable. Historians debate what forces create history -is it economics, great men, societal forces, everyday individuals? Connie Willis' position is clear: the everyday acts of everyday individuals are the key to the development and survival of civilization as we know it."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. The amount of detail and research that Ms. Willis must have done is staggering and yet the book is very readable and the people come alive. Rather than either idolizing or condeming the past or the future, Willis presents both in a very real, all-too-human light. Though the book is long, I plowed through it, and was never bored. I like all of her books, but this is one of Willis' best. I don't usually like time-travel books, especially ones to the past, but this was so well done, I barely noticed that it wasn't &quot;my type of book&quot;.The book begins humorous and light and remains that way for the majority of the book, despite the heavy subject. The weightyness only hits you later and by then I was too immersed to toss it aside. This is not 600 pages of depression, it has all the ups and downs of any human story, and it has continued to touch me long after I put the book down. The sequel, &quot;To Say Nothing of the Dog&quot; is also wonderful, but not at all dark and gloomy if you would like to start there."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Even though this book is very sad I think it's worth reading 'cause it's also very good."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I read this for a class and it is now my favorite book andMrs. Willis my favorite author.

Everybody else, here's a wonderful book, absorbing and suspenseful and intelligent and even funny. &quot;Doomsday Book&quot; has a well-researched tour of the middle ages, enjoyably snarky commentary on university life, and a race-to-the-finish-line plot, all in one neat package. (Also does for the CDC what &quot;Slow River&quot; did for sewage treament.) If you're the kind of reader who must have dragons and spaceships, skip it, you'll only be confused. Those who prefer a little less convention and a little more craft should be very pleased.

A real pleasure to read, and knowledge to gain."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I do not know why this book is called a science fiction book, because the time travel device used to go back into the Middle Ages is something which does not seem to play an important role in the book. The nice thing about the book is the comparision about a flulike epidemic in 2050 and the plague in 1348. I wondered whether the writer was English, because she catches the English humor and way of thinking quite well. I think the novel would have been stronger and better if there was more attention to the Middle Ages, because the story told about a village catching the plague during Christmas 1348 is quite strong."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"this book was a book that had everything.

I like the author's approach to the time period. The people are quite different from us...obviously and unapologetically NOT modern. Yet, Willis convincingly links the past and the future in more ways than one. I find her future, with the bureaucratic tangles and incompetence, to be quite believable as well. Additionally, her characters are engaging and realistic. I particularly liked Mr. Dunworthy (and enjoyed his reappearance in other books) and Father Roche. She didn't resort to any of the tired stereotypes of the middle ages. I was particularly glad to see her depiction of genuine piety. Very well done. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"The book conssists of two intertwined stories, that of the student going back to study the Middle Ages and the 21st century academics trying to rescue her. The former is outstanding. The characters are real, the detail is fine, but even more, the unspoken inferences about medieval life and society drawn by the reader are the most fascinating part of the book. However, the latter is disappointing. It is at times plodding and clumsy. Attempts at comedy are misplaced and the characters are two dimensional. This 21st century portions really took away from the meat of the book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"When I read 'Hugo and Nebula award winner,' I'll give it a try, but this book was surprisingly disappointing. The mode is sci-fi in the beginning and at the end, while the middle of the book concentrates on the mundane -- life in the near future and life in the fourteenth century. The sci-fi aspects worked well, but the speculative fiction aspect was not as successful. As mentioned in other reviews, her humor is suspect ('We're almost out of toilet paper!' is funny?) and repetitive (the first few times it may be amusing, but by the hundredth time -- no exaggeration -- the lack of sufficient toilet paper comes up -- it's simply annoying).But what was most disappointing was the lack of strong characters. Every character is one-note, even the lead characters. Kivrin is the archetypal Naive Student Who Needs a Father Figure, while Dunworthy is the archetypal Teacher Who Is Also a Father Figure. So focused are they on these roles, they merely LEARN from the events in the book. They are not CHANGED by the events.The support characters are worse, however. Their function is clearly just to keep the plot moving, or to keep the one-note, repetitive jokes coming (for example, a nurse demonstrates no nursing abilities whatsoever, but demonstrates a strong need to keep visitors out of Dunworthy's room, forcing the efforts of Dunworthy's friends to sneak him out of the room).The middle section of the book is split between Kivrin in the fourteenth century, which was very interesting, and Dunworthy battling bureaucracy, which was downright dull. I kept finding minor flaws as well. The need to keep finding phones when everyone should be carrying cell phones dates the book's depiction of the future. And would the young child, Agnes, really be allowed to constanty sound like a whiny twenty-first century child? I don't think so -- I kept waiting for Kivrin to box HER ears! The book is redeemed, though, by the sci-fi aspects of the story. Redeemed, that is, up to three or so stars.Many interesting elements, but overall disappointing."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Doomsday Book is a chillingly beautiful, well-written and well-researched story combining the best elements of historical fiction with absurdist science fiction. The characters, like real people, seem archetypal and easily categorized when you meet them but show more and more texture as you get to know them. Both the future-day academians and the medieval villagers seem real and present and very much alive, and so do the other main characters: merciless contagious disease and insistent time. The basic plot line begins like this: Oxford historians create a mechanism to go back in time. Once it becomes clear history can't be looted because you can't bring objects back and forth or change events too much, time travel is only of interest to historians, who send a tough young undergrad to the Middle Ages. The story follows her experiences in the past as well as the (future for us) present, where the university is suddenly hit by the outbreak of some new disease. The story starts slow, like all Connie Willis books, where seemingly anecdotal story lines and conversations come and go and you're not quite sure what is going on and how it will all tie together. Slowly, also like most Connie Willis books, you become more and more involved in the rising tension, and you look up and realize time slipped away from you and you really should go cook dinner or check your work e-mail, but all you want to do is get back into the book. I highly suggest reading Doomsday Book in as few sittings as possible because the pace of the story and the intensity of your relationship with the characters is best experienced this way, like listening to an entire album rather than song by song to get the full impact. Connie Willis has a strong historical foundation and she thinks of brilliant ways to link various time periods and story lines. She clearly researched the 1300s and medieval daily life very carefully; she focuses on the details that really make you feel as though you're in the 1300 with the characters. She manages to point out differences you might not think of between our daily life and culture and theirs, while still highlighting the universality of human emotions and desires. In sum, it's a brilliant, thoughtful book with an intense conclusion, carefully defined characters and an unusual, illuminating dual story line. You'll think about Doomsday Book long after reading it."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is my new case example of a novel that could be a much better book if it had a couple hundred pages taken out. The main strength of the work is the author's intricately detailed evocation of medieval England and the onslaught of the Black Plague. The years of research show and you see, feel, and smell the place and the people. The final 100 pages or so are well paced and heart wrenching as characters we've gotten to know and like, love, or hate fall victim to the virus. But we simply don't need as much lead up to this. The novel felt like it was treading water much of the time, more interested in showing yet more of the surroundings and the daily life of its characters when the same goal of getting us involved could have been met with fewer scenes. Much of what happens felt repetitive or had no serious bearing on what came later. Worse, the many scenes set in the modern day world are filled with far less interesting characters who, in some cases, were not particularly believable."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I probably would not have finished this book if it did not win the Hugo and Nebula award. I kept on saying to myself that there must have been a reason this book won. Must have been a weak field that year. The beginning is slow, the middle is slightly interesting, the end comes abruptly.The time travel concept was unremarkable except for the fact that if I had invented time travel, I would have required much smarter people to run the system. Most of the characters are 1 dimensional. A lot of what happens does not have the ring of plausibility. Suspense is made by having one character blatantly withholding information from the reader not once, but several times. He has very important information, but somehow he just never gets around to telling everyone about it.Normally, I don't care if characters are 1 dimensional , just as long as it is a good read and characters behave somewhat plausibly. However, the plot moves too slow and you just don't care about the characters towards the end."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"***SPOILER ALERT****Ok, I have no idea what purpose the author had in mind when writing this. I'm in somewhat of a foul mood anyway today...so I'll take out my wrath on Ms. Willis. I just kept hoping that there would be a plot, some epiphany. But there isn't a plot. The characters are pathetically helpless and lacking in all imagination. They run around in circles fretting over nothing that they couldn't fix by just, hmmm...talking to someone... It's terrible. Let's just say, THEY ALL DIE! Yes...all but three of main characters get bumped off by either the plague or the \`mystery virus'. Oh...and the virus has no connection whatsoever to the time travel events. None! The dig site that is \`oh so important' has no connection to the town where Kirvin ends up. None! There's no historical link from the characters in the past to those in the future. It's just an empty novel that poses a little hope of interest and never delivers....for hundreds of pages. It really would have been a much better story if everyone just died in the first 20 pages. Then you could just go on and read a good novel. I'm sorry...but the goons that rated this with more than 1 star must have read a different version of the book...because this was just mind numbing.So, yes...both little girls die, the wife of the manor dies, the mother-in-law dies, the clerk dies (but I must have missed that sentence.... He suffers for a gazillion pages and then he's just not mentioned...so I must have missed the one line where he actually died). The preacher dies. Everyone in the whole town dies. Aunt Mary dies. The \`evil' acting head of the college dies. That's it. Oh...and they never do locate the real head of the college that gone off to Scotland fishing and doesn't have a cell phone or pager in an era with time travel. Really?So, the story could be rewritten... There was a hopeless twit of a girl that gets sent back through time to the black plague. Her friends worry about what to wipe their butts with in the present while she tries for days to get the courage to ask the knight in shining armor how to get back home. Then, everyone drops dead in the present and past... Oh...and then there's a weak hearted attempt to rescue the girl from the past by a sickly miserable old professor and a twelve year old Wunderkind. When they meet up in the past...there's no hugs, tears, thank-you's... Just hey... let's go home.Do yourself a favor and skip this book.

Hopefully the first of her books I would eventually love...Unfortunately -- to cut right to the chase -- I couldn't even manage to finish this novel, and that is very rare for me.Usually award winning books deliver something special to the reader -- new ideas, tremendous plotting, big themes, complex characters,etc. I just for the life of me couldn't find any of those in this novel. Had this novel been written in the 60s or 70s I might have given it just a little more leeway... but sheesh it was written in '92!The time travel aspect wasn't original, nor even handled particularly well. The were some tremendous incongruities technologically within the story and some of the characters made me want to cry in their banality.But for me the single most off-putting aspect of the writing was the simplistic repetition of the characters' conflicts. I felt bludgeoned by the sheer number of times the same phrase/theme/thought was repeated over and over and over... ESPECIALLY because they were very basic and not at all difficult to grasp.The descriptions of medieval ages were bland and after I found myself skipping portions of both storylines I finally gave it up.There were very occasionally hints of some original and innovative thinking, but nowhere near enough to carry a 600 page book. This book was formulaic and uninspired, certainly not deserving of the Nebula over the superb Fire Upon the Deep (which at least tied it for a Hugo)."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Forester said that there are three kinds of characters in fiction:the round, the flat, and the flat masquarading as the round.Doomsday Book doesn't even attempt the first, but offers the last two adnauseum. Despite this, the portions of the book set in the Black Plagueare at least readable, being judiciously arrayed with 14th century grunginess.These parts are, however, mercilessly hacked apart by present-day scenes packed withphone calls, hospital visits, little yellow stick-em notes, and lots of irritating characters (fanatical bell-ringers,overly-protective mothers, anal assistants, snooty deans), as if we don't haveenough of those in real life. Willis tries to buildsuspense in these scenes by having characters swoon whenever theyare about to say something revelatory. Can you say CONTRIVED?The most moving character in the story is Blackie, a puppy that dies of being handled too much. Considering the wayWillis shoves her characters around, I'm surprised they didn'tall die that way. Each can be summed up in a few wordsand nothing any of them does is surprising in the least. Ifyou want more complex characters, just read the Sunday comics."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Christmas, 2054. The 'net' is a technological breakthrough, a device which allows people to travel back in time to observe the events of the past. Historians use the net to go back and observe history in progress, but anachronisms and those intending to change the past are not permitted through. Whilst the net has mostly been used to travel to relatively recent periods of history, the Mediaeval department of Oxford University is preparing to send a young student named Kivrin through to the year 1320. No sooner has she gone through, than chaos erupts: a virulent disease sweeps through Oxford, striking down most of the populace and a quarantine is enforced that prevents the faculty from retrieving Kivrin. Back in the 14th Century Kivrin becomes used to living in the Middle Ages, which none of her training has really prepared her for, but it soon becomes clear that something has gone horribly wrong, and she is not when she is supposed to be...Doomsday Book was originally published in 1992 and won both the Hugo and Nebula awards for Best Novel. It mixes elements of traditional time travel stories with elements from a disaster movie: Kivrin is trapped in the past and her friends in the present are unable to help her as they themselves are dealing with a pandemic. This is a nice spin on the cliche, with the present-day storyline given just as much attention (if not more) than Kivrin's misadventures in the past. The notion of disease and illness lies at the heart of the book, and seeing how futuristic medicine can barely stop the pandemic from killing people makes the sections set during the Black Death even more horrific in comparison. The novel also acts as a curious comedy of manners, or even a farce, with characters' own blinkered viewpoints and opinions mean that they are unable to effectively deal with the unfolding crises. At times this makes the book a frustrating experience, as some characters are obtuse to the point of total ludicrousness and gives an oddly tonally inappropriate dose of humour to the novel.What keeps you reading is the depth of research that has been done here: 14th Century England is brought to life vividly, with the characters painted richly and convincingly. Unlike a lot of writers (such as say Ken Follett, whose Pillars of the Earth is an utterly unconvincing depiction of medieval life), Willis makes the point successfully that the medieval period was one where people's beliefs and thoughts were totally alien to our own, and understanding how they thought and acted on a day-to-day level is extremely difficult. She succeeds at this admirably.The 21st Century sections are less successful, mainly due to the stupidity of certain characters meaning that you lose any belief that these people would actually attain the roles or positions they have. There are also a number of plot strands in this sequence which are completely left unresolved: it's never made clear if it was user error or a deliberate act by Gilchrist that resulted in Kivrin being sent to the wrong year, and the mystery of what happened to Mr. Basingame, who vanishes before the book even starts and whose fate is much debated by the other characters, is never answered. The lack of communication between major characters is also completely unbelievable and adds to the frustration levels of the novel.Doomsday Book (***) features some stunning and deeply affecting sequences set in the 14th Century. Those set in the future are less compelling, and there are some moments of reader frustration to be had, but overall the book remains a vivid and memorable reading experience. The novel is published by Bantam in the USA. It doesn't currently have a UK publisher, but the US version is readily available from Forbidden Planet or via Amazon.co.uk."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I read this in the 1990's and really loved it and have recommended it many times. I recently listened to the audio book version on a road trip and was surprised at how badly the book held up. Part of it is because one cannot skim over the repetitive annoying bits when listening to an audio book. Somehow I hadn't realized how much of a slog it is to get through the characters endlessly looping around the same issues and concerns. As others have noted before, much of the slog is because folks can't get a hold of each other on the phone. I got my first answering machine in the mid 1980's and by the 1990's everyone had them. Their absence in Willis's future would seem to be solely for the purpose of having missed phone calls thwart the characters at every turn. It is interesting to remember a time when it actually could be hard to get a hold of folks on the phone, but that wasn't true even in 1992.That said, the end still is powerful. There is something haunting about this novel. The characters are thin, the pacing dreadful. But still. I would love to see a rewrite of the same thing. A 200 page version of this novel would be a wonderful thing."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I'm a fan of Connie Willis for sure. I love the way she manages to combine sci-fi with great research. I sure learned heaps about the fourteenth century while enjoying a great yarn. Unlike her novel To Say Nothing Of The Dog this one is more than a little grim, but I wouldn't expect that time in history to be any other way. I'm glad she kept it close to the bone right to the end."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I have read and reread this book several times over the last decade. I will very likely read it again. Connie Willis brings the middle ages back to life. Her characters feel like friends and acquaintances. Her descriptions are vivid. Her plot is engaging and feels plausible. I am most taken by Father Roche's relationship with God, especially amidst a background of cares, cynicism, and unbelief. It's an excellent book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"The book starts out being really slow and descriptive about the setting, the people, and the relationships between the characters. Once something goes wrong with \\"the drop\\", the action picks up and it's hard to put the book down. You want to know what happens next. I love the sense of humor and sarcasm the author has given the characters."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"In a future rather like our present, a grad student is accidentally send back in time to the Plague, rather than the slightly safer time she had been planning. Between the mysterious epidemic in the future and the gory details of buboes in the past, Connie Willis has written a story that will forever color how you view the Black Death. Perfectly plotted and rapidly paced, you won't want it to end."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"First off, though I did like this book, I have to say that I'm astounded that it won the Hugo and Nebula awards. Was there really nothing better published in science fiction or fantasy that year? The Doomsday Book is certainly enjoyable, especially the last third or so, but it still leaves a lot to be desired. Science Fiction requires a willing suspension of disbelief by the reader, which is usually accomplished by making the non-sci-fi elements of a book believable, but the author doesn't do a very good job of it.For one thing, for a book with a lot of dialogue and not a lot of action, many of the characters seem pretty flat, almost caricatures of real people. We have Gilchrist, an impossibly unqualified administrator desperately seeking to blame everything that goes wrong on Dunworthy, one of the protagonists. Add to that an assistant whose obsession with the supply of toilet paper seems positively freudian, a mother of a student who is impossibly overprotective and who insists on reading the most depressing parts of the Old Testament to hospital patients, ostensibly to boost morale, and a cheeky adolescent who is constantly sneaking into hospital rooms. Not a lot of depth here, I'm afraid.For another, the cavalier attitude of the administrators toward a rather astounding piece of technology is entirely baffling. In the future, time travel has become possible, and universities have the means to send historians back in time. Given the years of preparation required to send someone back in time, and the attendant dangers of such time travel, the idea that various safety protocols could simply be ignored by an administrator in a hurry is laughable, and the idea that no one is double checking (and triple and quadruple checking) the calculations required to send someone back is just not believable.Finally, the communication difficulties the characters have are maddening. First, although the book was written in 1993, when cell phones were not as common as today, the complete lack of any sort of mobile communications device without any explanation seems quite contrived, and much of the middle of the book is taken up with characters trying, with limited success, to get in touch with one another. The one character who knows what has gone wrong with the planned time travel to the year 1320 spends most of the book delirious with the bad case of the flu, and Dunworthy's repeated attempts to coax some sense out him drag on far longer than they need to.Where this book really shines is in the efforts of Kivrin, trapped in the past, and Dunworthy once both realize what has gone wrong with the \\"drop.\\" In Kivrin in particular, we see a strength of character emerge from the chaos around her, as she struggles to help the people she has come to know, believing she is trapped in the past with them. In these last chapters, the book became a page turner, and I found myself staying up late into the night, unwilling to go to bed until I discovered Kivrin's fate. I just wish the first part of the book had been as compelling."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"An interesting concept of time travel, with great detail of the early 1940s. Recommended for scifi fans of alternative universes."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Most time travel books take you away to other places. This book is unique in that the traveler goes to an earlier time for the same location and lets her \\"contemps\\" know if she can not return that she will be buried in the local cemetery so they can to find her.In the style of Wil Durant-that the past is the everyday lives of ordinary people- that were expertly brought to life in this book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book was very entertaining and worth every penny.

Details are piled up unmercifully. Facts are recycled endlessly. Events unfold, but characters don't particularly develop and the large contours of what plot there is are buried under the relentless recitation of trivial details like landscape features under a snowfall.In the end I was left wondering what the point was. The tragedy of what happened in the Middle Ages is real, but what is the visitor doing there? Is she there only to be our eyes and ears to learn what went on? The parallel events in the modern times are less starkly presented but equally unfortunate.A good concept plus a mass of details doesn't add up to a story. There might be a 150-page tale of great power buried under the avalanche of words in the 600+ pages of this book, but I can't tell what it might be. I wasted hours of my life that I will never see again plodding patiently through this book waiting for the moment when it would all fall into place and whatever was being set up would be sprung. That time never came. The book droned on and on, people died, people talked, people wondered... and in the end I was past caring.

Eliminating 90% of the side plots about the American bell-ringers, Mrs. Gaddson's 50s-vintage conservatism, William Gaddson's lothario exploits, and nurses demanding that people fill out contact history forms would have done the trick. The premises of the book were highly unbelievable (50% untreated flu mortality rate, cavalier use of time travel), which worked fine for the comedy portions but made the tragedy parts just seem more pointless.All in all, Connie Willis is a very gifted writer, but if I want unending meticulous descriptions of British people being silly, I think I'd better stick with Susanna Clarke."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Connie Willis has over time been fashioning a quiet little niche for herself in the Science Fiction world with her brand of SF deeply rooted in history and alternate realities. Her SF is deeply character centered with little to no technology involved save the obligatory time machine. Yet, this book which was her first full length novel and took more than 5 years to write is excellent not only with its wonderfully blended characterizations, subtle humour but especially in its excellently detailed research into one of the darkest periods of human history.Kivrin is a History student at Oxford in the future, where History involves more than flipping through dusty tomes. Her interest in the middle ages leads her on an expedition to travel back in time to observe the lives of people during that period. However, disaster strikes not only in the past but in the present as well, leaving her in danger of being stranded in one of the most dangerous periods of the past.The most amazing thing about the book was its ability to evoke a sense of the past so clearly. The reader is drawn into the middle ages so convincingly that the period truly seems to come alive. Her sense of setting is excellently done in the near-future Oxford as well as she convincingly evokes the sense of panic of a people who have never suffered the effects of disease let alone the epidemic that threatens them so suddenly.The characters generally are well-drawn and convincing though the author relies on cliche quite often in painting the general picture of a character (from the over-protective mother, over-inquisitive kid to over-competitive territorial Prof) but they are all fleshed out rather nicely, particularly the two main protagonists Kivrin and her professor who is trying to rescue her. The characters in the middle ages are all convincingly drawn and I was impressed by the fact that came across so historically accurate for want of a better discription. Also, its nice to see an American write British characters that truly seem British and not like Americans pretending to be British.To sum up, it is an excellent novel, tauntly written and wonderfully paced, keeping the tension up to the final pages. Its historical setting is superbly detailed and accurate and the characters are well fleshed out. This is a must read in any genre and well deserving of the Hugo and Nebula Awards that it has won."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I suppose you might enjoy this book if you like the array of literature you can find in any airport.

Maybe that's why I'm reading so many negative reviews here. I think a lot of reviewers have both missed the boat and a great read.As 'Doomsday Book' opens, a young university history student named Kivrin is preparing to travel back in time to the year 1320 for an on-site study of English people and their customs before the Black Plague hit. Mr. Dunworthy, Kivrin's professor, fears she is not prepared, even though Kivrin has spent months learning about the era, its customs, its language, and its dangers. He feels that something is wrong, dangerously wrong.He's right. Something has gone wrong. Kivrin lands in the Fourteenth Century, but not in 1320. She finds out (in more ways than one) that the time she is in can be very, very dangerous. In the meantime, an epidemic has broken out in Dunworthy's time (the year is 2054), taking the professor's energy away from trying to rescue Kivrin.I think the mistake some readers make when reading 'Doomsday Book' is in expecting a thrill-a-minute ride that never stops until the last page. If that was what she wanted, it wouldn't have taken Connie Willis five years to research and write the book. I think people are not judging the book she has written. That's too bad because the book Willis has given us is a jewel. Why? First, its expertly written. Yes, the research is evident and impressive, but Willis makes you feel that everything you are reading about is absolutely authentic, all the way down to the fabric of the clothes people wore in Fourteenth Century England. Second, the characters are not stereo-typed. It would have been soooooo easy to have Kivrin stumble into the Fourteenth Century and instantly be considered a witch or a demon. It also would have been easy to portray the &quot;contemps&quot; as backwards, ignorant people clinging to superstition as their religion. Willis is much too smart for that. Instead, she gives us a very believable heroine in Kivrin, a young woman who is as prepared as one could be for such a journey until she arrives and discovers that no amount of preparation would have been enough. The people she meets are not one-dimensional cardboard characters who are incapable of thinking. They are richly drawn complex people who I will remember for a long time. Finally, the parallels between the two time periods provides an interesting study. Have things really changed in seven hundred years? Are people really so much different now than they were then? The answers might surprise you.Only one part of the book began to grow tedious for me: The constant presence of Dunworthy's assistant Finch, a yes-man if I ever saw one. Other than this, 'Doomsday Book' is a book to enjoy and treasure.578 pages"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Facinating concept -- a time-traveling scholar trapped in 14th century England and her 21st century mentor literally race against time to try to prevent her being stranded in time as parallel crises imperil both eras. The characters are well developed and finely etched, and Willis expertly conjures up the world of the Middle Ages. But the book staggers under the weight of unnecessary detail, and the artificial plot devices the author employs to maintain suspense are irritating. Unfortunately, the main character is never convincing as a trained Oxford historian. A brisk read once the Willis hits her stride two thirds of the way through, but it's a slog to get there."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Willis has written a captivating story set partly in mid-21st century England where the threat of epidemic disease has become one of the world's greatest fears, but mostly in 14th century England where the Plague is a total mystery to those it brutally afflicts. This book is much more geared toward historical fiction,with just a flavor of sci-fi to make it that much more interesting.The historical sequences are realistic and captivating, if slightly repetitive (I need to find Gawyn, I have to talk to Gawyn, Oh! where is Gawyn?) and as a history enthusiast I really appreciated the details of 14th century life and culture, which are obviously well researched. The future sequences are written in a kind of witty, slapstick style that makes them feel light and funny - a suspenseful comic relief to the frightful and eventually gruesome medieval scenes.Willis' description of time travel is particularly delightful, as it gets rid of all the \\"paradox\\" and \\"incongruity\\" problems by simply providing the time travel device with the smarts to keep it from happening.While some of the characters were distractingly thick in the head and could have used a little more fleshing out, this was still an awesome effort overall."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Connie Willis is an interesting writer and this is an interesting book, and a page-turner as well. It's a very good read. But I have some misgivings. I agree that this is not your typical \\"sci-fi\\" work, but neither, as another reviewer has mentioned, is it well threshed out historical fiction, such as Neal Stephenson gives us in The Baroque Cycle. In other words, Willis doesn't exactly transcend any genre here. Rather, she mixes several together in a way that is not completely satisfactory.Ironically, what rather bothers one is how entertaining this book is. It is, like much of Willis's fiction, heavily dependent on a droll, Wodehousian humour. This is used to perfect effect in works such as To Say Nothing of the Dog. And it is used to perfect effect here at the beginning where Mrs. Gaddison, for example, much like Bertie Wooster's Aunt Agatha, serves as a perfect comic foil for that droll sort of wit---But then the deaths start piling up, in both eras, and it isn't really until we near the end and Dunworthy becomes ill, that these wry lines and situational comedies are ended - by the characters' deaths. There's a distinct literary dissonance about a book that has one smirking or tittering until the final, harrowing chapters.All this having been said, the book has some finer points, the finest of which is Willis's evocations of the medieval landscape; I was reminded a bit of Singrid Unset's Kristin Lavransdatter (which, for those who want real historical fiction of this sort, is definitely the place to turn). The book truly does manage to convey Christina Rossetti's picture of \\"a bleak midwinter long ago\\" quoted at the beginning of \\"Book Two\\".So, what's the verdict? - Doomsday Book is a good, engrossing read, if rather flawed in a literary sense. I'd recommend it for anyone who wants something more than a mere page turner but something less than true literary fiction - for that, Kristin Lavransdatter is where to cast your eye."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"In the mid-21st century time travel has been perfected and is used by historians as a method of exposing oneself to one's research. Kivrin, a British history student, uses time travel as a means of exploring the Middle Ages. Kivrin goes back to a small village of the period. There, with the aid of a device that allows her to understand the locals (they speak Middle English ya know!), she becomes a part of the village...and faces, along with them, their darkest hours.The research Willis must have performed to put this book together had to have been enormous. Indeed, I heard that she spent no less than five years putting all the research together. Whatever the time spent in library for this book, Willis made it more than payoff. Her detail of an English village in the Middle Ages is EXQUISITE. Very few authors can truly put one into the setting of the story...Willis accomplishes this feat with grace. One word of warning: Parts of this book are quite depressing...so one should not undertake this book if one expects to walk away from it (whether one has completed it or is just breaking for tea) with a jovial spirit. This being said, Willis has sculpted a true work of art that should certainly be shared with as many people as possible."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Winner of both the Hugo and Nebula Awards for science fiction, this book is a tour de force that is sure to captivate all those who love time travel themes, as well as those who have a deep appreciation for medieval history. The author masterfully melds these two genres, creating a novel that is riveting and highly entertaining.The year is 2048 A.D., and a young history student named Kivrin is preparing to do an on site study of the turbulent fourteenth century. Her mission has placed two of the University's professors at cross purposes, as the proponent for this study, Mr. Gilchrist, finds himself pitted against Mr. Dunworthy, Kivrin's mentor, who believes that this trip in time is far too dangerous. Mr. Gilchrist, however, is in the position to have the final say on the project.Kivrin is scheduled to land in the rural English countryside of the fourteenth century some twenty years before the Black Death savages England. Armed with the knowledge of fourteenth century customs, dress, languages, religious practices, and history, Kivrin is raring to go back in time. When she travels back, however, an unforeseen crisis in the present places Kivrin in a potentially deadly situation upon her arrival in the past.The book alternates between what is happening in the present and what is happening in the past, as those in the present work to unravel the mystery of what went wrong. Meanwhile, Kivrin struggles to overcome the anomalous situations she encounters that run contra to her expectations. Believing herself stranded in the past, Kivrin artfully maneuvers around the precarious situations in which she finds herself, never losing her humanity despite the horror of her situation, given what went wrong.Steeped in well-researched medieval life, it is the story of Kivrin's sojourn in the past that captures the imagination of the reader. This is a stunning book that is totally gripping. The spellbound reader will definitely keep turning the pages of this wonderful book, which is clearly written by a master storyteller. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"_The Doomsday Book_ is one of the most unusual pieces of science fiction I think I've ever read. It's not what you'd typically expect in a science fiction novel - most of the action takes place in the very low-tech world of England's Middle Ages. It's also not really historical fiction. While well researched, the book doesn't flesh out the details enough to qualify in that category either. I guess this book is really just about people and how they react in a crisis. I don't think I've ever been as moved by fictional characters as I have by Ms. Booth's in this novel. No, there's not a lot of adventure here. If that's what you like, you'll hate this book.

I respected the five years of work that went into it, the Hugo and Nebula awards it earned, and the recommendation by friends. I expected something rich and detailed, something that would draw me in and not want to let go. What I got was a &quot;whole lotta nothing.&quot; Had this book been a third of its near 600-page length it might have been a tight, moving story. As it is, the characters have seemingly eons of time to wander through, both forwards and backwards.The book contains two stories running in parallel. In the 'modern' one (actually several decades from now) Kivrin, a young Oxford historian, is sent back in time to 1320 despite great misgivings by her professor, James Dunworthy. Dunworthy spends the next several weeks trying to make sure she's all right and can return home, a formidable task due to an epidemic that has broken out at the college and a hopelessly ignorant department head who organized the 'drop.' The second story deals with Kivrin's experiences in the past, and her own battles against ignorance and illness. The ever-present questions are, &quot;will Kivrin get home?&quot; &quot;will she die in the past?&quot; &quot;will everyone die in the future?&quot; and &quot;can any of this be stopped?&quot;When I say &quot;ever-present&quot; that's exactly (unfortunately) what I mean. 200 pages into Doomsday Book I thought that I'd never read so much of so little. 400 pages in, when then modern folks learn an important (and obvious since about page 20) fact about Kivrin's trip back in time, I thought that at last we could move forward. And we did, a little, but not much, and not enough.So what fills 600 pages? The same questions, over and over again. The same characters, exhibiting the same behavior that they did in their first appearance. The same technical information, repeated constantly. And a minimal story, about two separate epidemics. Even these are reported more as casualty lists than personal reactions to illness and death. Ms. Willis gives us little opportunity to truly inhabit either world, holding us at a distance with endlessly repeated facts. The large group of characters never seem more than one-dimensional props, conveniently there to manipulate the story when needed. The biggest question mark is Dunworthy and his obsession with Kivrin. His colleagues and friends are dying around him and he thinks only of a student, not even his personal student. Why? He doesn't develop this feeling over the course of time; he's plopped in that way and stays so until the end. Nothing changes, the other deaths barely touch him; it's Kivrin start to finish. And we're never told why. I thought at least that we'd be treated to some kind of love story, but no. It just is what it is, another fact we're to accept.What is perhaps most aggravating about Doomsday Book is that some of the facts it loves are manipulated so as to make little or no sense. For instance, a large part of the book deals with the difficulty of getting someone on the phone, leaving a message, or even finding a phone to use. Dunworthy resorts to having characters wait in his room to take messages for him while he's out. This would seem absurd even today, and I would imagine that in an age where time travel is possible people would not have discontinued the use of cell phones, voice mail, or even answering machines. The Medieval world has incongruities as well, as when Willis describes a landscape after a fresh snowfall, where roads show up as black lines. How is this possible? A) it just snowed. B) Everyone is dead, so no one has traveled lately. C) presumably the plow hasn't just gone through. These roads would be covered in white snow, just like everything else. It's obvious to us, but it's crucial to the story that they be black, so they're black.The late film critic Gene Siskel had a wonderful question when reviewing a movie; &quot;Is this film more interesting than a documentary of the same actors having lunch?&quot; I'd apply that here in this form; &quot;Is this book more interesting than the author's research materials?&quot; I'd have to say no; I did learn things about Medieval life, but found myself wanting to read the original sources in order to complete the sketchy picture. Kivrin arrives in the past in a haze of illness, but the fog never seems to clear, and we see little of how this life actually affects her beyond a historical-document feeling. The most ridiculous element is perhaps that she's supposed to be viewed as a saint sent by God to help the locals through this time. This is not shown to us by anything the characters do or say; it's simply stated to us. Without backing it up with actions or reactions it means nothing. It's just another fact, weak and debatable."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"&quot;The Doomsday Book&quot; is an astonishing, gripping, stunning intertwining of time travel with two possible doomsday scenarios, one in the mid-21st century, the other the real Black Death of 1348-49 in England. The student historian Kivrin Engle wants to go to the Middle Ages, and she's supported by a thwarted medievalist, Gilchrist, who finally gets his hands on the power to send her there. Willis kills off quite a few sympathetic characters, in the remorseless fashion of Renaissance tragedy. Others survive, though changed by the action, in the best tradition of comedy. In some ways it's frustrating to read, because almost all the &quot;good&quot; characters are themselves terribly frustrated, but after the first hundred pages this thing is almost impossible to put down. On the 21st century side there are a lot of light, even farcical, touches (for example, the pressing need for &quot;lavatory paper,' and William Gaddson's ability to attract any number of young women) that relieve some of the inevitable grimness enjoined by the circumstances. I read this book, despite its length, in a 24-hour period, and cannot get it out of my mind. The detail is wonderful, the plots are wonderful, the morals strike deeply. What a book!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"&quot;Doomsday Book&quot; is probably the best book I've ever read. It occasionally still drives me nuts waiting for the real action to start, but every time I re-read it I discover something I missed. The writing alone is worth reading just to be enjoyed, even during the slow beginning.I read an incredible amount of historical fiction, and Doomsday Book is one of the only books I've ever read that sounded authentic. For once the medieval characters really seemed medieval, not just 20th century people in costumes. Also about the characters, the reviewers who say they seemed flat must not have been paying enough attention! Sure, a lot of the characters (Gilchrist and Latimer especially) were archetypal. But they all still had enough personality of their own to be very real people. Gilchrist and Latimer almost became sympathetic characters at the end when you realize that they were vulnerable too, which is quite a feat considering how they start out. Several, like Father Roche and Eliwys, are not easily categorized at all. Father Roche was a typical saint-like figure but still was human enough to have carnal thoughts about Kivrin and shout at Imeyne. Eliwys was a loving mother but, firstly, never resolved her feelings about Gawyn (notice the scene where she sends him to Bath to get Guillame) and, secondly, had her own problems and priorities and could sometimes be snobbish or cruel, unlike most stereotypical good mothers. You can also see the family resemblance between her and Rosemund just clearly enough to make it interesting. Connie Willis's people are *human*. They do make dumb mistakes and have personality flaws, just like the rest of us.But what really makes the book great isn't the characters or the story, but the writing. Anybody can write a book about a bunch of medieval villagers, but only Connie Willis could have written the scene where Rosemund dies. It just rips me apart every time. Also the scene where Father Roche quotes Romans to Kivrin after they bury Agnes, when he tries to help her stop being angry at God. And who can read &quot;You are here in place of the friends I love&quot; without crying?What a great book. Everyone should read it. It really does a great job of showing how much all people have in common. It's a nice change to read a SF book with real people and themes in it, not just stereotypes of good and evil and everybody getting exactly what they deserve in the end."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I should start by saying science fiction is not my usual genre. I have recently been reading historical fiction, and the reference to the Middle Ages in The Doomsday Book is what drew me in. After reading the book, what strikes me most are the parallels I believe the author was attempting to draw between the 14th and 21st century. Not only does she lay the story lines side by side in alternating chapters, but the literary imagery of the ringing bells and ever-present weather in both centuries unifies the opposing times. It might seem that the 21st century, with its technology, in time travel and communication, it's virtual eradication of most diseases, would have little in common with the superstition and ignorance of the 14th century. Her characters, however, in both centuries, display many similar characteristics. There is lust, passion, jealousy, greed, and thirst for power. Listening to Lady Imeyne, I found myself saying, &quot;That's Mrs. Gaddison.&quot; And when both centuries are beset with mysterious and terrifying diseases, reactions of fear, panic and misunderstanding are common. The protesting students with placards of the 21st century are the doomsayers of the 14th. What makes us fully human, our wealth of emotion, is ageless. But within ourselves is also hope, love, compassion and bravery, the Father Roches and Mr. Dunworthy's of the world. There is the innocence and wonder of Agnes and Colin. The human spirit has a remarkable ability to survive devastation, and that is for me, the message of The Doomsday Book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I love this book. I have read it dozens of times, and every time it rips at my heartstrings. So many reviewers have sung its praises that there's almost nothing they haven't already said, but some things bear repeating.If you are tired of time-travel books where all the characters exhibit contemporary philosophies and politics, this book is for you. If you like a good, gut-wrenching cry every now and then, get your Kleenex ready. If you've ever wondered how a carillon-ringing group works, then by all means dive right in.The basic plot of the book is fairly simple by fantasy standards. A modern university student is sent through time to the era of the Black Death, while pestilence sweeps her own era. The action switches back and forth between the two time periods. It sounds basic, but the unparalleled character development and unflinching look at the hardships of life in any century make this book truly unforgettable. Connie Willis's characters are flawed, funny, angry, *human* people who will suck you in to their world without apology.I just cannot praise this book enough. The historical accuracy, gripping plot, and generally outstanding prose make it a must have for any reader, not just a fan of sf/fantasy."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This novel held me in its grip for the better part of 3 days and some of the scenes and images still haunt me nearly two years after having read it. Connie Willis has certainly done her research on conditions in the Fourteenth century and the plague, as well as creating some intriguing characters. This novel is also more emotionally intense that some of her other work, which tends to be lighter and more entertaining. Although time travel is necessary to set up the plot, the sci-fi aspects of the work are actually pretty minimal. Life in the 21st century doesn't seem all that different from today, with a few technological exceptions. It seems like Willis has concentrated most of her energy on making the scenes from the 14th century as vivid as possible and in this lies the real strength of the book. The book's beauty and horror are only accentuated by the Christmas season setting."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"How do you gauge the success of a book... Try reading it years ago, packing it up in a box, stumbling across it unexpectedly years later, and recalling the haunting beauty of it immediately.Doomsday is not a standard novel. It does not fit into a standard genre, but it does tell a marvellous story that is moving, thought provoking, and ultimately truly memorable. The medieval people are particularly good - I agree with the reviewer who said that for once these were not 20th century people in fancy dress, but you really got a glimpse of how humans from a different time may have thought. What imagination and what a gift it is to read it!Not only is this a wonderful book, it improves on rereading. for a few dollars and you get a new way of looking at the world - what more could you ask for...read and enjoy,amf"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I rarely read fiction for historical accuracy. If the errors are glaring and remove me from the story then it affects my enjoyment of the book. But I found none of that in &quot;The Doomsday Book&quot;. Connie Willis brought the Middle Ages to life for me and made me feel the difficulty in living during this dark time. Kivrin, the time-traveling historian, is the perfect go-between, explaining for us, living for us, observing for us.On the other side of the time tunnel is Mr. Dunworthy, her instructor. He, too, is an observor, guiding us through a 2048 not so distant from our present time. In fact, I was surprised at how similar this future was to the one envisioned by Terry Gilliam in the film &quot;Brazil&quot; - futuristic, yet archaic at the same time. They can travel through time, but they are still gulping down pills to treat illness. They have videophones, but the concept of a cell phone seems foreign.I finished this book this morning, as I walked to work and I found myself weeping at the hopelessness of life during the Plague. I got to know the characters, to feel for them, to root for their survival, but Willis knows better than to give us a false happy ending. It's not a completely depressing ending, but the happy is mitigated, as it should be.Willis takes a long time to get going, keeping us in suspense through artificial means, but they payoff is great. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I probably would have enjoyed this book more if it had not won the Hugo and Nebula awards. As it was, my expectations were far too high. The future characters are stupid and tend to pass out before they can reveal important information. This would have been a stronger book at 300 pages. The character development for the past was pretty good, but be ready for tragedy. Not the &quot;feel good&quot; book of the nineties."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I find it curious that of everyone I've spokento who's read this book, everyone seems to eitherlove it or hate it. Which also seems to be thegeneral tenor of the reviews appearing on thissite.Overall, I was extremely impressed by thisbook. Medieval history has always been one of myfavorite subjects, and Willis' exhaustive researchhas made the sections of her book set in thistime period unflinchingly realistic. It was notan age of reason; it was an age when the churchwas the source of all knowledge and God was theultimate authority. Reading medieval history, weare led to understand why so much fantasy fictionis set in this period; it was a time when thedistinction between physical and spiritual wasmuch more blurred than it is now.Willis hasworked hard to create believable medieval people,and for the most part has succeeded, in that Ifound myself sympathizing with characters whoseworldview is fundamentally different from my own.As any science fiction fan knows, creating abelievable alien culture -- one that issympathetic, but still alien -- is an extremelydifficult challenge. Creating believablecharacters from another time and place canscarcely be less of a challenge.That said, thesections of the book set in the modern period werenot as strong, and mostly seemed to have beenwritten to create obstacles that would allowKivrin to endure her ordeal in 1348. Dependingon how you like your plot, the constantbureaucracy and the chaos of a modern viraloutbreak either add overwhelmingly to the tensionor drive you to distraction. Not being too farremoved from the academic realm, I found theseareas of the book quite believable, and for themost part well done. There were just a few toomany of them.I tend to prefer character-oriented fiction over idea-oriented fiction, and I greatly enjoyed &quot;Bellwether&quot;, which was written by the same author. There, as here, the actual hard science content was fairly minimal, and if nuts and bolts are what you like, I suggest looking elsewhere. I found the story itself extremely strong, and an excellent impetus to resume some history reading."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I found this book an easy read and entertaining enough to finish it. However, as others have pointed out, there are many unnecessary repetitions: Whenever there's a description of what's happening to Kivrin, the female protagonist, we are often treated to a description of almost the exact same scene in 1st person in the form of a transcription from Kivrin's recorder implant. It would have been much better if the author had let Kivrin narrate her own experiences in the parts about the 14th century instead of switching between 3rd and 1st person."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I won't go into a lengthy synopsis since there are already so many. I loved the detail that Connie Willis put into this novel. She weaves history, the future, and public policy into a great story. The character descriptions were wonderful. I enjoyed this book tremendously."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I've been meaning to read this one since I read \\"To Say Nothing of the Dog\\" (which, by the way, I highly recommend). I hesitated because \\"Dog\\" was so very light-hearted, and that was why I loved it, whereas this one sounded far more serious. And it was, but in what an amazing way! Willis is never heavy-handed, and navigates future- and past-England with equal ease. In the hands of another author, this plot could have been much to repetitive and much too lengthy. What makes it work is her unparalleled skill in character description and development. Each and every one of her characters, from the heroes to the obnoxious Americans, is distinctly human and recognizable. This, combined with her signature wit, results in a book that is touching, suspenseful, insightful, and humorous, in all the right places."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Along about the middle of the book I discovered the right way to approach it... every fifth or sixth page or so pick a paragraph at random and read it until you get to the end of the story.."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I bought and read this book a long time ago, whenit first came out on paperback. I rememberdistinctly that I thought it was very flat; Iwas not at all impressed. Guess they're givingawards based upon the amount of research thatgoes into writing a book, not how interesting,engrossing, or compelling it is."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I was hesitant to read this book because something about a 14th century setting just did not appeal to me. I imagined medieval sword fights, castle sieges, lute-playing jesters (ha!), and such stuff I have little interest in. But it is not that at all. It is a beautiful and moving story of people loving and helping others despite their coming from cultures separated by hundreds of years. This is what I call \\"speculative fiction\\" as opposed to science fiction, where the science is minimized and used mainly to provide an unusual setting for a unique story about humanity. \\"Doomsday Book\\" made me laugh and made me cry, and it is one of my favorite works of fiction."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book is a compelling read, not significantly marred by some oddly low-tech characteristics of Ms. Willis's world of the future. Her writing style conveys the manic, driven, repetitive thought processes of people under extreme stress. I had trouble putting it down, especially for the last third of the book. This is NOT a traditional science fiction 'comic book without the pictures'. It's a compelling story of people soldiering on, finding a way to do the best they can, in nearly impossible circumstances. Most intellectually post-adolescent readers will love this book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I purchased Doomsday Book on a very high recommendation from a professor. He expounded on the various merits of the novel and I was excited to sit down and read it. He proclaimed that the story showed how you can never draw accurate conclusions about anything in life till you're lived it and been there. He also remarked on the fine character development and closeness you feel to the individuals.So, he might have exaggerated a bit. Starting with such high hopes I might have led myself down the path of disappointment, but I feel my conclusion about the story was more accurate than the professors. The main character, Kivrin, is an ambitious student of the future. Her dream is to travel back in time, to the especially dangerous era of Medieval times. Well, because of some bureaucratic errors and upsets Kivrin instead is sent too far back; back to the deadly and highly dangerous time period of the Black Death. A lot of the conclusions historians had drawn about the people of that time period were found to be inaccurate at best. Kivrin learns the truth about life in that time, and death. I did not find her the most endearing of the characters though. Her mentor and close friend at the university was the only character I truly grew attached to. I ached as he ached, wanting to save Kivrin from what was surely a painful demise. And though, conclusions can be drawn as my professor made, the book itself never states it outright. It is clearly shown how you can NEVER be sure till you've experienced something yourself; but the author never states that idea pointedly.I enjoyed reading Doomsday Book for it's fantastical time travel and the portrayal of past and future. Though the book had endearing individuals, I did not find myself knowing as much as I would have liked to know about them; and therefore did not become very attached to the characters. Near the conclusion of the novel, I found myself becoming slightly annoyed and bored because it felt like Willis was dragging out the ending and by that point you really want to know what happens so you can put the book down. I did enjoy many of the underlying themes of the story, but you have to be able to really think and pick them out for yourself. If you enjoy lengthy novels that don't flat out smack you in the face with their message, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Many reviewers have covered the book's slow pacing, the anachronistic 1950s technology, the fact that the characters in 2048 are much less vibrant than those in 1348. I agree with all of this; had I not been on an 11-hour flight I would have given up on this book after 200 dragged-out pages.Willis' setting of modern Oxford was laughable. (One five-star reviewer raves about her marvelous setting of Cambridge, so I'm not sure he even read the same book I did.) Her geography of the area around Brasenose College is sketchy and incorrect, and I had no sense whatsoever of this city where so much of the book takes place. I cannot believe she visited even once. And although she spen an lot of time on the research, she only thanks one librarian in the acknowledgements, which seems awfully suspicious for a 600 page novel steeped in history. (Look at the acknowledgements page of any historical non-fiction book and you'll see what I mean.)Just as I dislike Convenient Weather (i.e. the plot is stormy and therefore it is lashing with rain), I despise Convenient Deaths. The clerk drags out for days and days in an ugly manner, finally dying with an ulcerated eye, having said nothing coherent. Roche, on the other hand, dies swiftly and gracefully, whispering beautiful last words. Much of the plague section reads realistically (the cows wandering around unmilked), though it's all very repetitive and heavy-handed.Why wasn't Kivrin's translator working in the early parts of her visit to 1348? Was it because the language had shifted so dramatically (something that was, in fact, well foreshadowed) that her language training literally had that little use? The fact that the translator adapted to the spoken language, figuring it all out from context, was a nice bit of SF. But if the language difficulty was due to it being the wrong year, I wanted some mention of it. And with all the repetitive infodumping, I would have liked some attention paid to how a language could shift so much as to be unrecognizable. Perhaps it could--I have no idea--but it isn't so obvious as to be glossed over without mention.Finally, some reviewers have commented on the fact that Basingame is searched for throughout the book, then forgotten. Others have suggested that Roche should have been a future time traveler (else why state THREE TIMES that he prays in the SAME WAY Kivrin talks into her own corder). I was waiting for Roche to *be* Basingame. Alas, that's more of a plot twist than this book could provide."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"First impressions are so important. I'd seen this book on a list of Hugo winners and was looking for something new to read. If this is an good example of Willis' writing, I certainly won't be bothering to read anything else by her. Without going into too much detail, I'll just echo what some others have said: boring, repetitive and with many irrelevant details that did nothing to further the story line. How in the world did this win a Hugo??"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"How in the world can anyone give this more than two stars? I tried to enjoy this book - I kept looking for that surprise or unique event. The story is ridiculous in so many regards, but for me the most outrageous is the author's painful need to explain EVERY SINGLE DETAIL of EVERY SINGLE MINUTE of the characters' days - like the publisher paid by the word! And as Anna Keaney-Dullea said, some of the details would have been ridiculous years ago, let alone fifty years from now.Also, this book has almost nothing to do with time travel. The story could have been written with one character in Great Britain and another somewhere in Africa.This author can construct coherent sentences. Too bad because there are way too many in this one. I would have edited out 2/3 of this book as meaningless babble.Spend your money elsewhere."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Maybe I'm too demanding, or maybe too we'll read in the sub genre of postapocalyptic u/dystopias. This book is just utterly poorly written.The author is evidently not a native speaker of British English, yet foolishly makes the mistake of setting this novel in Britain, in a society and a language she barely understands. Is this a public school? A grammar school? Oxford University? All possibilities are mished into one mash within the first ten pages. And no, the British do not go on \\"vacation\\", not even the faux idiomatic neologism of the author's own devising: \\"vac\\".Grating, jarring. The writing gets in the way of a story, which I didn't have the patience to discover."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"FAIR WARNING: Connie Willis's writing -- and this book -- is for readers with more than five-minute/computer game/Zombie-novel-of-the-week attention span -- and readers who enjoy the sometimes humorous, sometimes frustrating but always moving situations that well-drawn characters get themselves into in the course of life. (By the way: the novel was written well _before_ the latest onslaught of technology brought us the annoying reality of a cellphone/ipod/computer game in nearly every sweaty hand on the planet; a lot of H.G. Well's novels, and Robert Heinlein's novels, were written before certain bits of technology was available. That doesn't make them any less readable -- one simply needs to be bright enough to understand that).Gearing up for reading BLACKOUT (and then ALL CLEAR), and I just finished re-reading DOOMSDAY BOOK. As before, it held up to another go round. As with much of the best of Willis's writing, there are plenty of frustrating characters (like Gilchrist) whose stupidity sets up stumbling blocks along the way. In this case, it ensures that Kivrin (favorite student of Mr. Dunworthy) will be sent back in time when things are most definitely _not_ all clear. And although there is much sturm und drang (much worry) about whether Kivrin will be vulnerable to the plague and criminals and such, it is the usual failings of mankind (in the future) that put her and the project at risk (reviewers complaining of such a development show a clear lack of understanding when it comes to human nature -- just look around at the world today). And the nature of Kivrin's -- and future London's, as well as the rest of the world in 2054 -- delimma is _very_ timely!What's more, Willis's depiction of medeival England not only makes the reader feel as if she or he has, indeed, been transported to that era...it reads like an encounter with an alien species (and if a modern-day human COULD travel back in time to that era, it would be just so: different languages, different manners of dress and behavior, etc., etc.).Equal parts comedy (of the screwball type, replete with frustating situations caused by spot-on descriptions of human behavior) and drama, DOOMSDAY BOOK remains a classic."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"When this was selected as my book club book du mois, I was incredibly put-off by the \\"science fiction / historical fiction\\" labels, which signified my two least favorite genres. Now, having finished the book, I have really enjoyed it and have found it to really just be a good story with deeply described characters I became increasingly engaged with throughout the novel. As a review before stated, there is no hard science and the time travel aspect is merely a device to set up the plot, which cleverly intertwined the two times.My only complaint is that there are strings left unanswered, that seemed just to serve the purpose of furthering the plot -- ie: Basingame. I would have loved to see a twist involving him. Also, as always with a good book - I would love to have another chapter added to the story. :)"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I started reading science fiction in fifth grade and by age 50 I have probably read thousands of them. This is one of my favorites. (In fact, The only other time travel story that I enjoyed more than this one was the Anubis Gates by Tim Powers.) The author brought the characters to life in a way that drew me in completely.There is no hard science here, the concept of time travel is just a literary device to set up the story, and is not really played up very much. The main storylines are the events in the past relating to our time travelling hero, and the actions in the present of the people who sent her.Like all well written time travel books, there are lots of threads that have to be skillfully managed and the author does a wonderful job."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I am an avid historical fiction reader and was alittle tentative about reading a sci-fi book about time travel. A kind member of my book club chose it because she wanted the sci-fi factor, but knew that it could be enjoyed by the historical fiction fans, too. It was a good choice.Obviously, as a result of my preference for history, I very much enjoyed the chapters related to the medievel times. The scenes were realistic and informative and the relationships between the characters were easily conveyed. The present day scenes(or actually the future) were alittle more contrived and far-fetched and the characters had alittle too much of a superhero feel to them. However, the author did a wonderful job of using characters and metaphors to show the intricate relationship between the two time periods.The book did get alittle long at times (especially in the middle)and Mr. Dunworthy's neverending obstacle-filled battle to rescue Kivrin could have been shortened by 100+ pages, but I do understand how the author used the struggle to build the suspense. And while I couldn't wait to see what happened at the end (I really had no preconceived ideas), I was eventually disappointed with the quick and hurried, perfect superhero ending. I won't give it away. But Ms. Willis must have done something right because this book won so many awards.All in all, an enjoyable read and I'm glad it was chosen by my group as it was not something I would have picked up otherwise. Definitely a page-turner and worth the time."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I must of read over three thousand and twenty six great reads in my life and all of them were just that, including many Spidermans and The Incredible Hulks and a Jonathan Livingstone Seagull. This one read, The Doomsday Book by Connie Willis, is definitively science fiction as it has a time machine in it, and so I am disinterested in hearing anybody say it isn't science fiction. Fortuitously, most people realize just that. So anyway, The Doomsday Book is my very favorable read of all the reads I must of ever read, and hopefully all those sad, hopeless people who don't appreciate it yet will hopefully realize what a great read it is, when they hopefully reread it again and again. (One possibilistic analyzation of why they didn't like it is it makes you half to really think and they didn't want to half to really think.)"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"...and Connie Willis is not one of them. Like _To Say Nothing of the Dog_, _Doomsday Book_ manages to be madcap, bitingly satirical, and poignant all at once.Kudos to Ms. Willis. They don't come any better than this one. But if you're irony-impaired or can't handle a story that does three or four things at once, better go read something less complicated."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I liked the premise of the book, however, I found the characters too stereotyped and unbelievable. You have the overbearing and overprotective mother, a overly incompetent back stabbing Assistant Head, a secretary that complains constantly about a lack of toilet paper, visiting Americans that obsess about missing their bell concert in the middle of a epidemic, a Casanova undergraduate who seems to have a affair with every woman in the book including much older nuns! The rest of the minor characters seem to be living in a fantasy world without realizing what is going on. Only the two major characters seem realistic. The plot of the story is okay, rescuing the heroine from the past. The actual time the heroine spends in the past is spent rather blandly, but I like the historical background. If you're looking for a SF book this isn't it. Other than the fact that the story occurs in the future and time travel is involved there is very little science. The story runs on the plot of the rescue and I really wouldn't call this an adventure novel. If you like history, especially Medieval England, and fiction, you'll like this book. If you want believable characters that you don't roll your eyes at every statement, avoid this book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I notice that a lot of people really like this book, but I found it very irritating. It takes until page 386 before the author gets to the point. In the meantime she uses and re-uses a couple of really irritating devices: characters constantly repeating factual information, like the symptoms of various diseases or constantly going over their concerns about someone's welfare; or character's about to find out some crucial piece of information but constantly being frustrated by some minor mishap. I get enough of this kind of thing every day at work and don't need to read it time after time in a book. The basic idea of this book is good and the last quarter of it moves along at a reasonably good pace. But it takes a long time to get there and I almost put it down several times."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I cannot understand what people like about thisnovel. I could barely finish it.

It doesn't.The characters are completely unreal and theyseem to be controlled by &quot;artificial stupidity.&quot; Whenever there is a simple and obvious thing to do which would probably resolve the wholesituation, theyinstead do something silly to advance the plot.It is also virulently anti-technology.

This book was boring and shallow. It seems promising at first, and the story line has potential (sending a historian back in time to the 1300's) , but it is really a huge disappointment. The historian is sent back to the Middle Ages within the first 15 pages, and the next 350 pages are agonizingly boring, filled with one dimensional characters ( the hateful mother in law, the overprotective mother, the self-important bureaucrat, the good scientist... and on and on) Not one of these characters ever does anything out of character. And worse, the author tackles themes that prove to be light years beyond her ability: Life and Death, Goodness and Evil, God and Man. I urge readers not to waste their precious time and money on this book. There are too many well-written sci-fi books that one could read instead."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Oh dear, I see the point of the negative reviews. A great idea (thus two stars, not one), but done so badly. So much repetition, so little character development, such a slow plodding pace. I'm half way through it.

Also within my price range. Important to me."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book takes us through three waves of illness. One is a bad flu that hits a 21st century university during Christmas break. This wave is poorly written with several running jokes that (1) are not funny and (2) destroy any feeling for the deaths that occur.The other two waves occur in the Middle Ages. We get a lengthy story of the illness of a time travelling student/historian, followed by a separate plague that strikes the other characters.The story of the final plague is moving. Unfortunately, it is only about 100 pages of a 600 page book. And by the time you reach it, you have had an overdose of high fevers, racking pains, and drifting in and out of consciousness.The Hugo and Nebula awards for this book are unfathomable. Affirmative action for female science fiction writers?"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Some SF survives the test of time because the author has a good working knowledge of technology and a reasonable view of the future, and also the ability to separate the story from the technology. Connie Willis displays neither in this book.In a nutshell, the majority of the tension is created by the fact that no one can get in touch with anyone else because they keep leaving messages that don't get delivered with people that answer the landline phone....in the year 2048 AD. This book was written in the late 80s/early 90s, mobile phones were not unknown. Forget about forecasting things like cell phones, beepers, IMs, text messages, call forwarding, e-mail or any sort of modern communications technology. To not even project technology already present into the future is a sign of poor science fiction research, and then to build so much of the tension in a novel based on this rather silly omission is just poor writing.I gave two stars because the parts set in medieval England are actually quite good. Drop out all the nonsense set in the future and this would make a decent novel if expanded. But as it is, this book is highly overrated because it is just kind of silly and annoying, and will seem as dated as John Carter on Mars."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I \\"discovered\\" Connie Willis when researching about the winners of the Hugo and Nebula Awards. This author has an impressive number of those important awards of science-fiction, either with her novels, novellas or short stories. Her most known books are \\"To say nothing of the dog\\" and \\"Doomsday book\\". While \\"To say nothing of the dog\\" is almost like a comedy, set in the Vitorian Era in England, \\"Doomsday book\\" is a much more somber and serious tale, set in Medieval Oxford.Both books are set in the near future and deal with time-traveling, and both share some of their characters, such as Mr. Dunworthy, the scholar responsible for Balliol's Time Net, in Oxford. This time he was overruled by a Mr. Gilchrist (the equivalent of Lady Scrhapnell in the other book) who has sent Kivrin, a Medieval specialist, to the 14th century. However, everything that can possibly go wrong happens after young Kivrin is sent to the past. In the 21st century, a misterious virus starts a new pandemic, and the time-specialists team gets crippled real fast. On the other hand Kivrin, in the past, struggles against a world that is different from everyhting she had studied about it; besides, she is very sick herself, and, after some days in the past, she seems to notice that maybe she was sent to the wrong year.Willis has created a very interesting set of rules to time-traveling. These rules create the plot around which the story evolves. And what a great story it is. In the beginning, the chapters are very confused, as are the characters and the situations they live. As the book goes on, however, Willis skillfully writes a very dark story of loss, sickness and superation. Some of the characters are unforgettable, like the industrious Kivrin, the saintly Father Roche, the dedicated Mr. Dunworthy and the apocalyptic Colin. The final chapter is apotheotic.No wonder \\"Doomsday book\\" won both the Nebula AND the Hugo. It's one of the greatest books of the genre that I've read.Grade 9.0/10"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is one of my favorite books that I've read recently. A combination of Historical Fiction and Science Fiction, Doomsday Book is engaging, interesting, and educational.In the future, the secret to time travel has been discovered, but it is only used for academic purposed, for nothing can be brought back from the past. The corporations that were funding the initial endeavors lost interest and pulled their funding when they discovered that they weren't going to be able to pillage the past for it's treasures.Historians have a completely different perspective and they can't resist the opportunity to explore the time periods that they have been studying through books and artifacts. Mostly, they've been exploring the 20th century, for that is the only time period that they can be sure that their researchers are going to be safe, but recently the 14th century has been opened up for exploration as well.Kirvin, the first historian to go back to the 14th century, is excited about going and has a fairly simple job. She just has to come up with appropriate clothes and a story for why she's traveling alone. The people who are staying behind monitoring her trip, however, have much more to do and many more worries.The worries pan out when something goes horribly wrong, trapping Kirvin somewhere in the past, only not when she was supposed to be.The two storylines-the future and the past- are equally engaging and entertaining. The technology of the future contrasts with the simplicity of the past, but the events and the reactions to them are remarkably similar, despite the 700-year time difference.This fascinating look into what life might have been like in the past is combined with a gripping storyline, and well-developed, interesting characters that the reader comes to genuinely care about. The link between the future and the past makes everything flow despite the jumps back and forth between the time periods.The little details that are included about both the past and the future make both time periods come to life in vivid (or not so vivid) color. The reader feels like he or she is there, feels the terror, the worry, and the hope. It was a book I found hard to put down.In addition to being an engaging story, Doomsday Book also deals with the themes of hope, sacrifice, and suffering, as well as how we as human beings react to them. Even in the darkest times of the dark ages there was still hope and even in the brightest futures there is still fear and suffering. They are eternal and undying, but it is how they are reacted to that matters. Doomsday Book shows this admirably.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes Fantasy, Historical Fiction, or Science Fiction. It deserved its Nebula Award."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is one of the worst books I've read. I can't believe a book this bad can get published, much less winning any awards!First, volume does not equal good writing. More than 60% of the book is filled with irrelevant, useless, repetitive, and tedious information that does not add anything to the story. The author seems to think that the more pages she can fill, the better the writing, which is simply a ridiculous notion. In fact, her writing style is neither sophisticated nor elegant. The author piles on minute detail after minute details without any consideration as to whether such details are superfluous to the story.Second, there is not a bit of originality or novelty or creativity in the plot or the characters. The plot is over-used and completely predictable, and all the characters are stereotypes. As such, the story and the characters lack of any depth and are completely unbelievable!Third, the mysteries and conflicts are entirely artificial. Suspense is not created by not providing information to the readers. At the very beginning of the book, the readers find out that there is \\"something wrong\\" with the time travel. It's not until 70% into the book that the readers get to find out this \\"something\\" is that the historian is sent to the wrong year. In order to artificially prolong this so-called suspense, the author makes all her characters refuse to answer simple questions for 70% of the book. Similarly, conflicts should not result from characters behaving irrationally or unbelievable circumstances. In the middle of the 21st century where time travel is possible, not a single character carries a mobile telephone or some sort of mobile communication device. The department head goes on vacation without a single soul, including his wife, knowing his whereabouts. An experienced archeologist excavates ancient tombs without taking any safety precautions. A crazy and overbearing woman, who has no business and no reason to be in this story in the first place, is free to roam quarantined hospital rooms full of infectious and dying patients to read them doomsday scriptures.Last but not least, the author has absolutely no scientific knowledge, not even the very basics, to make a time travel story even remotely believable. It's laughable to suggest that a person from the future traveling 700 years into the past and interacting with people in the past would have no effect to the timeline, or that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the passing of time in the present and the passing of time in the past.The story grows more and more ludicrous as it progresses. By the end of the book I'm so happy and relieved that just about everyone is finally died."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I started this book with high hopes due to it winning both the Hugo and Nebula. My only conclusion is that was an extremely slow year for science fiction publishing (perhaps Connie waited 5 years to strategically time its release). The characters are very one-dimensional, have annoying pointless conversations, and never seem to end up solving anything. The characters are very one-dimensional, have annoying, pointless conversations, and never seem to end up solving anything. The characters are very one-dimensional, have annoying pointless conversations, and never seem to end up solving anything. And the book is as repetitive as this review.I would recommendA Canticle for Leibowitzas a Hugo winner that I enjoyed much more."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"The book tells two stories -- one following the adventures of a time-traveling historian who goes back to the 1300's and one following the university staff who run the equipment used to send her back. I found both stories sort of interesting, maybe a little more so in the future part. However, I cannot recommend this to casual readers. it's way too long, with loads of paragraphs and pages telling us tedious details about the family of the medieval characters, and I especially found the child Agnes trying and a lot of ink is wasted on her \\"exploits.\\" Plus, the author wasn't very clever in foreseeing the future. Lots of frustrating time is spent in the 2048 part trying to find a video-phone that isn't overloaded or in use. Seems cell 'phones must die out in that world since no one has one. And they still rely on books to research stuff, so the Internet has also disappeared. A disappointing read considering all the praise it's gotten."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"The story concerns the Black Plague in 1648 England--a horrible period for humankind.It is well written and exciting-you feel as if you are there in the midst of this awful tragedy -the characters become very real and you care for them-the writer captures in plain simple language the time period and the difficulty of fighting a disease without all our modern knowledge and drugs.There is a sub plot about a modern day plague in England that I feel was used to soften the horrors of the historical drama but even this story is told simply and with a sense of humour.It is a great novel-well done and recommended."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I loved this book.

Just trust that it is really good and start reading."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I completely enjoyed this book - I've looked at a few of the reviews that gave low marks, and I guess that's just a good example of how we all have different tastes.I thought it was a unique storyline; won't go into detail about the plot, as others have already done that. Mostly I just wanted to give my 5 stars to add to the mix. I really, really liked this book and it was one I couldn't wait to get back to."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is what I want to do everytime I pick up this book in an attempt to finish it. I'm currently about 3/4ths of the way through but frankly, everytime I see another book I'd like to read, I put off reading this book again. The majority of the book takes place back in 1348 during the time of the plauge (through time travel) and most of that takes place within the confines of a house in a village. This book just goes nowhere. It is just plain boring. I wanted to like it, especially since another reviewer said it was better than Crichton's &quot;Timeline.&quot; This book is not even in the same league. This is the only book I've ever started that I may not finish. It's that BAD. Do yourself a favor and read &quot;Timeline&quot;"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Dooms Day Book barely crosses the threshold that defines science fiction. However, genre doesn't matter when the work is as engrossing as Willis's. After accelerating to a pace that demands pregnant anticipation, Willis slows down. Plot, character development, and fine writing force the spectacle of time travel to take a back seat to storytelling. Willis walks us to dread and pushes us past it to the point of empathy. We come to care for the personalities she builds; we empathize with difficulties in their lives; we are buoyed by their ability to meet life and then Willis does what good story tellers do: she pulls it all apart. What happens is devastating and it is life. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"...nobody has ever made a movie this good. I have never read any historical fiction this realistic - I was transported right back to the 1300's. There are a few long, boring passages about a flu epidemic in the future - so what?

This book is a classic in my mind, as great as or better than any other."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"It has been over 10 years since I read this book, and I can still remember it clearly. It is not, as many people have said in their reviews, typical sci-fi. The story drama is drawn out without so many twists and turns that I'm used to reading. The black death becomes the main focus of the book, and it's hard to not feel real emotions from such a tragic period. The priest is an awesome character, humble, faithful....it puts humanity on a pedestal."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I always thought science fiction meant \\"Zork from outer space eats space ship\\". Boy was I wrong. After avoiding the science fiction aisle like the the black plague, I got this as a loaner from my brother, and it was terrific! Amazing in historical accuracy with some future technological ideas thrown into the mix, I found it really a creative and imaginative read."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book is recommended for anyone who enjoys time travel books. I loved the time era that it takes you to, back to the 1300's during the Black Plague. It's entertaining as well as a learning experience. This is my second time of reading this book. Hope that it comes out on E-Reader soon!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Time travel is one of my favorite science fiction categories and Doomsday Book does not disappoint in this area. It's very much character based though and anyone seeking a high tech novel should look elsewhere. About all we learn of the time travel method is that there is a device called \\"the net\\" which makes it possible to travel back in time for fixed durations and you have to return to the physical location where you arrived in order to come back to the present.The novel is initially set in mid 21st century England where Kivrin is a history student seeking to go back to the period about 20 years before the onset of the Black Death. One of the things that is made clear from the start is that mid 21st century England isn't exactly a paradise. It seems to rain all the time and there has been a recent devastating pandemic. No one has ever been back as far as the fourteenth century and Kivrin's teacher, Dunworthy, is understandably concerned about traveling there. The trip is made, however, and everything seems to go well until we discover that she has actually been sent to the year 1348, just before the Black death reaches her location. Efforts to locate and rescue Kivrin are complicated by the sudden outbreak of a virulent flu epidemic which disables virtually all the people connected with the time travel project.While fairly slow moving, this book gives an excellent picture of what life in the mid fourteenth century must have been like and in many respects it's not too different from the present day. While there are obviously many technological aids available in the 21st century we see that both time periods are almost equally disabled by a disease outbreak.In general I liked this book a lot but it could possibly have been a bit shorter and still delivered the same impact. A good read though."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This was a very good science fiction book that could have been better had it jusy been a little bit shorter. The momentum of the book sputters to a near-halt in the middle, but it picks up again and builds to a riveting, moving, if grim, climax.I read this book because of the accolades and awrds it had received, and it almost lived up to the hype. It was very well written, and the parts of the book taking place in the middle ages was very vivid, well-researched, and well done. The parts ofthe book taking place in the \\"present day\\" (2055 or thereabouts) was okay but had too many subplots and minor characters. Both plot threads could have lost a few dozen pages, but otherwise this is a very worthwhile book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I read this book 3 years ago and it has haunted me. If you like time travel or history definitely pick up this book! The characters were so &quot;real&quot; and dimensional they had me crying (don't want to give any &quot;spoilers&quot;).You definitely owe it to yourself to read this book and I wish Connie Willis would write more books like this. By the way, if you like this book - check out the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Connie Willis is amazing! I'm not a science fiction reader and yet I stumbled across this book and found myself totally engrossed from the first page to the last. To Say Nothing of The Dog is another one of hers that's absolutely wonderful. By all means, buy these two books."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I'd have to say that this is one of the most interesting books I've ever read. I felt like I was actually taking a trip back in time. The book was engrossing before it got creepy. I had a nightmare about catching the black plague the night after I finished the book. My entire family came down with the disease and it was horrifying. I was actually able to see the effects of the plague as it killed my family members as Connie Willis described in her book. Now I feel that I've had an actual experience of the past and not just from reading the book. Doomsday Book made me think about the aspects of human nature and how it plays into our history. I would have found the book even more interest had it not been so long. Connie Willis wasted a lot of time talking about things that are irrelevant (to me). I would have preferred a movie or the abridged version instead."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I really enjoyed reading this a couple of years ago, and now that I'm addicted to my Kindle, I'd like to reread it! Could you PLEASE make it available on the Kindle soon?It's THAT good!"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"First and foremost what I have to say isn't going to be popular with those that love this book. But I'm going to say it anyway. This book suffers from what I always refer to as \\"An author who absolutely loves the sound of their own voice.\\" Trust me Connie Willis loves the sound of her own words so much she tries to choke us with them. My biggest problem with reading this book is trying to get past whole pages that describe something as simple as bumping into someone on the street. That's how this entire book reads. Take for instance the interpreter not working properly. A good editor would have said \\"Look 2 pages would be sufficient in explaining this and sending the message to your readers. They aren't as dumb as you believe them to be.\\" Instead, the editor and the author had to make sure all of us idiot readers could understand what was happening so they stretched paragraphs into multiple chapters so that we, the low intelligent readers, could understand something we understood immediately.The author commits so many fouls involving her audience that in my eyes she loses respect. She may be smarter than most of us who will read her book but we will never truly know will we. Unless I can get her to take a MENSA test while I sit beside her taking the same exact test. I'll even give you a good example. She flaunts this attitude by using the gimmick that we should put together the pieces of the story surrounding the animosity of the different groups within the time travel order she writes about. We never really get the full story on why these groups hate each other or try to work against each other. She tries to outsmart us by only giving us part of the story while apparently holding the other part inside her. The truth is that she doesn't know why they hate each other. She never bothered to even think of the reason and she just thought she'd be smarter than us by having us enter that part of the story halfway through.It was a gimmick as I said and in my eyes she made a bad choice. Don't get me wrong, I like books that make me think. But this little trick she uses is akin to walking into a movie after it's halfway over and trying to understand what's going on. This trick doesn't make me think, well actually it does make me think. It makes me think she must believe we will be so involved with the animosity between the groups that we'll actually care enough to put it together in our own mind. Sadly all it made me want to do was jam a sharpened pencil in my eye so I wouldn't be able to read another word about the friction I cared absolutely zero about. What it accomplished was that it made me NOT CARE about anyone or anything in this book.While parts of this book can be mildly entertaining it's completely lost because the filler the author wrote bores you half to death and zaps the story of its life. I got to the point where I was scanning instead of fully reading and that to me is the sign of a poorly written book. I'm not against having descriptive text and dialog if it is written beautifully and it adds to the story. But text for the sake of adding about 250 extra pages to a story that ended up having so little substance that it could have been told in 100 pages is just useless. If I want to be bored to death on purpose I'll go read the dictionary for my entertainment. What I see this book as, is something written by an author who has fallen in love with hearing themselves speak. Somewhere along the way they listened to too many people who said \\"It's so interesting how you can spend 30 minutes describing how someone puts toothpaste on a toothbrush. You ought to do that in a book.\\" Unfortunately she did it in a book I wasted my money on and one you are now thinking about buying.The bottom line is that many people obviously love this book and decided to drink from the Kool-Aid. To each his own. But as a person who purchased this book based on customer reviews and the synopsis I feel it is my duty to warn potential buyers of this book about its shortcomings. I wish I had paid closer attention to the negative reviews so I would have made a more informed choice. But that is my fault and I paid the price ... Literally. So to potential buyers I offer my take on this book. I'm not fooled by the Kool-Aid any longer and my suggestion is to keep looking if you wish to find something entertaining or something with a beautiful story that shines through the overkill of an author who breathes life into herself rather than her characters.I say that because it is my opinion that the author of any book should not even be thought of once the reader starts their journey. They should be thought of only when the reader marvels at the story that has been crafted. You shouldn't ever hear yourself say, while reading \\"My god just shut up and move the story along.\\" For instance, when you read Carol O'Connell's Mallory books you feel lost in the character. You see the world she lives in and feel the way she purposely sequesters herself from being too involved with the people she interacts with. You pity her, you applaud her, you mourn for that lost portion of her soul. You buy into the fantasy and suspend your disbelief in the manner a good book begs you to do. That can't happen with The Doomsday Book. To me, it just doesn't let the reader suspend their disbelief and invest in the characters. The reason for that is simple. Connie Willis wants you to know SHE is Santa Claus. She doesn't want you to buy into the mythology of her characters. She wants you to bow before her self professed greatness. She wants you to know that SHE alone crafted the words and gave them life. She can't let you believe that some magical fat man brought you some gifts manufactured at the North Pole. She can't allow that to happen. Her ego won't let her. She just wants to make sure that even if you get sidetracked and start seeing the world through the eyes of her characters that you'd best remember that she is Santa, The Wizard of OZ, and The puppet master ... All rolled into one.Connie Willis commits the ultimate sin as an author, she tries to be smarter than her reader. Don't be fooled by her or the positive reviews, this book and the echoes of the author who has fallen in love with her own voice, proves that she is not smarter than me, or you, or anyone who accidentally stumbles into her world of blah blah blah fiction. She's a writer and all I can say is that this book proves to me that she's not a very good one. If you want something good to read that centers itself on time travel. Go read Replay. The story is crafted in such a way that you do make the investment in the story and characters wholeheartedly. The Doomsday Book never achieves that, but in reading it ... It did make me wish for one thing (mentioned in its title) to happen and save me from the story. It made me wish and dream fondly for DOOMSDAY."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I love Time Travel stuff, expected a lot from the reviews.

I, for one, believe that if a person is going to give a low review that they should know their stuff. First of all, this book *is* SF (not Sci-Fi. That is just a condensed version of Science Fiction and is literally wrong). A Science Fiction story does not have to be filled with clanking robots, spaceships, and metallic surfaces. A Science Fiction story is that which speculates on today's science and creates a reality that *may* and could happen.That is the only stipulation for Science Fiction. Now, for the people kvetching about cardboard characters and a slow story. Why have you not looked at the subtext? All good readers must notice and see the subtext. The cardboard characters were created as an allegory. They were created as a stunning reprose directed towards the University Community.For those that know nothing of Connie Willis, she is the wife of a professor at the University of Northern Colorado in Greeley. She hears, daily, about the rediculous and incredible manners of University headman, that she wrote them into her story. That is why they are cardboard. She is commenting and attacking the University system. Kivrin and Dunworthy are the only *human* characters. This is because they are the only *honorable* characters in the story. Everyone else is worrying about toliet paper, their dig, his mother, Christmas, etc...there and only Dunworthy and Kivrin are worried about something deeper, therefore making them real. The headman of the University are more worried about budgets and money rather than the student. The professors, most of them, are concerned for the students. Connection!The parallel of the virus in modern day to the Plague is representative to man's weakness. Here we are in the 21st century where disease is all but wiped out. Yet, an influenza appears and causes a pandmeic. People are infected and panicking....whereas, in the 14th century, the Plauge appears. People are infected and panick.... hmmm..... it seems to me that this points out the weakness and egotistical manner of man. We have the technology to irradicate illness, and yet are susceptible to the same diseases that infected the &quot;boorish&quot; Middle Age man. We prance around with our antibiotics, feeling invincible. But what happens when something comes around that is invunerable to antibiotics? What happens when an unknown virus starts to spread across a nation and the health professionals do not know how to cure it? What if the healers are the ones infected? We become like the people in the Middle Ages. Powerless, and ignorant to what is happing to us. And this is only on the surface level of the book.It is in my opinion, that a book that makes you think deeply and question modern day humanity, is a good book. Whereas, the Star Trek and other SF books are there to tell a *story* and not questions ourselves."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I don't know why so many people love this book. First it is basically a repeat of 'To Say Nothing of the Dog' which already did get on my nerves. The first 400 pages are completely tedious and repetitive: utterly incompetent people run around in confusion, that's all there is to it. The last 150 pages get a bit better as the story finally gets started. I certainly would not have finished it if it haden't been the only book I'd taken on vacation.Why does 2050 look exactly like mid-1900 england plus a time machine ? No cell phone, hardly any phones and they don't work (for weeks) in a crisis. The head of Oxford out of reach for a month. Two characters who take 2 weeks to exchange a single key sentence. I expected some kind of time paradox consequence to explain it towards the end but no, nothing so satisfying.At least 'To say nothing of the dog' has some humor in it, but it's sorely lacking here, unless the endless displays of incompetence are taken as humor. All the characters either get sick, die or usually both; so much about humor.Another reviewer said that the only character he cared about is the cow, and that sums it up quite nicely."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I grew up loving science fiction, but I haven't read much for years. When I was casting around looking for a book, I saw that this had won the Hugo and Nebula. I immediately thought of Heinlein, Asimov, or Bujold, and settled down for an enjoyable read. What a huge disappointment.How could this book have won second prize at a local aspiring authors' club? There is barely enough action for a short story, and it is wretchedly handled. To give an obvious example, the basis of the story is that they have time travel. TIME TRAVEL, for God's sake! What could be more exciting?According to this book, watching paint dry could be more exciting. Nobody cares about it, other than incompetent administrators fighting turf battles at universities.I said it's been a while since I've read sci fi, but I do remember that the point of it is to imagine how new technology would affect society. Well, what if we had a time machine? OBVIOUSLY, it would be the biggest thing in the world. It would be controlled by the government, to prevent sabotage from the past. It would be guarded like Fort Knox. The general public would be fascinated by the possibilities, historians would be lined up for miles trying to get a slot, and religious people would do anything to get a chance to prove their faith to be true. Criminals would want to escape into the past, or maybe dominate it with their superior scientific knowledge. Lots of people would want to go back and tell their fathers to buy IBM in 1960, or to sell everything in 2007.Nothing like this happens. The machine is apparently just a device in a lab, without a single guard. The \\"security\\" is provided by the guy who watches the front gate for the entire campus. The technicians are few, incompetent, and avoid answering their phone when needed (and there are apparently no cell phones or answering machines in the future). Although there is no mention of any technical reason why trips couldn't be made every day, they apparently go weeks without any activity, and one of the characters spends the first third of the book complaining that even that was too rushed. When they finally do send someone back, NOBODY BOTHERS TO FIND OUT IF IT WORKED. They just send her back and leave one tech with the machine, and when he suddenly gets ill, that's the end of the follow-up. Only one other person even tries to ask him what happened with the, you know, TIME TRAVEL. The man in charge of the machine is *so* incompetent that he refuses to check on it, and finally simply unplugs it just to get the other guy out of his hair, not realizing that he has stranded the traveler. Oh yeah, and the person who was sent back is just an eager student, who apparently had no competition for the honor.The action takes place at Christmas time, and there are all sorts of religious people around, from horrible Bible thumpers, to well-meaning bell ringers. You would think that one of them would have some interest in going back to see the birth or death of Jesus, or even a period church. Nope - the time machine doesn't interest them at all. In fact, the only notice the general public takes is a few kooks who want to shut it down.Even the hero, such as he is, is a boob. When he finally tries to rescue the first traveler, he decides to go back himself, even though he just left the hospital against medical orders, and can barely walk. A strong young man offers to go back with him to help him, and he refuses the help --- he doesn't want to endanger him. Well, OK, but are you telling me that the only two possibilities were sending a semi-invalid by himself, and sending a semi-invalid with an untrained minor? Are you telling me that there was nobody else on campus who was healthy and intelligent and wanted to travel in time? Are you telling me that the beautiful, intelligent Kirvin didn't have a boyfriend? Are you telling me that they couldn't call somebody, somewhere, and say we have an emergency with our, you know, TIME MACHINE, can you please give me a cop or a soldier or SOMEBODY that will help ensure that as soon as we send this doddering old fool back to the dead of winter in the 14th century with no tools or weapons or transportation or even warm clothes, he doesn't just stumble a couple hundred yards and then freeze to death????The book is very light on the technical aspects of time travel, but what little there is makes no sense. The (single) tech does his calculations, making careful measurements and placement of the traveler, but then a second person jumps into the field without warning, just as the machine is activated, and the transfer works perfectly.We are told that the machine magically prevents anything from going through that could change the past. How this can be done without the travelers losing Free Will is beyond me, but OK, presumably that is why they have to make sure there are no zippers on their clothes and the like. Except that the guy that jumped into the field without warning brought his flashlight back to the 14th century, and it worked just fine. So did his GPS locator, which the boob of a hero never thought to bring on his rescue mission. He OBVIOUSLY would have stumbled around the woods and froze to death if he had gone alone, as he wanted to.You think I'm spoiling it? There is nothing to spoil. What little good there is about this book all takes place in the 14th century, so I won't say much about that, except that I hope you like Waiting For Godot. Some people write about the painstaking research, although the author apparently doesn't know which century Joan of Arc lived in. Some people say they cried. How hard is it to make you cry when writing about cute little girls (with puppies, no less) in the time of the Black Death?In short, I don't really think there is anything to recommend about this book, but if there were, it would be as historical fiction, not science fiction. If the entire modern story were eliminated, and the 14th-century story were chopped by about 80%, it might have made a decent short story.Can modern sci fi really be so bad that this book won the Hugo and Nebula? God save me from whatever finished second."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I am not a &quot;medievalist&quot; (whatever that is supposed to mean), so I can't vouch for the historical accuracy or inaccuracy of the scrap of medieval life depicted here, but having read this book, I can testify that it IS a mere scrap. As far as depiction of medieval life goes, it risks almost nothing. We are essentially confined within one house and within one half of a household (the men have been called away and never return).Science fiction as a whole tends to allow little character development or its character development tends to seem gratuitous. This is because science fiction necessarily concerns itself with the effect of scientific technology and that effect tends not to be an effect on individuals in particular. Since, despite its marketing, THE DOOMSDAY BOOK is obviously NOT science fiction, it is not so constrained, and its characterization ought to be judged by the the standards of mainstream fiction, not by the standards of a genre that has other, compensating, attractions. Judged thus, it falls very short. No character in the entire book is &quot;rounded&quot; or fully developed. The only character that ever interested me, as a character, was the younger of the two children of the medieval household, and she interested me only briefly, in passing.(American Heritage, first edition: &quot;disinterested, adj. Free of bias and self-interest; impartial.&quot; &quot;Disinterested&quot; does NOT mean &quot;uninterested&quot;; &quot;UNINTERESTED&quot; means &quot;uninterested&quot;, and when this BOOK means &quot;uninterested&quot; it should SAY &quot;uninterested&quot;. In my opinion, we are fully justified in rating a book that abuses the simple, common term &quot;disinterested&quot; and others, as this book does, one star only, and on this basis only. There is NO excuse for it. This is not, however, as it happens, why I have rated THE DOOMSDAY BOOK one star only.)"},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I'm sure this book is great if I could ever make it through. I finally gave up about 1/3 of the way in. Why does Ms. Willis have to write about every single thought, emotion and insignificant story point that has nothing to do with the plot? I listened to the audio version and many times I just wanted to press a 30 second skip button to get the story moving. Several times I just blurted out \\"come on already! how many times is Kivrin going to go through her symptoms to self diagnose her illness?!\\". This book is opposite of Crichton's novel Timeline which was fast paced but lacked the historical knowledge and depth that Ms. Willis obviously included. The 14th century was a pivotal century in Western civilization, it would be exciting to find a book that would bring it alive. This book fails at that."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I enjoyed this book, though like many I found it excessivelyrepetitive. I'm also not fond of the style, much like that found inthe Jame Harriott and Harry Potter books, of having other charactersexcessively abusing the protagonist: Imagine an entire Harry Potterbook written such that Harry never gets to leave the Dursley's houseand you get the picture. Is this supposed to make them more noble?Overall I found the type of dialogue and interactions between peopleunbelievable.I did like the characters, though found their propensity for planningfor failure annoying at times. I also liked the idea of time travelas presented here, with it's own set of rules and constraints. Alsothe imagery of 1300's that painted is very vivid. The detail for theera is given in a way that fits the story adds to your empathy for thecharacter as she faces the challenges set before her.I'm glad I read it, but if this is a typical of Connie Willis book Iwon't be reading any more of them."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Stayed up until 2am reading this tour-de-force.Moving from mystery novel to gut-wrenching first-person account of the arrival of the Black Death, from a young girl who turns out to be a very human Christ-figure.Powerful, powerful read."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"When this book came out in 1992 it was lauded as a great example of alternate future history and time travel. While the time travel part has held up admirably, the alternate history seems almost archaic. As in many good books, there are two concurrent stories, one of a time traveler back to the middle ages, and the other of the times that she lives.Kivrin is a medivel scholar who has badly wanted to travel back to the middle ages. That of course is exactly what she gets, a bad travel back. She is supposed to be going to 1320, before the advent of The Plague, but ends up in 1348 on the cusp of the first wave of the black death. There is more than enough 'color' to keep us interested, and the interaction of the nobility and the common people is well researched. The actions of Kivrin are somewhat overboard but mostly well done.As to her current time, 2054 in Oxford, England, it leaves a lot to be desired. Willis brings in too many ideas that she never fleshes out. An example being that she mentions a previous Pandemic but never discusses either the causes or the damage done. Her americans are all twits or obnoxious (so she got that part right), and most of her Brits are stiff upper lip and lets keep things moving. Many of her characters are so opaque as to be useless, and seem to be thrown in for no other reason than to plump up the story.Her future is nowhere as thought out as her past. In one glaring example, when the phone system goes down (they are video phones) it doesn't seem that anyone has ever heard of the internet of cell phones. She mistakenly refers to the community as the EC and not the EU. There also seem to be no private cars, just the tube, taxis and ambulances, but no explanation given. During most of the book, one of the protagonists is looking for the head of the medival history department. She spends endless pages trying to tract him down, but never finds him or explains where he is.The denoument is so predictable, that you can see it coming about a hundred pages before it shows up. For a bunch of scientists these people seem to be rather dubious in their use/misuse of the scientific method.Unfortunately I was more unimpressed than impressed...save your time and money and read \\"To Say Nothing of the Dog\\", it's a much better book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book stands as a counterpoint to Crichton's Timeline. However, it is much, much, much better. If you like the thought of time travel, the period of the Black Death, in-depth (and highly plausible) tidbits of the psychology that the plague had on the people of the time, then this book is for you. It doesn't really get too \\"gross\\" until the end, and the last chapter is a bit of an anticlimax (although it is quite expected). Still, well worth an 80% grade."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This is a pretty good read. I don't think that this was as care free or as complicated as her off the wall book 'To Say Nothing of the Dog.' I almost found myself giving this book a three star review until I realized that I was doing so because of how 'Doomsday...' stacked up against this other book.Unto itself, 'Doomsday' presents us with a fairly simple plot that ends up engaging the reader due to its stark though humorous take on the primary protagonists. I like how Willis does not pull any punches here and rams us through in a mainly unsentimental fashion.Unlike most science fiction Connie Willis really goes into great detail with her characters and the sci-fi part almost becomes a secondary factor. In fact, I can't think of another sci-fi author who manages to accomplish this feat. Perhaps two authors most akin to Willis would be Stabenow of the 'Shugak' mystery series and MC Beaton who writes the 'Agatha Raisin' books. I think that it is interesting that Willis brings this form of character development into this realm of fiction and I hope more Sci-Fi authors emulate her in regards to this in the future."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The premise, in which students travel in time to learn about history, is unique and extremely well handled by Willis. The descriptions she uses to describe the time travel mechanism, and the 'rules' in place to prevent the alteration of the time line, are also well done. In the past I've always felt that time travel was poorly handled by authors. They either left too many gaps, or made the system so overly complex that I found myself spending more time thinking about how impossible the time travel was and less time on the 'meat' of the story. Thankfully, this story has none of these inadequacies.I especially liked the characters. Each one was well written, and presented in a believable manner. I think an author does a good job of writing a book when they make you, the reader, want to meet the individual they have written about in person. Willis, in my opinion, achieves this.And finally, the descriptions Willis manages to convey with regards to the 14th century make one think that she was actually there herself! For anyone interested in historical fiction, or has a passing interest in time travel (with a bit of humor thrown in) I'd say this book's for you."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"This book was very engaging emotionally, without insulting your intelligence about time travel (you know who you are, Michael Crichton!). Interesting characters, well-researched history, solid plot. You may not feel good when you finish reading it, but you'll still appreciate the book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Irregardless of its minor flaws, this book as a whole was a brilliant engrossing read for me as I tried to rush through my usual busy day so I could hurry and get back into the story. Oh such anguish and emotion we feel for the characters as the story draws us to their timeless and all too human reactions in the face of ragged emotions of stress, superstitious fear, and abject misery. Take the context away and just apply our own modern woes and voila ! Universal human emotions just as translateable in any time period...The book shows us as vulnerable clay human being equally capable of fierce hate as well as love.The plot runs like a literary roller coaster that gradually but smoothly builds the unlucky current and past events as well as the constant exhibit of blind faith and hope. The gradual but inevitable plunge to the tragic conclusion was just as poignant. ...It was well written in my opinion and flowed very well as I wanted just as fiercely for Agnes and Rosemary and expecially Fr. Roche to pull through...The characters lived and breathed for me and I greatly enjoyed this read ! This is my first read for this author so I am very anxious to try her other novels or short stories..."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":".What a depressing story.Some people enjoy being heartbroken. While I do admire beautiful stories -- those that leave me longing for more -- I am not one of those people. And Doomsday Book is definitely not one of those stories.To help you relate, I'd compare this story to the movie Pearl Harbor -- the movie's lengthy, and, halfway through, things start becoming impossibly sad. Then, somehow, they get even more sad, and keep getting worse, until finally it's over and you're released from the agony.But you're relieved that it's over. You feel as if a great burden has been taken from your back; this relief, I think, is why many people (the same people who enjoy being heartbroken) may consider Doomsday Book a great story.I'll elaborate on the Pearl Harbor analogy a bit: As much as I disapprove of needlessly depressing things, I really liked Pearl Harbor. I say that because of its inspiring/hopeful conclusion. The peaceful ending was a welcome reward for having to sit through a movie that long and painful. Doomsday book didn't give me this type of satisfaction, didn't close with hope.I'm giving it 4 stars because it's not my type of story. But don't let that mislead you. Connie Willis is an excellent writer. (May I recommend To Say Nothing of the Dog for the lighter-hearted individuals out there...) If you've read this review and think you're the type to enjoy being heartbroken, Doomsday Book will probably be one of the best books you've ever read. You'd probably give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I loved this book. I happened to be reading it on a trip to Europe, so it had an even greater impact on me. I remember standing at a 14th century church right after I finished the book,and I felt much more connected to the people and the time the church was built. This is a wonderfully researched, gripping story. It is populated with real (not Monty Python like) characters. I learned a lot reading this book."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"A landmark like Leguin, Gibson, Brin. In additional to being a great story this novel performs the classic sci-fi mission of preparing us to deal with possible futures."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Willis weaves the Black Plague, mediaeval sexism, university bureaucracy, pandemics, and time travel into a engaging tale of vibrant characters about whom we quickly come to care and in whose shoes we tread days soon to come as well as days long past. Her portrayals of ancient England are rich with colors and textures that bring the reader into the scene. Wonders and horrors lurk in every corner as the plot builds delicious tension with seemingly insurmountable obstacles. If there is a failing here, it is with the too facile resolution of things. A bit more trouble in setting things right might have seemed more real, but by the last page our heroes have been through enough. An easy recommendation for any fan of speculative fantasy, this book makes me curious for more of Willis' work."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I've recently re-read this book and have found it to be quite amazing. The author has made her characters very real and has managed to include an impressive level of detail without weighing the story down at all. This book deserves the awards it has won - it's a pity some people have rated it lowly. Connie has made the university setting seem very realistic and the medieval setting is well suited to the emotive theme of the story. Kivrin and Mr Dunworthy are characters that seem so real that I can easily compare them to people I meet at my university every day. Well done Connie."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I find it very hard to believe this won both the major SF prizes. The main character is reasonably well portrayed, but the rest of the cast spend their time hamming it up in a way that reminds me of some particularly poor amateur dramatics. Particularly bizarre are the characters that seem to have been thrown in to provide a bit of comic relief among all the desolation. They simply manage to provide further irritation with their irrational and unconnected activities, which are neither funny nor contribute in any manner to the plot. The scenes dealing with the plague have been fairly well researched, but the author's vision of the future is laughable and idiotic. I doubt whether she has spent more than a couple of day trips in Oxford. Her rendition of the area is extremely sketchy and confined to a rather trite round-up of the major tourist attractions. Write what you know, Ms Willis, not what you've seen through the dirty window of a tour bus. Unfortunately, this lack of reserach is found in many other areas of the book. Her monolithic notions about the British NHS are a case in point. She obviously has never heard of Regional Health Authorities and has no idea of the actual procedures that would be followed in an epidemic. One of the key elements of her vision of the future is that the human race has developed an incredible susceptibility to infectious diseases. Yet the author does not deign to inform us of how this sad state of affairs has come about. Instead, we are supposed to believe that the world of 2050 lives in daily fear of widespread pandemics caused by rogue viruses. Those who wish a bit of perspective might consider the zero mortality rate in the Hong Kong flu &quot;epidemic&quot; at the end of 1997. Unfortunately, the book's entire plot hangs from this spurious thread, which makes it very difficult to overlook its other failings. This book is suitable as a light read for an airplane, but little else. It most certainly did not deserve the awards it received."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"I read the book. Then I read the parts from 1348 only. Three times. Then I read the book again. Now I'm going to read it again! The details of the Midevial Times are wonderful and make you want more and more. The truths of daily life there are hard to us, but the author brings us to understand that what we percieve as &quot;hard&quot; was normal for the 1300's. The characters are like people of any century, some good, some bad, some boring, some fanitical, some out of control, having us realize that people are people in any time.

This book will appeal to people for whom the characters are what makes for a good read. The concepts are strong, but unless you're moved by character development you might find that the pay-off takes too long.I'd recommend this book to anyone who thinks that SF is a &quot;fluffy&quot; genre. What an education!I'd recommend this book to anyone who was in the mood for a deeply stirring, even melancholy read.Finally a book where reality doesn't take a back seat to the predictable &quot;happy ending&quot; ."},{"Title":"Doomsday Book","review":"Nothing fancy to say, just wanted to get my vote in.

No, there's not a lot of science fiction in it and it takes a while to build up, it seems to me. But the feeling I took away from the book was that this ( the Bubonic plague ) really did happen, that it is truly amazing how much better life is today. We look back at those times as if they didn't really occur, part of the reason being that we can't actually imagine how bad they were.
