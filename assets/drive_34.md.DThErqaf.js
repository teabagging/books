I feel that most people who read this book will enjoy and have a great time. This book contains many twists and turns that left me begging for more. Huckleberry Finn is a great character for all young boys to relate too. He is full of adventure and loves to cause trouble.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was overall a very fun and exciting book. The drama was always high and had my blood pulsing. From having an abusive and alcoholic father, to running away from his hometown, and then being captured by the duke and the dauphin, it did not seem like Huck ever got a break nor did he want one. The plot was great because it was always changing from one dramatic experience to the next. Huck never stayed in one place and was always ditching his father or Miss Watson (the widow taking care of him). While both of them care about Huck in a completely different way, he really didn't want to have anything to do with them. Most of the characters were great in the book. Each one had an important part that lead to the next catastrophe. At the end all of the characters seemed to come together and it was interesting how basically everyone met each other. Jim, a slave child, was a very important character. He became a true friend and accomplice throughout the entire book. While most of the characters played an important part, some pieces just didn't fit however and lead to boredom.Although this book was basically very good, I got confused during certain parts. The whole deal with the duke and the dauphin was stupid in my opinion. I feel that they just made the book more puzzling. They were from one town to the next tricking people and using fake names, eventually it got old. Around this time the book started to drag on and the development didn't really go anywhere; it stayed pretty dull. Also the whole deal with Huck's abusive father really didn't have a huge affect in the long run. Huck still ended up with Miss Watson and besides the beginning Huck didn't have to deal with his father.Overall I was very pleased with this book. I am the kind of kid who loves drama and adventure. Even though parts were slow and boring, they picked up. The action is intense and the humor goes very well with it. No matter what type of situation, Huck always seems to make it enjoyable. I would suggest this book to anyone who enjoys a fun book about mischief and who enjoys good laugh."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I tried to read this book in high school without much success. The episodic plot and many dialects were too much for me to handle. Now, nearly 10 years later, I find this book an absolute masterpiece.Twain paints 19th century american ideals, themes, and perspectives through the experiences of perhaps the most memorable character in American literature. I found Huck truly innocent and clever, and his episodes with Tom Sawyer in their elaborate rescue attempts were some of the funniest and most touching I have ever read."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Powerful, refreshing, beautifully written and incrediably clever this is a timeless masterwork with well drawn characters. This unforgettable romp makes a superior read aloud."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This book is bigger than the Mississippi, bigger than school boards that would ban it, bigger than contemporary critics who would snuff it. Read it and wonder at the loneliness of Huck Finn, the cultures and traditions that embrace ignorance and racism, the hopefulness of Jim in a society that values only him as a slave. You Charles Dickens fans will hear echoes of Great Expectations.But above all else, read it as a Story. It's one of the Best."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I'm writing this review because I loved this Audio book that I bought on Audible and I was scrolling through it on this amazon page and it was rated lower than what I believe it deserves. The main reason is because two of the other reviews quite frankly sucked. One guy even said that the book was confusing because of the grammar errors. haha wow, he must not understand the context and style that Mark Twain intentionally wrote in. durrr!but ya this is a fantastic book and Elijah Wood does an amazing job as the narrator. One of the reasons he does such a good job is because Wood actually played the role of Huck Finn before in the 1993 Disney movie so he had a lot of experience with portraying the character. but ya really good audio book for Twain's classic novel. that is all."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"If there's any book out there that needs no introduction (or review, to be honest), it's Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Yet here I am reviewing it, anyway. I must admit (not without a fair share of embarrassment) that I just now got around to reading this American classic for the first time. I never had to read it in school, and to some degree I felt pretty familiar with the novel even without having read it - that's just how popular and important Huckleberry Finn is to the social fabric of America.Nowadays, with all the politically correct liberals having escaped their Berkeley zoo and run amuck all over the nation, many of our young people are told not to read this novel. In fact, legions of voices cry out for poor little Huck Finn, that beloved rascal of literature, to be banned from schools and libraries - for the crime of using the n-word, a word commonly used by both blacks and whites up and down the Mississippi during Huck's time (not to mention numerous hip-hop artists of today). Turning a blind eye to the fact that Twain made the slave Jim a noble, human, easy-going fellow with his heart always in the right place (unlike Huck's other companions), the literary fascists contend that this novel is poison to the minds of youngsters. One can only imagine the reaction Mark Twain would have to the hysteria his book incites in liberals today (although he would certainly not be surprised, as he had to fight censorship of this book from the date of its publication).One of the great ironies of the \\"Ban Huck Finn\\" brouhaha is the fact that young people will surely find this novel much more entertaining than the vast majority of other literary classics they are asked to read. This is a very funny book, especially once \\"the duke and the dauphin\\" arrive on the scene and, later, when Tom Sawyer meticulously plans out Jim's rescue from captivity (no thanks to the captors, who didn't even try to make it as difficult as Tom says it should be). Young readers will also relate to and understand this book, a fact which should give rise to spirited discussion of it in class. Don't we want our kids to be excited about books and reading?The more outrageous the hissy fits thrown by liberal critics over the \\"dangers\\" of Huck Finn, the more important it is for everyone, young and old alike, to go out and read Twain's novel. Whenever someone tells you not to read something, it's important that you go out there and read it - and discover whatever it is the book banning loonies don't want you to know. Prove to them that you are intelligent enough to know the difference between the social values of the past and present, fiction and reality, right and wrong, etc. Think for yourself. Read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"There are very few works that come near this masterpiece of American literature (\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" and \\"Moby Dick\\" are the closest in my opinion). Not only do you need to read this book; you need to read this book multiple times. It never gets old. It is so complex and multi-layered that you truly find something new with each reading. It is a shame that so many students feel \\"forced\\" to read this. Reading this book is a privilege and a delight. It is funny, touching, witty, satirical and one of the most important books that exisits. Although it was written and set in the past the themes are universal and timeless. Do not hesitate to read this book!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"To everyone who said this book was simply a children's story--you obviously don't understand this book. It is a brilliant satire about slavery and about the conventions of society. When I first read this book I didn't quite understand it either and just blew it off as another tedious book we had to read for school. But after reading it and discussing it in AP English, I discovered just how brilliant it was. Huck is caught in an eternal struggle between doing what society tells him is right and doing what he feels in his heart. It's a classic Pikaresque type novel, and a funny one at that. A lot of it's humor is in it's irony. And it pokes fun at religion, war (mobs), slavery, and society in general. I suggest those of you who disliked it should read it again. It is a truly great novel."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This book was great. It had so much action. It was about a boy whose father was always off drinking. When the father hears Huckleberry, also referred to as Huck, is rich the father comes back. The father beats him and gets drunk. So Huck runs off. He goes to a deserted island. While on the island he discovers that Huck's friend, a slave named Jim, also ran away and was on the same island. When Huck hears that Jim's owner is going to sell Jim they going rafting on the Mississippi to find Jim freedom. It is a great piece of literature and I strongly reccomend reading it."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Beneath the surface innocence of Huck's narrative, this is Twain's darkest and most troubling critique of American society before the Civil War.

Unfortunately, this edition of Huck Finn is a total failure - the pages just fell out of the book when I was only halfway through. The cover catches your eye, but choose another publisher to enjoy this classic."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I wasn't too looking forward to the reading Huck Finn at first, particularly after glancing at the dialect of the first couple pages, but once I got started and more used to how the characters spoke, I loved the tale! Huck Finn is an extremely well-written novel that uses silly situations to explain how living was back then, and how slaves were treated. Jim is in the beginning of the book coming across as the stereotype of a slave, but as the novel continues, you really begin to see the real person, not just how Jim was &quot;supposed&quot; to be... Also, throughout the book, you see Huck mature and begin to get his own mind; among other things, Huck develops his own set of morals different from those of society... The Adventures of Huck Finn is a funny, exciting, and at times sweet book that everyone should have the chance to read... :):)"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I've read this book many times over the last 48 years and I find something new every time. Buy it. Read it again. When I read it at age 10 I enjoyed the story and had my eyes opened to history. Later the history and morality became the primary point. But always there is the humor of Twain and the magnificent angel on earth that is Huck. I have a hard time thinking of them as one person. Huck is a person all on his own.Again. Read the book again."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I can't even say for sure how many times (four? five?) I've read \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" but each time I notice something new and admire something different. Having read several biographical accounts of Mark Twain's life in recent years, however, I learned some background that explains an aspect of the book that always puzzled me: how a book that is a sequel to an adventure story for boys seems to be of a different genre entirely.Many readers come to \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" via its predecessor, \\"Tom Sawyer.\\" Sure enough, the second book opens not long after the first book, and the first chapters of \\"Huck\\" resemble the tone and style of \\"Tom.\\" Twain's initial plan was indeed to write another boyhood adventure story; he began the sequel soon after \\"Tom Sawyer\\" was published, and so we read about how Huck's low-life father desires the treasure Tom and Huck found in the previous story, about Huck's escape from his father's cruelty, and about his comical disguises as a girl and as a survivor of a wreck on the river. And then Twain set the work aside when he reached Chapters 15 and 16, in which Huck and Jim take off on their now-famous raft journey.It was three years before Twain worked on the book again, and by that time he'd decided that \\"Huck Finn\\" would not be a simple, episodic adventure tale for children. It took Twain another five years to finish it. During that period he wrote a travel book, \\"Life on the Mississippi\\" (in which he included an eventually deleted passage from \\"Huck Finn\\"), and you can see its influence on the river adventures of Huck. More significantly, the centrality of Jim to the story transformed the novel into a work on race, slavery, freedom, and life on the frontier--hardly the stuff of children's literature.This amalgamation explains why the early chapters seem to be written for kids (much like \\"Tom Sawyer\\") and why the book still resonates with so many youngsters. It develops into a different book altogether the moment Huck and Jim step on that raft, become fugitives, and eventually head \\"down the river\\"-- away from the promise of freedom upstream and toward the territory where the institution of slavery is even more inhumane. (A constant fear among slaves in Twain's later novel \\"Puddn'head Wilson\\" is to be sold \\"down the river.\\") Huckleberry Finn--both the character and the book--loses the aura of childhood innocence; as a result, Huck's journey is much less like \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and more like Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness.\\""},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is considered by many to be the American novel; the work that most closely represents the America experience. What then makes this such a great book to read, and such an embodiment of America? Many things.First, this book addresses the issue of color racism thoroughly and subtly from multiple viewpoints. The latter includes the naive reluctant racist (Huck), the naive apathetic racist (Tom), those discriminated against (Jim), and of course the active, enthusiastic racists (most everyone else we meet in the book). Racism is examined from both the mental viewpoints; how individuals consider others of the same and different race, and from the social viewpoint; how individuals of different races interact in public and private. This emphasis on race points to the heart of American history; few other countries have struggled with skin color bias as long and as deeply as the US.The second major point examined in this book is slavery; an issue strongly related to the first. Slavery as existed in other countries was rarely as delineated along color lines as it was in the USA. And rarely was it defined as a feature of different skin colors. For example, slavery throughout Europe was used as a form of criminal punishment. Likewise, slavery in the Middle East was a side effect of military conquest of one group of people by another. Not so in America. Here it was an inherent feature of how two races dealt with each other.The third theme of this book that strongly embodies the American experience is the fractured / divided family. Walk through any neighborhood in China, India, Japan, Mexico, Egypt, Ireland or most any other country, and most of the children you encounter live with their parents, and most of the parents you meet live with their children. Unique among nations is America where many children do not live with both their biological parents. True now, this was true in the mid-1800s when this book's story takes place. Jim is searching for his family and Huck has left his. At the end of the book, they meet Tom, another boy who is not being raised by his parents. In fact, the two most stable families nuclear families encountered in this book are the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons.This leads of course to a fourth feature of this book that is reflective of America; the family feud. For a country where everyone has so much, both back then and now in the early 21st century; Americans seem to have problems with neighbors. Nowadays, everyone wants a house with big yards to maximize separation between them and their neighbors, and neighbors rat on each other to their homeowners assocation. Back then, they had feuds.The fifth topic dealt with in this book is the con. Unique to America is the role of the con artist in our history and culture. Consider Jim and Tammy Fay Baker, Robert Millikan and Charles Keating of modern times, and Ponzi of the early 1900s. In this book the reader encounters numerous cons and con artists. Huck himself cons Jim at the end of the book whereby he concocts a series of escape plans that puts Jim thru a series of ordeals, all for the naive amusement of Huck.Having read several versions of Twain's classic by different publishers; this reviewer has only praise for this version. The book itself is a great classic and worthy of anyones time and effort in reading it."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Huck is a poor boy with an alcoholic father who lives in the town of St. Petersburg, Missouri. Huck and his friend Tom Sawyer find gold in a cave and get six thousand dollars apiece, which judge Thatcher puts into a trust. Huck was then adopted by the widow Douglass and she tries to refine him. Huck's father comes to town and demands custody and the money. He can't get it so he kidnaps Huck and takes him to a log cabin. Huck escapes by faking his own death with pig blood and escaping to the river. There he meets a runaway slave named Jim. Soon they find out from a woman that her husband is seeing smoke from the island. Later Huck and Jim meet a pair of con artists that end up selling Jim to a local farmer. But Tom and Huck manage to free Jim, and Huck heads to the west. I would recommend this book anyone.The characters in this book where very interesting. Huck, the protagonist, is thirteen and hates it when people try to refine him. He likes to be on his own. Tom Sawyer, also a protagonist, is Huck's imaginative friend. Pap, the antagonist, is Huck's mean greedy alcoholic father, who later in the story kidnaps Huck and keeps him trapped in his log cabin.Huck is a rowdy boy stereotype in this story and even makes a point of that in the beginning of the book. As you start off reading, the narrator, Huck, says that he dislikes his new life of cleanliness, manners, and church. Also if Tom wasn't there to encourage him to start a new life he would have run away in the very beginning.I enjoyed reading this book because I read the Adventure of Tom Sawyer but I never knew that the Adventure of Huckleberry Finn was the sequel to that. This tied into the Adventure of Tom Sawyer because the money they made in the first book actually caused the problem in the second one. After reading both of these books I am still a fan of Mark Twain books.This is a very well written book that anyone should consider reading. It took me a while to read this book but in the end it was more than worth it. I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Before the beginning of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, renowned author Mark Twain writes: \\"Notice- Persons attempting to find a motive in this narrative will be prosecuted; persons attempting to find a moral will be banished; persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot.\\" After reading this, human nature compels us to think one of two things, either \\"There are a motive, moral, and plot in this and I am going to find them,\\" or \\"I guess he's trying to tell me this is supposed to be fun. I like to read for fun!\\" Either way, you'll be reading it within the next minute.When you've reached the words \\"The End. Yours truly, Huck Finn\\" 220 pages later, your suspicions, which there are a lot of in this book, will be verified. The book is a fun read for everyone above the age of nine or ten (although it might appeal most to those age 13-20), and also has a very definite plot and multiple morals.The story begins where The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, another classic by Twain, left off. Huck is living with the Widow Douglas when Tom organizes a band of robbers, which doesn't last very long. However, the fun doesn't begin until Huck Finn's dad, a whiskey/alcohol addict, comes to town. After being \\"kidnapped\\" by his father and living in conditions similar to those of the underworld, the teenage Huck concocts an escape plan.After his escape, Huck, as the narrator throughout the story, tells of his adventures. Among these adventures was rejoining with Jim, a runaway slave on the widow's estate and rafting down the mighty Mississippi with hopes of freedom, and while rafting, stumbled upon, and contributed to an ancient feud between two families. Huck and Jim then met up with fugitives who claimed to be royalty and helped them earn money. They did this first by pretending to be a troupe of traveling actors and various other things, and then acting as a rich dead person's brothers to get the thousands of dollars in money granted in the man's will. After that, Huck pretended to be a nephew of the man who bought his friend Jim. It turned out he was acting as Tom Sawyer! Huck soon met up with the real Tom Sawyer and tried to free Jim. In the end, all became well again and Jim became free, which he had unknowingly already been due to his recently deceased owner's will.As long as you're not offended by the \\"n-word\\" used to describe African Americans, this adventuresome book will shortly be a favorite!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I love Mark Twain, and this is Twain at his best! This is one of the best American novels of all time, in my opinion. Twain is very funny and irreverent."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I read this book after enjoying reading Tom Sawyer to my 5-year old. Firstly, this book also stands out for its readability: There is a flow and abundance of detail that pulls you in permanently. This is due, in part, to its being written in the voice of a kid, of course, but we should also credit Twain's efficiency with language. Twain can plot through the logistics of a story, maintaining continuity and credibility (barely), but without getting bogged down with too much complexity.The characters are real and timeless. The episode that convinced me that this was a great book happens early on: Huck's drunken, good-for-nothing dad goes on a tirade, blaming his woes on the guv'ment and the negroes. It's a perfect and timeless little slice of life and takes up barely a page. You could just see Twain thinking through all the little morals and wondering how he was going to include pieces of his philosophy in this story. Interesting thing about the Huck character: He is not learned or wise, being young, he has a quick sense, he is conniving, he lies constantly, and yet, judged from a higher plane, he seems to be morally perfect!The author's admonition to the reader not to find motives or morals in the book is obviously just ironic bunkum.

He is was alive and living in America. Along with a Duke, Huck Finn, and Jim, they travel down the Mississippi putting on shows for the good river people.Huck faked his own death to escape his father, Jim ran away for fear of being sold, and they catch up with the other two. Jim talks to a hair ball he pulled from the fourth stomach of an ox to tell the future. Jim also has to dress up like a diseased Arab and stay on the raft for fear of being discovered as a runaway slave.Along with Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry makes escape plans for Jim after he is captured. Little does Huck know that Aunt Polly is on her way down for a visit and calls the whistle on the whole thing. Including the part that Jim has already been set free.This is a great book.

Huckelberry Finn the great colloquial classic in which Mark Twain succeeds through speaking the many dialects of his time in putting American literature in closer touch with the Everyday . He connected American Literature with the heartland a moved the whole enterprise down- to- earth in a more humorous and realistic way. In childhood it was the scary Duke and Dauphin that almost turned me away from the book. And I must admit that there were many pages which seemed to me to be there just to make me turn them faster. But in the end and somehow there is that picture of a time, of Huck and Tom and Jim and The Widow Douglas and the Judge and of America itself more American and more rural than the American of my small - town Troy, New York streets. The river rolling on with more life than I could imagine and the dreams of a different time and a different world strange to me then.

This young man slips from the clutches of his drunken father and sets out for adventures of his own. In doing so, he meets with a fugitive slave named Jim. Traveling mostly at night, Huck and Jim float down the Mississippi River on a raft, while building a friendship. They travel at night trying to avoid trouble and being caught. As their luck would have it, trouble in the way of additional passengers, found them.The stories central focus is on the mischievous life of this boy after his run-away. The number of his adventures, lies and deceptions are too vast to tell, but would have to be found out by oneself. This young man did not set out to harm anyone, but rather just didn't seem able to tell the truth. One might be able to see Huck as a Dennis-the-mennis, of steam-boat days. The adventures of this young man will keep you wanting to find out what he does next!This book was well written in the sense that you could visualize the settings and almost hear the dialogs. The speech used however may slow your reading down a little in attempt to understand Jim's lingo.Although (because of Jim's dialog) I found some portions of this book hard to read and comprehend, I found the adventures to be riveting. I highly recommend this book. Readers who love adventure should put this book on their \\"must read\\" list."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain, was one of the best novels I have ever read. When I was a junior in high school, I had to get signed permission to read this novel. I never thought a book could be so controversial that something like that would be necessary. I am so glad that I read it then, and again during my freshman year of college, because I think it sends a powerful message. Written in the dialect of the deep south, Twain successfully gets the reader involved in the book. When I read this novel for the first time, I did not want to put it down. The character of Huck intrigued me. Though a young boy, he had more common sense than many people years older than him. He knew what he wanted and was smart enough to know how to go about getting it. When he befriends a runaway slave named Jim, social issues are brought up and Huck is forced to follow what his heart says, instead of what society says is morally acceptable. I enjoyed how Twain portrayed Huck and Jim's journey down the river and the adventures they shared. It was a symbol of their need for freedom. By sharing the same goals, Huck and Jim become true friends. They are beyond the color barrier and realize that a person is a person, regardless of what they look like or who they are. I think much of today's society could benefit from reading this book. It helps you put things in perspective and think about what is really important in life; what others think versus how you feel. If anyone is looking for a good novel to read, one that captures interest and provokes thought, Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is it."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I thought that this was an exciting book, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes adventure. Southern dialect is used throughout the entire novel, and it was difficult to understand at first, but once I had read a little ways into it, the language added tremendous reality to the story. This book is about a young boy who runs away from his dad, the town drunk, and is later joined by a slave, Jim, who is running aways at an attempt for freedom. It questions a lot of the values that Americans had when it was written (before the Civil War), and it's message is timeless. It was an awesome book, and you should definitely check it out!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Huckleberry Finn, a boy in the Deep South, is living with the Widow Douglas and is finally becoming civilized, when all of the sudden, Huck's father comes back to town. He decides to take Huck back into the wilderness to live with him. He keeps Huck under lock and key, so Huck decides to escape. Huck plans his own \\"murder\\" and takes a raft down to Jackson's Island, where he meets Jim, Miss Watson's slave who ran away. Jim and Huck head up north, where they will both be free. Once there, they begin to get homesick and head back down south. On the way down, they meet two bums who think of themselves as a duke and as a king. The foursome continue down while the bums trick all the towns along the way out of their money. Eventually, being broke, the bums sold Jim without Huck's knowledge. Huck finds out, and goes to find Jim at the Phelps' farm. Sally Phelps mistakes Huck to be her nephew, Tom Sawyer. Tom later arrives and Huck convinces him to help him steal Jim back and to play the part of Sid. The two of them work out a plan to get Jim out and cause one very large headache for Aunt Sally. In the middle of freeing Jim, Aunt Polly comes and Tom gets shot in the leg. At the end, Jim is set free under the orders of his owner in her will, Tom recovers and Aunt Sally threatens to take in Huck and civilize him.I thought this book was very funny, though a little hard to get into during the first 49 pages, and some parts must be read aloud in order to understand the dialect. I recommend that this be read by everyone ages ten and up."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"As I read Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, I was in love with Mark Twain once again, because this is such a literary wonder. The protagonist, Huck, has to face many issues in his life. He has many adventures and many moral problems to face. He has to go through \\"Rights of passages\\" throughout this story, which give children great morals to follow. He is a great role model in my opinion (but not his shenanigans...). Find out about Jim, the black slave, who is caught between the social choice of Huck or Huck's individual decision on setting him free or turning him in. You just have to read this book. Many others have. Will you?"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"\\"Come here, Huck,\\" Aunt Polly called from the front porch where she was washing the clothes, \\" Don't you dare talk to that nigger again, you hear me, Huck, never!\\"\\"Alright, I am coming I was just making a bargain,\\" Huck yelled back as he slipped the money in his pocket.My essay is on the book Huckleberry Finn. I read this book and loved it. I think this book shows a friendship between a black slave and a white boy during a time when that was considered an unusual thing.This book takes place during a time when blacks were not treated equal. Blacks were thought of as property not as humans. An example of this takes place in the down town slave market.\\" Cheap niggers, get your cheap niggers,\\" a slave driver called out from on top of the stage. Families are being separated and children are crying while they are standing in shackles and cuffs. This is hatred.In this book, there is a lot of action. Every time you turn the page somebody is getting into trouble. It even goes as far as to put on a play to rip people off.\\" Come see the Play of Nonsense, the best in the world,\\" the duke yelled to the listeners. The duke and so called king are going to put on a play. Their idea is to rip people off and run with their money. It is a smart idea but later on they pay for it. The next night the play starts. Hundreds of people walk in and hand their money to the duke. Right when the play starts, the duke comes out and announces that there have been some misunderstandings and rushes off withthe money he collected from the audience. This book's plot is awesome.In this story the main characters are laid back and have a great sense of humor. An example this happens when Huck and Jim, a runaway slave, are rafting down the huge river. Jim is in great danger, but they always have time to play tricks on other people.Also, there is a lot of dirty tricks and cheating. All four characters have a good sense of humor and a mind that is made to get into trouble. An example of this takes place when Huck fakes his own death and fools everybody while he lives on a raft for two years. He left his Aunt Polly behind to mourn about him and fooled everybody else. For a while he stayed on a little island but then decided to raft down a river. He made his own camps and caught his own food. All this to him was a fun vacation. He loved it!In conclusion, this book is awesome! My four beliefs are: there is a hatred toward blacks in this story; the plot is filled with all kinds of action; the characters are happy, laid back, and have a great humor; and there is a lot of bad trick playing and a whole bunch of cheating in this story. I think Twain was trying to show us an ideal example of friendship."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This book is about a boy who was taken in by a nice widow to be protected by his drunken father. The father got custody of him again. Huck was abused and chased around the house with a knife being called, \\"The Angel of Death.\\" Huck stages his own death and runs away. While he's running away he meets up with a runaway slave named Jim. Huck and Jim then start to have weird adventures.This is one of the funniest books ever. It totally portrays the South as it was 150 years ago. It also portrays the innocence of children and their ability to make change. The book also has good morals which preach against the evils of slavery.If you're looking for a hillarious read, then buy this. If you're looking for an intellectual read, then buy this.

This is a faithful reproduction of a 1948 edition and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the paper, cover, and especially the illustrations. Beautiful color paintings on the cover and some throughout the text as well, with black and white pen and ink drawings at intervals. The illustrations in no way interfere with the reading; this isn't a watered down children's version, rather the presentation is suitable for adults as well."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I was introduced to this book back in high-school (in Australia), where my English Literature teach (who was an American) used this as one of our set texts. Despite this, I really enjoyed it, and now, near 20 years later, I picked it up in some second hand book shop for $1.50 and got engrossed in it all over again.Mark Twain (not his real name) sailed the Mississippi river as a riverboat pilot early in his career, and the truth of his depiction of people and way of life in this novel shines through, despite the fanciful nature of the adventure. I couldn't help but get caught up in the crazy tale of Huck Finn, hopeless trouble-magnet that he is, as he struggles to get free of his troubles with the less-than-helpful assistance of a large cast of characters.The language is a joy to read. The characters are fun to follow. And although the plot isn't the most complex, the characters themselves do a fabulous job of making the simple into convoluted mayhem. Several times I had to laugh out loud at the absurdity.Even though I picked this book up cheap, it's well worth hanging onto. I can easily see myself re-reading this again - hopefully before another 20 years pass!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This book accurately depicts the lifestyle and thoughts and feelings of Americans during the time slavery was legal. This book incorporates many concepts from other books such as Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet when the Grangerfords and Sheperdsons feuded against each other over a marriage. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"How can one critically review what is arguably the greatest American novel? Very carefully! Twain, who briefly served the Confederacy was a river boat pilot, miner, reporter, lecturer, acerbic wit, devoted family man, was the premier writer of 19th century America.In \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" Twain thoughtfully and compassionately weaved a tapestry of mid-stream American life and culture which probably did more to positively change white America's view of its black minority than any legislation ever could. He achieved all that while creating a timeless world of youthful adventure to where countless generations can escape.This wonderful volume is a replica edition that contains almost 200 original illustrations by E. W. Kemble, which conveys the raw excitement of life on the Mississippi. It should be given as a present along with \\"The Complete Tom Saywer,\\" so the reader can have access to the the entire mythos that Twain recorded."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"First off, I love this book and I was very mad to hear stuff like \\"All people who like it are stupid\\" I read one review where the person said \\"It shows how stupid Anericans can be\\" You misspelled Americans buddy! People did talk like that. I know because they still talk like that. I loved the language, and snobs who just turn their noses up and say \\"that's not proper English!\\" are obnoxious and pitiful! How is it hard to read? The bad reviewers called lovers of this book stupid when they couldn't even understand the book. Twain uses the N word so much because that's how people talked back then! Americans who insult this book are uncultured, know nothing about history and are complete snobs. I find Jim to be a kind, patient, fatherly figure, Huck to be an interesting main character and Tom to be lovable and funny. People say it's childish and that Jim is childish, but that's because the book is written through the eyes of Huck, a 13 year-old boy. You would have to be racist to call this book racist. MARK TWAIN WAS VERY ANTI SLAVERY! I'm really mad that people can be so ignorant as to want to ban this book. People say that Huck's adventure were boring, but they were not. He is a 13 year-old helping to free a slave and then there's all the stuff in between. How many 13 year-olds do you know who have ever travelled down the mississippi river constantly being hunted for, without any parents? I love this book, the characterization is flawless and all Americans should read this and enjoy it. Mark Twain was a brilliant writer and all you people who hate on this book and are mean to people who like it, I feel kind of sorry for you that you are such stupid snobs who can't even understand a dialect which is still used today. This book takes place at America's most shameful time in history and yet I am still proud that this is a book that represents america."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is certainly a highly controversial book, but you can really enjoy it if you try to read it as a unique piece of writing, because there aren't really any other pieces of fiction written like it, except for maybe Tom Sawyer.At the beginning of the book Huck Finn is thirteen years old. His father is a drunk who lives slightly out of town and usually leaves Huck to his business. But Huck has recently come across $6,000 and his father just heard about it. Huck lives with an elderly widow and her sister Miss Watson and Miss Watson's slave Jim. The widow and Miss Watson are trying to \\"sivilize\\" Huck by getting him to wear nice clothes and go to church and school. Huck misses his own life out in the woods. But one day his father shows up in his room and tries to get him to give him the money he has heard about. Huck doesn't have it and so his father takes him to his shack out in the woods. Huck enjoys the fact that he is no longer being \\"sivilized\\", but he is often beaten and whipped by his father. One day Huck manages to escape and builds a raft, with which he floats down the Mississippi River. While living on an island, Huck finds the remains of another man's camp and starts to run away but then he realizes it is none other than Miss Watson's Jim, who is trying to run away so he can't be sold in New Orleans. Huck and Jim join forces and float down the river with numerous adventures and encounters and misfortunes through until the end of the book, which really has an interesting end, very controversial to some but enjoyable to others.It is important to read Huck Finn as a unique piece of literature. Some people are frustrated by its use of language, its slow beginning, sometimes an apparent lack of action, and Mark Twain's use of the confusing southern slave dialect. Try to get through the first 5 chapters and it starts to get more interesting. There are some spots later in the book where the story hits a speed bump, but if you read it from a historical perspective and have researched the area where this book takes place, it is far more easy to visualize the book and it can make it a great book to read. One of the best strategies is to read it slowly and to try to imagine yourself as a teenager alongside Huck, maybe just out of view. Another good idea is to read Tom Sawyer before Huck Finn."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The CD helped my students with the dialect. It is read by one person and he is really good in giving Huck a personality true to the book. The only upset is that you will have to keep track of the chapters with the numbering of the CD. The price is cheap and you really get what you paid for. Good luck!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This is the most entertaining book I have ever read. Numerous times I laughed out loud. \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" has been called the greatest American novel ever written and I don't doubt that it is."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is one of those novels that could easily go either way in the minds of a reader. Some people find it either boring or offensive, particularly because of its excessive use of the \\"n word.\\" Others balk at the unbelievability of the plot premises (such as carrying an escaped slave south rather than north). Still others find the excessively colloquial linguistic style distracting and difficult to read. Any or all of the above could cause a person to dislike this story.I myself certainly noticed the shortcomings above (although I personally enjoyed the colloquial language and realized that the use of the \\"n word\\" was historically accurate and would have been used much as we today say \\"black\\" or \\"African-American\\"). However, I was able to largely overlook the problems of the novel and appreciate it on a more simple level: an adventure-filled journey down the river.In addition, I appreciated the central device of Huck's character: he acts consistently against his conscience, which is representative of the deplorable attitudes that were prevalent at the time. Through his actions, we see that he is not truly racist, but that society has imposed racism upon him. We see that he is impressionable, and will allow bad things to happen for a while, but ultimately he will step in and try to stop them. In this way, he is representative of the \\"innocent\\" child, whose worse qualities are always a result of others around him rather than anything innate.Overall, this book is worth reading as a parable on freedom and conscience, and deserves a place among the great American classics."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Twain's colorful and darkly funny critique of the antebellum American South is no less stinging (and no less controversial) 125 years after it was first published. Its satire of race relations, vigilantism, hypocrisy, and romanticism may remain just as relevant, but it's Huck and Jim's travels down the Mississippi River - the quintessential journey to reinvent oneself - that makes Huck Finn the decisive Great American Novel."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This book has the reputation in some quarters as the greatest American novel, and now that I have finally read it, I can see why. Mark Twain's great achievement is to write a story that is so thrilling, engaging and, at times, laugh out loud funny, yet can also be appreciated on a very deep level.Huck Finn resists being \\"civilized,\\" but he proves to have a practical intelligence and an innate moral sense that is superior to that of the civilized and educated society that he stands outside of. This is most powerfully represented by Huck's friendship with the runaway slave Jim. Even though he believes, along with the rest of white society at that time, that he is doing the wrong thing by helping Jim escape, he cannot turn his back on a friend and decides that he would rather be \\"bad\\" than betray his trust. They are joined for a time by a pair of con men who are terribly cultured (or at least do a good job of faking it), and Huck is deeply impressed by them until he begins to realize the full extent of the harm they cause. This is also the funniest part of the book. The last section, in which Tom Sawyer reappears, slows things down a bit, but here, too, we see Huck's superiority. Tom is an eternal boy, always looking for games and adventure. For reasons I won't reveal here, we learn at the end of the book that Tom has inadvertently been quite cruel to Jim because of this never-ending search for excitement, and that Huck would have done better to obey his own inclinations rather than follow the lead of the friend he idolized.As in \\"Tom Sawyer,\\" Twain presents a fascinating and detailed picture of life on the Mississippi before the Civil War. He makes it easy for us to immerse ourselves in Huck's world. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Travelin' down the great waters of the Mississippi starts the adventures of Huck Finn and ole Jim. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn takes place on the Mississippi river and begins when Huck Finn runs away from home and ends up meeting the Widow Douglas's slave Jim. Huck finds out that Jim was running away, too, so Huck helps Jim get to the free states. One of the adventures that this book includes is when Huck Finn and Jim pick up these two men that were kicked off a steamboat. Huck and Jim didn't know these two guys were con men until they start robbing different towns money. Read the book to find out all the different adventures Huck and Jim have to over come.I was surprised how great this book was because I didn't think it would be nearly as good as The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, but it ended up being the best book I've ever read and enjoyed. I could even imagine myself on the raft with Huck and Jim traveling down the Mississippi. This book is a little difficult because it uses country accent. I would recommend this book that likes an adventure, but can handle a challenge.-Andrew"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"(sorry if i mispelled your name). At first i found this book somewhat hard to understand given the very nature of the writing style i could easily imagine a southerner sitting on a porch with a pipe telling this story to his grand kids or something word for word. Asides from this though i was quickly taken with the characters and the subtle yet distinct philosophies and suggestions that the book is filled with behind the guise of an entertaining tail of a boy's adventures down the Mississippi River. I don't understand how any critic could call this book trash or see any reason to ban it in some school libraries. Both the book and the author are very insightful into not only human nature but also into humor as demonstrated again and again by the Duke and the King. Sam Clemens also expresses his low opinion of frontiers folk who just as readily want to lynch someone as they are drinking at a pub. Overall, if you can get past the way it was written, this is a very insightful book and i reccomend it to anyone who enjoy sa good story or to someone who can read between the lines."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Adventures of Huckleberry FinnHuckleberry Finn is an entertaining but dark epic, considered a masterpiece by some and offensive by others.This novel is set in the deep South during the antebellum period. Huckleberry Finn is a boy who, after being subjected to attempts to be \\"sivilized\\" by the Widow Douglas and after being kidnapped and detained by his alcoholic, abusive father, finally sets off down the Mississippi River with Jim, a runaway slave. They strike up an unlikely friendship. When Huck was at home, he and Tom Sawyer pulled a few pranks on Jim, like taking his hat and making him believe that witches flew him around the country while he was sleeping. Now that he is spending more time with Jim, he starts to have a growing respect for him. During the entire journey, Jim treats Huck with respect, almost mothering him. Huck would later remember this, which will affect some of his decisions.While floating down river, they encounter a drifting house with a dead man inside; they came very close to being caught by a dangerous gang, and nearly being run over by a steamboat. Two men who claim to have royal blood in them join Huck and Jim downstream. These men will unwittingly test the loyalty of Huck's friendship with Jim.My opinion of this book is on the fence. I certainly am not fond of it. The dialog can be confusing at times, especially when Jim starts talking. Everyone, including black slaves and white Southerners, use the word nigger frequently. One issue with this is that Huck calls every black person he sees a nigger; is he being a racial bigot or is he just repeating what he has heard all his life? Is he wrong for saying that or can he be excused for it because that's the common word back then for a black slave.Though this book is not one that I would pick up again and again to read, I do not have a passionate hatred for it either. I find certain parts humorous. For example: to find out information from the townspeople, Huck disguises himself in a dress and a sunbonnet. Or when the old man's claim to royalty was that he was the son of Louis the XVI and Marie Antoinette. This book also brings to light how cruel human beings can be to one another. For example: When his friend Buck Grangerford and the male side of his family are killed in a feud with the Shepherdson family: They shoot Buck without a care. Huck would remember that all his life.This is definitely not a children's book. TheAdventures of Huckleberry Finn moves away from the child-like innocence Mark Twain used for Tom Sawyer. Mark Twain instead replaces it with a darker plot, with deeper characters, all the while taking a stab at slavery and the underlying flaws in human nature."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an amazing piece American literature. This book helps you to get in the frame of mind of an American living in the Pre-Civil War era. This book depicts a journey of a young boy traveling down the mighty Mississippi helping Jim, a slave, enter freedom. They met interesting characters such as the duke and the king. These characters distract Huck and Jim from their mission but do help them to realize life lessons. You can really feel for Huck and you see the progression he makes through out the book. He starts off as a very racist boy but turns into a sympathetic young man.Although this book uses words that, by some, are considered vulgar and inappropriate, this is not true at all. They truly help you to understand Huck's and many other's mindset. Mark Twain uses these words but they don't represent Mark Twain's personal opinions. Another thing I like about this book are the messages it tries to teach. Mark Twain is trying to show American's that sometimes the laws of the state and country can greatly differ from the \\"right\\" thing to do. He shows this over a period of time as Jim and Huck's relationship begins to advance. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, even though highly debated, can teach us many things about life and morals."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn is an all around good book. It keeps you wondering what might happen next. There is a lot of excitement and the book rarely gets boring. The book and the story lines are also fairly easy to follow so that one understands what is going on.One of the things I really enjoyed in this book was the way Huck acted. He looked at everything very simply. Huck was also pretty funny; like when he would talk about stuff that widow Douglus would tell him to do. Huck's practical and often socially naive views and perceptions also provide much of the satirical humor in this novel. Huck didn't like to be held down by rules. He wanted to be free to do whatever he wanted when he wanted. The only reason he stayed in school and kept going to church like widow Douglus wanted him to was to spite his Pap. In this book all the friends, Huck, Tom, and Jim all had a very good friendship with one another and they were very loyal to each other during everything they went through.The only thing that some people might not like about this novel is that it is pretty long. The book has 42 chapters, so you should know this book will take you a while to read. I also didn't enjoy the part of the book when Huck is working with the scam artists that are trying to act like there Peter Wilks brothers so they can get the inheritance money from his death. I just thought that part of the story was a little to long and wasn't too realistic.Overall I think that this was a good book. I would suggest reading it if you had enough free time to read a fairly long novel. It will make you laugh and always be guessing and wondering what might happen next."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Huckleberry Fin Book ReviewHuckleberry Fin was an exciting and adventurous book.

Through the eyes of main character, Huck, the reader is able to see how Twain is satirizing this society. Characters such as Pa demonstrate the ignorant \\"white trash\\" in the society, and the widows Douglas and Stevens are examples of the Christian women in the society. Through Huck's thoughts, the reader is able to find the irony that Huck the \\"uncivilized\\" character in the book, may have the most civilized attitude and ideas of all the characters in the story. Twain uses Huck's friendship with Jim, the runaway slave, to deal with the issue of slavery and suggest that slavery is wrong. Twain's strong take on issues in the story are evident and create a powerful novel told in an innocent manner through the eyes of a boy.Hope diz haz helped u"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"When I had to read this book, my first thoughts were, Southern life in the 1800s? Why would I care? Some people are just living in the past.How wrong I was.This book is so great and can be enjoyed by all people, with the exception of close(d)-minded inviduals. The story is about Huckleberry Finn, son of a drunk, regarded as uncivilized and morally lacking. The book is written in the 1st person point of view from Huck's eyes. \\\\To put it briefly, the whole book is about Huck trying to help Jim, a runaway slave, get free. Throughout, there are many episodes on the Mississippi River, where many adventures take place. We get to see Huck grow and mature as a person, having to make decisions and occasionally lie or dress up, yielding humorous moments often. The characterization of Jim is done very well by Twain, and we realize in the end that Jim is the most humane, caring person in the story.The ending was extremely disappointing, from the standpoint of the rest of the book. I will only say this: Tom Sawyer is a jackass. But don't take my word for it, read it yourself and judge for yourself; many regard the ending as great and an appropriate way for things to end. What's done is done, though, and the book still remains a great tale of friendship and adventure.What the book is not, is racist. The N-word is used, but that is for the effect of realism and credibility. If anything, the book is anti-racist, as can be seen in the relationship between Huck and Jim. The book, being written by Mark Twain and all, contains a lot of satire and humor, which is extremely enjoyable.May this book live on, it definitely still matters and teaches us many a great deal."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Hucklebury Finn, written by Mark Twain, was an excellent book. The manner in which the novel was written caught my attention just from the start. Twain combined his distinctive dry humor with some of his exaggerations creating the Mark Twain style. The Adventures of Huck Finn was a sequal of The adventures of Tom Sawyer. Upon reading The Adventures of Tom Sawyer I decided to read The Adventures of Huck Finn. The novel starts off telling us about the end of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. In conclusion Tom and Huck find a treasure so Huck is put a home living with Widow Douglas. Here Huck is'nt so happy. She is trying to teach him all of the proper ways. Soon after his drunken father finds out he has a treasure and beats him almost to death so Huck will give it to him. Huck runs away to an island where he meets a runaway slave, Jim. He and Jim become friends and decide to run away to the free states up north. They find a raft so they can travel by river. Hoping not to be seen, Huck and Jim travel by night. A little while later they encounter a ferryboat which recognizes that they are runaways. After selling Jim to be a slave again, Tom and Huck decide they must free him. In the conclusion of the book, Jim is freed because his prevoius owner had freed him just before she died. The Adventures of Huck Finn was an excellent novel. This work along with The Adventures of Tom Sawyer forever placed Mark Twain amongst the ranks of the greatest writers on earth let alone the United States. The Adventures of Huck Finn, often mistaken as a children's book, has since its creation instigated widespread timult. It and Tom Sawyer were banned in various places around the world for their &quot;questionable&quot; racist content.

His classic wit shines through as does his knack for expressing deep observations about life through the life and events of a child. This book lacks some of the mystique that Tom Sawyer has and the plot moves more slowly. This is still great reading, however, as Twain's effort here is better than many authors' strongest moments.

If you're curious to try Twain, I would recommend Tom Sawyer before giving this one a try."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Let's face it, the novel is flawed.

Good luck kids...hey, isn't &quot;Friends&quot; on?"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The first time I read this book I was much younger. The novel was exciting and adventurous to me. It was about a young boy that escaped from his overbearing life and went on an exciting adventure down a river. It was humourous and entertaining at the time. I recently reread the novel for an American Literature class and the second time around realized there was so much more to the novel. Huck Finn is an American classic written by Mark Twain. The novel is essentially the conflict of man v. society. What seems to be a light hearted adventure story of a boy on the run, it is actually a satirization by the author of society during the time. These satirizations which are entangled within the plot and it's charaters, are a direct attack of Twain's opinion of society and societies &quot;morals&quot;. Throught the novel, Twain humorizes man's foolishness in the beleif of religion and superstition, and questions societies value of the individual and satarizes mans morality of money and time. Twain is satarizing the characters persistent beleif in superstition and a reason for exsistence and explanation of the unknown. The author is exploiting the need for a reason in life and that there is no satisfaction in just being there for no underlying and meaningful purpose. Mark Twain has also made it obvious that he is satarizing society for it's value of an individual. At a point in the novel there is a direct example of this point where the reward for a runaway slave is significantly more than the return of a man that has murdered a young boy. This obviously exploits the societies value of justice in murder, and a runaway slave. The last point is that the author satarizes man or societies value of money over a good deed. In a scene of the novel two characters would have rather given Huck and Jim money to go to a doctor rather than taking the time to assist them in their troubles. All in all, Huckleberry Finn is an extraordinary piece of American Literature and it's playful plot line and underlying truth in society has made it a classic in years past and years to come. If you take the time to read between the lines and through the adventurous plot line, you will discover thoughts and messages of an incredble piece of American Literature!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Huck Finn is a classic novel that almost every high school student has read at some point in their lives. I read it when I was young and it was an exciting novel about a boy that escaped his life and went on an adventure down a river and did what ever he pleased. I recently reread the novel for a high school American Literature class and discovered that it was much more than a childrens &quot;story&quot;. Mark Twain is a classic author who wrote a novel that is adventurous and exciting to the youngest of readers and is deep and intuitive to the most advanced readers. The author is actually satirizing the society of his time through a novel that eventually became a classic. Through his characters and their adventures, the novel exploits the faults of society and it's morals and twisted elements. Twain is satirizing societies value of a person, overbearing superstition, and it's importance of money over time. In the novel a strong aspect of the value of a person is shown when the reward for a runaway slave is significantly more than the reward for a murderer of a young boy. The characters superstition in the novel rules their lives. It seems as though they must have an answer to every question and reason for every occurence, good and bad in their lives. This includes the overwhelming need for religous beleifs and reason they ar here. Another good aspect is the fault over man to put his greed for money in front of everything else. This includes when a man feels, that instead of just offering time and help, they can contribute their money and feel good doing. Twains satirzations in the novel are also present in today's society. Which may be why the novel seems to still be analyzed and praised today. Although the novel may come across as a childrens adventure story the reality in the novel is greater than the perception. If you read between the lines, you will see a mans greater perception of the society around him and a reality of the society of today,"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I think this book is full of surprises and is very fin to read. Before I read it, I heard it was &quot;boring&quot; but after I read it, it became one of my favorite books. I Recommend reading this book. My favorite part of the story is when Huckle is forced to decide society or his heart. This story is one of the most popular stores by Mark Twain. I think Huckleberry Finn ( the main character) is very funny and brave in this story! He is definitely a realist and takes everything like it is. Tom Sawyer, Huckle's ally follows him all through the journey and keeps him company. I think story does not say much about the people around him since the majority of the story is spent with only Jim and it is told in first person.

Twain comments on every major aspect of human society in \\"Huckleberry Finn;\\" if he missed anything, I didn't notice. Saying that Twain was \\"ahead of his time\\" here is trite - he's ahead of our time as well. Fast-forward a thousand years into the future, to the unimaginable cyborgs that will be populating the Earth then, and Twain will be ahead of them as well. It's unfortunate that he didn't anticipate future sensitivity to the N-word, as his liberal use of it throughout the book is understandably offensive to many people. It should be clear from his treatment of the \\"Jim\\" character that Twain's intention was to demolish the philosophies of racism and bigotry of his time.\\"Huckleberry Finn\\" is one of those rare books that one may reread many times, from childhood to old age, and find something different in it each time. This isn't just because we change - our society evolves as well, and each time we will read it within a different context, as in Borges' \\"Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote.\\"Maybe I would give the Martian \\"The Brothers Karamazov,\\" but that would probably make them want to exterminate us.

I like the way Twain humanized Jim and goes in depth about his friendship with Huck. Yes, there are a lot of stereotypes in it, especially the way Jim talks and the over use of the N-word. We have to keep in mind that this book was written in 1885.My biggest problem with the book is the ending. I find the ending anti-climatic, or in other words boring. I would have given the book a 4 stars if it wasn't for the last few chapters. For me, it all started going downhill once Huck meets up with Tom Sawyer and they start scheming about getting Jim out.Regardless, this book is a part of American history and should not be censored out.

On the other hand, the book is a vivid reflection of the life in the 19th century.Whenever Huck went to a new place, the detailed description of this place helps me enter the world of earlier times.

This seminal novel did for literature what the Declaration of Independence did for government. It chooses not to hide behind any pretexts, with its characters speaking in straight-forward language.

This novel is an adventure story brilliantly disguised as a tirade against the civilization of mankind. Twain makes his political points well felt throughout the story, but what saves this novel from being a dry and boring political statement is the grandness of the adventure contained within it. Huckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer, and Jim are three immortal characters of literature. Huck especially I will always picture as traveling on his raft, up and down the Mississippi River forever, painting a picture of America that will never be equaled, for the novel was written in a defining time in American culture, when a sense of adventure that separated us from our English ancestry ran rampant throughout our country. A wonderment prevailed, asking questions about what lay out beyond the horizon. Huck Finn defines that sense of mystery. Maybe he was the first truly American hero, and maybe he was also the last. But his words, &quot;I been there before,&quot; will be immortal."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"A young innocent boy who feels the whole world is against him. Huckleberry Finn feels he is trapped and cornered. His actions are constrained and his freedom is limited. This is what civilization has done to Huck. The only place where he can find sanctuary is the river. For Huck and Jim, the river becomes a place where the only bliss in civilization exists. Everywhere else, civilization is just a force trying to mold them into shapes that they do not want to be. What is civilization? Is it like the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons who would do anything to kill each other or is it like Miss Watson or the Phelpses who buy and sell slaves as if they were chattel? None of the characters have totally civilized characteristics. It appears as though no one wants to be civilized. Even the proper Miss Watson cannot live without her dear slaves. Whether she is good to them or not is not an issue. The fact that she does not look at them as her equal takes points off her character. How can a society consider itself civilized if they deny the humanity of large numbers of people in it? The satirical novel ridicules civilization. Mark Twain tries to look for civilization everywhere but in vain, he finds it where it is least expected. He finds civilization away from the towns and away from the busy people's lives. Civilization lies in the almost isolated surroundings of the river. There is great contrast in the river and the shore. The hands of 'civilization' drive people onto the river. People want to believe that civilization exists on the shore. But the hopeless attempts to reach civilization on the shore show that the river is a better place that is more humanized. It is only in the parts where Jim is treated as a human being where the positive aspects of civilization are shown. Civilization is not when Huckleberry Finn has to wear his nice new clothes or when he has to come for supper when a bell is rung. As Huck says in the last line of the book - &quot;Aunt Sally she's going to adopt and sivilize me and I can't stand it. I been there before&quot; ( Twain 369) Huck doesn't feel he is 'sivilized' when he follows all the proper and decent manners of Aunt Sally. Only when he helps Jim escape from his dreaded fate does he feel humane and good about himself. Instances like when he does the 'right thing' by not giving up Jim, give Huck a more civilized character than anyone else in the book. There is irony in the fact that the person who cares the least about being civilized may in fact be having one of the most civilized emotions of all the characters. He is more civilized and mature than his elders precisely because he looks at the world from a different angle. He rejects the notions on what is necessary and real and goes by feelings other than what the supposedly civilized world follows. His non-conformist nature makes him bold and civilized. &quot;..and so when I couldn't stand it any longer, I lit out. I got into my old rags, and my sugar hogshead again, and was free and satisfied&quot; ( Twain 49) Everyone lives in their own unrealistic realm. Jim wants to be a free man, the Duke and the King believe they can get away with anything, Miss Watson and Widow Douglas think everything can be made perfect and Tom lives in a world of adventure and excitement. No one lives in the real world. If they would just look around they would realize that it is not civilization they are living in. They have created imaginary worlds. Nature and the river is needed to snap them out of their beliefs and bring them to the real world where civilization exists. Even Jim started to accept the fact that it was a next to impossible mission to make himself and his family free. The rich families of the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons are in a feud. Huck Finn and Mark Twain see no sense in the killings between the families. Even for the time the book was written, when civilization was not as advanced as it is today, the feud was looked upon with amazement as to how people could kill senselessly. Both families indulge in uncivilized acts. It is certainly not expected for two families of such elite standing to follow barbarous doings. The King and the Duke hope to get away with their hoodwinking play. They believe that people would fall for it precisely because they haven't yet reached that advanced stage of social development called civilization. Both of them think themselves to be more civilized than any of the people on shore. But the reader knows just how civilized the Duke and the King are. They are nothing but mere scoundrels. And if they are more civilized than the people on shore, then those people do have a long way to go before they reach civilization. Although the people eventually see through their sneaky act, Mark Twain still does not think the people to be worthy enough to have reached the level of civilization that he pictures. The examples of uncivilized people in the book show how society thinks themselves to be civilized. This gives them a feeling of having an edge over those who are not civilized. It is this very feeling that also makes them uncivilized. This is how Mark Twain has viewed people in the book. This is his criticism of civilization. Out of a handful there lie very few that can be called civilized in the world."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Is &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; a racist novel? It certainly does not portray Jim in a very favorable light in the last few chapters especially after he had been portrayed as a warm, loving human being in the middle of the novel. But just because the book seems to fall apart after Chapter 31 doesn't make it a failure and it certainly is not a racist novel. Just consider Twain's use of Pap, of all the people he could have chosen, as the spokesman for white superiority as he denounces the black college professor from Ohio; who looks ridiculous? Pap, of course; the drunken, child abusing bum who contributes nothing to his society except bad breath after he drinks, who considers himself superior to Jim solely on the basis of his skin color. There are also many other instances in the novel that clearly show how Twain uses Huck's willingness to test things out early in the novel(remember his testing out of Miss Watson's ideas about prayer and also Tom Sawyer's story about the genie and the lamp?) to prepare us for his growth in love for Jim the black slave, whom he comes to love enough to go to hell for rather than allow him to remain in captivity. Huck gradually learns to have feelings for Jim, feelings that his society told him were wrong, and he also learns to accept the fact that Jim has the same feelings for his own family as a white person does. Huck says, &quot;It don't seem natural, but I guess it's so.&quot; Is he grudgingly admitting this here? No, no more than Twain himself is grudgingly writing about it. Is the book a racist book? Hardly. It is a book about the stupidity of racism, a major problem still in our society today, but one that hopefully one day will be wiped away just as Huck's was by the time Twain wrote Chapter 31. What happens after that chapter is a disappointment perhaps, since Jim reverts to the subservient slave he had been early in the novel, and Huck lets Tom take over, but at the end, when Huck rejects Aunt Sally's offer to adopt him and 'sivilize' him, he decides to light out for the territory; if what he has experienced in the white adult world is civilization, he wants no more of it. He is probably a lot like Biff Loman at the end of Death of a Salesman, who, having recognized the falseness of his father's dreams, rejects the crazy city of New York and heads out for his own territory. Both characters are reborn at the end of the respective works. But Tom Sawyer and Happy Loman have learned nothing from their experiences; Happy is going to stick it out in the big city and show them that Willy Loman did not die in vain; Tom Sawyer even gets shot in his game of escape but he wears the bullet around his neck as a badge of honor. Arthur Miller's &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; calls for us to reassess our values and to know who we are; but Mark Twain had Huck do the same nearly a century before."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I'M IN 8TH GRADE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS HARD TO READ BUT I ENJOYED IT VERY VERY MUCH"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Hi,I am a student in Cornwall New York.

Huck is a horrible character and is emotionally mute, except for the occasional \\"doing something good for someone else\\", he has opinions, they're just not strong. Compared to Holden from Catcher in the Rye, Huck is a character who lacks substance. Huck's adventures along the Mississippi River with an escape slave Jim are very unbelievable. On these adventures Huck encounters many people that Mark Twain wants the reader to see how awful these people are, leaving Huck Finn at the end of the book not liking people. The characters are occasionally funny and thought provoking. Mark Twain uses this book to look at human nature unlike Tom Sayer which is a children's book. Mark Twain also uses alot of symbolism in the book, so half of the book is understanding and noticing the symbolism."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"An American classic, a literary work of art, these are just a couple of things that you hear about, Mark Twain's; The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. This novel takes place in the late 1800's on the Mississippi river, with a young run away boy, Huckleberry Finn, and his runaway slave friend Jim. The novel takes you on their journey down the Mississippi, where the two endure many triumphs and tribulations. In the midst of Huck and Jim's struggles, a friendship between them develops. At the end Huck and Jim are caught, only to find that Jim was set free months earlier by his owner. Before this happens though Tom Sawyer comes back into the picture and Huckleberry Finn once again follows Tom into a dangerous scheme that almost gets them killed and puts Jim through hell.In my opinion I would not call this novel a work of art, for sure! It is a fantastic story and really keeps the reader's attention. Then it ends, and sucks! The whole last three chapters of this book had me so angry. Jim gets caught and Huck is going to try to get him free but in the process meets up with his very self involved, immature friend, Tom. Tom then comes up with this outrageous scheme to brake Jim out. Instead of putting his foot down and freeing Jim, Huck goes along with Tom's plan. The plan not only makes a total fool of Jim, but almost gets both the boys killed. The novel takes you through this journey and you see Huck and Jim becoming friends, maturing with each other and learning acceptance. Then comes the ending where Huck morphs back into this careless boy who is trying to JUST free a slave for fun. Twain shows you how Huck matures throughout the book, just for him regress back to a follower. It makes no sense to me. How can a person go through this wonderful journey with another and form this bond just to throw it away in an instant. It's like Twain just gave up at the end, like he took the easy way out. Maybe he had writer's cramp, I really don't know. I do know that in my opinion this book gets huge thumbs down.Anita"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Mark Twain's &quot;Adventures of Huck Finn&quot; is a series of scathing social commentaries about America of the mid-nineteenth century, barely covered with a minimalist plot. The reader must be forewarned that this Twain's work is drastically different from the high adventure of &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot;. The reader must also be ready to grapple with the Huck's bad spelling (since the entire book is narrated from his naive perspective) and the partway-comprehensible colloquial of the dialog. In my personal experience, the book ranges from mildly engaging during the cynical criticisms, to slow as tar during the &quot;action sequences&quot; (although the action sequences are in themselves criticisms, but the humor factor isn't sufficient to overshadow the action).The plot is paper-thin, and on its own leads virtually nowhere. It mostly consists of Huck and Jim ( a runaway slave) floating down the Mississippi on a raft. This journey quickly loses its point - the pair floats past the free states and just keeps going on. Nevertheless, this premise manages to propel the reader from one parody to the next with a measure of success. The social commentaries themselves are fairly original in content and in that they fit the situations well, but the reader does eventually tire of stupid, drunken, and easily-fooled villagers and the monotonous charlatans and vigilantes that populate the book's pages. An unexciting, although insightful read."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Though it may be considered a classic novel, timeless and forever enchanting, I found myself angered as I was forced to read this book for my english class. I can understand why many rave about Twain...he captured a popular American literature style for the time period. I, however, am not a supporter of his simple vocabulary and sentence structure. Twain avoided \\"flowery\\" words, instead using words that an elementary student would use. I also understood how he wrote using a character's dialogue,but I still detested every moment of it. Reading Jim's part was like wading through quicksand, and sometimes I found myself sinking to a point I never thought I would get out of.Also, I found myself disliking the popular character Tom Sawyer. I didn't find him the least bit charming, and I really felt that he was quite the illogical, egotistical little prat. I can say that I did quite like Huck Finn, even if reading his narration was barely short of torture.I often enjoy classic novels, but I can assure you that I will never read a Twain novel again. The only reason I gave this book as much as two stars was simply because I almost enjoyed hating it, because some of it humored me so."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"There were a lot of weird mistakes/typos in the publication.

As I fisrt opened up the book I was so so curious about reading the novel because it had so many interesting things that appeared on the front cover of the book. The cover of the book seemed to be a catching title so I decided to read the book and check it out becausse mostly all my friends have read this book and asked them what the book was about they said it was a cool book so now I decided to read it.The first chapter was interesting it was about Mark he found six thousand dollars a piece in a cave and he gave the money to judge Thatcher and so the judge gave him back n his friend a dollar piece everyday for interest. Tom and his friend seemed trouble for towards this. Tom and Mark seemed to be very enthusiastic about hanging around together.I thought the first few chapters were very catching and appealing towards others. But asI kept at it reading the book I found a lot bias surrounding the book. I couldn't believe this there was so much hate and foul language in the book. My thoughts towards the book began to dread away.A book title can describe a thousand words but when siting down and reading the book I found that the book was totaly out of my league to read I was so astonished by the language that was being used and expressed at others.

I wish someone would have told him that it's quality, not quantity. Overall, I found that characters I wanted to stay died and characters that I wanted dead stayed, making for a tedious and dull read."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain, is a dull book that is kept alive only by its strong moral lesson that contradicts the rights of slavery. Jim, an African-American runaway slave, is on the search for his own freedom by escaping to the south. Shortly into his journey, he phenomenally runs into and befriends Huck, a rambunctious wild child who is also coincidentally running away from home! Although the lesson is important, I found that it clouded Twain in his ability to entertain me as a reader. Insignificant chapters and random characters slowly drag along as Huck defeats all odds in his unrealistic encounters that take place on the Mississippi River. Repeated character personalities and storyline ideas created confusion for me as I was also perplexed by Jim's heavy dialect. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who is actually looking for an actual action plot as it is a huge disappointment as a sequel to the thrilling Tom Sawyer novel."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I can understand why this book is considered one of the greatest piece of literature in America. Huck Finn dealed with a lot of sensitive and humanity issues, in which society at the time was not aware of. I admired Twain for his audacity of bringing such faults of society. HOWEVER, I found this book the most boring and monotonous book I've ever read. Twain did not capture my attention with his coloquilism, which I thought was extremely overused. His descriptive passages were painfully verbose, I literally had to slap myself a couple of times to stay awake and read this darn book. I just found this book disgusting boring, but that's just my opnion."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"We wanted a pure copy of the original text by Mark Twain with all its politically incorrect jargon.

The other is found in &lt;Huckleberry Finn&gt; when Huck decides against turning Jim in, even though his soul would rot in hell for it. The point is that Huck really believed that he was going to be damned for helping Jim (which was why the decision was so difficult to make), but was willing to face the consequences anyway.The major letdown of this book is that last part with Tom Sawyer. The book's tone changes suddenly; it becomes almost juvenile. Those last chapters are what's keeping me from giving this book the full five stars.As for the dialects, I had surprisingly little trouble with them even though English is not my first language. A suggestion; if you come across a word you really don't get, try reading it aloud. If that doesn't work, read the whole sentence aloud. You'll be able to deduce what the word is supposed to be."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"After reading many of the reviews below, I have come to the conclusion that perhaps this novel should not be taught at the high school level. Personally, when I read &quot;Huckelberry Finn&quot; my junior year, I thought that it was an enjoyable break from reading other early American classics, but judging from some of the reviews, others didn't agree. I don't understand exactly what was considered so &quot;boring&quot; about this novel. This book provides the reader with action, humor, and morals; what any 'classic' should do. For those who think of themselves as highly intellectual and felt that the novel didn't have a point, you may want to check your IQ, because I think your ego is in for a massive let-down. Although Twain clearly states at the beginning of the novel that he doesn't want his readers to try to find a point in his 'coming of age' story, the theme of the novel almost smacks the reader in the face. The 'point' is that friendship is more important than social standards and sometimes you have to put yourself at risk in order to save those that you care about. This classic will remain so as long as those who are forced to read it lighten up a little and actually open their minds to a great piece of literature."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This is a very time specific book and it takes you back to a time when life seemed free and easy. It was anything but. Huck is footloose and fancy free but running in the background is his loyalty to his friends. He still 'tries' to get an education so he won't have to follow in his father's footsteps. He learns that there are people who care for him and he tries hard to please them. It is a wonderful, easy read that will take you out of your busy world. It's almost like taking a holiday.I have read both the unabridged and the sanitized versions and I have to say that for me the unabridged version stays closest to the time and era of the book. The way people spoke in those days has a lot to do with the flavor of the book."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"\\"All modern literature stems from this one book. There was nothing before, there has been nothing as good since.\\" I wish I could have been the one to coin that description of Twain's best known work. I guess coming from Ernest Hemingway it does carry a bit more weight. \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" is one of the more commonly referred to works when people speak of the \\"Great American Novel.\\" A fictional account of a young boy's voyage down the Mississippi River, Huck Finn guarantees that as long as he is around people will still care about American literature. It combines Twain's knack for humor with very real and mature social issues.The main character is of course Huckleberry Finn. When \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" . . . Huck had found $12,000 and was living with the Widow Watson. At the beginning of this book Huck is kidnapped by his Pap, who only has come back to get his son's money. Huck escapes his father and soon finds himself floating down the Mississippi River with a slave named Jim. Jim was the property of the Widow Watson and overheard her plans to sell him to a slave trader. When he realized he would be leaving the relative comfort of the widow's home he decided to escape.Brought up by a racist, abusive and drunken father, Huck at first sees the escape by Jim as totally wrong. However, as the two travel along the river enjoying one adventure after another Huck finds himself growing fond of his companion and the two form a strong bond.\\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" can only be described with one word, classic. It is one of the few novels that can be read by a child and then re-read year after year without becoming the least bit stale. Such staying power is rare and is proof positive that this book before most others most assuredly belongs on the shelves of every school library. But don't read it because it's a classic -- read it because it's fun! And let me suggest another quick pick: The Losers' Club by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"There are many reasons to read \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" --1. It is a great American classic novel2. It documents a period in history from the common-man's viewpoint.3. It is banned by some libraries and schools (a must-read, therefore on my list always!)4. It can teach you to write.5. It's a great adventure story that can be read aloud to groups, or enjoyed by yourself!The Fischer et al. edition attempts to reconstruct \\"Huck Finn\\" in the way Twain probably intended. In particular, there is a section showing how Twain revised the \\"Sunrise on the River\\" passage to perfectly reproduce the sound of English as spoken by Huck --so reading this is almost as if we are listening to a tape recording of Huck talking. If you are unsure about \\"Huck Finn\\", turn to the Sunrise passage and read it aloud. Then tell me you AREN'T an admirer of this novel.As a lesson for writers, Twain's search to perfect his craft and reproduce the very sound of his characters, along with a splendid use of language and an ability to create adventuresome plot are unparalleled in American literature. Banned? Are you people NUTS? This is possibly one of the greatest American books ever written.A MUST-READ if you love American literature, or really English language literature in general."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I have been a long-time lover of Mark Twain's books. And being analytical, I want to know why something is written the way it is; I want to know the historical details behind his expression. So when I find that the Mark Twain Library has published Huckleberry Finn the way Mark Tain wanted it (unlike every edition that's ever been published, including the first!), I had to get it. Using all the explanatory notes--which are NOT cumbersome--and the glossary, and other notes about the text, I came away knowing that this book was truly what it is proclaimed to be: the best American novel ever written.Having read just about all one can get their hands on by Mark Twain, this shed all new light on what Mark Twain was really saying when I read Huck Finn this time. The humour was more obvious, the sarcasm was more justified. The book itself opens up this door, but it helps to know what was in Mark's brain throughout his writing career.Truly a must have for anyone into Mark Twain. I have purchased all that the MTL has put forth so far, and put my other editions in the yard sale box as errant texted that no longer interest me. I think any fan of Mark Twain will be tempted to do the same. Why read errant editions when one can have the author's intended, authoritative publication--with the original neat pixtures, too. I was so taken by this last reading of H. Finn that I've taken to memorizing some of the glossary terms. They are truly classic; bring'm back.I am reminded of E. A. Poe's expectation that his works be published only as originally intended. This should not need to be requested by any author. To modify an author's writings for any reason is a type of sacrilege. Of course, even Poe's books are published different than he wanted. But thankfully, there are publishers who seek to restore the only versions worthy of publication. The Mark Twain Library is doing this, and any wanta-be authority in Mark Twain will never be such with \\"Penguins\\" and other bird-brained mass-market editions sitting on the shelf, or rather, in their hands."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I received this book as a Christmas present in 1955 when I was eight years old. I had wanted a baseball glove and was deeply disappointed. It sat for three years, unread and unwanted. When I finally did pick it up and begin to read, I was transported in a way that was to change my life. It would be years before I would understand the meaning of such words as irony, satire and metaphor, but I sensed these things in the way I believe they were intended as I read Huckleberry Finn for the first time.I am perplexed and disturbed when I hear how thoroughly misunderstood and controversial this book has become to some, and it saddens me that those that deem it offensive fail to understand how sympathetic it was towards more positive race relations at the time when it was written.William Faulkner spoke of what was most important to writing in his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize for Literature. He suggested that the best writing deals with problems of the human heart in conflict with itself. Mark Twain's &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; succeeds in a beautiful and remarkable way by subtly illustrating the conflict in Huckleberry's mind between what he has been told by society and what he feels in the intellect of his heart.I shall always be grateful to Mark Twain for this work. It was the portal through which my young mind first grasped the immensity of great literature."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"One hundred and twenty years after its publication, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn remains the quintessential American novel. It is an amazingly well crafted piece of work, as complex or as simple as you want it to be. On one level, it is a dissertation on society, slavery, morality and the meaning of civilization. On another, it is simply an entertaining yarn. Whether you are 8 or 88, there is something here for you.At the heart of the novel is the unlikely but heartfelt friendship between Huck and Jim, a runaway slave. Both are outcasts of sort, running away from a society they cannot comprehend. It is through his friendship with Jim and their adventures together on the river that Huck truly finds himself. He is continually confronted with the question of right and wrong and he learns to stay true to himself and follow his own heart, regardless of conventional, social, or religious mores. Huck's instincts rarely fail him. And, as Huck suspects all along, he learns more on the river than he ever did in school or Sunday school.Many readers see the ending (Huck's adoption and continued \\"civilization\\") as a disappointment. I disagree. Huck has grown so much that his individuality has already been forged. Aunt Sally can't change him, no matter how hard she tries to \\"sivilize\\" him. Besides, Huck always has the option of escape.The book has been lambasted in recent years for its shocking language. But I think it is important to understand that Twain was simply being honest and faithful to the dialect, language, and social sensibility of the times. It would be unfair (and a mistake) to apply present day sensibilities and standards of political correctness (well intended or not) to this book. The language may seem harsh but it should seem harsh. There is value in that as well.It would also be lazy to infer that Twain was racist simply because he uses the \\"n\\" word in this book and because of his characterization of Jim as simple and naive. Jim is uneducated, yes, but in Twain's world, uneducated can also mean unspoiled, completely human, noble, and honest. Rather than demeaning Jim, Twain is holding him as an example of the dignity inherent in all human beings.The value of the individual versus the influence of society. The hope and opportunity of freedom versus the comfort and security of civilization. These are themes that have reverberated throughout American literature, American history, and the American psyche. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn develops those themes brilliantly in a captivating story with vibrant and unforgettable characters. It is, and always will be, an American classic."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is to Twain's prequel, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, what the Ring Trilogy is to Tolkien's The Hobbit. In each case the author progressed from noteworthy effort to masterpiece. Huck Finn is a work of art. The funny thing is, he did it by breaking several of the \\"rules\\" in today's literature.Nowadays, aspiring writers are admonished to avoid writing dialect. According to the experts, it has all been done before and done well. They're talking about Huck Finn. Twain's book is a study in American rural dialect between the central and southern states in the nineteenth century. It is so dead-on and hilarious that you can't help but be drawn into the story.Another no-no he commits by today's standards is the preposterous coincidence. When Huck travels a thousand miles down river by raft only to show up weeks later and totally by coincidence at the home of his friend Tom Sawyer's Aunt Sally, it's beyond belief. Of course, the rest of the story is so good and well knitted that we don't particularly care, but my reaction was not \\"Aha!\\" but rather \\"Oh no!\\" Cheap plotting tricks have fallen from favor over the past 150 years.At the heart of the book's greatness, though, is characterization. Huck Finn is one of the most enduringly likable literary characters of all time, the classic unlikely hero. Tom Sawyer is a close second. And yet they are so different. Their words and actions may have surprised us chapter after chapter, but they always stayed true to the characters Twain created. And Twain's sly humanization of Jim, the lovable runaway slave, was ahead of his time and probably second only to Uncle Tom's Cabin in its contribution to the reduction of racial prejudice. Bravo!..."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This is the granddaddy of American literature. Mark Twain is an American icon. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn slyly purports to be a boys book about freedom on the river. It pretends to have no moral or motive at all. This is not so. Mark Twain, in spite his opening rebuke against anyone finding a meaning in the book, is seeking to make a statement. This is a polemic against the evils of slavery. I often felt that Huck Finn parallels Twains own youth. Huck grows to see Jim as a man and a friend. Twain came from a family which owned slaves but he himself came to be vehemently opposed to slavery. Huck Finn comes from a background where slavery is perfectly acceptable. The grand climax is when Huck decides he will go to Hell rather than let his friend be sold back into slavery. He continues to help Jim. This is an amazing tale although the ending is a bit anticlimactic. One is happy that Jim is free however. He emerges as the one true man and gentleman in the whole novel. This is one of the great underlying ironies of the novel. It is often overlooked due to the politically incorrect racial slurs. The slave is the man with the greatest dignity and integrity. It is unfortunate that this point is missed. Mark Twain wrote a masterpiece. The current controversy will eventually fade but The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn will endure as one of the great works of American and World literature."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I adore Mark Twain's hilariouse yet thought-provoking book. Not only does he have the talent to captivate the readers interest but also his characters actions and words have a deeper, often satirical, meaning which requires a sheer genius to produce. Huck is my personal hero because he is never short on solutions or a witty remark. I can relate to his social misfit qualities and some of his philosophys. My favorite line is, &quot;A dog will never bite the hand that feeds it and this is the principal difference between dog and man[kind].&quot; I recommend this to anyone who is looking for an easy to read yet not easy to put down book - the one you're always looking for and rarely are fortunate enough to find. ~15 yrs."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Huck Finn is, along with Faulkner's Sound and Fury, the greatest American novel. The novel is a hillarious slap at romantic chivalry, a great adventure story, an evolution of a man coming of age, as well as a plea to end slavery. I too was forced to read this novel in high school (this year), not once but twice. I am indebted to my teachers. The sinking of the Sir Walter Scott, Huck's decision to endure perdition in order to save Jim, and Tom and Huck's quioxic rescue of Jim are some of the most fantastic scenes in literature. The vernacular is well employed by Twain, not in a racist way, but in a tolerant one. As Huck travels farther into the slave country, he realizes that Jim is a man just like himself. Huck even says that &quot;I knowed he was white.&quot; Huck understands the implications of disagreeing with the orthodox barriers of the time (Walter Scott), but he knowingly violates these supposed values to set Jim free. A boat accident occurs and the response to the question of whether anyone was killed is &quot;Nome. Killed a nigger.&quot; Twain is satirizing the stupidity of this response, not advocating a racist dogma. Jim and Huck discuss the fact that frenchmen talk in a different manner from themselves, but frenchmen are still men. Huck and Jim speak differently, but both are men. This is the messege of this timeless classic. All American novels come from one novel, Huck Finn.

Could someone have actually thought that Mark Twain didn't do a good enough job? I bought 4 of these Dalmation Press Classics books thinking that my children would love them.

It is unfortunate that films cannot capture the Huck's narrative."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The book I chose to read for my book report was The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain. The conflict is man vs. society which is illustrated at the climax when Huck is forced to decide society or his heart. His action's results conclude the story. Huckleberry Finn, the main character in this story is perhaps one of the most well known fictional characters ever. His literal point of veiws provide humor and comic relief in suspenseful situations. He is definately a realist and takes everything literally. In Tom Sawyer, he appeared to be tough, yet in this story, his compassionate side is revealed. He percieves others only by how he feels society would feel about them. This is shown in his attitude towards Jim. Huck is very curious at this point in his life and in the story he is trying to determine what his veiws, opinions, and religious beliefs really are. This makes him succeptable to change throughout the story. Others look at Huck as an uncivilized person. The story does not say much about the people around him since the majority of the story is spent with only Jim and it is told in first person. He changes dramatically in that throughout the story, particularly at the climax, he is faced with many decisions where he has to do the right thing which is the wrong thing in societies eyes. I think that he becomes more secure in knowing what is right. The theme of this story is, &quot; Freedom Versus Civilization&quot;. What I liked in this story is that it had a little bit of everything. This story not only portrays the historical Mississippi River, but it also tells a heart- warming story with humor. This story makes you want to cheer on Huck when he is making those decisions. You become not a reader of the story, but a spectator of the events."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Not that Twain needs any more praise, kudos or whatnot, but I bother to write here only to point out that anyone taking issue with the \\"fine points\\" of language, political correctness (ersatz) or racial issues (contemporary or historic) has ENTIRELY MISSED THE POINT of this timeless American treasure.The entire subtext of this gem of a novel is a polemic AGAINST racism. Twain was a die hard abolitionist and fought tooth and nail against prejudice and bigotry wherever he found them. He was intolerant of intolerance. He wrote this wonderfully funny novel after the end of the bloodiest Civil War imaginable (more lives lost than in any other war we have fought) when the entire nation was wounded, suffering and in need of a good laugh. BUT he was not going to let anything pass, let anyone off the hook and was going to call out fools wherever he saw them. His genius was in putting the words in their own mouths and giving them the staqe on which to do so.The deep friendship he limns between Huck and Jim, an ignorant but sweet white boy and an uneducated but deeply loyal and sensitive runaway slave, will bring tears to the eyes of any reader who can, as it were, \\"read.\\"Twain creates such sympathy both between them and in the reader for them and their perilous situation that no one could have written a non-fiction tract, diatribe or polemic that would have better served the cause of racial equality and harmony.Fiction works through the creative processes and in the hands of a master such as Twain can work miracles. The book remains a miracle and one of our national monuments to good overcoming bad ideas and bad people. A battle won, the war ongoing. Take the time to read it and mind-mend your ways. And, for heavensake laugh, because the situation is so absurd, as are we all, so much of the time."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The curse of a novel that becomes a \\"classic\\" is that everyone is expected to read it. Every open-minded, educated, literate adult will read it, but so will every small-minded, semi-literate, uneducated ignoramus, and unfortunately these are the first to express their sentiments regarding Huck Finn. Add to this the number of reviewers on Amazon who are unable to grasp that they are reviewing a product, not a service, and a book that deserves five stars is demoted to four by the unread majority.It is ironic that The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is often cited for its racist language when, in fact, it is one of the most ferociously anti-racist novels ever written in America. The language used to refer to the slave Jim is not an instance of racism as the censors would have us believe; neither is it easily dismissable as the language of the time, as many of the novel's defenders claim. Either of these positions is simplistic and does not consider the attitudes of the author himself. As a teacher of American Literature for nearly fifteen years, I have read this book countless times, and I have taken an especial interest in the works of Mark Twain. In my opinion, Mark Twain was fully aware of the connotations of the N-word. If this word did not harbor these connotations in his time, the author was certainly far-sighted enough to know that one day it would. Remember, this was a man who was fully attuned to the problem of humanity. He was also an author famous for his scathing use of irony. Why should his use of the N-word to describe Jim be taken at face value? Jim is the most noble character in the book and the only character who consistently rises above his humanity. Even Huck has his lessons to learn, and Miss Watson does not rise to the occasion until she is near death, but Jim's conscience is consistently clear. That he is referred to by the use of any derogatory term must be ironic.This novel has often been criticized for its last few chapters, and perhaps rightly so. It is unsettling when a novel that has worked so hard to develop a theme suddenly abandons this theme for a simple romp a la The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Yes, this causes unity to suffer and makes for a lopsided work, but even here we can at least appreciate the author's intent. In order to fully appreciate how much Huck has changed and progressed, we must look at him again in contrast to his friend and foil Tom Sawyer. If this frustrates us, the readers, at least it does so with good purpose. Whether or not this purpose is fully realized is debatable, but I think we would be amiss to discard the last few chapters of the text simply because we don't get it, and certainly not because it does not suit our personal tastes.Concerning matters of taste, we should approach this book neither with the eyes of the pseudo-elitist who turns up a nose at the word ain't while failing to grasp concepts of regionalism and local color that should be a part of the mind of a literate adult; nor should we approach it with the mind of the simpleton who finds a book boring simply because it contains sentences of more than five words. (Incidentally, it is a sad reflection on literacy when a fictional son-of-a-town-drunk has a greater vocabulary and better grasp of English conventions than we have.) Mark Twain uses a style of writing that realistically tries to simulate the attitudes and vocabulary of people from different regions and cultures in mid-America in the nineteenth century, and to fail to grasp this is to fail to grasp not only Huck Finn but a huge chunk of American literature written during this time.At last, I would like to offer my personal opinion that no book is perfect, but this is one novel that offers a rare balance of enjoyment, humor and significance seldom achieved by any book or any author writing in any time or at any place. That the author is American and was writing at a time that we were becoming more aware of our own corruption, hypocrisy and greed should cause us to move forward, not back. The evils of humanity will never disappear until we are able to approach them with an open, educated mind."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This Kindle version of Huckleberry Finn is great.

(pg76.mobi @ 26.5 mb, 2006 and updated last May 2011) Admittedly far larger than the non-illustrated 880 kb one, which I reckon is the one you used. But, for those willing to use the space for E.W. Kemble's illustrations, here cut and pasted into the text as if from the original as scans, as well as Hamlet's supposed soliloquy--which is hard to read, but it's there as three inserted greyish images of the original book's pages at Loc 2374-5--it may be a work-around solution. THe illustrations and chapters are listed and hyperlinked but the \\"Go To\\" on Kindle via my download takes you to the beginning or cover nearby, not a Table of Contents.Not elegant, but David Widger's \\"production\\" for Gutenberg-dot-org allows us to see it on a Kindle or e-book reader. A prefatory note mentions how this same image file of Huck can be clicked to reformat it to look better on a computer or laptop as opposed to the version I am consulting for the Kindle. Better versions illustrated with Kemble's images exist for a cost, of course. I posted this not as a review of the text itself (which may surprise those who forget how the plot falls apart towards the end despite all its earlier strengths!) to help others searching for this e-book version. It looks as if the illustrated version is the more complete e-book text, at least the one offered at PG for free.Paul Killebrew in Aug. 2011 reviewing found a flaw in the public domain text version Amazon offered as of that writing: no end to Chapter 23 and no Hamlet's marvelous mash-up of the Bard's greatest one-liners--so I wanted to mention this. I compared a printed copy and the e-text of the U of Virginia with that of the illustrated Gutenberg and they matched for Ch. 23. But the online Gutenberg text lacks the Hamlet material. I suspect the non-illustrated one via the public domain text at Gutenberg as with that offered for Kindle download in this listing may lack the material too.Any public domain text now seems by Amazon to be lumped into all sorts of media. So, evaluation of one e-book (or audiobook) appears harder and harder to carry out as the editions proliferate for newer devices. As controversy continues around how to teach this classic American story, readers may wish to have this illustrated version for portability or quick consultation, and can check it against the more stable printed editions widely available."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Mark Twain is a great author, and this is a classic work of American literature, and a fun read.

I wished I had read it when I was younger. The friendship between Huck and Tom is so genuine."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The following review is from my blog, Cure My Writer's Block:The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is technically the sequel to Tom Sawyer, but it can and often is read as a book on its own. It is the story of Huckleberry \\"Huck\\" Finn and his adventures on the Mississippi River as he and the runaway slave, Jim, escape downstream. Along the way they have adventures involving fog banks, con artists, feuding families, mistaken identity, and countless others. Twain takes you on a trip of the Mississippi River culture of the mid 1800's.Huckleberry Finn is a great book that is related to Tom Sawyer, but is truly a whole different animal. It has a serious, thoughtful side to it. There is definitely the trademark Twain humor to be found throughout the book, with moments that will have you laughing out loud if you try to visualize them. However, there is an important underlying story and lesson about racism, friendship, loyalty, and human decency. That is what makes this story one which I have read and reread several time since I first was assigned to read it in 7th grade, more years ago than I care to admit!There have been school districts in the past that have banned this book because of concerns about racist content. This is something that needs to be addressed. There is certainly racism in this book. In fact, racist attitudes and the use of racists terminology is a consistent theme throughout the narrative. The problem is that if you just notice that it has racism, you truly miss the point that Twain was trying to make. Yes, Huck Finn had lots of racists views that he was raised with, as were most people of that time period. He doesn't question them, because he was always told that's how things were. Even the runaway slave, Jim, sees things much the same way because that was the culture of the region. What is so amazing about this book (and what makes me weep anytime a school district bans it) is that Huck Finn, without even realizing it, grows past his racist upbringing to see Jim as a true person and friend. He still used the same racist language, as does everyone in the book (and, historically, from that time period), but he sees past the words. Here is a young man that is convinced that people who help slaves escape are going to Hell. Once his friend is in danger of being sent back into slavery, he faces an internal struggle about what he should do. He finally comes to the decision, \\"I just reckon I'll go to Hell, then!\\" Reading that statement in the book almost makes you want to cheer out loud. Yes, he still uses language and sees some things in a way that is disgusting by modern standards, but he still took that step into the light and was willing to take such a bold risk for someone that he no longer saw as a slave, but as a man and a true friend.If there is a downfall to this novel, it is the language, and I don't mean the racist language (which still makes it a little uncomfortable to read even when you take its setting into account). Twain tries to capture the colorful language and terminology of the age and region, but the spelling and liberal use of apostrophes can be painful to the brain and even more painful if you try to read it out loud. I found that I had to read quickly through a lot of sections so that I wouldn't think too much about them and confuse myself on what he was trying to say.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a time honored classic that should be on most people's shelves. The controversy surrounding it and the language issue costs it a little in its review score, though. I laughed, I cried, I cheered, I begged a grammar teacher to visit these characters!Christopher Slaterauthor of Trapped in Shades of Grey"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Tom Sawyer is a vibrant telling of life in a small town along the Mississippi River in the 1800's. Mr. Clemens paints great word pictures in a dialect of the times. Even though the offensive word for blacks is used, the reader should realize that the word is historically significant and tolerate its use as reflective of those times."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Largely plotless and oftentimes difficult to read because of the extensive use of particular vernaculars, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has, regardless, entered the American subconscious in the late 1800s and has stayed with us now into the 2000s. The work itself is a long, drawn out traveling blog of a young boy who needs to escape an abusive father, the rigors of becoming \\"civilized\\", and the confined spaces of a family oriented lifestyle. Huck Finn, not yet 14, is an inventive, creative, but also rational individual who's sense of adventure is only rivaled by Tom Sawyer. Where Tom creates plot and adventure and suspense, Huck is willing to allow life to take it's course, like the river he travels upon, and will simply adjust to the bumps encountered on his travels.Huck leaves his old life behind and begins his travels and ends his travels with Jim, a black man who, despite the time period, is the single most rational individual in the entire story. In fact, his one liners and his ability to have a sincere sense of empathy and care for Huck raises him above the other adult characters that are riddled throughout the story. More often than not, the duo will encounter murderers, swindlers, and drunkards that don't have a single redeeming quality about them to compare with the soft spoken, attentive, and motherly association that we garner from Jim.Despite being relatively without a plot the book is simply about life, namely the life of an American boy and all the adventures he can get into when allowed to roam free. That mentality is the very embodiment of our desires, our wishes to travel, explore, to understand, to live, and to feel free. Huck feels the most freedom when it's quiet, away from the noise and bustle of cities and towns, and when the river is peaceful and the sky is alight with the moon and stars. He sometimes feels alone, but rarely lonely. He accepts Jim's company and is happy to have him as a traveling companion while nature takes its course.Though it was written as a sequel to Tom Sawyer, Mark Twain creates a stand-alone story that has captured the minds and hearts of any exploratory individual, whether as a child or as an adult and it will most likely continue to captivate us for many years to come."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Like many people of my age (62), I read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn as a child because at that time it was widely perceived to be a child's or young adult's book. This is unfortunate as it is not nor has it ever been directed at the young. In my rereading I discovered for the first time why it is still called the original great American novel. Huckleberry, like Twain, is opinionated and perceptive. His narration and point of view drive the novel forward. Rather than relegate this work to the children's shelves or castigate it as racist, folks should embrace this novel for what it is, a bildungsroman that shows the growth of a country as well as the growth of its young protagonist."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"In Adventures of Huckleberry Finn we see the initial paragraph introducing this story as a flashback. Huckleberry Finn, or Huck, starts to recount how he and his friend Tom Sawyer discovered a lot of money and right from the start we see a style of writing that mimics that of an under-educated youth. It is wrought with spelling and grammar mistakes, which help to develop the character of Huck and you instantly understand his education and maturity level, or lack thereof. This first person recounting of events does a lot to draw you into how Huck saw the world around him.The setting of this book is in the mid 19th Century, starting in Missouri in a small town on the Mississippi River. The locations change many times in the book as a main theme of the story is escape. Huck initially escapes life under the guardianship of Miss Watson and Widow Douglas, then he ends up having to sneak away to escape his father. After this escape he discovers the slave Jim and embarks on a journey to help him escape to Ohio to break free from his slavery.When Huck meets Jim we see an internal struggle, the conflict of the overall story. Huck wonders if he should turn in Jim, since he is someone's property after all. At this point in the story he decides not to turn Jim in and then starts his transformation.The two of them begin to build a friendship that ultimately changes Huck. You see a shift in his views on people and slavery that continues all the way through the end of the work. During this building of friendship you slowly see a shift in how Jim is portrayed in the story, from a very racist caricature of a black man to a friend and equal with Huck; from a slave fleeing captivity to a free man. We see Jim's compassion when he doesn't let Huck see the dead body in a flooded house they find, which we later discover was Huck's own father.Another interesting little sub-story within this work is when Huck and Jim get separated as a steamship floods their raft. We see Huck get taken in by a man name Buck and his family the Grangerfords who are locked in a feud with a rival family the Sheperdsons. The whole thing turns to a major conflict as Buck's sister runs away with a man from the Sheperdsons. This is a parallel to the well-known Romeo and Juliet story that we all can relate to, and in this conflict we see the excitement as Huck barely escapes alive.This story goes on to tell the story of this little adventure but much of it is little more than enjoyable reading, except for the introduction of two new characters, King and Duke. This is important because this leads to the re-introduction of the conflict, whether Huck should help Jim or turn him in. The King, ends up playing the Judas of the story and sells his information about the escaped slave Jim. This leads to the crisis and climax.Jim gets seized and help on a plantation, which we find out is owned by Huck's friend Tom's aunt and uncle. At this point we see Huck overcome his conflict. He feels that he is helping to steal Miss Watson's property (Jim) but decides that regardless of the consequence, he was going to do it. When Huck goes to investigate he is mistaken for Tom and uses this opportunity to gather his information.The story the goes into the intricate escape plan that Tom and Huck devise. We see an exciting scene where Tom is shot in the leg and Jim stays behind to help him. Jim's decision ultimately leads to the failure of this attempt and he is taken. This leads into the final resolution, as we find out that Jim was already free. Miss Watson had died and freed him in her will.This is a very fun story with a few sub-stories included. The overall theme is escape and the conflict, crisis and climax are all very apparent. The resolution of the story comes as a welcomed surprise as any reader would develop a connection with Jim just as the first person narrator, Huck, does. This is a well structured work and a very interesting read."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I received Paul Newman's reading of the Adventures of Tom Sawyer as a gift. It's a stunner, a wonderfully entertaining two and half-hours of fun and thrills. I enjoyed it so much I decided to get Jack Lemmon's companion reading of the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Wow, this performance is so enthralling I listened to the entire audio book in one sitting. The book is written with Huckleberry Finn as the first person narrator. Who would have ever imaged it but Jack Lemmon is Huckleberry Finn. Two time Academy Award winner Lemmon's Huck is full of pluck and cunning, mischief and excitement when he escapes from his Pap, confronts the King and the Duke and plots with Tom Sawyer. His contrition after playing the mean joke of Jim after they separated in the fog is palpable. And the famous Lemmon mannerisms are everywhere in evidence. Mr. Lemmon seems to be enjoying every moment of Mark Twain's wry and wonderful writing; he makes the characters live.

Mark Twain sure knew what he was doing when he wrote Huck Finn. He was sending out a message to the world. As Huck once said &quot;Humans can be awful mean to each other&quot;. I believe that this is the message that Mark Twain wanted to get across. An ignorant little boy, Huck Finn, defies all that he knows when rescuing Jim. He even recognizes that we are all the same underneath the skin; we are all human. Huckleberry Finn is the most unlikely hero. As aforesaid, he was ignorant and unconventional. Knowing nothing, he set out into the world and had amazing adventures. He might have been uneducated but he certainly knew what was most important in life. As a literary piece, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is amazing. It drags a bit in the middle but it picks up again and has the perfect ending. If you haven't read it, read it now.

This is the &quot;darkest&quot; American novel I know of, which is probably one of the reasons that induced Hemingway to say that American literature begins and ends here. Like Conrad's Marlowe, Huck is journeying &quot;upriver&quot; into a region of the human psyche best left unobserved by any but the most stalwart of heart. His eyes are opened on the voyage. His ultimate character is shaped by what he experiences. His is a passage from naivete to wide-opened observer.What begins as an idyllic raft trip turns more and more turbulent the closer to Illinois he gets. What begins as a Tom Sawyer lark becomes more and more Faulknerian. Yes,it is a voyage from inexperience to experience. Yes, it is a quest story. Yes, it is a novel about man's inhumanity to man, etc. etc. But there is so much more at work here..Twain shared much in common with Swift. We are looking primarily at the underbelly of humanity here, not its bright spots. The ending, as pointed out by numerous critics,is problematical. Exactly what is Huck's position vis-a-vis Jim? Has all that has occured previously been given up in the moment he is counseled by Tom? Is Huck so ready to overthrow his hard-fought allegiance in order to conform to society's dictums? Twain offers no clear resolution, but this should not keep this novel from being taught in high school or college classrooms, when students are given the liberty to consrtuct their own conclusions.Personally, I believe what Twain is telling us is that we can never exhibit our true natures in society without risking being stoned to death. Conventional pressures have not really changed that much from Twain's day to the present. Just by espousing my support for this novel I am opening myself up to criticism aimed my way from the righteously correct. American society hasn't changed all that much. Religious piety and indignation has been supplanted by political correctness. Harriet Beacher Stowe, bless her, is alive and well. There are people out there convinced that Uncle Tom's Cabin is a more significant work than Huck Finn. What would Vonnegut say here?"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"For such a simple story, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn often proves to be elusive for its readers. Here are some guideposts to look out for:This story is told by Huck, and is not in the classic shape of a novel. Rather it is a precursor to Ulysses and Remembrance of Things Past, where other great writers attempted to capture the essence of our internal dialogue.Huck is also hiding a lot from himself. You as the reader can quickly see through him, though. He is trying to put a brave and positive face on a very dangerous situation. We all do that.Huck also has to face himself before the book ends. What really is important? We can all spout a lot of moral talk, but what we do is critical.If we lived in Huck's times, we would also see that there was an emormous moral dilemma. The rules of humanity were often not applied to black people. You could choose to go along and feel like a hypocrite (if you thought about what you were doing), or you could do the right thing. Sensitive people of that day often found it hard to do the right thing. If your neighbors were open-minded and you lived in the North, you might do one thing. If your neighbors were slaveholderes and lived in the South, you might do another.Also, think about the trip down the river as an analogy for going through life.

It's as though - having written a brilliant, sometimes-humorous, often-tragic commentary on life - he felt the need to dumb-it-down at the end."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This book arrived in perfect condition and on time.

The labeling issue was just a bit troubling."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Huckleberry Finn is one of those classic books that you just can't put down. It is a very good book that is suspenseful and really draws you in. It starts off with Huck imprisoned in civilization surrounded with good manners and sophistication. Daily he goofs off with his pals Tom Sawyer and others, imagining up scenarios where there is plenty of action and fun to be had. When his father returns, Huck has to stay with him but soon escapes, faking his own death and running away to a local island to live on his own. There, he meets Jim, Miss Watson's slave who he thought was going to sell him, so he ran off. Soon after, Huck and Jim start traveling down the river as many men were out looking for Jim. They travel only on nights, surviving on fish that they catch and other vegetables that they manage to scavenge. Unfortunatly, they run into two men, duke and king as they are known, who both claim to be royalty. They end up being a nuisance, as they demand everything be done for them. Soon afterward, they arrive at a small town where a respected man has just died. Everything in his will is pledged to his two brothers, who have not arrived. Duke and King pose as the real brothers, as they are hoping to rob the family of their money. When the real brothers arrive, Huck and Jim try to evade the con men, but as they make their escape they are caught by Duke and King. They travel futher down the river, and stop at yet another town, to resupply and hopfully make some money. When Huck, Duke, and King return to the raft, they find Jim missing, apparently captured as a runaway slave. Huck goes off to try to recapture Jim, and he poses as Tom Sawyer when he stays at Tom's Aunt Polly's house. Coincidentally, Tom arrives, and joins the cause to save Jim. Tom, as he has to throw some finesse into the escape plan, makes it much longer than it intended to be, even thought it would have been quite easy to escape in the first place. after weeks, The boys and Jim make their escape, but a few days after, Jim is captured in a town a few miles below the escape point. As Jim faces death, Tom steps in and says that Jim was already free, and that Miss Watson had freed him in her will, as she had died a week or so earlier. With Jim free, Tom returns to his original town and Huck get adopted to be civilized by Tom's Aunt Polly."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"It was sucha great read totally worth it. the books quality was outstanding it was brand new and not even a scratch on it! the shipping was very quick. thank you"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"it&#34;s a great read. makes me wish i had lived in a time when life was so easy and carefree."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I enjoyed reading this book again with my son.

The only reason I wouldn't rate this particular book a five star is because it's not exactly the one I was looking for. I've been reading this book in school, and the one we used in school was slightly more durable looking, and included definitions of some confusing parts in the book. This book didn't have those footnotes, and in fact it also didn't have chapter titles, so it may get a little confusing for you to navigate.But other than that, it was perfect.

I came into this book thinking that it was going to be to long and that I would not have time in my busy life to finish it. I began it on a plane ride home and I was enchanted by it. I never thought a book could take a hold of my imagination and heart the way this one did. Huck Finn was a simple young child who had more heart and common sense that I could ever imagine. I was intrigued by the mature relationship that he was able to take up with Jim and how he looked up to Jim as a mentor even though he was brought up to know that Jim was only property and a slave. The dialect that was used made it even more real for me; Mark Twain put me right in with Huck and Jim as though I was floating down that river on the same raft as them. I loved to watch Huck mature as the trip went on, he seemed to understand more and more that his lies could hurt people and some could help. The only part about this book that disappointed me in the slightest bit was when he ended up at Tom Sawyer's aunt's house. It made me feel as though the whole novel was just going around in circles and I secretly in my heart I wished that Huck and Jim would never go back and get away from society and live the carefree life of drifting down the river forever, although I know that this could not happen. All in all this was a perfect book and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This timeless classic by Mark Twain should be a must read for everyone.

You have to have a balance control on your tape player, or no dice. I don't have a balance control, so I had to unplug first the left and then the right speaker to listen to this. That's the only way they could get the entire novel onto four tapes! Mr. Hill reads a lot slower than I do, for effect I guess, so we won't listen to this much. Maybe just when I am sick of reading aloud! But it is nice to have so when I need a substitute, he or she can just pop the tape in and not have to worry about covering the reading for that day."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Don't listen to the naysayers. This is a truly great piece of literature. On the surface, it's a great adventure story in the tradition of &quot;The Odyssey&quot;. But there are deeper issues to be tackled, issues that still can provoke lively discussion more than 100 years after the book was written. In my opinion, the central theme to the story is Huck's development of a moral code. Huck's sense of right and wrong is forged in the furnace of experience and the need for survival. The reader is put in the position of rooting for Huck to escape his abusive father even if it necessitates the use of deception, making people believe that he, Huck, had been killed. In the journey down the Mississippi with escaped slave Jim, Huck survives by use of his wits, pretending to be someone he's not (his attempt to pass himself off as a girl fails miserably), and encountering various interesting characters. For awhile, he stays with a very respectable, upright family who has one problem: they are in a feud with another family, which results in a tragic ending for all concerned. (As a sidenote, I read that section of the book the morning of September 11, before turning on the TV only to be horrified by the events of that day when America and freedom itself was so violently attacked. Why must the world continue partaking of the bitter fruit of violence?) The comic pair of &quot;royal&quot; con men who become traveling companions with Huck and Jim scheme to dupe the unwitting out of money as they travel from town to town, until Huck helps to foil their biggest scheme. Huck's moral code is continually shaped by the extent by which he values people as friends and worthy individuals. Once Jim is recaptured, Huck has to make a decision which becomes the central moral dilemma of the book: should Huck return Jim to Miss Watson, from whom he escaped, because now Huck is having severe misgivings about helping take someone else's &quot;property&quot;, or should he help Jim escape because Jim has become a friend to him? Interestingly, Huck does not debate, in his own mind, the morality or immorality of the slave trade in and of itself, but be makes his decision based on Jim's friendship, which Huck thinks is the wrong decision based on what he was taught. But, of course, Huck basically follows his heart.At this point, the book bogs down a little. There is a contrived situation where Huck reunites with Tom Sawyer, and what should have been a fairly easy escape for Jim is complicated needlessly by Tom's romantic ideals gained by his reading of adventure books. Even though I found this part of the novel frustrating to read, it does point to the difference between Huck's pragmatism and Tom's romanticism. Huck gives in to Tom too easily on this point, and the whole escape plan almost blows up in their faces. Don't allow the rather weak ending (or the liberal use of the n-word) to deter you from reading perhaps the paramount achievement in American literature. Enjoy it for the rousing adventure it is, and think about the deeper moral questions raised by this book. If any novel deserves the label &quot;classic&quot;, it's &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"dventures of Huckleberry Finn By Mark Twain 352 PagesThis book was very well-writen. It is about a boy named Huckleberry Finn (Huck for short), who runs away with his slave named Jim, who doesn't speak English very well. They run into a lot of trouble along the way which makes the book very exciting and suspenseful. Like one time they run into a bunch of pirates. That part kept me turning the pages.

It's way better than the movie, like most books are. Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry do things that would give your life such a rush. The adventures they go through and the trouble they get into is just great. Children these days can't do some of the stuff they do without being gounded for life or send to a military camp, but on thing they can do is use there imagination like Tom and Huck do in this book. This is a really good book to read and it feels like your part of the book, which is a cool feeling. This is one of my all time favorite books. I read it once already but I just want to open it and start reading it again. Mark Twain, AKA Samuel Clemens, had a taste for adventure now it's your to taste it. There are many moods to go thrugh in this book happy, sad, angry and etc. Just got to read it. There is excitement around ever corner.Uproariously funny, Tom and Huck even run away awhile, to show you how hard it is to live on your own if your a kid to see how hard it is to support yourself on you own.

I see why it was banned, since the N-word was used so frequently, but considering the time and place that the story takes place, no one with any kind of common sense should be upset because of it. The book tells the story of Huckleberry Finn, and young boy and the adventures he has when he is travelling down the Mississippi River with a runaway slave, Jim. The book is a serial of the troubles and the good times that Huck and Jim have on their adventures. And what adventures they are too. From Huck escaping his father to the last adventure with Jim.

Twain in his characteristic satiric fashion constructs an avator for freedom in Huckleberry Finn, and a comment on American society in the 1800s through his beautiful idiomatic prose. As Huck winds down the meandering Mississippi, the reader is wisked away on a page-turning sojourn like no other. However, most readers will make this book more than a sojourn; this book will become a torn and tattered escape that barely rests on their bookshelves before going on another journey with another mind. A 10 out of 10, which symbolizes the beauty of literature, and the real reason why reading a book will exist long after computers become a trite household appliance- this book is transportable and 2 1/2 inches of sure beauty.

Although this book has many racial slurs it should not be under contriversy because of its use of the &quot;N&quot; word. The story takes place when the &quot;N&quot; word was used frequently. In a way it shows the positive relations between two people of different races. Huck Finn the main character of the novel uses this ofensive slur just because he was brought up that way, he doesn't know any better. Within the novel this teenage misfit gets himself in tons of trouble. This is where the comedy comes into play. Every time Huck ends up in trouble he manages to think of some clever excuse. Like when the two slave hunters ran into Huck and Jim(the runaway slave)on the river. Huck said &quot;Oh ya my father has small pocks, you can see him if you realy want to.&quot; Of course the slave hunters wanted to stay as far away from the two because the don't want to get small pocks. Mark Twain not only writes truthfully about this time period but he also critizes the human race for being ignerent and stupid. Throughout this incredible book Twain makes suddle comments about the human race just to poke fun at us. There was a two year break while he was writing this book because he was unsure of what he was doing. This was written in a time period when blacks were looked down upon as if the were not as inteligent as the whites were and Twain is having a black man and white boy out smart several white men. Twain thought that his novel would be laughed at if he continued this unheard of stoiy line. He was in such a twisted mental state he took off thoes two years to think about what he was even writing about, then continued Huck on his journy.

They would both run into different people in different situations, which were sometimes good and sometimes bad. Both of them encountered many different adventures together.

It had been some 35-40 years since I had read the work myself, and so I relished the opportunity to read it again with my daughter.For those who have just arrived from another planet, HUCK FINN is 19th-century humor writer Mark Twain's episodic adventure tale about a good-hearted young rustic named Huckleberry Finn, who boldly and ingeniously escapes the abusive treatment of his father and sets off on a raft down the Mississippi River. Almost immediately, he is joined by a runaway slave of his previous acquaintance named Jim. The greater part of this lengthy novel consists of the various adventures they experience on the River, including an encounter with thieves aboard a sinking steamship, an escape from a bloody family feud, and, most prominently, various scrapes in the company of a couple of ne'er-do-wells who wish to be treated by Jim and Huck as the Duke of Bridgewater and the King of England. The novel is written as a sequel of sorts to THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER, but can be read independently of it.Two things stood out for me in reading HUCK FINN aloud; with respect to the language, the racial epithets and Twain's masterful attention to dialect. Let me start with the second: reading this story aloud really helps one appreciate the dialects that Mark Twain captures in the novel. Certainly, Jim's dialect is different from Huck's, but with careful attention to the language one will also notice the distinctive dialects of the other prominent characters such as the Duke and King. The first thing that stood out for me is how uncomfortable I was reading a literary work--even a classic such as this one--that liberally uses the \\"N\\" word and heaps other abuse on African Americans.This is one reason the book is banned by many libraries. In reading HUCK FINN with my daughter, however, I found that the story could be both a literary experience and a teaching tool. We could and did discuss the terrible power of words to hurt people, as well as the treatment of slaves in 19th-century America. Also, over the course of the novel, Huck Finn comes to see the humanity in Jim and sees him as a friend. Still, the novel doesn't entirely justify itself on those grounds, particularly after the humiliating treatment Jim experiences in the final chapters. Moreover, one might argue that, at least in parts of the story, Jim comes off as a racial caricature.Thus the novel does pose a challenge to the reflective and concerned parent. HUCK FINN is no doubt a masterpiece of fiction. It is, moreover, a humorous and sometimes moving adventure story (albeit one that moves at a deliberate pace compared to 21st-century YA fiction). Nonetheless, with respect to the racism that is pervasive in the novel, in reading this story to children one should be prepared to talk about its underlying social problems in the light of American history and contemporary mores.My daughter and I read this edition (Puffin Classics). It is a conveniently sized book that does not stint on font size to create a small format paperback. It would not be the edition I would choose permanently to grace one's library, but it is an excellent choice for children."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Do you need some Orwellian Big Brother to 'edit' a classic book for you? Do you want someone else to decide what you should or shouldn't read? Are you incapable of seeing a word used in a century-old context without throwing a fit over it?If yes, then this is the censored book for you.If NO, then keep browsing for an UNEDITED, UNABRIDGED version -- and leave this piece of dreck to rot.Why?First, consider the attribution that appears in this book's search result listing: \\"Mark Twain 'AND Sarah Matthews.'\\" Why is there a second name on a classic book that everyone knows had only one author? Why, because the second person is an ~Editor~ -- a self-appointed Judge of Words, a modern-day INQUISITOR who has removed parts of the original work because THEY decided that you, the Reader, don't need to see them.What parts of the original did this Inquisitor decide you don't need to see? Well to begin with, every last use of the word N-gg-r -- you know, because somebody might wet their diapers if they see that word in print in a book that's more than century old, despite the fact that black people all over this country use the same word every single day even NOW.But then, just for good measure, the Inquisitor also removed whole sentences and sections that didn't have anything at all to do with 'the N-word' -- but which might have stirred up thoughts in you that the Inquisitor doesn't want you thinking.The result is a butchered and mangled parody of the original: a pathetic, PC-sanitized piece of crap. Everyone involved in the production of this edition should be ashamed -- indeed, they should be barred from working in the Publishing industry ever again -- and anyone who rewards their censorship by buying this edition is contributing to the decline of Freedom and Free Speech in America."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It was assigned for my American Lit class this semester. The book is told in the voice of Huck Finn, the son of the town drunk. Huck starts the novel living with the widow Douglas, who wants to \\"sivilize\\" him. He won't put up with that, however, and starts on a series down the Mississippi river in which he befriends a runaway slave named Jim. I will refrain from giving any more thoughts on the book, because although I'm sure most people know the story, I don't want to ruin it for anyone."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"In Twain's most prized novel, he reveals the problems in a judgmental, racist society and shows the need for reform. He argues for an end to such acts throughout the novel with Huck's union with the runaway slave and his ultimate decision to leave such a tainted world for more free ground.Throughout Huck's travels, he struggles with the decision of whether or not he should stay loyal to his most precious and dedicated friend or turn him in just because he is a runaway slave, revealing the problems with judging people based on their skin color alone. In the beginning of the book, before Huck runs away to be alone, he would talk to Jim, Miss Watson's slave and property, on occasion, playing tricks on him with the help of his friends. But once he is able to escape society and discover the runaway Jim along his path, he decides to protect him and they band together in their journey. Although Huck repeatedly refers to him as \\"my Jim,\\" he sees him as more than property but more in the sense of him being his friend. It is only when Huck is able to abandon all the \\"ideals\\" that society had taught him that he accepts Jim as his friend, not at all associated with any means of property. He decides this one night, even willing to go to \\"hell\\" for his actions, showing how he achieves Twain's goal of ending the extensive judgment in society based on a man's outward appearances.As Huck learns more related lessons, he notices many problems that society has and decides that he does not want any part in such actions, abandoning those who do not share his views and becoming the full embodiment of Twain's wishes. Once Huck has decided that he will not dispose of Jim and return him to the hands of his owner he decides that he must break Jim out of \\"jail.\\" He finds himself once more reunited with Tom and shares his goals, amazed at the fact they Tom is willing to free a runaway slave. He thinks that Tom has changed to share his views, but is once again let down by those who were once close to him. It turns out that Tom only agrees to do this after he learns that Jim is already free. He would not have agreed to help Huck otherwise because he still believes in the fact that slaves are property. When Huck discovers this and Jim is set free as he should always have been, he no longer wishes to live in a place where people are considered property and others do not keep their promises or base their acts on faulty premises. He then decides to leave for the Indian territories--a place where he can act as he knows is right and how things in the world should be."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I first read this book (unabridged) when I was in grade school, and it is still one of my favorites. I was fortunate to discover it on my parents' bookshelf long before it ever occurred to my teachers to assign it to me.In this masterpiece of the road trip, we meet a bumptious, self-confident, self-absorbed young America in person as Huck and Jim hitchhike along its first great highway: the Mississippi River of sternwheelers, flatboats, keelboats, canoes and crude rafts. We see the vast river and its people (with all their warts, quirks and odd ideas) through the eyes of a young white runaway orphan (Huck) and his much-wiser-than-he-lets-on black companion (Jim). This is the same Mississippi River highway that Abraham Lincoln saw as a young man, when he worked on the crew of a flatboat that delivered goods from the Ohio River Valley to the seaport in New Orleans.If you can forget that it's an assignment to read, notice that each of Twain's colorful characters has his or her own authentic way of damaging the English language (dialect), and let yourself go with the flow, I think you will find this to be a wonderful story with many delightful surprises.The journalist Mark Twain's &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; is to America before the Civil War as the impoverished cavalier Miguel Cervantes' &quot;Don Quijote de La Mancha&quot; is to the underside of imperial Spain at the time of the Spanish Armada. In both books we see a rough-hewn society in the midst of rapid cultural change through the eyes of a pair of puzzled innocents. To a first approximation, Huck Finn is Don Quixote, and Jim is Sancho Panza."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The temptation to teach Huck to high school students must be taken seriously. No matter the racial makeup of the class, the \\"N\\" word has to be defused before reading begins. We can explain and discuss and meltdown some of the ascerbity of the word, but unless the issue is fully resolved, the 200-plus appearances of such a slander will eventually work us back to tender. Background reading on Twain is a must. His short story, \\"Disgraceful Persecution of a Boy,\\" about a boy returning from Sunday School who stops to stone a Chinaman (in San Francisco) makes a pointed comment about the \\"teaching\\" of prejudice. This story makes good pre-reading since a reference with a similar point is made in \\"Huck Finn.\\" When a river boat has an accident, a riverside discussion goes: \\"Was anybody hurt?\\" \\"Nope. Killed a N- though.\\" This bit of dialog slipped in and overheard is painfully offensive and yet such a perfect contrast to Huck's feelings and the \\"teaching\\" he has received, both from the Widow Douglas and from life itself. Jim, of course, is the subject of Huck's racial feelings. Throughout the story, Jim is a father, brother and friend to Huck, but never a servant. He is everything, a good man tormented with love for his lost family and Huck, yet in his world, he is literally bound (by chains and threats) and so cannot come close to the dignity of African Americans of today. Huck and Jim's world requires that we board a mental time-machine and accept both the life on the raft and the values on shore as they were then, not now. Teach the book with joy after preparing with compassion."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Plain and simple, this is a book that you have to read again and again and again just for good measure. One cannot possibly appreciate modern American literature as it exists today without reading Huck Finn. Twain's style is one-of-a-kind, and his keen sense of politics and history is one that rarely exists in modern times. Get past the racial implications of this book and look at what Twain is -saying-. Huck Finn is a character who is a rogue, a modern scoundrel; however, we trust his moral judgement and are able to look inside another time and place through his journey with Jim up the Mississippi. So get out your maps and notebook and enjoy Twain at his finest."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I'm intrigued to read how many modern readers have objected to the &quot;wordiness&quot; of this nineteenth-century masterpiece in their reviews here. By modern standards, it may well be rather long-winded. Or it could just be that we have a harder time understanding the words and phrases Twain uses, which evoke images less familiar to us than they were to his original audience.What intrigues me about this is that Mark Twain himself levelled this same charge of wordiness against James Fenimore Cooper's &quot;Leatherstocking Tales&quot;, which were written in the early 1800s. In a famous essay, Twain picked apart Cooper's description of a woodsman making camp, line by line. Each word, each phrase, each sentence was evaluated for its value in setting the scene, and far more than half of each were discarded. At the end, Twain gave his readers his own--much shorter--rendition of the passage, then congratulated himself on having improved it greatly by shortening it.Languages and usage change over time. By John Milton's standards of the mid-1600s, Cooper's sentences and descriptions might well have seemed terse and choppy. By Mark Twain's time, the same sentences sounded long-winded. Today--80 years after Ernest Hemingway taught us to expect our vivid descriptions in telegraphic prose--even Twain can sound wordy, reading Cooper can be an enormous struggle, and few beyond English majors learn to appreciate Milton's &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; as a complete work.But we can learn a great deal about ourselves and our own times by reading popular writers from our ancestors' times. First, it teaches us tolerance, as we see that &quot;the past is a different country: they do things differently there.&quot; Second, it warns us that our own ideas, speech patterns and writing styles may also seem quaint, antiquated, ungrammatical--even boring--to our grandchildren. Learning to expect this can help us avoid taking ourselves and our times quite so seriously.Life goes on, and so does the language."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I read some of the other reviews and understand that some people had an issue with the candid way in which Mark Twain dealt with the race issues.

I loved the book when I read it as a child, and enjoyed reading it again.

I started reading this book at elementary school age and never stopped. One continues to absorb so many different things from it - as a child and as an adult - as if it is a different book every time you read it, and all these things are valuable in their own way.

However the edition I received, which was printed by Oxford World Classics, was missing pages 123-154. Luckily, I could go on line and actually read those pages (chapters 21 through 25) but that did not make up for the hole in the book that is now part of my library. Very disappointing! This is a classic I had hoped to pass on to the younger members of my family.I rated this edition 2 stars (rather than 1 star) because it did include Twain's \\"The Raftsmen's Passage\\" in an appendix as a bonus."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"You'll notice pretty quickly when you pick this up that Huck doesn't spell too good and his grammar isn't so hot either. But if you look a little more closely, you find that he sure knows how to use the semi-colon, and his sentence structure is picture perfect. Mr. Twain may have decided that he was going to have some fun with his charming narrator, but he sure wasn't going to sacrifice good writing to do so.The novel, as everyone knows, is a masterpiece, and works splendidly on every level. Plot, character development, theme; everything is here. Anybody reading this review has probably read the book several times and moreover has probably read about it a dozen more so it's pretty certain that my little review is not going to add much. I would, however, like to comment on something which struck me while reading it most recently, which is how richly it evokes middle America of the mid-nineteenth century. In other words, as well as being literature of the first rank, Huckleberry Finn also functions as a thorough and fascinating historical document of a time and place that every year sinks deeper and deeper into our collective memory.Here he is describing Uncle Silas' place in Arkansas upon seeing it for the first time. \\"It was one of these one-horse cotton plantations and they all look alike. A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile made out of logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a different length, to climb over the fence with . . . some sickly grass-patches in the big yard, but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat with the nap rubbed off; big double log house for the white folks--hewed logs with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud stripes been white-washed some time or another; round log-kitchen, with a big, broad open but roofed passage joining it to the house . . . hound asleep there in the sun; more hounds asleep round about . . . outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch; then the cottonfields begins, and after the fields the woods.\\"The first thing that strikes you about this is how . . . impoverished this all is, especially compared to how we live today. And this is a cotton-field owner with a number of slaves! But this was the south: rural, poor, hot, languid. Oh, yes, we are all familiar with the palatial southern mansion from novels like Gone With the Wind; I suspect that most of the South in the 1840s was closer to Huck's description than to Margaret Mitchell's.Here's Huck's description of the town in which the King and Duke put on their first show: \\"The stores and houses was most all old, shackly, dried-up frame concerns that hadn't ever been painted; they was set up three or four feet above ground on stilts, so as to be out of reach of the water when the river was overflowed. The houses had little gardens around them, but they didn't seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpson-weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piles, and old curled up boots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out tinware . . . There was generly hogs in the garden, and people driving them out.\\" Charming, eh? Of course, we in our modern twenty-first century aren't immune to such slovenliness. Sometimes, historical descriptions remind us that things don't change much.Along with his brilliant observations of humanity and the human habitat the novel also contains breathtaking descriptions of nature, especially the Mississippi River. There's heavy timber on the Missouri side, mountains on the Illinois side, the lights of St. Louis: \\"We run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up--nearly always in the dead water under a towhead . . . Next we slid into the water and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool off; then we sat down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee-deep, and watched the daylight come. Not a sound anywhere--perfectly still--just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs a cluttering, maybe. The first thing you see, looking away over the water, was a kind of dull line--and that was the woods on t'other side.\\" How wonderfully evocative this is; how it makes one ache to experience such things!Again, the novel is so much more than this. I'm not going to bother with the theme and the plot and the characters--what else is there to say?--but I can not finish this without giving an example or two of the wonderful humor contained in here. Here's the charming Huck after sneaking into the circus under the tent: \\"I ain't opposed to spending money on circuses when there ain't no other way, but there ain't no use in wasting it on them.\\" And when the King and the Duke run on hard times: \\"First they done a lecture on temperance, but they didn't make enough for them both to get drunk on. Then, in another village, they started a dancing-school; but they didn't know no more than how to dance than a kangaroo does, so the first prance they made the general public pranced in and pranced them out of town . . . \\"Oh, how rich this is. Rich and funny and lovely and hilarious. Read it for the pure entertainment contained in here, if nothing else."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The most charming element of Mark Twain's writings is that he masques his utter disdain at the defects and foibles of society under a superficial layer of humour. Indeed the simmering screen of wit and hilarisity so readily associated with this great 19th.century American novelist lends an air of deceit to his work. Now,humour and comic satire have always been great writers' subtle instruments to deflate the ever-expanding balloon of society's corrupt lifestyle and the gift of employing boisterous means to mirror moral decay is firmly exploited by Mark Twain in his remarkable novel \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\",arguably the best work of the author.For those who haven't read Twain's previous book \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\",a meeting with Huckleberry Finn for the first time would prove both awkward and interesting. Huck Finn,as we know from his plethora of adventures with Tom Sawyer in the aforementioned book,is a mischievous urchin always in the uttermost fear from his drunken,never to do well father. At the end of this book,we discern Huck Finn to be fed up with being,or rather trying to be,a decent,well-furnisheeeed lad and even runs away from his adopted mother-of-sorts Old Widow Douglas only to be brought back by Tom Huck takes up the funny and great tale of boyish mischiefs from there and himself accounts in his very own American dialect in a conversational tone that imbibes the readr's interest and takes him through his various adventures,misadventures,joy,agony and an innocent and gradual maturation.Huck is saturated with putting on a fresh and fair appearance and longs to escape the realm of Old Widow Douglas,Miss Watson and others propagating 'civilization' and returns to his old familiar,accuatomed ways of 'uncivilized' living. His drunken father's whim to take him back with him and his fortunes enentually proves to be a blessing in disguise as he escapes from his perpetually inebrited and cruel father only to meet with another fugitive in the shape of Jim,a \\"nigger\\" and and slave of Miss Watson. Jackson Island proves too insecure an abode to sustain life with the whole of St.Petersburg hot on their heels and so Huck and jim make a raft and flow along the Mississippi river and what \\"a raft of trouble\\" their floating journey would turn out to be.The eponymous protagonist of the novel and the frightenrd slave encounters numerous characters on their journey. Huck Finn undergoes changes in his perceptual capabilities as he decodes the latent meanings in ordinary and seemingly harmless folks' intensions. Most notably Huck and Jim meet two men,old in years but youngat deceit,and enforcrd by trying circumstances to accept them in their journey,are subjected to myriad critical moments,which when congregated,direct at the moral corruption of people. Huck and Jim have to harmonise reluctantly with these two characters in their success in fooling a whole village and then in attempting rob an innocent family of its money. Huck learns to refine the good from the evil and foolowing the echo of a pure conscience saves many a misfortune from crashing upon a number of innocents. Huck and Jim are finally successfully in absconding these two men but land up in Uncle Silas Plhep's place,two miles below Pikesville,and then the inevitable takes place. Huck is kept back under the care of Aunt Sally,Uncle Silas's wife.\\"The Adventures of Hucleberry Finn\\" reflects a typical Mark Twain---witty,hilarisity and sarcastic. This book goes much deeper and is more intense in the sense of exposing the debaucheryand sheer foolishness that society favours to live in. What the American great sketched in \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\", he finishes addind the final touches in this novel---the abject custom of slave-trade and racism. The easy and nonchalent manner in which the poor villagers are taken in by the two \\"Royal Nonesuch rapscallions\\" mirror the intellectual bankruptcy of humans in a smaller landscape. Hollow laws are mocked at and individual pecularity ridiculed. But Twain doesn't make this essentially boys' book a dark,exhaustive social novel and riddled with with comedy and fun,this novel is then added by a hint of romanticism when the representative of all boys Tom Sawyer arrives onto the scene and both enthralls and pleases te audience the audience with the implementation on his notion of heroism and style.The plethora of dialects used in the book do make it difficult for the reader to properly absorb their meanings but with the passage of time,he gets to comprehend them and finds them somewhat funny. The word \\"nigger\\" too is an utterly controversial one as scattered through the pages actually divert the major essence of the book. And Jim's marvellous escape from the jaws of death after being bitten by a rattlesnake becomes a trifle too romantic. Is it really possible to survive a rattlesnake bite that easily?Even after taking the flaws into consideration,one must ackowledge its conguency to the life of a boy undermined by a boozed father,uncompromising circumstances and bitter society. Huck finn is the eternal effigy of a street-urchin captivated within the narrow scope of civilization and in his urge to free himself from the shackles of civil codes,this \\"poor devil\\" confronts the harh realities of life and through his innocent,pure perception,learns more about the world and the umpteen dark aspects of it. His explicit desire to return to his old days of uncivilized manners is never realised as escaping from Widow Douglas,he falls into the grasp of Aunt Sally. Indeed the book ends in the rstoration of all pieces of the jigsaw puzzle and pehaps this fairy-tale gratification is a vital part of life that propels us to carry on with our own adventures."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"As a high school teacher, a question we always face when teaching the classics is... will my students think this boring, irrelevant, and inscrutable? While many of my students struggled through Hawthorne, Emerson, and Thoreau, Mark Twain's Huck Finn caught their interest more deeply.What makes this classic appealing to high school students is its taboo character, its humor, and its characters. The novel is a taboo; knowing that the book has been banned in places all across the nation rouses students (\\"oooo... they say we can't read it? I'm in!\\"). With heated issues like the use of the n-word, smoking and stealing, students are in. Further, the novel is genuinely funny, even to teenagers. Huck is honest to the bone-his observations about conventions are amusing. And the messes he gets into with Jim (among other things, dressing up like women) are hilarious. Finally, the characters are genuinely likeable-students can relate to Huck's restlessness and mistrust of authority, and can despise the rigidity of the Widow.There are many particularities about Huck that students will love. For one, he smokes and questions traditional things like prayer and Christianity. He hates school and doesn't see the point of wearing nice clothes. He sneaks out late at night. There is one scene that students will particularly find amusing. Huck has run away from the widow and ventured into town incognito to find out what people are saying about him. The thing is, he is dressed like a girl. It is hilarious to read the descriptions of this lanky boy attempting to play the part of a sweet modest girl. The students read with interest and enjoy making fun of Huck here. They appreciate his wild side.There are a few precautions in teaching this book to high school students. There are passages that border on racism-not only the use of the n-word, but many a passage that underscore stereotypes about blacks. These are indeed a reflection of the time and do not invalidate the book, but they must be approached with high school students conscientiously and explicitly. Also, the dialect in the book is hard and frustrating for many of the students."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain contained many different morales.It help encouraged me to continue to listen to my heart.

I hate people who discredit it by saying its a racist book, by no means was it racist besides the use of the N word alot ( but that was how the southeners talked at that time ). the story many centers on how huck is struggling to help free a slave named Jim who is running away for freedom, and throughout it huck realizes its the right thing to do, even if it means going to hell for it ( so hence the quote above ). and its not only about slavery and racism, it also deals with child abuse, deceitful robbers pretending to be preachers fortune tellers and people like that, the horrors and stupidity of feuds, and also tries to tie in some light hearted good old fashion Tom and Huck type humor to keep hope alive for the characters in the book. Overall this book is basically about the horrors of human hatred and how its wrong, its supposed to be a eye opener to people to change their ways and see the truth of the matters such as racism for what they are. not at all racist, deserves way more than 5 stars, and one of the best classic books ever. A MUST HAVE"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I am not sure whether you know this or not (or even care) but reading books that seem too rooted in reality is a bit unbearable for me. It is like calling the sand man and allowing him to sprinkle his little magic on me in broad daylight. Unlike previous reviewers, I do not care for the racist slurs or \\"problems\\" as you can call it because I think it is ridiculous to dwell on something that happened nearly a hundred years ago when such words were acceptable. Mark Twain even said and I quote:\\" There are many humorous things in the world; among them is the white man's notion that he is less savage than all the other savages.\\" So, instead of coming to the conclusion that this is a racist book, maybe some people should read up on the author to find out whether all of it is a myth or plan truth.Unfortunately, I thought that the book was a little dry and got pretty boring some where in the middle. Without a doubt I think that Mark Twain is an excellent writer, but since this book was written a very long time ago and some of the dialect is pretty hard to understand, I find it pretty impossible to understand everything that is going on without having background knowledge of basic American History (but that is just my opinion).

As an interacal teenager I had a very hard time understanding and reading the book because the 'N'word is used SO frequently in the book. Am I the only one who finds it offensive? Just because HF is consider an American Classic does it change the meaning of the 'N' word. To me it doesn't make sense! I'm not agruing that it isn't a good book. It has its good parts. It doesn't make sense that because its an &quot;American Classic&quot; its O.K for students to say the 'N'word aloud because it a &quot;Classic&quot;, but in any other situations it IS racism. A &quot;Classic&quot; should not be an excuse to state offensive words! What kind of influence is this having on people (especially TEENAGERS!)? We as a nation already have a huge problem with prejudes and racism! Why is racism or offencive words O.K to say aloud, as long as its a &quot;Classic&quot;?

I'm sure it'll be great!&quot; Boy, was I wrong! Historically speaking, the book was accurate with its use of racial slurs, societal views, etc. Twain's colorful use of dialect was interesting, albeit difficult to sift through at times. Also, Twain's vivid descriptions absorbed me into the book and made my feel as if I were sitting next to Huck and Jim on their raft. However, those factors definitely did not make up for the boredom experienced as I read the book. The characters were bland and unappealing, the plot was absurd and dull, and the hefty symbolism was annoying.Sure, &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; is a literary classic.

Huck is not a perfect character and all his flaws seem to be over looked. Jim is merely in the story because he needs to be and although he is not a brilliant person mark twain has not given the slave fair credit by making an unschooled boy half his age seem twice as smart.

I didn't get past the 12th chapter before I had to buy the Cliffs Notes (I've *never* done that before). Just thinking about the book makes me sick.

At the time of reading this book I had a student teacher, which only made the experience worse. The ONLY thing we ever discussed in class was literary symbolism. I mean, we spent 30 minutes talking about a bowl of fruit!!!! (what did Twain mean by spending so much time describing the fruit? what does the fruit symbolize?

However, I hadn't read much of it before I realized that it was going to be something to suffer through, not enjoy.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was an extremely plotless, racist book relating the adventures of the rather tedious, annoying character of Huck Finn. Huck had recently left his hometown and went rafting down the MIssissippi with a slave, Jim. Huck is forever lying to and leaving Jim, in a fashion that made me wonder if he had ADD. The end of the novel, which had potential to make it better, made me hurl the book across the room, in a way certian to make any librarian weep.I also found the dialects that Clemmins used extremely annoying. I had to sound out the words to myself to see what he was trying to relate.If you want to read a book, any book, pick something, anything, else. Trust me on this one."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Or maybe -5. This book should have never saw print, much less read and loved by generations of Anerican readers. That goes to show how stupid Americans can be. Nor should it be regarded as the novel that inspired all other American novels. Nor should anybody be impressed by the seven or eight dialects employed within the novel's structure, which the fool author made up to fool us into believing people actually talked like that. The story is a couple of people floating down a river, with a number of utterly unsuccessful scenes meant to enhance and define a theme so obvious its not even worth mentioning. Then there is the structure of scenes themselves. Each uniformly the same in length and what occurs except the last where in the scene drags on and on and on and on. Then to top it all off at the end Hucleberry Fin regresses. This is worthless. Anybody who likes this novel is stupid. They have no linguistic intelligence or even logical intelligence. And yes you all should read Dean Koontz who is a better writer than Samuel Clemens ever dreamed of being. He will be our Shakespeare, never Mark Twain.

I just felt that was a little ironic. As far as the story goes, Twain did a good job of crafting a well written, well researched novel, but it was missing key elements that kept it from being great. The first part of the book up to the steamboat randomly crashing into the raft was pretty good. The characters were beginning to develop nicely and we started to understand why this book was being written, as in an allegorical sense. Of course, why didn't Jim skip and a jump to Illinois from Jackson island to get his freedom, for one Twain couldn't write about the river he was attached to. After the raft everything seems rushed and doesn't fit together very well. It begins to look more like a bad night for Homer as he is reciting the Odyssey instead of an American classic. The ending with Jim in captivity and Tom acting out things is probably one of the worst endings this book could have had. Overall it was a good book, but I don't feel like it captivated me like a real classic should."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"What I liked most about this book was the sense of nostalgia it induced. The events Huck experiences may be dramatized for entertainment value, but they highlight the real sort of internal struggles we all experience as young teens. Huck battles with loyalty, friendship,and trust issues. This is one of the best pieces of classic literature I have ever had to read for school. Twain has the sort of flaire in his writing that speaks of quiet wisdome and soul. He also has brilliant insight into the human condition."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This book is an honest, down home critic of slavery 100 years ago. Mark Twain uses the observations of a young, homeless boy to let the reader know that African Americans are the same as white people. He has Jim, a slave, travel with Huck on a raft into the southern slave states. During their adventure, they meet a variety of crooks and very hypocritical people, including con men who pretend to be kings and dukes from Europe, a rich Christian family involved in a bloody feud, and many Christians who own slaves. I think Mark Twain is not only an great writer for his time, but also for any time, because he makes the reader see people as they really are. His open criticism of society is humorous and yet all readers get the message. I would recommend this book to all readers who can read the many dialects used in the book."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I've always heard others talk about how groundbreaking \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" was, but I never imagined that it would be such a controversial, yet beautiful novel. It comments on slavery and discrimination while also allowing the reader to watch Huck Finn grow into a mature character. There's a lot of adventure and mischief present in the novel to keep readers enticed; from Tom Sawyer's love for adventure novels to the lies that Huck has to tell in order to keep Jim safe. One of my favorite parts of the novel is when Jim realizes that Huck is his only friend, and then Huck accepts that Jim is a fellow human being, and not at all as horrible as Miss Watson and other characters may have portrayed him and slaves as a whole. Rebellion is prevalent in this novel, and it inspires the readers to not take everything at face value. After reading the novel I felt that it was important to be independent in one's thoughts. The scene with the sheriff made that evident being that when we're in a crowd we are more likely to be influenced by others, but when we're alone we have that moment of sincere reason. The more you read this book, the more you realize how harsh life was for slaves in that time. It really makes you question who you are, just as Huck had to when he decided to \\"go to hell\\" instead of turn Jim in. It reminds you that sometimes, a little reevaluation is needed, and that's what I believe makes the book so amazing. It has the power to make you question everything you've ever believed in."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The look at society's assumptions about colored folk was startling. I, for one, forgot how \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" could be so entertaining: rich with Mark Twain's humor and for us now, educational about how things really were.

Both were wonderful examples of life in the late 1800's and in both houses we got a picture of those author's lives and how they thought.I may have read Huckelberry Finn in high school, but if I did, I completely forgot it. Now I am reading it and realize the potent political messages Twain was sending about the life of the slaves, even after the Civil War, and the mentality of those from the North who were exploiting the people in the South, both whites and blacks. Written through Huck's eyes, it is a telling and explicit picture of life along the Mississippi during troubled times. I like this book and realize now why it is such a \\"classic\\"."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I read a German translation of Huck Finn as a teenager. When my husband found a pristine copy at a yard sale I cracked it open and was immediately captured by Mark Twain's miraculous gift for expressing the Old South in language and decided to read it again--this time the authentic version. Not wanting to dog-ear my husband's copy, I chose to buy it for my iPhone.My favorite part of the book is the long journey down the great river that moves slowly past villages and cities and it's human drama, past foolishness, kindness, and malice alike. I was not fond of the protracted adventure of breaking Jim out and did skim a little to spare myself some of the thoughtless cruelty he is put through for Tom Sawyer's entertainment, who enjoys the adventures of complications, even if he has to create them himself. But I have no objections to this part of the book, nevertheless.The historic business of human cruelty and thoughtlessness as expressed in the enslavement of Africans is more fully captured in the uncensored version and, reading Huck Finn, I wanted as accurate an accounting of it as Mark Twain originally provided. I believe if this version is read by a child, there should be supervision and discussion as it may otherwise lead to hurt and confusion. Or perhaps it should not be read by a child. But I think this unedited version is an excellent learning tool for teenagers and adults alike. Mark Twain is astoundingly good at limning the emotional and historic space of the Old South of slavery, using the tool of local language.After reading most of the book, I found myself becoming simultaneously numbed toward and hurt by the plight and blight of slavery, getting a chance to experience my own humanity. It's hard to believe we ever did this to anyone. And I think we should not forget.

In this novel the reader is introduced to Huckleberry Finn, a young free spirited boy. Tired of the endles constraints of so called \\"Civilised Society\\" Huck \\"lights out\\" on a raft with his escaped slave friend Jim.What follows is a series of adventures with a few twists and turns in the plot which are all deftly handled by Mr. Twain. My English teacher had the criticism that the book was spoiled by the last few chapters when Jim becomes a steroetypical member of his Race. I believe that in doing this Mr. Twain was trying to point out to the reader that Huck and Jim were equals only when they were alone aboard their raft and as soon as the inevitaable demands of Society are placed on them Jim is no longer Huck's equal.This is a sad indictment on the concept of Society as it was back then. I never get tired of reading this book!!!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I happened to pick up this book recently as a free promotion by the New York Post. I had read it many years ago translated in Albanian, and I vaguely remember it to be an entertaining adventure story. Obviously in communist Albania, I had no idea about the racial controversy associated with the book.So now, fifteen years later, after hearing about the book being banned from some public schools I decided to get reacquainted with it and decide for myself whether it is appropriate or not. Needless to say, that after living in the states and down south for most of my adult life, I could immediately relate to the language used by Mark Twain. I can see how some black people can get offended by the extensive use of the \\"n\\" word, but I would have to give credit to the people can see beyond the negativity that surrounds the word and are able to enjoy the story.The story will take you into the most fascinating adventure that runs through America's main artery, the Mississippi river. Mark Twain went up and down the river for a good part of his life, and that's where he learned to relate to the mainstream America of the mid nineteenth century. So the language that he uses, should not offend anybody, because it accurately represents the sad reality of mid nineteenth century.The genius of Mark Twain is that the entire story is conceptualized and told from the perspective of 13-14 year old orphan boy, with almost no formal education at all. Yet, Mark Twain places a golden heart on this little boy, which after struggling with the brainwashing on the matter of slavery is able to see the light. A fourteen year old boy is able to distinguish right from wrong, on his own, at a time when slavery was taken for granted by white people, He was able to value Jim as a person and a friend, and not as a runaway slave.That is the most beautiful message that we inherit from Mark Twain. This message sounds coherent today more than ever. Look at a person for what they really are, and not for what their color, race, or ethnicity is. That is the American soul.I am going to highly recommend this book for the children of all ages. If you are skeptical about it, give it another chance and maybe you will be able to discover the Huck Finn that lives in your heart, and is dying to come out."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Always hesitant of the word \\"classic,\\" I picked up this book with trepidation. It wasn't required reading at any point, and some libraries still have problems with it today because of certain words and scenes. That said, I plunged right in and haven't been sorry since. This is a charming tale that will definitely take you someplace you've not been before. And isn't that what we all want?--to go where we haven't been or can't go? Though not as funny as some other of Twain's books (think \\"Life on the Mississippi\\"), \\"Huck Finn\\" is an easy read, told by a child narrator. Like other child narrated books--Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" and McCrae's \\"Bark of the Dogwood,\\" Twain's \\"Huck Finn\\" uses this technique to great effect. This, coupled with a very distinctive style, not really like any other Twain work except one, makes this a highly unusual book. One must also take into consideration \\"when\\" this book was written and how new it must have seemed then with its incorrect grammar and style.

It shows one teens journey through the Mississippi River, running away from his father and helping a runaway slave named Jim, who he soon befriends, to the north. This story shows how different some people can be, though they do have hard times, but are still true friends.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, is an exciting book that will keep you guessing. The writter Samuel Clemens, pen name of Mark Twain, really brings the story alive for you. He makes his story feel so real. It wasn't like I was just reading the story, It really felt like I was there, watching Huck and Jim floating down the Mississippi River on their log raft. Mark twain makes the journey so funfilled and full of enjoyment that you can't put the book down. I had to read this book for 6th grade during summer vacation. I thought it would be a drag, but as soon as I read the first chapter I couldn't put it down...not for a second. I couldn't wait to see what was comming next because with every chapter this book gets more and more exciting until the very last page.The Adventures od Huckleberry Finn is fun, suspensful, and comical at some times. I would recommend this book to anyone, of any age who wants to get swept away in an amazing story."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"If you believe that uncivilized way of life is better then an organized planed life, then you should read this book before going to college. I am first to admit that I hate to read, but this book kept my attention till the very end. I got so caught up in how huck tries to escape from the standard ways of living.This book takes me back to when I was little and would have my own adventures with my brother. This book is one exciting adventure.This book is about being you and not living up to other people's standards. The Mississippi river is the only place where Jim hucks friend and himself can be free and make up their own rules. Another big part in this book is friendship. This book shows you the true meaning of a friend. Some of the characters in this book are huckleberry Finn other known as huck. His friend Tom and his self discover twelve thousand dollars in treasure. Huck gets adopted bye the widow Douglas and Miss Watson. Huck gets fed up with this rich life style and runs away. But Tom manages to bring him back by promising to start a band of robbers. Then Hucks father comes back to collect Hucks money but Huck refuses. In return his father takes him to a log cabin and frequently beats him. Huck escapes and fakes his own death and, runs to Jackson Island. At Jackson Island he meets Jim an ex slave hiding out. As soon as you start to read this story the plot gets you and you will catch yourself saying what's going to happen next. I really loved the way Mark Twain used southern way of speech in this story, it made you feel like real southern people were taking. I loved the plot when you think Huck is save and free he meets somebody new and an all-new adventure takes place.After reading this book it made me think about my family, I would feel so lonely if I was Huck and spent all my time alone on the river. Mark Twain feels that a uncivilized way of life is better I disagree I'm glad we have rules to follow if not everyone would do what they want and there would be chous. Imp happy to say though im glad that I live in a time where I'm free to be me."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I know most people had to read this in school so I wondered why it was so important and I finally read it after college. I know it is suppose to be a kids story but I found it to be one of the best books on morality I have ever read.The book teaches how even the most dowdy, illiterate knows that it is wrong to have another person as a slave.Huck goes through lots of experiences on his trip down the river. He learns about the envy of his father, he can't understand why the families are feuding and killing each other year after year for an old arguement. He learns how to be a charlaton and what happens to people who lie.The best part is when Tom Sawyer meets up with him and makes him and Jim follow all the rules from the pirate story and drives all the adults crazy.I really enjoyed this book and believe every teenage should read it."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Mark Twain called a \`classic' a book that everyone praises but which no one actually reads. This book defies that description, and the result is a classic which is both very readable and very enjoyable. Few American authors have enjoyed such widespread popularity as Twain, and this work is, in my opinion, his best. The story is fairly simple, and the plot such that any average person could read and follow the story, yet the message the novel conveys is so deep and important that one cannot help but be greatly enriched by this book.This is the story of Huck Finn, the son of the town drunk from \`The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.' In this novel Huck helps a slave, Jim, escape from slavery, and the two of them float down the Mississippi in search of freedom for both of them. Along the way they have many adventures, and Tom even makes an appearance toward the end of the novel to complicate and romanticize things in true Tom Sawyer style.This book has much to say about the subject of slavery. The institution is so entrenched in Huck's world that it is preached from the pulpit, that aiding a slave to escape means eternal damnation for the accomplice. Throughout the novel Huck struggles with this issue, as his inner conscience (which knows he should help Jim, and which sees him as an intelligent and worthy friend) battles his knowledge of society's morals and values (which sees Jim as a mindless brute which should be returned to captivity). In many ways Huck is far more perceptive than most people in his time, because he sees Negroes as people too. Huck's final decision in the matter is one of the great moments in American Literature. He knows what it means to help Jim, but he has made up his mind, \\"All right, then, I'll go to hell!\\"I first read this book when I was young, and even then I was impressed by the story. I didn't understand most of the meaning, but the book nevertheless made an impact on me. This is the beauty of Mark Twain--he is readable for all ages."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Mark Twain is rightly regarded as an icon of American literature. Of his works, Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer are the most famous, and of the two Huckleberry Finn is generally held to be the finer. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book as part of my introduction to American literature. Mark Twain had a sharp wit and his stories are rich with character, personalities, language, irreverant humor and situations. The historical aspect of the story is also interesting and important. The story gives a human-level view of Mississippi towards the end of slavery. The N-word is in common usage, but in an everyday context not as a derogatory term. The story shows some interesting and perhaps unexpected relationships and allegences. The wisdom and ignorance of the two main protagonists is a constant source of joy and humor. Highly recommended for adults and teenagers alike."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"this is an excellent and well written story. there are some truly memorable lines in this film as Huck and Tom take their adventures down the Mississippi.A wonderful read for kids of all ages, including 50 year olds."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I never read Mark Twain books and I sure missed out, because he is surely one of the finest American writers that ever lived. In Huckleberry Finn, he brought me right into the heart of his 19th century Missouri childhood and made me feel what life must have been like then. Huckleberry Finn is a wonderful character, and the book is full of elements of high drama as the boy escapes from his wicked father and goes on to a series of adventures with the runaway slave, Jim. Along the way, he meets an assortment of memorable characters, including a murderous feuding family and a couple of con men. He even gets to meet up again with his old friend, Tom Sawyer.Published in 1883, this book has a long history of being banned in schools because of its depiction of Jim, as well as the liberal use of the \\"N\\" word to describe African Americans. However, a close reading of the book will see that Huckleberry recognizes the [cruelty] of slavery. Also, Jim keeps his dignity throughout while white men show up as cruel or foolish by contrast. Jim might be a slave, but he shows a deep humanity and the reader cannot help but identify with his plight.I loved the book and found I couldn't put it down. It's certainly an adventure story as well as a journey into the world Mark Twain knew during his boyhood. There were parts where I laughed out loud, parts where I felt a shiver of sorrow, and parts where I grasped the beauty and wonder of the Mississippi River and the countryside around it. Always it kept me fascinated. And, if the ending was a bit contrived, I was glad. There is nothing like a happy ending to leave me smiling. I give this book one of my highest recommendations. If you've read it before, there is no doubt you'll gain new insights if you read it again. If you've never read it, don't miss it; it's a real treat."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I bought this book for my kid's school reading assignment and my kid like it very much.Bought used but the quality is pretty good!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I love Hick Finn with all my heart!

As the title suggests, it follows the adventures of Huckleberry Finn who is paired up with an escaped slave, Jim. This story is just as fantastic as everyone seems to say; it definitely deserves the title of being a \\"classic\\" book. Each obstacle Huck Finn and Jim encounter is captured in stunning detail by Mark Twain and keeps the reader captivated.One of my favorite things about \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" is how well the humor and drama balance each other. As the two boys work through each problem there is always a slight air of humor; although there are some intense situations in this book, nothing ever gets too serious. There is an absolutely perfect amount of sly, funny comments, mostly from Huck Finn, to counteract all of the drama. \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" get even funnier and more enjoyable, though, when Tom Sawyer enters the story. His preconceived notions of everything that must be done in each situation provides endless entertainment. This book is a serious, dramatic book but has humor that makes it that much better.No matter how inventive and entertaining the storyline in \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" is, though, it is still extremely difficult to get over the grammar. The book is written as if Huck Finn wrote it, with his accent and spellings. Also, the slaves' dialects are written in exactly the same way as they speak. I understand why the book is written in this way, but it does not make it easier to understand or less frustrating to read. Mark Twain wrote this book in a brilliant way; however, after a while, the grammatical errors wore on me and did take away from the story line a little."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I like the adventures of Huckleberry Finn.

Miss Watson's N*, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty clear, because there was a light behind him\\" (Twain 6.)What I liked about this novel was that it was from a child's point of view, \\"you don't know about me without you have read the a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter\\" (Twain 2.) I didn't like how it was so hard to interpret what Jim, the Run away slave, was saying; \\"I laid dah under de shavins' all day. I \`uz hungry, but warn't afeard...\\" (Twain 55.)This should be read because not only is it a classic, but also it has a nice message.

No one likes obligatory reading, and it was like water off a duck's back. Regretting that I remembered nothing of the novel, I recently re-read it, and I found it entertaining reading, and also much more for a grown-up audience than I expected. Of course the book was only started as a sequel to Twain's novel for boys THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER before being turned towards much more serious themes, such as child abuse and the conflicts in antebellum southern society. But even much of the novel's humour is intended for older readers, requiring some knowledge of European history and of Shakespeare.The book's status as one of the Great American Novels is curious when it paints so bleak a picture of America. Any signs of refined culture among these inhabitants of the Mississippi comes not even for the East Coast but from Europe. For all of Twain's love of the land--indeed, the Mississippi River is itself a character--he was clearly a cosmopolitan figure by this point. Or perhaps the praise of America is subtle, as it is a portrait of a land free of aristocracy (the characters who call themselves the \\"king\\" and \\"duke\\" are scoundrels), and the novel is written in the honest vernacular of country people.The novel cannot in any way be considered a perfect work of literature when it is an arc that soars towards quality only in the middle. The opening pages are still in the realm of children's literature, while the final section reads as a tiresome parody with far too much serendipity to be believable. For that reason I've rated it four stars."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a book that I remembered fondly from my childhood that actually holds up to another reading as an adult. Twain's wit and humor still carry the story for me as when I was a child, however, this time around, I was better able to appreciate the social and political commentary infused throughout the story. That's the magic of Twain's masterpiece: it's attraction to both young and old for both the same and different facets. For the young, this is a rollicking adventure story of an ornery youth and his escaped slave friend. It's the classic buddy tale infused with humor and narrow escapes. For the adult, There are the deeper layers of Huck's constant struggle with his own inner morality versus the popular opinion of what is considered to be right in the eyes of whites in the pre-civil war Mississippi River area.For a great escape and a look into the culture of the central United States just prior to the Civil War, I highly recommend Huckleberry Finn for all audiences."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"A set text in Yr 11 English, this book has become a favourite of mine.

It is the sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Ernest Hemingway (and many others) called it the greatest American novel ever. Huck Finn picks up right where Tom Sawyer left off - Huck's abusive father appears to lay claim to Huck's fortune, so Huck fakes his own death and goes down the Mississippi River with Jim, the escaped slave.Much like Tom Sawyer, there's not a lot of plot going on here most of the time, and that's okay, because Twain's writing is extremely entertaining. Twain has a good old time mocking social conventions, and the novel is gripping almost all the way through. Hemingway was right: the end of Huck Finn is poor. After Jim is abducted and Tom Sawyer reappears, things just get silly, not to mention highly convenient (And Tom Sawyer here is just as immature as he ever was, reinforcing that no real maturation occurred in Tom Sawyer, and that that book really isn't a coming-of-age story in the truest sense).Twain has made Huck the narrator. On the whole, this works, although it gets tiresome to read Huck's dialect sometimes. Twain-as-narrator is definitely missed here. Nobody could write a clever sentence like Twain, and most of that is lost here, although occasionally Huck will turn one (and by doing so break character, but that's the price you pay).Huck Finn has been exceedingly controversial because of the extensive use of the n-word. So is the novel racist? Certainly the characters have the racism of the day ingrained in them - in that sense, it is racist. But more important to most people is whether Twain was racist; that is, whether he put his own personal racism in the book. That is harder to determine, especially since Twain has made Huck the narrator. Perhaps the fairest thing to say is that Twain was genuinely criticizing racism, but the way in which he portrayed Jim and the other characters contains some residual racism of its own.So is Huck Finn America's greatest novel? Well, maybe not.

Maybe she is right, but Twain treats Jim as a person, while Stowe treated most of the slaves in her novel as a social problem. We all know the story. Jim is a runaway slave; Huck is a runaway teen. Together they raft down the Mississippi. Yadda yadda yadda plot, and Jim is sold back into slavery by two con-men, forcing Huck to choose between what was legal in 1840 (the approximate date of the action) and what was (and is) moral. He has heard the words of religion tolerating and even supporting slavery. He knows the laws support slavery. But Jim is his friend. Jim is not property. He is a man. When Huck Finn finally decides that his only course of action is to free Jim, he signals his determination with the line, &#34;All right, then, I'll go to hell!&#34; &#8212; and thus proves Jim's humanity and his own.

To float down an endless river not caring what happens next or where you are headed? Well in both a metaphorical and literal sense, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is the book for you. At first thought, the book appears as a child's paradise, a sort of novel well suited to young boys who want to play &quot;Cowboys and Indians&quot; or &quot;Cops and Robbers&quot;. However, these games, though included in the book, deal more with real life than at first thought. Seeming trivial pursuits in the novel possess a greater meaning and symbolism in association with the culture of America. A tale of rafts, rivers, and nature can be appreciated both for its literal sense and its deep underlying political and cultural commentary. Chronicling the life of a boy, Mark Twain masterfully utilizes literary elements such as dialect and satire along with his infamous and brilliant wit. Huckleberry is an incorrigible boy who longs to escape the strict restrictions of society and pursue a life free of woe, living off the land in expansive forests and forever gliding down the Mississippi River. Huck's adventures include interactions with a runaway slave, robbers, feuding families, and two scheming &quot;carpetbaggers&quot;. The reader is transported into the world of the 1840's where one encounters the economical and cultural conflicts of the day. It seems that as the more Huck attempts to escape the society that ties him down, the more he encounters it and the more it attains a hold upon him. Twain expresses his views on such cultural issues as the elitist yet scheming upper class through the characters aptly named the &quot;king&quot; and the &quot;duke&quot;. These characters expose the gullibility of the American public as they scam and deceive their way to economic prosperity. Twain also utilizes literary motifs as a way of revealing common facets of American culture and goals of citizens. One such motif, money, shows how some characters (for instance the king and duke) view money and material possessions as a necessity for self-fulfillment. While on the other hand, different characters (Huck and Jim) are happy to enjoy the luxury of money but are more than able to do without it and fend for themselves. These evident yet subtle touches are what make the novel The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn enjoyable not only for its excitement and story line but for what can be learned from these instances. Overall, I found the novel Huck Finn an exciting and engaging experience. It allowed me to kick back and relax with my body as my mind floated on a river of ideas and symbols hidden in the novel. I liked the body of the tale and the in-depth relationship the reader develops with the character Huck. It would not be surprising to find yourself speaking with a southern drawl after an hour or two of reading. I did however find some fault in the way the book was completed. I found the ending section's plot a bit too excessive and overall unnecessary. It did not, however, detract to any extent from my opinion on the book. I would give the book a three point five or four out of a five-point scale. I recommend the book to just about anyone, especially to those with an active imagination and an ability to look past the words of novels into the extensive world they are capable of revealing."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huck Finn by Mark Twain is a great American novel because it touches on all the points of our nations history. Although this book has many racial slurs it should not be under contriversy because of its use of the &quot;N&quot; word. The story takes place when the &quot;N&quot; word was used frequently. In a way it shows the positive relations between two people of different races. Huck Finn the main character of the novel uses this ofensive slur just because he was brought up that way, he doesn't know any better. Within the novel this teenage misfit gets himself in tons of trouble. This is where the comedy comes into play. Every time Huck ends up in trouble he manages to think of some clever excuse. Like when the two slave hunters ran into Huck and Jim(the runaway slave)on the river. Huck said &quot;Oh ya my father has small pocks, you can see him if you realy want to.&quot; Of course the slave hunters wanted to stay as far away from the two because the don't want to get small pocks. Mark Twain not only writes truthfully about this time period but he also critizes the human race for being ignerent and stupid. Throughout this incredible book Twain makes suddle comments about the human race just to poke fun at us. There was a two year break while he was writing this book because he was unsure of what he was doing. This was written in a time period when blacks were looked down upon as if the were not as inteligent as the whites were and Twain is having a black man and white boy out smart several white men. Twain thought that his novel would be laughed at if he continued this unheard of stoiy line. He was in such a twisted mental state he took off thoes two years to think about what he was even writing about, then continued Huck on his journy.

It also commanded the colossal metaphor of the Mississippi river journey, which haunts American literature as does Melville's white whale. Toward the end, unfortunately, Twain suddenly remembered he was supposed to be writing a comic adventure for boys, and it kind of peters out. But not before it has made itself an important milestone, deft in its use of point of view and wit to handle difficult issues."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"There is a deeper genius in the adventures of Huckleberry Finn in that the book is written from the perspective of 14 year old boy who is stuggling with what he has been taught and what he learns in this adventure. Huck is fleeing his troubled family life when he comes across, widow Watson's slave, Jim. He decides that he will help him find freedom in Ciaro, Illinois. He and Jim have exciting and at times very chilling adventures. In one great irony of the book, Huck and Jim are swept past the meeting of the two rivers and carried further and further into the slave south. Huck captures the spirit of a nation struggling with his/its conscience concerning slavery. In this book, Huck considers Jim an adventure but comes to respect him as a man who he cares about and a man who cares about him. Huck learns the value of friendship and the value of mutual respect along the way. I would say that the ending disappointed me in that I felt that the reappearence of Tom Sawyer played to the lessening of the lessons that Huck learns along the way. The trick he plays on Jim and Huck for that matter softens the blow that this book should level. My review as with others I have read cannot do this book justice for the very human experience it provides. One must come to grips with an era of American thought which is hard to stomach and not nearly reflected on enough."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"&quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; by Mark TwainThis book is intriguing in the fact that I, a country boy, read and understood it.

The printing was so small, that I first thought it would be a boring read. But I soon figured that I was wrong. I found myself slowly slipping into the story as if it was all happening before my own eyes. The characters were very interesting. Especially Huck Finn seemed like a very likable person with a strong identity, wit, and a soft heart. He does not want to sit and let the world rule over him, but instead test his own ideas and proves to the world that he can be better than what the society expacts him to be. And although many say it is a racially biased book because of its frequent use of N word, nobody can deny that it was a commonly used word in the 1800 where the rogue institution called 'slavery' was considered healthy and inevitable. As a matter of fact, this is a book that actually tries to tell the world about the evilness of racial prejudice not promote it. One should read between the lines, in order to acknowledge Twain's subtle attempts. It was a thrilling experience and I recommend people to have for their own!!!!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Highly, highly, highly politically incorrect and if you look at it on the surface alone you are likely to be offended. That is until you read into what Twain is really saying then you can see the absurdity of it all. Huck Finn lives in a time when an African-American is considered a property and not a person. The interaction between Finn and Jim is fantastic. This book is a classic because of how you'll find yourself uncomfortable reading how everyone looks at Jim. If your uncomfortable reading it then ask yourself why and maybe you'll learn something about yourself, society, and what strong a writer Mark Twain really was."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Twain's Huckleberry Finn has derived much controversy from its use of the \\"n\\" word in the dialogue as well as what some believe are stereotyped characters within the novel. As some have noted in defense of Twain, Twain's main object was to portray and depict the typical Southern dialect of this time period, and so his use of the word was to mainly show that this was a common expression used. This \\"overuse\\" of the word is most obviously an attempt at debunking the idea that people should speak this way. What some forget while reading Huckleberry Finn is that it is a satire aimed at breaking down and making fun of many of the conventions of not only the South, but other aspects of social life. Perhaps the biggest indicator of Twain's intent of facetiousness is in his \\"Explanatory\\" and \\"Notice\\" in the book's preface, where it is inferred that we are not to take everything so seriously in the book. There are many other things going on in the novel, and it is a shame that often we overlook that a classic like this has so much more going for it.For one thing, the novel is as much about growing up and striving to do good as anything else. Huckleberry Finn has this battle throughout the book, and mostly after he meets up with Jim on Jackson's Island and must do some serious soul searching to figure out what is right and what is wrong. An abolitionist wasn't thought of lightly in this setting, and so Huck is not easy to let go of society's laws. However, through much of Jim's guidance, Huck does learn morals and principles of life. Jim represents the father-figure in Huck's life, mainly because Huck's \\"real\\" Pap is an alcoholic, abusive, neglectful and mean-spirited to his son. If there ever were a case for a character breaking the stereotype idea, it would be Jim. After all, isn't it Jim who questions what Huck believes about him running away from slavery? When Huck examines ironically to himself is, and will always be, a \\"no good abolitionist\\", this admission and growth of character can be chalked up to Jim, who has already influenced Huck by then. Jim helps Huck grow up and be a more thought-provoking character. Huck gains a better picture as the novel progresses; for instance, he comes to understand that the duke and the king are not only frauds, but that they are lower than low because of their greed and callousness to the Wilks family.On another level, the novel is a lot about light-hearted fun, satire, poking fun of society and just Huck's imagination. Huck is a child who is not easy to civilize; he wants to be out in the world and living an adventure, being in a band of robbers with Tom Sawyer or adding \\"style\\" to a given situation. Huck often lives life by the moment, and has to use his \\"street smarts\\" to get out of predicaments, which might mean making up a story, faking his own death, dressing up like a girl to get information or using quick wit to escape a sticky situation. He seeks freedom and adventure, and the Mississippi River, where Jim and he spend much of their time on the raft, is a symbol for this escape.Over all, I found this to be a difficult review because Huckleberry Finn is probably one of my favorite books and Twain is one of my favorite authors. But, I think if you read Huckleberry Finn in the right light, it is an amazing read about adventure and growing up. Definitely recommended!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I have read and enjoyed \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" many times; but this recording enhances the text and makes it that much more enjoyable. The narrator, Tom Parker, does a superb job of bringing this odd assortment of strange and humorous characters to life. He does an especially fine job of pronouncing the numerous dialects that Twain put down for posterity. Hearing Mr. Parker's pronunciations and articulations brings these characters to life in all of their mid-nineteenth century motley. If you close your eyes you can picture Huck and Jim conversing as they travel on the Mississippi, lazily wasting their days and outwitting the numbskulls they encounter along the way. Parker does an especially fine portrayal of Pap Finn when he rants about the Guv'ment in a drunken stupor. His Duke and King are also delightfully portrayed in all their vainglorious pomposity.I was really impressed by how much value I received for so little cost. I laughed many times while following along with my text of the story. After all, Twain was primarily a humorist, and what's the point of reading a story like \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" if you refuse to see the humor in it? And Tom Parker's dramatic skills embellish this humor by bringing the text to life. Aside from the humor, Mr. Parker elicits the heart and soul of both Huck and Jim and shows how their views of each change as they both realize just how human and decent the other is. This is a story of some very human people from a time and a world that no longer exist. It's like reading a dream of a foreign world.This CD set is worth the money. It's a delightful and heartfelt reading of a most wonderfully compassionate and funny story about the common sense and innate humanity of an \\"uneducated\\" boy from the back woods of Missouri who discovers his own sense of morality and humanity while living by his wits and travelling up and down the Mississippi while meeting an assortment of colorful characters along the way. And, yes, it is unabridged."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Adventure of Huckleberry Finn is a wonderful book that blends entertainment and philosophy in an easy to read package. While this book can be fully enjoyed for its plot and story, the book shines for its ideas on morality as it is seen through the eyes of a teenage boy.Twain is an abolitionist, a proponent of anti- slavery and equality. Creating the character of Huck, Twain has injected his own ideas about slavery in the south into this novel. He presents his own ideas about morality though this young, and rather nave, teenage boy and his travels throughout a corrupt world. Everywhere he turns, he is greeted by an act of indecency. By leaving his home and traveling aboard, Huck matures every time he experiences an act of human kindness or malevolence. Huck struggles to understand what is right or wrong when his southern upbringing contradicts his own personal morals. At the end, Huck has learned and experienced enough to develop his own set of morals and help a fugitive slave escape, even though his action is an outcry towards southern values. Twain's novel is more than a story about a young boy on his wild adventures; instead it is a story of his growth.As irrelevant as it is to make comparisons, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a much darker book in comparison to Tom Sawyer. Huckleberry Finn contains countless lines of humor and satire but its overall ideas are deeper and gloomier as they concern human morality, especially in the context of slavery. While both are extremely enjoyable reads, Huckleberry Finn contains theological elements that make it a more serious book. Nevertheless, Twain's trademark humor and style are easily identified as he flawless weaves them together with the deeper elements within the book."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Preceding The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, which ends after both Tom and Huck receive a large sum of money after finding a gold stash hidden by robbers. Both take place in the small town of St. Petersburg, Missouri, sometime before the start of the civil war. This helps to set up one of the main conflicts of the book, the issue of slavery. The story is told in the eyes of Huck Finn, who's skeptical view of the world allows him to think for himself what is right and wrong based on his sense of morals rather than jumping on the band wagon and coming out upright disliking slaves and regarding them as property, as much of what the south did during those times.After being kidnapped by his biological father, he runs away and hides out on Jackson's Island and meets Jim, a run away slave. Although he has initial doubts on helping a runaway slave, he acts on what he believes to be right and team up. Throughout the story, Huck is tempted many times to turn Jim in for reward, and Twain incorporates these ideas through the characters surrounding Huck, like the con artists he is forced to join together with one time. They eventually sell Jim to Tom's aunt and uncle, and through a misunderstanding they think Huck is Tom and Tom is Sid, Tom's younger brother. Although Huck is initially surprised by the fact that Tom is willing to help Huck rescue Jim, because unlike Huck who was a social misfit, Tom was the product of middle-class society, strictly enforcing to the established rules by society. He acts as the foil for Huck through his strict adherence to rules despite moral issues while Huck acts solely through his own independent way of thinking. When Jim is \\"free\\" Huck learns that Jim had been free all along in the will left by the former slave's master. He realizes that was the reason why Tom was willing to help him. From the first book, the reader generally regards Tom as the good guy of the story, but it seems that in this novel, our view of Tom changes. He is willing to cause harm and risk lives for his own selfish motives.When all is well and over, Huck begins to see the world more clearly for himself, saying that he does not want to be civilized because it would mean losing his sense of logic and acting on cold and strict rules. He decides to go west, toward Indian territories unbound by these rules where he can decide for what is right and wrong.Twain's story is seemingly focused on Huck's \\"coming of age\\" with his discovery of the hypocrisy of the otherwise barbaric society. Where they cold-heartedly abide by rules and treat black people, who are also human as pieces of property to be bought and sold at their master's every whim.I would advise anyone to read this book because it has such a strong message and it reads well due to all the action in the story. In addition, Twain's use of foils allow the reader to see both sides of the story, albeit a little biased because it was told from Huck's point of view. All in all, it makes for one great book to read!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I first read this when I was about the fictional Huck's age. Rereading it after nearly 50 years was especially enjoyable. Numerous incidentals and turns of phrase came flooding back, yet major portions were lost to memory. This has to do with my particular literary appreciation of course, but it may also reflect on the author's construction. My memory was strong for the first half, but after Tom came on the scene it was as though I were reading it for the first time. Ernest Hemingway remarked that the book should end where Jim is betrayed and returned to slavery. That would have made the novel more a tragedy and a truer picture of 1830s America.Somehow, I cannot enjoy Tom Sawyer's machinations and contrivances to romanticize Jim's escape. I appreciate Twain's satiric style, but it went on far past my point of tolerance. Tom Sawyer is exposed not only as a twaddle-headed romantic, but as an arrogant little cockalorum, eager to toy with regular folks for his own amusement. Had I been Mark's editor, I would have urged him to abbreviate Huck and Jim's association with the King and Duke and especially shorten Tom's influence at the end. Some would say I am making too much of this. The Tomfoolery is there to allow Mr. Twain to display his unique spoofing. I get it. But why allow the brave and noble Tom to be shown as such an overweening brat?"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"\\"Persons attempting to find a motive in this narrative will be prosecuted; persons attempting to find a moral will be banished; persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot.\\"With characteristic humor and self-satire, Mark Twain inserted this warning into the preface of his classic American novel, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Perhaps he was thumbing his nose at his critics, who often criticized his writing as coarse and unsophisticated. Perhaps he was acknowledging that the book, which contains elements of an adventure story, a hero's journey and a tall tale, defies easy categorization. Using first-person narrative, Twain skillfully employs his command of language and masterful storytelling to explore the idea that true individualism means following one's own conscience, even if that means coming into conflict with society's rules and prejudices.I found this story to be an enormously good time as Twain wonderfully describes Huck and his magnificent adventure. Twain brilliantly writes of the innermost thoughts of Huck as he struggles with whether or not to accept and help Jim, a runaway slave. This is a great book that offers more than just a boy traveling down a winding river and what he encounters along the way. Twain satirical writing delivers immense insight into the society of the time. His explores the problems that existed in nineteenth century America (pre-Civil War era) with regard to slavery. Twain's comedic styles allows for a good read while subtly emphasizing the importance of personal understanding and acceptance. Twain threatened to banish anyone seeking a moral in this work, but it seems likely that his compelling themes of individualism and shared humanity contribute to the enduring popularity of this American classic."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"A vivid story of wit, growth, and adventure is provided in Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The experience of reading this novel has proved equally exciting to the plot, inducing fear, anger, and happiness as I yearned to find out the next encounter of Huck and Jim. Through a mix of satire, irony, and subtle humor, Mark Twain voices his condemnations of the faults of society: its prejudice, discrimination, and racism. This is especially expressed in his exaltation of Jim the fugitive, revealing that one's qualities are shown through their actions, not a pre-existing judgment of physical properties. The strength of friendship and individuality is also greatly emphasized in this novel. I have learned from Huck's experience that respect and freedom is not gained by following the rules, but rather gained by reaching beyond what is expected. As \\"uncivil\\" and \\"savage\\" as Huck is considered, his purity and morality outshines the rest, illustrating him as the true protagonist. The flaws of society in Huck's time are just the same as our times: a drive of ambition and greed, selfishness, and cowardice in humanity. The average man follows his peers to gain acceptance, for without acceptance, one fears their capability to function. This dependence has made us fearful and suspicious of one another, trusting no one but ourselves. A true friend discovered is a priceless jewel - a needle found in the roaring sea. They will wait for us, accept us, and most of all, converse and trust us regardless of our flaws or looks. Huck is just as we are, but successful in finding true direction and acceptance."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a great book if you are into that kind of reading. Huck is a young boy who is going through the hardships of an abusive parent. His father is a mean, nasty, cruel, and unkind person who wants Huck's money so he can use it for his own will. Huck doesn't like that idea, so he does what any boy would do: he runs away. After he runs away, a HUGE adventure unfolds on the muddy waters of the Mississippi River. He finds a runaway black man (referred to as the N-word in the book) and they set off to free him (the black man, not Huck). This book is a great book (like I said before) if you like this kind of reading. It has a lot of action in the beginning, but kind of fades off in the end. I think the book was pretty good because it was colorfully written. I really don't think that the author had a message in this book, but if he had one, then I think he was trying to say that adventures do happen, even to ordinary people."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Twain's characters are so much a part of popular culture and our national subconscious that any summary of the story would be repetitive. The book is a masterpiece - the call to adventure and subsequent journey of Huck Finn provide both a glimpse into antebellum America (the relations between whites and blacks, patterns of speech and pace of life are long gone) as well as a cold, hard look at who we are now (racially, socially, and the irrepressible urgency of being young). A classic of American literature in every sense of the word, it also is a fun read and a great story. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"\\"...sivilise me, and I can't stand it. I've been there before.\\" This is a small part of the long book of \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" by Mark Twain. This book is about a fourteen year old boy named Huck Finn who escapes from a life of abuse and sailes down the Mississippi River with an old friend. I think this book has extrordinary vocabulary like the words scour, numskull, and meek. These words in the book describe a person or an object. Although the text doesn't give much of an idea of the word's definition; it's fascinating to see the tremendous vocabulary Mark Twain uses. Also, I think this book rises in the plot and then stays there. I think this because Huck and Jim encounter a \\"king\\" and a \\"duke,\\" and they keep attempting to escape from them. A good age group for this book is grades seven to nine because this book is somewhat long with some confusing parts in it. Also, the vocabulary is for more advanced readers. Overall, this book was a great classic. It is one of my favorite books written by one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"It's interesting to read this book 150 years after the Civil War and the Emancipation. I really enjoyed this story of friendship and adventure. Twain does a great job of writing in the vernacular; also lots of superstition, which I found interesting. This book chronicles Huck & Jim's life on the river, living on a raft for several months. Huck finds out what it means to be a real friend. Tom Sawyer also shows up, and hilarities ensue. The best part is the last 80 or so pages. Very funny."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"I read this book years ago when I was very young, but it still stands today as my alltime favorite.

I really enjoyed this book. Mark Twain managed to keep the boyish atmosphere of the Adventures of Tom Sawyer while adding in adult like concepts, such as decisive moral choice and honor, to create a work of fiction that many hail to be the \\"Great American Novel.\\"If you're not familiar with the story: Huck, after having found riches with Tom Sawyer, is living with the Widow Douglas and no longer leading a life of vagrancy. I won't go too deeply into the story because: a) there are a lot of plot elements and it would be impossible and b) it really is something that you have to experience through the eyes and in the language of Huck Finn (the entire story is written from his perspective and in his dialect as opposed to the Adventures of Tom Sawyer, which was written in Twain's distinct voice). Notable plot elements: Huck's escape from Pap, Jim and Huck's travel down the Mississippi, the Duke and the Dauphin and the Royal Nonesuch, and Huck and Tom's (who is present at the end of the book) contrivance to \\"free\\" Jim (you'll understand the \\"quotations\\" after you read the book).Overall, all the hype surrounding this book is well deserved.

Situated in the early nineteenth century, Twain exhibits his opinions and concerns regarding society and racism towards African Americans through the voice of twelve-year-old Huckleberry Finn. In the beginning, Huck runs away from his town in order to escape society and its many rules. During Huck's journey, he is joined with a runaway African American slave, Jim, who not only becomes his friend but also a parental figure Huck has never had. Together, Huck and Jim venture through numerous towns in southern America, encountering discrimination, racism, lies, cons, and many other injustices in society. Their exciting adventures will keep the readers constantly entertained and amused. Though filled with humor and wit, underneath the comedy, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn contains several serious messages and topics. Through Huck's character, Twain primarily illustrates the injustices in society's rules and beliefs and its prejudice towards African Americans. Twain also tackles topics such as childhood, growing up, superstitious beliefs, and moral versus intellectual knowledge through satirical and situational events. This timeless tale is suitable for people of all ages because it allows adults to reminisce their youthful years and shows children the difficulties of growing up.

Everything, in Huck's life is going very well until his pap strolls into town looking to cash in on Huck's fortune. Shortly, after arrival Huck is taken against his will by pap. After Huck escapes, he stumbles upon a familiar slave named Jim. Jim and Huck become friends rather quickly due to similar circumstances, and without much hang time the two set off down the Mississippi River in order to set Jim free. While, on the journey down the Mississippi the two become loyal friends.Twain's novel relates to readers through his views on slavery, religion, and politics. Throughout the book he makes a mockery of the time in which he lived. Also, by having the main character, Huck, befriend a slave it shows how even in pre -civil war times there were people who thought people of color were the same as whites.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is highly recommended for its exciting and adventurous monologue, which can be shared with reader's young and old.

It did a great job making me feel like I was in the South during the 1800's because; the dialog from Huck's narrative, the way the book showed how southerners felt about blacks, and what they had to go through to be friends with a slave. Twain also did a great job with the characters, he didn't make any one character better then the other but at the same time did a great job describing the characters. For example, characters the King and Duke, Twain really made them come to life. The novel also keeps you on your toes the whole time; you never know what's coming up next, because there's a new adventure ever couple chapters. But the novel isn't just about the adventures that Huck; a young southern boy goes through. It's also about the learning experience he goes through by becoming a good friend with a slave.

The story takes place in the states along the Mississippi River during America's early years. Huckleberry, also known as Huck, is a young boy who grew up with an abusive and drunk father. When Huck's father disappears, he is taken in by a widow who tries to civilize and instill manners in him. The book starts out with adventure when Huck and his good friend Tom Sawyer form a gang. Huck is later kidnapped by his father, but he devises an extremely clever escape. He teams up with a runaway slave named Jim and they travel up the Mississippi River in hopes of getting to the northern free states. Huck always seemed to be torn between right and wrong. One minute he feels remorse for helping a runaway slave but the next he feels bad for him. This is evident when Jim is captured later in the book; Huck is set on finding and freeing Jim. Even though The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a very controversial book it should be read by people of all ages.

I find the book really interesting and at the same time almost weird, kind of on a Sci-Fi level, with everything involving how the two families kill each other including their children. Today's world is full of people trapped in the routine of society's standards and Huck is a perfect example of what many people want - independence and free spirit. I like how Huck, even though without a proper family oriented upbringing, is able to distinguish from right and wrong. It shows the incredible mental capacity humans have in their ability to reason."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"Mark twain did an amazing job at making the characters come alive. Although the book is over 100 years old i was still able to laugh at the jokes and some of the situations are still relavent today (for example the whole predicament with Pap). Though the dialects used in the book were essential to the characters and the story I sometimes found them to be either annoying or downright confusing. Nevertheless, this book still deserves 4 stars and will surely stand the test of time(well...it already has but will continue to do so)"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"and I was somewhat dreading this particular read in the American Literature class in which I'm currently enrolled. HOWEVER, if the reader can put himself in the mindset of pre-civil war America this is a great multi-level story. Obviously many reviewers are going to talk about the theme of slavery contained in the book. I think Samuel Clemens did a fantastic job of portraying his disdain for it. Blacks were considered almost below animals at the time. Consider the portion of the book where Huck is spinning a tale to Tom Sawyer's Aunt Sally and says that his boat was delayed becasue of an engine explosion. When she asks if anyone was hurt, he replies that a \\"nigger was killed\\" to which she responds \\"Well that's good, since sometimes people do get hurt\\" and then goes on to relate a tale of a white engineer that was killed in a similar accident. She didn't think about her response. This was simply the automatic reaction of southern slaveholders of the time. In this environment, in this society for Huck to grow to realize that Jim is a true. loving caring human being is amazing and the heart of the story as far as I'm concerned. Set aside any preconceptions that you may have about the book and give it a try!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This book is the American classic. It isn't simply a children's book, or a simple adventure tale, but a vision of a battle between individuality and conformity through the eyes of one of the greatest characters in American literature. The point that this book is racist is absurd. In fact, it is quite the opposite, with Twain indicating that it is more natural for Huck and Jim to be equals. Every time Huck stops along the river and enters a town, Twain satirizes the faults and gullibility of society. The ending is there to provide a sharp contrast between Huck, a strong individual and a realist, and Tom, a total conformist and a romantic. Overall, this book is a pivotal piece in American literature, and most of the points made in the book still hold true today."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This book was great i read every one of his adventures.

That, however, is not what he gets as a feigns his own death in order to escape his drunken old man, and meets up with another disregarded soul, a runaway slave who becomes his only steady friend. Together they high-tail it down the Mississippi river on a make-shift raft, narrowly escaping death, thievery, and capture from a variety of southern folk. Their experiences serve as true examples of adventure, as both discover that there is more to their character and souls that what they had ever imagined. They develop a sense of courage, acceptance, and happiness as they float their way to freedom, knowing that water always finds its way, and by following it they will too.The story of Huck shows the growth and molding of identities of both Huck and his companion Jim, with the use of eloquent diction. Twain writes in the typical language of the time period and exercises the slang and frank use of words that would be ever so appropriate of the homeless waif and runaway slave. This use of the literary device enhances Twain's theme by speaking a pure American dialect in order to paint a picture of one of the most piercing images of the devastation slavery had on those enslaved as well as the society that allowed such an act to take place. The controversial topic and writing technique which Twain uses, succeeds in relaying to the readers what his purpose was in writing the great American novel: that existence and the participation in it is short and measured, sometimes by others, but mostly by actions of the individuals themselves. Therefore, it must be taken as a continual learning process, with which understanding and growth are a byproduct to the daily highs and lows of what is known as life."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"This book is a great classic.

It truely capture the issue of race in the post ( when Twain wrote the novel) and pre ( when the book takes place) civil war as well as our society today. Many critics argue that Mark Twain was racist, but I think that the entire book is in fact making fun of the society he lived in and showing how horrible slavery was. People who want to bann the book just because it uses the \\"n\\" word are ignorant an do not want to see that slavery really did happen. It has become one of the most evil and hated words in the english language, but during the time Twain wrote this book the word was very commonly used,;it is in the book to show the reader the how black people were treated. Although it may be a sensitive issue, people need to talk about slavery and their ideas on slavery and not supress them. If we refuse to teach the book just because of this then we are trying to ignore our history. It should be veiwewed as a chance to realize that people were wrong and their mistakes are still trying to be fixed today. Should we not teach American history of the 19th century just because there was slavery? No we must learn from our past and make sure history does not repeat itself. It is very important for people when they read this book to seperate the ideas of the author with the ideas of the characters, because these are two totally diffrent veiws. Also a person must not read this book at face value and must read between the lines to capture the underlining themes of this amazing novel.

If you like adventure, or if you like danger, then The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is the book for you. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was written by Mark Twain, and published by the State Street Press in 1996. It is a great book for all ages. I think it is a good book, but it is slightly difficult to read because of the old-fashioned southern dialect used by the characters. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is about events that happened a long time ago, and I really enjoyed reading this book because I like history.This book is about a boy named Huckleberry Finn, as you might have guessed. Huck lives with a widow who had adopted him after he and Tom Sawyer, his best friend, caught two murderers and found six thousand dollars. Huck Finn did not like living all fine and dandy, so he was always breaking the rules. ...Huck would live with his dad, but his dad is always drunk and can not get settled in one place.

It showed alot of facts from the past, which I have learned from. Additionally it kept me in suspense. I highly recomend you read this book."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The book, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain, is a timeless classic that provides a message to the reader through a huge adventure that Huckleberry Finn encounters. This is actually a sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer which only helps explain the beginning of the book a little more clearly. Everything else is a new journey that Huckleberry Finn takes. There are the same characters as in the first book as there are in this book, including Huck's best friend Tom Sawyer. When I first began to read it, I got a little confused about what was going on and having a little trouble starting it, because it had been awhile since I finished Tom Sawyer. However, it didn't take long for Mark Twain to start up an adventure between Huck and Tom. They decide to start a gang where they would rob and murder people. This idea eventually dies off, but I personally thought it humorous that a couple of boys in their teens decide suddenly to begin breaking the law. It really didn't seem that they had a chance from the start to do such a thing. After this, the main story really begins to unwind.You see, Huck's dad is a bit of a drunk and one who doesn't see the importance of work. They also only meet every once in a while, and Huck is doing just fine living with a lady by the name of Widow Douglas. Every time his dad does come, Huck gets scared of what he might do to him. I find that kind of sad knowing that a son is scared of his own father. Well, it turns out that one day his dad comes wanting to take money Huck had found in the previous book. Huck's father decides that since the judge won't give him the money, he'll prove that he's really the boss of Huck by taking him to live with him in very thick woodlands in a small hut. Huckleberry succeeds to run away one night through a very elaborate scheme and finds himself on an island in the Mississippi River. On that island he meets a runaway slave named Jim. Huck had built a raft too, and both of them decide to run away together. Huckleberry Finn realized he was transporting a runaway illegally. They can only travel at night and there's always the risk that someone will catch them. Not to mention a floating house with a mysterious dead man inside, Huck Finn dressing up as a girl, dangerous currents in the river, and even sneaking on shore into people's houses for supplies and information on what was going on. Each one of these events was both suspenseful and exciting at the same time.The two were also not on the raft alone the entire time. As time passed, they are joined by two men who thought of themselves as a king and duke. The only thing they're worthy of ruling is a good way to trick people out of their money. Now Jim and Huck are involved in all of their business plans to put on shows and make money. The two men's greed towards money is so great, that they put the lives of all four passengers on the raft in danger by lying to a family who has just experienced a tragic death. They pretend to be the people who are issued the money in the dead man's will. Jim and Huck are really beginning to dislike these men and know how bad they are. Huck then devises another devious plan that has such a high risk to steel back the money and turn in the two liars.Huck also manages to get himself tangled into an even bigger mess after Jim is finally captured. He's under a disguised name, but under a name and with a family he's closer to than he thinks. The last plan he invests his time into is setting Jim free, which is the most dangerous thing he's ever done. He meets up with Tom Sawyer, and they have one last great undertaking that will keep you flipping the pages of the book. I thoroughly enjoyed this exciting novel and it really gave a message on slavery. I think there's a little something in this book for every reader who likes a good adventure that will keep you asking for more. This book is what everyone says it to be.

Twain masterfully creates an interesting storyline while staying true to the times, setting, and language. Huck's tale of his adventure down the Mississippi will keep you turning the pages.Not only does it have a well written plot, but it creates quite a controversy. Over the years it has raised discussion of its themes: racism, slavery, morality, and society's hypocrisy. Young Huck finds himself struggling as to whether help his friend Jim, a run-away slave. His recent education and civilizing has taught him that it would be wrong to help him and he'd surely be eternally punished. However, his conscience tells him that it's the right thing to help Jim and that society is wrong.Overall this book brilliantly balances story and meaning, something which can seem rare of literature at times.

So vivid were the settings and so well-liked (or, in some cases, well-disliked) were the characters that the story pulled me forward almost effortlessly.At nearly every bend of the river, I found myself marveling at what it must have been like to have lived in such an era, in so different a world. The loss of such an idyllic world is now near total, and perhaps a foretelling aspect of this loss may have been one of the intentions Twain had in his realistic upheavals into this otherwise romantic tale. Yet by providing aspects of both romanticism and realism he has allowed us to enjoy the heart of this \\"innocent\\" era and feel the jolts of connecting it to our real world (or rather, the real world at the time of its publication, but still felt today).I was truly touched by Huck's friendship and loyalty toward Jim, and found myself turning page after page in fear of Huck's giving in to societal pressures and doing what was viewed as the \\"right\\" thing to do-to turn Jim in as a runaway slave. And yet, as broken or uneducated as Huck's upbringing may have been, he triumphs in the true test of human spirit and honest, unbiased friendship.What a remarkable story!"},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"The adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain is a very interesring book.

I don't imagine anyone can find much fault in the story of a man's efforts to achieve his liberation from slavery in the company of a colorful wild boy, nor can anyone but a mental clod fail to find Twain's keen prose masterful, so I will take a stab here and cite the frequent use within the text of what we in our time define as a racist word as the cause of so much of the puzzling backlash against this American classic.I'd suggest that anyone who cannot understand CONTEXT needs to better his or her education, and anyone who does grasp a word's use within a context should comprehend the placement of offensive word in question. Secondly, I would point out that we cannot sanitize the past or impose the fluid morals of our own age on it: at best we can only censor what we find objectionable in ages that came before our own, and in that we begin a descent down a slippery slope of lies. Consider this: in a future age words we use daily and without an implication of cruelty or slight might come to be viewed as indecent. Suppose the word \\"dude\\" were to take on an obscene tone in the lexicon of the 22nd century. Funny, sure, but it's a good example of how times change and so do mores. Twain was not trying to demean a race by use of an epithet.So I hope this wonderful novel by one of America's brightest literary giants stands uncensored and available in libraries across our nation for many lifetimes to come. To lose sight of the brilliance of this fun, transporting book over a word we see now as derogatory is to cheat ourselves and our progeny of a fine literary adventure."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"&iexcl;mThe adventure of Huckleberry Finn &iexcl;n is a book whick follows &iexcl;m The adventure of Tom Sawyer &iexcl;n&iexcl;AI have seen &iexcl;m The adventure of Tom Sawyer &iexcl;nbefore &iexcl;A so&iexcl;AI think it is an interesting book.If you didn't read &iexcl;m The adventure of Tom Sawyer &iexcl;n&iexcl;A you may feel that it is quite difficult to catch up with what the story goes on ."},{"Title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Simple English)","review":"In my school years, I wasn't a very good student. I didn't do my homework or read what I was supposed to read, etc. But growing up, after reading a few of my friends' recommendations, reading just becomes a lot more fun if it isn't work. Taking tests and writing reports sucks the life out of literature, and I have to say this is a big problem with the American public school system.But anyway, after reading this and that, I decided to catch up on classics. You know, so I don't seem like such an ignoramus about books since absolutely everyone but me has read them. So, I read 1984, Catcher in the Rye, to name a few. Then I come across Huck Finn. My high school junior class read this book, but of course, I hardly paid any attention.Racist? Sure, it's rampant with the horrid N word, but this is a book about a specific time period with slaves, and Twain captures the right feel and choice of dialogue perfectly, and sadly, it mirrors many of the guests that appear on Jerry Springer. The buzz word is just something you have to get over, it's not important to the story and it's not about hating African slaves and their descendants, but just a minor detail. People that say they should ban this book are just extremely ignorant. How racist is it for someone to help a slave ESCAPE?The story, overall, is very satisfying and enjoyable all the way through. Once you get to know the characters, you care about them and worry for their well-being. I'm not sure how I can better express what a great and well-written classic this is without quoting half the book, so you'll just have to give it a try.A word of warning, however, if you must read the Penguin Classics paperback edition of the book, DO NOT READ THE INTRODUCTION BY JOHN SEELYE. Not until you've finished reading the story. This is very important for your enjoyment of the story. While it's well-written and provides a lot of insight into Twain and the story, it's written on the presumption that you've already read the book, meaning, the ending and several important plot points are completely blown. Why would they call it an introduction if it assumes you've already read it?

That is why the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was an outstanding novel for kids to read."},{"Title":"Mort: The Big Comic","review":"If you are a fan of Terry Pratchett, you'll like this adaptation of 'Mort'. If you haven't heard of him & want to get into the Discworld series, this is a good place to start for the most part.The comic faithfully reproduces Pratchett's tale of Death & Love in nicely colored pictures. The story follows the titular character of Mort as he tries to find an apprenticeship, only to be apprenticed by Death himself. From there the story takes a comic turn as Mort has to deal with Death's unruly daughter as well as the nasty side of Death- that people actually have to die.I actually had to special order this one from the UK as it isn't available in the US yet & found it well worth the money paid for it. The humor in the book is rather dry at points, but that's the type of humor that Pratchett is well loved for. At the risk of sounding like a Pratchett purist, I had no real complaints with this comic. The only bit of caution I'd give to potential buyers is that if you live in the US you may want to shop around first before plunking down a great deal of money on this comic (the price right now is $80). It's a good comic, but it's not that good. I'd also recommend that if you aren't really that big of a fan of Pratchett that you may want to give this a skip. It was fun to read but I enjoyed the book far more."},{"Title":"Mort: The Big Comic","review":"This is a great part of the Discworld series and actually the first one that really got onto me. The story is pretty good, about Death needing a break (DEATH, I mean) and his search for a replacement, which is, you'd guessed, Mort. The book is really funny, and the characters are funny and a bit more realistic than most characters from the first two Discworld books (yeah, I know this is number FOUR but I didn't like number three, Equal Rites, very much). Overall one of the better ones in the series."},{"Title":"Mort: The Big Comic","review":"Mort is an awkward boy who is trying to understand about the world. He is chosen to be an apprentice by none other than Death. This is amusing considering that a translation of \\"morte\\" is death. This is a fairly typical coming-of-age fantasy with quite a bit of humor.Terry Pratchett sets the bulk of the novel in his Discworld, which is held on the back of a giant turtle. If you have never read any of the Discworld books, don't worry, you will not be lost here. If you are not a fan of Monty Python/British humor, then you might not get all the jokes and puns. Also, you might not understand why so much is spent on cabbage.The story is solid. Although the journey of Mort towards manhood is not linear, there are no gaps in the narrative. The flow keeps you involved in the story from beginning to end. I would recommend reading this for a laugh."},{"Title":"San Francisco: The Unknown City","review":"This is not a typical guidebook for the traveler. Most of those books are little more than directories of hotels, restaurants, tourist destinations and shopping areas. By contrast, this is the kind of book I could imagine even a non-traveler curious about San Francisco might sit down to read. One would probably know more after merely reading this book than after traveling to San Francisco and rushing around a few touristy areas, camera in hand. In an engaging narrative voice, the authors flesh out the locations with background details and historical context. The emphasis is less on the \\"must see\\" tourist locations that the business traveler might squeeze in after his convention is over, and more on the elements that make San Francisco the unique place that it is for those who live there. Make no mistake, practical details about the places covered are not ignored. The main text covers both these details and the bigger picture of what makes each location worth visiting. Smaller sidebar entries are like footnotes, dropping in little bits of trivia along the way. There are plenty of photos and quirky iconic illustrations ventilating the text throughout the book. Highly recommended as an alternative to the mainstream travel guides out there."},{"Title":"San Francisco: The Unknown City","review":"I like the \\"Unknown City\\" series, I've used the New York and Vancouver book before. San Francisco is one of my favorite cities, and I've been there enough times to think this book couldn't tell me much. Boy, was I wrong. What I liked is that one the one hand it hit all the big highlights of all the main, and not so well known neighborhoods, but what was really neat is this \\"guidebook\\" is really a bunch of short stories--I knew there were colorful and crazy people in this city, but I had no idea that these people have been here since it first began. I really enjoyed it, and as someone how has a lot of guidebooks, this is a great book on an even greater city.

The Uknown City makes for great reading,and lots of interesting factoids about the city are dispersed throughout. As a SF resident, I am constantly learning new and interesting facts about my city as a result of this book. I have recommended this to friends and family as a required book to purchase before their visit to SF, and all of them have later thanked me for it.

They are passionate about wanting both visitors and residents to enjoy the many fun and interesting things about SF - and about making it as easy as possible for you to find those things. Even if you don't have my good luck of getting to chat with two SF experts, this book still contains everything you need for a great visit to the city."},{"Title":"San Francisco: The Unknown City","review":"The Unknown City series of alternative guides provides a fine focus on San Francisco, the hotbed of alternative culture in the 1960s, and identifies neighborhoods and places which reflect the city's hidden history and cultures. From the gay mecca Castro Street to offbeat museums, the scene of a duel, camping in the city, unique studios and performing arts venues, and more, it's fairly certain much of the attractions listed in SAN FRANCISCO: THE UNKNOWN CITY won't be listed in your standard travel guide.Diane C.

A chronic invalid, he also needed adventure. He decided to do some travel writing and one such trip is recounted in TRAVELS WITH A DONKEY. He headed off to the remote Cevennes mountain range of south central France and got himself kitted out nicely, so nicely, he needed assistance in carrying everything. Enter Modestine, a donkey. He might as well have attempted to harness and pack up a cat. Thus, to a deft narrative that works in powerful landscape description, sketches of country folk met along the way, and a revisiting of the region's dramatic history, he adds the self-deprecating wit that would become a model for his 20th century counterparts like Peter Fleming, Eric Newby, and Bill Bryson. Though his commentary moves along at a swift but casual gait, it builds a tension on the upside, beginning with the age-old legend of the murderous Beast of Gevaudan that haunts a neighborhood where he finds the peasantry by turns hostile and friendly and accommodations primitive. Near the summit, a visit to a monastery introduces the religious theme that will attend his descent into the beautiful land of the Camisards, the friction between Protestants and Catholics that erupted into a tragic civil war in the first decade of the 18th century. Stevenson does a fine job of sorting out the history and evoking the awe that comes with visiting the deceptively bucolic scene. No wonder this book has continued to inspire: it often appears on recommended lists and it prompted Romantic biographer Richard Holmes to retrace the journey early in his career, a century later, complete with a donkey of his own (see his book FOOTSTEPS). The critical introduction to this edition is worthwhile."},{"Title":"Travels with a donkey in the Cevennes","review":"R.L. Stevenson writes here the first account of a touristic journey in France. He is the first modern tourist. He penetrates and discovers the country and the people of what he calls the Loz&egrave;re, this mountain range in the south of The Central mountains in France, a range of mountains that was the locale of a protestant rebellion at the very beginning of the eighteenth century, severely repressed by Louis XIV. These protestant insurgers are known as the Camisards. Stevenson tries to discover the landscape, the natural setting of this insurrection and tries to show how the insurrection was connected to the very nature of these mountains. He also shows how no repression can change a person or a population. These old Camisards are still alive in the memory and the customs and ways of the protestant population of this region. It is the survival of this faith that interests and fascinates Stevenson. He also notices that the catholics and the protestants, at the time of his travels, lived in harmony but with an absolute divide between the two communities. A young catholic man who married a protestant girl and changed his faith in the process was unanimously condemned for this breach of loyalty. This book is also a perfect example of what tourism can and must be : the discovery of the visited people's mentality, culture, way of life, and the connection of these with the surrounding nature, and not only a quick look at monuments and other (un)perishable. One has to live with the people, no matter how little, to eat the people's food and to be in contact with the people in order to discuss general and particular subjects and to understand their way of thinking and behaving. Thus tourism becomes an adventure even in the heart of the most civilized country and only a couple of miles away from a railroad.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Travels with a donkey in the Cevennes","review":"Apparently, Amazon is selling a Kindle version of Penguin edition. Nevertheless, it is a sloppy edition by digireads, without introduction, index or explanatory notes. Since this is a work in the public domain, that can be found for free in respectable internet sites that offer classics in Kindle format, it is not acceptable to charge any money for it, unless it comes with some additional value. For less than what it is asked for this, you can get, also from Amazon, the complete Stevenson's works in a neat edition, perfectly formatted and with good indexes (Delphi Classics)."},{"Title":"Travels with a donkey in the Cevennes","review":"If Bill Bryson and Paul Theroux had lived in the nineteenth century and collaborated on a 12 day hiking travelogue of the mountainous C&eacute;vennes region in south central France, the result might have resembled Robert Louis Stevenson's TRAVELS WITH A DONKEY. Stevenson's hilarious account of his laborious travails with his relentlessly stubborn and self-willed but completely lovable donkey, Modestine, is both laughable and utterly charming. His recounting of the preparation of his equipment, most notably his sleeping bag, in preparation for that 12 day 120 mile trek is absolutely fascinating, particularly for a fan of lightweight wilderness camping in all four seasons. His mellifluous and detailed description of the rugged and often barren local topography is clear and concise and his narratives of the history and the sociology of the region that he has chosen for his long distance walk are meshed absolutely seamlessly with the anecdotes of his interactions with the locals along the route. Highly recommended for readers that enjoy literature in the travel genre.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Travels with a donkey in the Cevennes","review":"Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes (1878) is among the earliest published works of Robert Louis Stevenson, and yet it is in no way inferior to his later writing that established his fame. In fact, this delightful account of Stevenson's solo trek in the Cevennes Range in south central France ranks among the best travel literature in the nineteenth century.Wishing not to advertise that he would be camping alone in remote areas, he chose not to travel with a tent. Instead, he designed a sleeping sack some six feet square, made of green water-proof cart cloth without and blue sheep's fur within. This commodious bed was too heavy to carry, and thus Stevenson acquired a donkey, one Modestine.Stevenson and Modestine for twelve days were close companions, traveling some 120 miles over several mountain ridges, along rocky roads, and even through boggy marshes. The stubborn Modestine was never quite convinced that the journey was entirely worth the effort, but nonetheless Stevenson and Modestine eventually became fast friends.Stevenson actually found lodging most nights, including a stint at a monastery, Our Lady of the Snows, allowing him not only to sleep more comfortably, but to share meals with strangers. Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes is as much about the people Stevenson encountered as about his adventuresome travels through this remote region of France. My only criticism of this short account, a little more than one hundred pages, is that it is not twice as long.Stevenson was familiar with the history of the Cevennes, especially the Protestant-Catholic strife under Louis XIV that eventually resulted in a Protestant rebellion in 1702. With the passage of nearly two hundred years, the Protestants and Catholics were now living peacefully together, although these two peoples seldom mixed socially and intermarriages were quite rare. Stevenson himself was Protestant, and while staying at the monastery his hosts made sincere efforts to convert him to the Catholic faith.The young Robert Louis Stevenson was a rare individual that truly enjoyed life, one that was continually fascinated with his chanced acquaintances. Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes is delightful and amusing, but at the same time it is equally successful as a thoughtful examination of the people of the Cevennes, isolated by both mountainous geography and a minority religion."},{"Title":"Travels with a donkey in the Cevennes","review":"In the fall of 1878, the then-twenty-seven-year-old Robert Louis Stevenson found himself alone in France, abandoned by the woman he loved, who had returned to America and her estranged husband. Lonely and depressed, RLS decided to take a walking tour through the highlands of the C&eacute;vennes. For twelve days he hiked 120 miles through a rugged, wooded, sparsely populated land. He then wrote a short account of that trek. Published in 1879, it was, excepting ephemera, Stevenson's second published book and it became a minor classic, among the first of the genre of literary travel-writing.Not confident that he would be able to find nightly accommodations for sleeping during his journey, RLS had a \\"sleeping-sack\\" custom-made for his trip. It proved too cumbersome for him to carry, so he bought a donkey to be his sherpa and traveling companion. Diminutive, unprepossessing, and mouse-brown, she was christened Modestine, and, charmingly, she made her way into the title of RLS's account of the trip: TRAVELS WITH A DONKEY. (A gilt portrait of Modestine adorns the front cover of my copy of the first American edition of the book, from 1879.)Initially, RLS thought he would simply let Modestine set her own pace: \\"What that pace was, there is no word mean enough to describe; it was something as much slower than a walk as a walk is slower than a run; it kept me hanging on each foot for an incredible length of time; in five minutes it exhausted the spirit and set up a fever in all the muscles of the leg.\\" And that proved to be just the beginning of RLS's vexations with Modestine. A good part of the book is devoted to the trials and tribulations of their partnership, yet at the end of the journey RLS confesses to shedding a tear over their parting.Much of the book, of course, is the usual fare of a travel book -- a description of the territory traversed (in this case forests, gorges, massifs, and vistas) and the towns and people encountered. RLS handles this much more engagingly than many from the succeeding generations of travel writers.Yet another topic has to do with religious factionalism. RLS himself was a \\"heretic\\", but he had been raised a Presbyterian, steeped in the traditions of the wars between the Scottish Covenanters and a Catholic monarchy. The C&eacute;vennes had been the mountain redoubt of the Camisards or Huguenots, and thus it had been the site of religious persecution and rebellion. RLS is sensitive to this setting of religious conflict and he gently mocks the very notion of one true faith: \\"Thus, to the high entertainment of the angels, do we pelt each other with evangelists, like schoolboys bickering in the snow.\\" Several times during his journey RLS becomes engaged in discussions of religious matters, and he steadfastly projects an ecumenical approach to life. When met by an old man who revealed himself to be a fundamentalistic Plymouth Brother, RLS writes: \\"Of what that involves in the way of doctrine I have no idea nor the time to inform myself; but I know right well that we are all embarked upon a troublesome world, the children of one Father, striving in many essential points to do and to become the same.\\"Overall, a century and a third later, TRAVELS WITH A DONKEY is on the quaint side, but nonetheless it is enchanting. Stevenson's prose is marvelous. But what is best and most memorable about the book is the good humor, magnanimity, and open-armed humanity of its author.TRAVELS WITH A DONKEY is perhaps most famous for Stevenson's expression of the credo of a certain breed of traveler. In response to the rhetorical question of why anyone would desire to visit certain small villages of the C&eacute;vennes, RLS writes: \\"I travel not to go anywhere, but to go. I travel for travel's sake. The great affair is to move; to feel the needs and hitches of our life more nearly; to come down off this feather-bed of civilisation, and find the globe granite underfoot and strewn with cutting flints.\\""},{"Title":"Travels with a donkey in the Cevennes","review":"RLS's covering note to Sidney Colvin contains one of the most profound philosophies with regard to our metaphorical travel through life - that of finding an honest friend.

Ardell Sheridan Castellano has written an excellent book detailing the contributions of one of the best actors of his generation, Richard S Castellano. Always to be remembered as Clemenza, Richard S Castellano never received his just due for his contributions in making The Godfather one of the most important films of our time. As you will read he kept an inexperienced Al Pacino from getting fired. He made a slight adjustment in Pacinos characterization as Michael Corleone that not only helped Pacino keep his job, but helped him in creating a powerful and complex character. Perhaps Castellano knew the character of Michael intimately since his true life uncle was Big Paul Castellano. Castellano was also instumental in helping Brando understand Vito Corleone's motivating actions. Brando's relationship with Castellano suffered after this due to Brando's hurt ego. Brando was somewhat disturbed that Castellano knew how to find Corleone's intentions when he could not. Castellano was the only other actor who was considered for Corleone's role after Brando's screen test for the part. Castellano along with his wife and the author of this book, Ardell Sheridan, rewrote the Genco Oil scene when the version written by Francis Ford Coppola could not be properly acted by Brando. Again Richard was able to draw from his true life experiences growing up in a mob family and these experiences helped him in making this version of the rewrite truthful. Coppola has never given Richard and Ardell Sheridan their just due when it comes to their contributions in tightening up the Godfather script. A great book if your interested in the Godfather and the character Clemenza."},{"Title":"Divine Intervention and a Dash of Magic unraveling The Mystery of \\"The Method\\" (Behind the scenes of Godfather 1)","review":"This is an unbelievable book by an author who is not only a true teacher of method acting but one of the script rewriters for the movie The Godfather.

Siddu 'un si linguista, e preferici tuttu ni lu Ngrisi, t'a fari piaciri stu libbru puru senza nuddu Sicilianu ni iddu. I still liked the book without the Sicilian, and even though it was more about acting and writing. And if you get down to brass tacks, there wasn't much Sicilian in the Godfather movie. It wasn't really used that much until the Godfather II. Heck, if I ever decide to try acting or to write a screenplay, this book may actually come in handy, lol."},{"Title":"The descendants of Capt.

He explains in terms understandable by almost everyone why it matters that we look harder at what is being done and by whom. Too many articles on this topic today seem to concentrate on genetic manipulation that will pass on to future generations of plants or animals and thus be a major factor in evolution. But this book focuses on what can or can't be done with genes in the current generation, a much more clear and present danger (or benefit).The only fault I could find with the book is that the subtitle might lead a person to believe he had more control over where, when and by whom genetic engineering will impact his life. Unless more of us get together to help craft policies and laws about the use of genetics, the answers will all come from those who stand to profit moneywise from your genes."},{"Title":"Beyond Genetics: Putting the Power of DNA to Work in Your Life","review":"McGee's predictions, while some may seem infeasible, are thought provoking and founded on ample research in today's biotechnology market.As a student taking AP Biology, I found this book to be wholly readable; it touched on topics I've had to study, but no where did it become tedious or perplexing."},{"Title":"Beyond Genetics: Putting the Power of DNA to Work in Your Life","review":"McGee's discourse is somewhat dry, uneven, vague (particularly the first three chapters which generally stuck me as being too abstract and grandiose), the editing should have been better, and for these reasons the text is often discouraging. But if you can stay with McGee, you will eventually find that the issues being examined are important and complex. McGee addresses the broad misunderstandings that many people fasten to the now frequent reports of the identification of \\"genes for\\" this or that condition or disease or shenanigans (I write this amid titillating headlines that \\"science\\" has identified a \\"gene for\\" sexual infidelity--so there you have it, I'm sure!). He highlights the difficulties and injustices that have arisen, and continue to develop, as regards \\"genetic discrimination\\". The abuse of genomic information (and likely other incomplete science, although McGee's focus is strictly genomics) by industry, employers, and particularly the for-profit private health insurance system enshrined by the American political Right, is now intractable, for the simple reason that the entire discipline of bioinformatics is enormously incomplete, at best. On points, current understandings of data (whether extant or absent) will certainly prove to be wrong (or perhaps too complex to foreseeably become scientifically \\"right\\"), but in many cases this incomplete and/or wrong science is wielded by for-profit \\"health care\\" insurers to isolate and [virtually eugenically] punish innocent but exploitable individuals, in hopes of producing a more attractive spreadsheet for investors. A putative \\"health care system\\" (that is, the American for-profit system) that is inherently fastened to the abuse and the selective misuse of science, and to place the necessity for profitability above mere scientific caution (apparently \`science' must be malleable, or even dispensable, if, when, and where science might conflict with financial strategies!), is a health care system seriously in need of dispassionate scrutiny, repair, and/or replacement.The issues surrounding \`genetic discrimination', the \`scientific' aspects of which are often dubious, is not McGee's only topic here, but in that it highlights our culture's misunderstanding of the fundamental nature of what science is and what science actually does (including what its appropriate uses, inherent uncertainties, and constraints are), and in that it highlights the inherent problems of doing healthcare for maximally large black or green numbers, it's an important topic."},{"Title":"Freud vs. God","review":"As a Christian medical student interested in psychiatry, I found this book to be very valuable--it's the only recent book I know of that addresses the interface and integration of Christianity and psychiatry.In summary, the book argues that there needs to be a much greater effort to integrate psychiatry and christianity in order to better help the emotionally/mentally ill. Attempts at integration have been virtually absent in recent years. Blazer puts forth his suggestions on where to go from here.I valued several things from this book. First, I valued the histories of psychiatry, psychology, christianity, and the interface between them that he provides. These histories give me a good background and context as I pursue my interest in Christian psychiatry. Second, I value the stories of his patients that he uses to illustrate his points. The stories made much of the abstract concepts discussed more clear and relevant.On the other hand, I had trouble following his discussion at a good number of points along the way. Perhaps they required more of a background in psychiatry for me to understand them. Chapter 2, on the history of the conversation between christianity and psychiatry was particularly tough to get through. Not the easiest read but then again, it's good to be challenged with difficult reads every now and then.I highly recommend the book to christians interested in helping the emotionally/mentally/spiritually ill..."},{"Title":"Freud vs. God","review":"The book relates the history of mental health techniques over the past 200 years, including the primitive and unscientific application of such pseudo-scientific modes of &quot;healing&quot; as lobotomies and electro-shock; it then focuses it's attention on the new &quot;wonder treatment&quot; of psycho-pharmacology - &quot;better thinking through chemistry.&quot; The major defect of &quot;christian psychiatrist&quot; Blazer is that he fails to completely research those he quotes. Although the book is well researched, he neglects to give us the latest historical research on figures of note in his chosen field. For instance, it has taken us 100 years to learn that Freud was a cocaine addict who treated his patients with cocaine to their detriment; that Jung was an occultist for the major length of his life, was an influence in Nazi occult theory, and who only returned to a somewhat traditional Christian belief system in his later years in a sort of &quot;deathbed conversion&quot;. Dr. Blazer, while admitting his own spiritual difficulties, does not acknowledge that some of his most treasured concepts are those of people who had their own very serious spiritual difficulties during the periods of their lives when they concocted those very theories. In short, the book is a juvenile attempt at catharsis for this aged practicioner of the discredited pseudo-science of psychiatry, in which he tries to balance his own &quot;hot-tub religion&quot; with his personal admission of the failures of his professional life as a psychiatrist. It is doubtful that he succeeds in his personal quest to wash away the guilt he exhibits throughout the work.

Corrupt and evil notions are so explicitly well-rationalized, with such a seemingly undeniable logic, that the reader is almost forced to pause, mid-paragraph at times, to debate in his own mind whether he agrees with what he just read. As the story unfolds, and the maladies brought about through the gradual corruption of Dorian Gray grow more and more apparent and profound, one almost needs to turn the pages back to the stanzas previously used to justify an ill-fated thought simply to reconsider why such statements at first seemed to be such decent insights about humanity. Perhaps we are all just as corruptible as Dorian Gray? If so, that is the genius of Oscar Wilde in this work.This novel is not simply one to be read; rather it is a novel to be read deeply into. There is a little bit of Dorian Gray in us all."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"reading this for the first time, i remember the movie that was made in the 1980's (vaguely) i'm a fan of oscar wilde and these pocket editions as well!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I love this story.

I highly recommend this classic book.Check out my newest thriller - Bound by Birth - by Randall R WheelerBound By Birth"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What a delightful book! Many of us our familiar with the basic Dorian Gray fable - a man yearns for immortality and gets it. In Wilde's take, Dorian Gray, a young handsome teenager wishes the deprecating effects of age to strike his portrait and not his flesh. He gets his wish and at the goading of Lord Henry becomes an absolute hedonist. Always within though there seems to be a remorseful conscience, a longing for purity. But the ease of depravity squashes moral sentiments before they take root. In the end though, the ageless man finally confronts his portrait...After learning of the author, Oscar Wilde, I was surprised that the book came from his pen (thinly veiled homoeroticism nonwithstanding). I interpreted the book as a cautionary tale against heedlessness and indulgence - basically against the materialist character of Lord Henry. It is a moral tale that explores themes of beauty and its subsidary: age. One cannot help but see one's own portrait in the depiction of young Dorian Gray.I found the writing of the book to be fantastic. Great dialogue and monologues with the British witticisms that you would expect."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"So you want to remain eternally young? This book will tell you an engrossing moralistic tale that paints the picture of where the deadly sin of vanity can take you. It will take you into a descent into a hell full of shadows where the light will never touch you.This is a classic dark tale of intrigue. It is filled with the depths to which the human condition can sink. It is a page turner, but it may leave you feeling empty at the end. That is what it did for me. Nevertheless, it is a haunting book that is well worth reading. Oscar Wilde will speak from his grave throughout the centuries through this book.As the author of a spiritually-themed book entitled \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude,\\" I appreciated this book for the most unusual reasons. I am a former addict who knows what it is like to experience hell within life. The hopeful note within this book is that it will wake the reader up to taking responsibility for his or her own life. That is what I have had to do with my own. Thank God for books that can wake us up to that reality so that we do not have to sink into the abyss of nothingness.Davis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Famed for his biting wit and a master of epigrams, Oliver Wilde fails to disappoint in the only novel he has ever published. The Picture of Dorian Gray is both shocking and profound, delving into the daunting choices one man makes after obtaining, through a careless wish, perpetual youth.Dorian Gray begins the book as an innocent, wholly untainted Adonis. He is introduced to the decadent Lord Henry Wotton through his friend Basil Hallward, a renowned painter. After the influence of Lord Henry, Dorian, upon seeing his alluring, youthful self captured in Basil's portrait of him, rashly wishes that he might remain young and beautiful like the portrait while it grew old and ugly. The discovery that his wish was made a reality leads Dorian down a sordid path. He coldly scorns his love, Sibyl Vane, when she loses her acting ability for love of him, resulting in her suicide. After this mar of blood on his conscience, Dorian chooses to lead a life of hedonism, ignoring the pleadings of his old friend Basil. Blaming Basil for his tainted conscience and corrupt way of life, Dorian murders Basil and eventually, stabs his portrait in rage, killing himself. He reverts to his true self, utterly grotesque and unrecognizable.Although the plot alone is enticing, Wilde's incredible skill with language is really the highlight of the book. Many astonishing events occur in the story of Dorian's descent into decadence, but Wilde's consistent, calm narration does not mask the scenes' madness but rather enhances it, making Dorian's evil actions all the more eerie. Tempting in its morbidity, the book drags along its readers as a horror movie would its audience. Through his mastery of syntax, Wilde is often able to convey exactly Dorian's emotion and state of mind. Varying between short, choppy sentences and long, languid descriptions, Wilde skillfully manipulates syntax to reflect upon the state of the characters. Imagery runs rampant throughout the novel. Whole passages devoted to the description of the gardens and the like drug the reader with sensual images, pulling them into the scene itself.The characters are also developed to an amazing extent, especially Lord Henry, the most intriguing in the book. Despite being a bad influence on Dorian, Lord Henry is actually a main contributor to the profundity of this novel. Although he is seen as a decadent, and often times, the intellectual lightweight of the story, Henry is also very philosophical. The man seems to have a philosophy of everything, smothering in his constant philosophical didactics. However, sayings like \\"Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was torn away\\" are very thought-provoking. It seems that Henry is Wilde's spokesperson through whom the author questions society's way of life and any alternatives. Lord Henry's thoughts, thus, not only influences Dorian but also has a tremendous effect on Wilde's readers.However, this amazing novel is not without flaws. Basil is intended to be the most moralistic of the trio, an opposition to Lord Henry's negative influence on Dorian. Although Basil's weakness can be interpreted as Wilde's criticism of Victorian society and its own weakening morals, his reluctance to fully acknowledge Dorian's stray from the noble path and thus, his inability to save his friend is infuriating and almost annoying.Overall, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great read. Its morals are fairly simplistic while its messages are wholly complicated. The masterful use of language in the novel establishes once more the reason for Oscar Wilde's popularity. Provoking and profound, The Picture of Dorian Gray definitely merits a second read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It has been said that this book is one of Oscar Wilde's classics and I do say it is. The story revolves around one man and his desire to be young. Although it was originally published in the 1800's, the themes and ideas within the book you can adapt to today's time. I have underlined many quotations that I found very interesting and if thought about make sense.Now, for those who know or don't, it has been made a movie before and it has been revived this time around as a movie set to release this year with the lead character played by Ben Barnes (The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian). Ben Barnes was known for Prince Caspian and this is his next movie to release. Also starring, Colin Firth.I would certainly read this book first before seeing the movie and for a price like this, you cannot take advantage of reading a great literary classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The experience of reading Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray is tantamount to engaging in a philosophical debate with a person suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder--and they're winning. The exquisite attention to detail paired with a sharp analytical wit delivers an indomitable argument. One cannot help but succumb to temptations along with the charismatic Dorian and echo his cries of despair when the effects of sin become prominently displayed, marring the handsome features.Wilde creates a subtle trap, luring the reader with Dorian's innocence and naivet&eacute;. The snare gently tightens as the pure boy slides deeper into depravity and becomes corrupted by pleasure. So slowly is the reader introduced to the poison, by the time realization hits there is no hope of escape. They are as thoroughly embroiled in the life of hedonism and aestheticism as the protagonist. Dorian becomes subsequently more callous with every act of debauchery he commits and the impact of his actions is reduced by the sheer number of skeletons in his closet. Rather than becoming appalled as his wickedness grows, the reader is simple hardened for what is to come. When Dorian finally carries out the act of treachery that tilts the scale, no one is surprised.The pictures painted by Wilde's careful words are elaborate to the point of being mind-numbing. Explicit descriptions of Dorian's hobbies fill pages while serving no apparent purpose. Closer examination determines the usefulness of aforementioned descriptions in drawing the reader closer to the child-like curiosity of Dorian, perhaps justifying his eventual corruption. Unfortunately this knowledge is not enough to banish the tedium and some passages must simply be suffered through.Oscar Wilde has created a thought provoking masterpiece. An excellent read for those who have ever question the morality of society of have peered out across seas of corruption and vowed to stay away. Not for the faint of hear or easily distracted, hose who choose to take the plunge will find themselves pleasantly rewarded."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"a classic literary staple of the modern world! a must read for any intellectual. every sentence is brimming with stimulating ideas and paradoxes."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde seems to have written a somewhat scathing critique of late nineteenth century English life, or at least that of the upper class. The two main characters, Dorian Gray himself and his mentor Lord Henry Wotton, lead lives of extreme self-indulgence.Lord Henry constantly spews forth his theories and philosophies regarding everything about human nature. Although they are numerous, Henry's ideas can be condensed into one main point. Early in the narrative when he is first exercising his right to influence under the title of mentor, Henry exclaims to Dorian that the only thing worth having is youth. Youth, which is, according to Henry, the only stage where beauty can be found, comes with an ever-present hedonistic lifestyle. This is the template for which the impressionable Dorian bases his life upon.Dorian becomes the ultimate purveyor of self-indulgence and corrupts everything he associates himself with, all the while accompanied on his journeys by a curse of grave implications. To the disappoint of many, I will not give away more of the story; as I'm sure most of you are already salivating over the details I have put forth.The story unfolds at first in a matter of weeks and then jumps several years, yet the focus of the novel does not waiver. This Romantic Period novel is filled with the standard mystery, and a central dealing with human nature. It is well written and comes with excellent detail, as required by this writing period. It also comes with the characteristic whit of Oscar Wilde. The dialogue between characters is excellent and Lord Henry's theories are exquisite often bordering on comical, but always cynical.Wilde seems to warn against the excess of hedonism and uses the story of Dorian Gray as a deterrent. More importantly I believe this is a social critique of high society, which breeds excess and cultivates decadence, while often regarding everything with a selfish eye. The book is filled intellectual quips about human nature and society, yet it is a short book and relatively easy read. This book is required reading for many, so possibly you've already read it, but if not, during commercial breaks of course, give this a try."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a terrific melodramatic Romantic-era novel. It is a pleasant story of an artist-Basil-and his relationship with a young man named Dorian Gray. Basil often paints portraits of Gray, and one day a man named Lord Henry Wotton comes and changes Gray's life. Though I don't want to spoil the rich plot, Gray is faced with the reality that he will soon age and the sketches will not, and he is horrified.The book is a quick read, despite mostly long chapters (fifteen pages or so). I was able to sit down and read the book, often finding myself enjoying a book assigned in English class. Though it is quick moving and a reasonably short book, it is a book meant for high schoolers and older.For a story out of the Romantic era, I really enjoyed reading this book. It wasn't one of the books that I had to turn to Cliff's Notes to understand-it was an easy read. The book kind of reminded me of a soap opera, though not nearly as lame, it had some parts that would appear in the script of a soap. I found myself hating Lord Henry for ruining Gray, and enjoying the choices that Gray made.Overall this book is definitely worth a quick read. It's not your typical Romantic book, because it isn't a cheesy novel, it has some real depth. I recommend it to anybody looking for a quick and easy read or if it's on the reading list for somebody's summer required reading for English. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The story in itself was great, I loved it! However, Wilde's use of excess pronouns could tend to confuse a reader.

I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I picked up this book on a whim at a local bookstore knowing little to nothing about Oscar Wilde. This story kept me entranced the entire time. I, like Basil, was completely infautated with Dorian Gray from the moment his name was annouced. A beautiful boy completely unspoiled by the darkness in the world. A boy immeressed in the decendance of his times. When Dorian realizes he too must face mortality and it's grip on his beauty he makes a wish to never lose his youth and beauty, to instead let his painting age for him. This the painting does... from the curve of his lips to the look in his eyes. Dorian uses this completely to his advantage and commits selfish and horrible acts all the while hidden under a charming smile and innocent face. A Picture of Dorian Gray is now one of my most favorite books of all time. If only Wilde had written more than one novel!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was shunned by the public after publishing The Picture of Dorian Gray. It is a beautifully written book and is as much a work of art as an elegantly painted portrait.Centered around the vain and young Dorian Gray, it tells the price one pays for eternal youth and gives a new dimension to the human soul. As Dorian succumbs to the tempting dark underworld of London, and he lives by night in wicked ways, the beautiful portrait painted of him becomes like a journal of his soul, becoming ever more twisted and deformed. It begins to haunt Dorian continuously, day and night, consuming his every thought. Then a shadow from his young past creeps back into his life and makes Dorian's life even more frighteningOscar Wilde's novel is a magnificent read and explores the issue and thoughts surrounding man's soul. How tarnished it becomes if we live a bad life, etcetera.I recommended anyone to read this Wilde masterpiece. You do not have to like horror to enjoy it. Any lover of a well written book would also fall for this."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde is a novel that explores the themes of human corruption, moral decadence and the value of youth in society. The novel follows the life of a narcissistic youth, Dorian Gray, who makes a Faustian pact with the devil to keep his youth. Dorian grows to love immorality and the darker joys of life. However, the evils of his life do not manifest within him but in his portrait.Published in 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray is still a popular choice of literature for society today, being praised as one of Wilde's greatest works. The appeals of The Picture of Dorian Gray to a modern day society are the plot, characters and Wilde's firm command of language. The novel deals with themes that are common in society, drugs, violence, immorality, social decadence and human corruption.At times, Wilde's writing appears shallow and wooden, lacking any action. However, what is lost in action is gained in dialogue, which is exquisite and strongly reflects Wilde's own nature. The novel is riddled with finely wrought epigrams and witticisms that display the true skill and genius of Wilde as both an author and an orator."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What is more important, physical beauty or a beautiful heart? This story gets to the bottom of that question and takes you on a journey ending with a surprise. Dorian Gray is the perfect main character. You will love him, dislike him, loathe him and then pity him. Just as relevant 100 years after it was penned."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This sophisticated but crude novel is the story of man's eternal desire for perennial youth, of our vanity and frivolity, of the dangers of messing with the laws of life. Just like &quot;Faust&quot; and &quot;The immortal&quot; by Borges.Dorian Gray is beautiful and irresistible. He is a socialit&eacute; with a high ego and superficial thinking. When his friend Basil Hallward paints his portrait, Gray expresses his wish that he could stay forever as young and charming as the portrait. The wish comes true.Allured by his depraved friend Henry Wotton, perhaps the best character of the book, Gray jumps into a life of utter pervertion and sin. But, every time he sins, the portrait gets older, while Gray stays young and healthy. His life turns into a maelstrom of sex, lies, murder and crime. Some day he will want to cancel the deal and be normal again. But Fate has other plans.Wilde, a man of the world who vaguely resembles Gray, wrote this masterpiece with a great but dark sense of humor, saying every thing he has to say. It is an ironic view of vanity, of superflous desires. Gray is a man destroyed by his very beauty, to whom an unknown magical power gave the chance to contemplate in his own portrait all the vices that his looks and the world put in his hands. Love becomes carnal lust; passion becomes crime. The characters and the scenes are perfect. Wilde's wit and sarcasm come in full splendor to tell us that the world is dangerous for the soul, when its rules are not followed. But, and it's a big but, it is not a moralizing story. Wilde was not the man to do that. It is a fierce and unrepressed exposition of all the ugly side of us humans, when unchecked by nature. To be rich, beautiful and eternally young is a sure way to hell. And the writing makes it a classical novel. Come go with Wotton and Wilde to the theater, and then to an orgy. You'll wish you age peacefully."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I first was introduced to Dorian Gray through a book club, and I thought 'Oh no, Oscar Wilde, here I go, another hard to read boring society book&quot;. I was wrong. Within the first two chapters of Dorian Gray I was intrigued and fascinated. This book deals with several issues that are as important now as they are today: the way our culture worships beauty and youth, an admiration that boarders on homosexual love, virtues, the differences between men and women, and what art is and what makes it truly art. Dorian Gray is a beautiful young man, who sees a portrait of himself and says &quot;How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young...If only it were the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the portrait to grow old...I would give my soul for that!&quot; The book takes off from there, leading you from a small theater to great parties. While younger readers may find some of the wording as tough as an old gym shoe, anyone older than 13 with an interest in mystery, romance, and how society runs, will find this a pleasurable and haunting read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a mesmerizing read dominated by two amazing personalities. Dorian Gray is certainly interesting, but I was much more impressed by his friend and mentor Lord Henry Wotton. Dorian is a perfectly nice, well-meaning young man when we first meet him in the studio of the painter Basil Hallward. Hallward in fact is so drawn to the youth that he draws his greatest inspiration from painting him and just being with him. It is the influence of Hallward's friend Lord Henry which leads to Gray's downfall. There are few characters in literature as decadent, witty, and somehow enchanting as Lord Henry. He is never at a loss for words, fatalistic observations of life and people, sarcastic philosophical musings, and brilliantly devious ideas. Among his world of social decadents and artistic do-nothings, his charm remains redoubtable and highly sought-after. Gray immediately falls under his spell, soon devoting himself to living life to its fullest and enjoying his youth and beauty to the utmost. He solemnly wishes that he could remain young and beautiful forever, that Hallward's exquisite picture of him should bear the marks of age and debauchery rather than himself. To his surprise and ultimate horror, he finds his wish fulfilled. Small lines and creases first appear in the portrait, but after he cruelly breaks the heart of an unfortunate young actress who then takes her own life, the first real signs of horror and blood manifest themselves on his portrait. His love for the ill-fated Sibyl Vane is a sordid, heartbreaking tale, and it marks the culmination of his descent into debauchery. He frequents opium dens and houses of ill repute, justifying all of his worst actions to himself, while the influence of Lord Henry continues to work its black magic on his soul. He hides his increasingly grotesque portrait away in an upstairs room, sometimes going up to stare at it and take pleasure in the fact that it rather than he bears the stains of his iniquities. In time, his obsession with his secret grows, and he is constantly afraid that it will be discovered by someone. For eighteen years he lives in this manner, moving among the members of his society as a revered figure who magically retains his youth, but eventually he begins to see himself as he really is and to curse the portrait, blaming its magic for his miserable life of ill-begotten pleasures and loss of moral character. The final pages are well-written, and the climax is eminently satisfying.Exhibiting the undeniable influence of the French Decadence movement of the late 19th century, this wonderful novel serves as a morality play of sorts. One can understand why its unique nature upset a British society emerging from the social constraints of Victorianism, but this reader is hard pressed to see why this novel proved so damaging to Wilde's eventual imprisonment and punishment. Dorian Gray is no hero, nor does his ultimate internal struggles and yearnings for rebirth inspire one to engage in the sort of life he himself eventually came to regret. The only \\"dangerous\\" character in this novel is Lord Henry; his delight in working his evil influence on others as a type of moral experiment and the silver-tongued charm he exploits to aid him in such misbegotten quests have the potential to do harm to a vulnerable mind such as that of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry's evil genius makes him much more interesting than his disciple Dorian Gray. By today's standards, this book is not shocking, and indeed it is much more dangerous to censor work such as this than it is to read it. This book in eminently quotable, and it still manages to cast a magical spell over readers of this day and age. Quite simply, The Picture of Dorian Gray deserves a place on the shelf of the world's greatest literature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What made Oscar Wild(e)?The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press has published a new edition of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. While there is no burning need for such a volume in the day of Lady Gaga and marriage equality, it's important to remember that Wilde spent two years in prison for being gay and for having the guts (stupidity?) to flaunt his sexuality. In many ways, it was the flaunting rather than the act themselves that so angered his persecutors.And Dorian Gray, his first and only novel, was certainly a shot fired directly into the heart of Victorian prudery.And in this day of Kindles, e-books and tweets, this is truly a magnificent job of bookmaking. Oversized, lavishly illustrated and gorgeously presented, Oscar would have loved it. The text is examined minutely, with a variety of comparisons from various publications of the novel, as well as Wilde's original manuscript. While there's nothing particularly new to discover in the emendations from the sources, merely a reinforcement of the outrageousness inherent in the piece, the scholarship is both astounding and informative.The annotator and editor, Nicholas Frankel, easily and effortlessly places the modern reader in Wilde's time and place, London's late Victorian Age in London. There is still a tingle to Dorian's story of endless debauchery while he remains looking pure and innocent for decades and the painting ages and grows monstrous, reflecting his sins and crimes.Strangely, the book seems more modern than one would imagine. Rather than merely a potboiler from two centuries back, WIlde's genius imbues the story with a strange and haunting immediacy, and a cautionary tale for us all: Be careful what you wish for.One could hardly wish for a more beautifully accoutered book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Is your soul a good bargaining chip for perpetual youth and beauty? Young Dorian Gray was led to believe so and impulsively struck that bargain. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is the story of his decline into depravity following that ill-advised trade-off. The story is well-known in popular culture. An artist becomes obsessed with his young model's attractiveness. He and his jaded friend compete for influence over the young man. The friend corrupts young Dorian, encourages him to embrace a life of sensual pleasure and to prize his own beauty. Dorian exclaims that he resents the portrait because IT will keep the freshness of youth -- then the fateful words, that he would give his soul if the picture could decay instead of his own face and body.Be careful what you wish for! Over the next twenty years Dorian sinks into the depths of moral slime and watches the hidden portrait show all the signs of that immorality, while his own face and figure keep the blush of youth.Along with the adulation of youth and beauty, Oscar Wilde delves into the theme of art as morally neutral, a principle of the aesthetic school of thought. Can art be moral or immoral? Should it teach us, improve us? That was the common 19th century view but the school of aestheticism believed that the arts had no role in moral enlightenment. The preface of the book lays out this theme in a series of proclamations.The entire book, like all of Wilde's work, is packed with \\"sound bites.\\" The corrupting friend, Lord Henry Wotton, is particularly prone to Polonius-like declamations, and Dorian tells him, \\"You cut life to pieces with your epigrams!\\" In fact Wilde does that, ripping into polite society and the opium dens of London alike.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is Oscar Wilde's only published novel. It first appeared in a magazine in 1890 as a shorter work, and was later expanded and edited to remove some of the more blatant homosexual references. His writing is exquisite, his themes repugnant but (dare I say it?) edifying. \\"What does it profit a man ...\\"Highly recommended as a true classic of modern literature. I read this book when I was young and thought I understood it. Now that I'm not so young, I'm sure that I don't.NOTE: I listened to this book on CD, not tape, but I chose this product link because it's the same production. The Brilliance Audio Library Edition, read by Michael Page, was incomparably presented and added a great deal to my enjoyment of this absorbing book.Linda Bulger, 2008"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book contains the story 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' - in original typescript form. This is the way Oscar Wilde wanted the novel to actually read before the publishers got hold of it. There are two other versions of the novel out there - the version printed for magazine publication & the one printed in novel form. After the publishers got hold of the manuscript a lot of changes were made because of content - the homoerotic element was toned down. The novel version is also longer - Wilde expanded the story. There are pictures, illustrations, & extensive notes included to explain all the changes. It's very interesting to see a version in print that is how Wilde intended it. If you are a fan of Oscar Wilde's works or of Dorian Gray in particular, you will appreciate having this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil Harwood talks to his friend, Lord Henry Wotton, about his latest painting, a portrait of a striking young man named Dorian Gray to whom he has taken quite a fancy. He feels that his art has never been alive as it has since meeting this young man. Intrigued at his friends acute interest, Lord Henry determines to meet the young man himself, and quite by chance, manages to remain in the studio as Dorian arrives and stands for the finishing touches to his portrait.Once it is completed, Lord Henry comments on how youthful the painting is, remarking how unfortunate it is that the portrait will always remain as young as on the day it was painted, whereas Dorian will slowly age, losing his youth and looks to time. Dorian frets over this and says that he would give anything if only his portrait would age instead of him.Weeks later, after an unfortunate scene with his fianc&eacute;e, Dorian notices a subtle change to his portrait, a certain cruel turn of the lips. As the days pass, he notices more changes and begins to realize that he can commit every vice and cruelty imaginable without any harm coming to him. His portrait will bear the brunt of his adventures. But at what price? As the years pass, he begins to wonder about the state of his very soul and if he can change, perhaps bring the portrait back to its original beauty.This is a great novel, dealing for the most part with man's quest for eternal youth. Who wouldn't want to stay young forever? We go through fad diets, gyms, botox, plastic surgery -- all in the name of trying to remain healthy and youthful. Dorian is given a unique opportunity, the consequences of which show him the havoc that all the vices and cruel acts have upon his soul (or his conscience). We also get to see how getting what you wish for doesn't always turn out the way you thought it would.It's a well-written story, full of unique characters. The majority of the male characters seem to have no problem whatsoever having intimate relationships with other men. By his actions, Basil appears to be in love with Dorian. Dorian, in turn, is infatuated with Lord Henry, even thought both of them do have relationships with women (for Dorian, a fianc&eacute;e; for Lord Henry, a wife). There's even a bit of jealousy on the part of Lord Henry's wife when she finally meets the man who's been monopolizing her husband's time.At times, though, it does move slowly due to long passages discussing the place of art in society and philosphizing about the quest for youth and beauty. In these passages the text seems to turn more into a lecture rather than a novel. That, however, does not take away from the enjoyment of the novel."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"While Oscar Wilde's central theme of corruption initially captures the readers attention, the character development does not help to hold the reader's attention for a long period of time. Dorian Gray, the central character, has the potential to be a very romantic and dumbfounding character, but because Wilde does not go into great character development, he seems almost more like the painting that comes to represent him ... dimensionless. The point of the novel is to point out how changed Dorian becomes over the years and how he goes from being the epitome of beauty to someone that is hardly recognized as the person he once was. However, in order to feel this transformation, the reader would need to feel as if he or she knew the original Dorian Gray. Because the beginning of the novel does not describe him enough, the full effect of Dorian's startling transformation is unable to be fully comprehended.In addition, although the theme of outer beauty coupled with inner corruption is a strong one, this book seems more like one that should be read in a class and discussed in groups. It is not a novel that is easy-reading for pleasure. The style of writing makes it hard to breeze through the book, although on the positive the book brings about much self-contemplation and is very thought provoking. The reader cannot put it down because the whole novel leads to the very disturbing, although somewhat predictable, ending.In general, it is a book that should be read and will be enjoyed by many. The reader can relate to the feelings felt by the main characters and the themes in the book are ones that can be witnessed in real life. The general faults of the novel are eventually outweighed by the suspense and the intrigue as the painting of Dorian Gray, once a masterpiece, becomes more defiled with each horrible act committed by Dorian."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Basil's friend Lord Henry influences Dorian Gray. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actor who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about.

Moreover, with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. In addition, we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made.

I was skeptical that it could be bad, because I'm very familiar with the wit of Wilde. As far as gothic novels go, this book ranks high in the Victorian era. Looking back from a historical perspective, I can see why the critics of the time disliked it. But from today's perspective, it is nothing short of brilliant. Wilde weaves a story like few authors could ever dream of doing, and of course his wit is played out beautifully in this book as well. full of quips and quirks, this book is a must read for anybody who has a love of sharp, intelligent writing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an entertaining, short novel, with a very honest moral to it. A friend of Dorian Gray, Basil Hayward, paints a picture of Dorian which the painting's subject falls in love with. Dorian wishes that he could remain as beautiful as the picture and that the picture may take on the effects of human aging in his stead. In Wilde's creative twist, Dorian's wish comes true, although this only becomes evident to him as his life becomes increasingly chaotic. As the novel progresses, Dorian, in obsessive love with himself, fights to keep his sanity as the burden of his stress, sins, and guilt, are transfered to the picture which increasingly haunts him.Wilde's writing is colorful and his characters' emotions realistic. This novel is a cutting, yet accurate, observation of human nature in general, especially in our modern, self-glorifying societies. Wilde makes the perfect critique of our selfishness and vanity when Dorian Gray says: \\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.\\" For many in our TV and Hollywood crazed world, this statement is not troublesome but rather, a personal mantra."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I had really high expectations for this novel, which were not fulfilled. The novel consists of mostly &quot;mindless&quot; dialogue and the true story does not really occur until the book is half over. then the story picks up pace until Dorian's descriptions of a book (totally unrelated to the rest of the novel) drag on. Once that portion of the book concludes, the end briskly approaches. Overall, I think I was expecting a more emotional response to this, which never occured."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a fine piece of literature- a tale of excess, of corruption, of decay and of facades.Basil Hallward, an artist, paints a picture of Dorian Gary, a handsome and vain young man, whom the artist is besotted with. Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\\"; \\" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\\"; \\"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\\" ; \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\" ; \\" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\\" And \\" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This story about a man whose wish for eternal youth comes true through a portrait of himself delves into numerous philosophical nether regions. Set in upscale 19th century London, The Picture of Dorian Gray deals with such topics as truth, death, and most especially beauty.Dorian Gray's portrait ages while he remains his youthful self. Gray uses this to his advantage (let's be honest, who wouldn't?). Gray breaks hearts, corrupts others, and avails himself of numerous vices...most notably opium. Gray also takes advantage of his youth by learning new things...music and gemology come to mind. But Gray's self-enhancement does not make up for the copious sins he commits, both large and small...and even though his face does not bely his crimes, the portrait's face does.Wilde's play on eternal youth was almost certainly novel for the time. These days the concept has been played out time again. But I do not begrudge Wilde for this...in his time, he was an innovator.Four major things irked me about this book:First, the prose is overly flowery. I don't read many books written in the 19th century...maybe most of the books were written like this. Second, Wilde seems to use this book as a platform to give us his take on philosophical issues large and small. True, most good works of fiction are a reflection of the society in which the author lives, but Wilde is NOT subtle about giving us numerous opinions on art, love, life, beauty, etc. I think he could have been a bit more subtle doing this. Third most of characters seemed overly naive. Granted, this story is supposed to be set in a time and place where the rich did not concern themselves with trivial matters. Nonetheless...so much was going on under the characters' noses! Even, Henry Wotton -- Gray's longtime friend -- seems to come down with a bout of extreme naivete toward the end of the book. Somehow, this made the characters seem shallower than they otherwise might have been. And my final gripe kind of ties in with the characters' overall naivete. From the time that Dorian Gray is granted eternal youth by whatever powers that be, to the end of the book, nearly two decades elapse. There is only one, very minor, mention of Gray's youthful looks toward the end of the book. Didn't anyone notice that this guy has, supposedly, aged nearly twenty years and yet still appears as youthful as ever? Come on, even these days with plastic surgery and $100+ cosmetic cream, a 40 year old doesn't look half his age. Why did only Gray's closest friend only offhandedly mention this toward the end of the book? Surely someone else must have noticed?Wilde's concept had a lot of potential, and it certainly does make one ponder life's intangible mysteries, but Wilde spent to much time proselytizing his 19th century philosophy for this book to really stand out. This book is only recommended to those who enjoy Wilde's other works."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I do not know words to describe the way I feel about this book. The first time, with the exception of one chapter, I could not put it down. I have been hooked on Oscar Wilde since. I researched the period and wrote a term paper on this book alone, and after that, when I still was not satisfied, bought his complete works, a book of quotations, and a book about his plays. I only wish by byeing these books I could understand and be swallowed into the beauty of his wisdom. I can sometimes be an obsessive person, and I suppose this is how my review sounds at this point, but don't let your opinion of me detract you from interest in this book.It's worth giving a try...you may become hooked too (by the way for Wilde fans..the movie WILDE is a great window into his life). This book is written with beauty and the words flow like poetry...warning though...people with closed minds towards homosexuality should think of choosing a different book. One of the most descriptive and hiddenly believable parts of this book is the secret feelings Lord Henry has for Dorean. I don't want to misinterpret the book, but i believe Lord Henry's feelings to be more than fatherly...great excelent story!! my favorite book!! what more can be said???-SArah"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is just a warning to prospective kindle customers - the kindle version of this book is not \\"lavishly illustrated\\" which is not so surprising in a digital edition. But what was more surprising to me, Nicholas Frankel's extensive notes, which run alongside the text and which exceed the actual length of the novel itself, are not included. In fact, both the paperback and kindle editions are 'reader's editions'. Yes, there are two rich scholarly introductions, replete with notes, and some three pages of notes to the actual text (which are also included in the hardback) , but the \\"annotations\\" which have excited so much comment from reviewers are in fact missing from the kindle edition. There was no warning from Amazon that the kindle edition omits the textual notes that run side by side with the text in the hardback. However, when I pointed this out to Amazon, 'they' very generously offered me a certificate for the amount of the book on my next purchase. So that was very nice.In fact Stonewall Riot Press has a complete, uncensored \\"reader's\\" edition on Amazon for 9.19. The editor himself, JOHN MCARTHUR, praises Nicholas Frankel's annotations:\\"I was already at work on my edition of the text when I received my copy of Nicholas Frankel's P-book edition published in 2011 by Harvard University Press. Though I was somewhat dismayed at having been scooped, I could only admire the quality and thoroughness of Professor Frankel's scholarship. His notes, which run alongside the text, exceed it in length, and he also provides lavish illustrations and other resources. I heartily recommend this edition for readers seeking a scholarly edition for research purposes.

I am in LOVE with this story. The way Wilde writes is fabulous- I am an increasingly voracious reader of the classics, and Wilde's writing style is exactly what I like. It is written in the eloquent verbage of the time, but not so much so that I find it stifling and hard to get through ( I am currently reading an Emily Bronte, and am having this problem). The story itself is charming and devious, with an ending that you expect and yet are shocked by. All in all, I am currently parousing more Oscar Wilde books to add to my collection."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a review of the Kindle formatting of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\" I really enjoyed the story itself, but the Kindle layout could really use some work. Like a lot of free public domain ebooks, this one isn't exactly user-friendly. The lack of a title page doesn't bother me, but this book is also missing a table of contents. If you're reading this for a class or a reading group, that missing table of contents might be a deal breaker. Additionally, while you can always refer to line numbers, this book lacks pagination. Again: I realize this isn't something that's going to bother everyone, but if you need to refer to page numbers in an essay, you might be in trouble if you use this copy.If you're like me and you're interested in reading this book just for fun, page numbers and a table of contents probably don't matter much to you. However, I think everyone can agree that things like page breaks and proper spacing between chapters vastly improve one's reading experience. That's the real rub: There are none. Paragraphs sit immediately atop one another like a great wall of text. Chapters receive the same treatment and are only demarcated by plain text- no bolding, no new section, nothing. The whole effect is not only visually unappealing, but just plain annoying.So the layout of this Kindle edition isn't great, but this book isn't all bad. For one thing, it's free. You get what you pay for formatting-wise, but it's a fantastic story and it's yours forever at absolutely no cost. Plus- and this is also big- this ebook isn't riddled with spelling errors and typos like a lot of the other public domain books available on the Kindle. In sum, while the formatting is annoying, the book is still totally readable."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a novel by Oscar Wilde. The soft cover is 176 pages in length.Maybe one of Wildes' most famous works. An increasingly macabre tale set in London, England during the 19th century.Most are familiar with the plot behind this book...but some *SPOILERS* ahead for those that don't want to know.A most handsome young man has a most lifelike portrait done of himself by a up and coming young London painter. In his youthful exuberance over the detail and beauty of the work, he casually remarks that he'd give his soul to remain young and beautiful, like in the painting, forever.His curse is that he stays young while his friends age and the face and body in the portrait grows old through the years. But the portrait does more than just grow old, it reflects every bad or evil thing he's done (using his beautiful looks to gain unfair advantage); resulting in a framed visage that becomes more grotesque and ugly with every new sin he commits.*END SPOILERS*Beautifully written, with great descriptive detail (maybe at times, a little too much). Wilde conveys a tense atmosphere filled with forebodling and apprehension as he gets into the second half of his extraordinary novel.Conclusion:A short, brilliant work.

Although a beatiful young man, Dorian finds that his debauchery and sin are not reflected by the state of his own body, but by the image cast in a painting. As Dorian continues his decline in morals, an interesting question arises. Kind of a \\"which came first, the chicken or the egg\\" type of thing. Was his soul corrupted by his lack of consequences for his mistakes? Or did the freedom merely let him unleash the evil that already poisoned his soul?"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Though this book was well written, Oscar Wilde fails in his attempt to glorify aestheticism, and in fact condemns it, and thus condemns himself. It was hardly surprising that following the publication of this book, the authorities sought to have him arrested for homosexuality. If aestheticism is embodied by Lord Henry, Henry is a despicable character, whose philosophies sound not only juvenile and sophistic, but ignorant due to his lack of practicing what he preached. He didn't act out his hedonistic, immoral theories, only Dorian behaved that way, and when doing so brought torment, shame, and guilt upon himself. And to preface the book with &quot;All art is quite useless&quot;? That makes no sense, since the picture was the most useful, significant, meaningful thing in life. Was Wilde's goal to declare his own dear philosophies completely worthless? If so, he succeeded, but I am much more impressed by someone who sets out to justify his philosophies rather than someone who sets out to debunk them."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I love the classics and somehow this one escaped my attention until now. I wish only that it hadescaped my attention forever. This rambling book of boring, sexually unstable rich people with nothing better to dowith their lives than look at pretty Dorian (because, Dorian is very pretty), and insult the commoners who have no rank or class,is tedious, boring and a complete waste of time.Dorian has his portrait painted while the painter and another man oogle him and tell him how pretty he is.The painter said his life was not complete until pretty Dorian came to sit for him.Dorian is very pretty..Dorian wishes he could stay young and pretty and that the painting would age instead of him.,,.. because he's young and prettyand men and women alike tell him how pretty he is.Dorian gets his wish and then the book ignores all his issues and goes off into the prose land of mushrooms.We next see Dorian decades later, the painting is hideous but Dorian is pretty. All his sins have left him pretty and the painting ugly.What happened in that time span is not told.Dorian is pretty.There is zero character developement and by the end I was just hoping everyone character in the book would die.Even Dorian, who is very pretty. We do not not know him, or the painter and have only a glimpse of the life of thethird main character in the book. He thinks Dorian is pretty too.*****************Spoiler Alert*****************I guessed the end about 1/3rd of the way through, I only missed that I figured Dorian (he, who is pretty) would torch the painting insteadof stabbing it.*****************End Spoiler Alert*****************I'm sure all the world is aflutter because of the daring topics discussed, or not discussed as it wasn't in this book. For its time period, I guessit would be shocking. Dorian, however, is still very pretty and that remains regardless of when this book was written.So, I hear this is only an edited version and somewhere out there is the REAL version, and it is oh so much better, but, nothing could savethis travesty of words. I wasted enough time with these pathetic characters (and author) although I think Dorian is still very pretty according to everyone.I'm only glad I read it on my Kindle so a tree didn't die in printing this boring book.

While full of wonderful quotes that sound great over a dinner discussion, a noteworthy tale this is not. Wilde seems far more interested in catologing lists of inane objects and people than he is of entertaining or interesting the reader. Wilde only glosses over Gray's sinful actions letting us know sparse details about his supposed debauchery but never exposing the reader to them...So a woman kills herself over being jilted, so he uses opium, so he goes to prostitutes, so he is bisexual...Who cares?? Such a shallow character (and this book is filled with shallow, undeveloped characters) is impossible to care one way or another about...So when the end of the book comes to its obvious conclusion as a reader I simply shut the book, pondered what all the fuss and bother has been about and put the book on Ebay as its not worth taking up space on my bookshelf..."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"sdfj dsljf asdfjksl sadf lsdjf al asdl sjdsl flasdf fl. fsdjls,..f lf fdjfdsl. dsdfjs.. eoweoiwiew wwed vfrd vmri riejkfn fkjei fjf"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Okay when I bought this book I was leery because I thought it would be too scary.

I found myself constantly amazed that someone from Wilde's time could have had such clarity of thought on certain topics. I've never seen the movie made from this but I saw some movie posters. So it was hard taking the horror look and putting that in this book. It is more of a twisted coming of age story and not even one that gets too deep. Lord Henry has deeper moments of speech then Dorian. And as shocking as they said this book would be...I read nothing shocking. I thought maybe the unedited version would actually have a sex scene in it lol but they don't even mention a naughty body part lol. Nothing ever gets remotely sexual. I mean several characters are definitely gay but not in a shocking way. More like Jack McFarlan on Will and Grace.

When I watched that movie I had no idea who the character of Dorian Gray was. The movie wasn't that good, but I was still interested in that character. When I saw The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde, I decided I wanted to learn more about that character.This book was not easy to read at all. It wasn't because of the language that it was written in, which did add to its difficulty. The part that bothered me the most about this book, other than its length, was the horrible lack of flow. I got the main idea of the book, I understood most of why certain parts of the book were there, but there were so many parts that did not add to the plot that for many pages at a time you would read about things like a jewel collection, book collection or whatever else fancied Dorian Gray at the time. It was so hard to finish this book because there were so many times that I couldn't grasp why I was reading what I was reading. There were so many times that Dorian or his friend Harry would go into these monologues for absolutely no reason at all.There were a few redeeming qualities to this book, but unfortunately they did nothing to help me enjoy it at all. The one thing I did like was the basic premise of the book. Dorian Gray could not age and he was beautiful so he could do whatever he wanted to. His lack of need to preserve his soul led him down the path of evil. His friend guided him down that path as well. The whole time I was reading this book I was thinking about Harry as the devil. He would plant thoughts into the brain of Dorian that led him further and further down his path of destruction.The book was a let down and I hope that the next classic fiction book I choose is a good one.If you like my review and want to read more of them I have a blog chronicaling my first year with my Kindle. I would love your suggestions and comments. Check out my profile for the website."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"While trying to start some kind of an aesthetic as well as a moral revolution, The Picture of Dorian Gray instead became a disappointment in the world of literature. I began reading this book upon the premise that it would contain fascinating worldviews, as well as a gripping plot. Rather, the book fell flat on its face. Wilde reflected his views of the importance of art, the pitfalls of beauty, and the horror of aging in this novel, and though it wasn't the views that were a problem, it was how they all contradicted one another. The author claimed, \\"all art is useless\\" in the preface of the novel, yet eventually it is art itself that becomes the bane of Dorian Gray's existence.The novel follows a young, beautiful young man, Dorian Gray, along with two of his friends, Basil, who paints a stunning picture of Dorian, and Harry, who leads Dorian into a world of lies, sin and betrayal. Though it starts off interestingly enough, the novel drags after the 50th page, and it only gets worse and worse until the very end. It is meant to shock its readers, with tales of murder and drugs, yet the writing isn't sophisticated enough to support these statements. The downward spiral of Dorian Gray's life is deserved, and the novel fails to leave the reader with a strong residual message. To its credit, however, the original premise was interesting, and the decay of Dorian Gray's existence and how he views himself makes for a decent plot.I will not bother to go into the details of the novel, for example the sexism and the portrayal of women in the book, and how it is questionable whether the characters are more in love with women, the idea of women, each other (yes, they are all male), or themselves. The homosexuality in the novel did not bother me, though the inaccurate portrayal of women did.If you are interested in reading about art, corruption or murder in the late 19th century in England, please, spare yourself the torture of reading Dorian Gray, though it is only a little over 200 pages."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The picture of Dorian wasn't that great of a novel. The subjects in this moral fable are very dramatic but go exceedingly too far. Tragedy stalks every crack and turn of it. It ends in a tragedy. In the beginning, it is rather happy, but right after the actress and lover commits suicide it goes completely. I do not doubt Wilde's famed wit but, he could have written something more happy than this depressing novel. The descriptions are very well done(especially in the beginning.) Thus, he should used his wit and humor for a more enjoyable and felicatous novel."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"this book was really really twisted, our sophmore class had to read it for school, and almost everyone hated it"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"One of the great joys of fiction is the positive encouragement to discard the intentions of the author and draw out individual meaning from its pages. This positive fruition is exemplified quite extraordinarily by Oscar Wilde in \`The Picture of Dorian Gray', as he weaves a tale of youth, corruption and disregarding hedonism.The protagonist of the story is the youthful and worldly-naive Dorian Gray who, through enticement by his mentor, pledges himself to eternal youth. His wish is sanctioned and the ravishes of age are transferred onto a portrait. Knowing that his appearance will remain forever innocent, he embarks on a pursuit of reckless pleasures, spiralling further into iniquity yet remaining unchanged, whilst his picture grows grotesquely disfigured...The novel was--and to an extent, still is--controversial due to the unsubtle suggestions of homoeroticism. Personally, I don't see the fuss. Partially for obvious reasons, but I also remain unconvinced that it is presented in such a way to have ever been an encouragement for others to embrace such a 'lifestyle'. Rather, it would appear that Dorian's sexual exploits with the same gender is a method to achieving his goal of ecstatic delectation; the goal which, in the end, is his destruction. But, of course, considering Wilde's own sexual practices, one could read it as a defence of those with same-sex attractions.Ultimately, I understood this novel to be a warning against unchecked desire and the pursuit of pleasure without limits; certainly an apt lesson for our own age."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book was truly one of the jewels filled with beauty that will never fade with time.

They are very interesting to read, and you may find yourself agreeing with the majority of what he says, as I did.Make sure not to skip over the preface. It is also quite interesting.

Dorian Gray is captivating, though the actual storyline is not intricate. The descriptions are extraordinary and left me wondering why he hadn't written more novels? Very short, very effective. It is inconcievable to think that Wilde was denounced for this book being immoral as it is really quite moral, considering the consequences of Dorian's behaviour. (He once commented that there never was an immoral or moral book, simply badly written or well-written) For insight into Oscar Wilde's very colourful life, pick up a copy of Richard Elmann's biography; it is not a happy read but very readable nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was known for his outrageous takes on life (in terms of aesthetics, superficiality, beauty and the like). This book seems to both explore and satirise them. It is about the decadence and superficial pursuits of Dorian Gray, who is \\"ruined\\" by Lord Henry Wotton who teaches him that beauty and youth are the only true values. When Dorian's friend Basil paints a portrait of him, Dorian exclaims that he wished the portrait got old instead of him.This comes true and under further tutelage of Lord Henry, Dorian lives a life of debauchery, hedonism and the like while the portrait bears his age and sin, becoming more malformed with each act. The book is full of philosophical digressions on sin, beauty and indulgence and its most fabulous aspect is the fact that it is (or as least I think) both an ode to hedonism and an allegory against it all in one, all perfectly blended, all achieved through the medium of the witty writing of Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"No one really impresses me when it comes to Literature. Oscar Wilde, Sylvia Plath, Shakespeare, those are the great people of literature amongst thousand others.Dorian Gray is an amazing fascinating book. I finished the book in a day, it just trapped me into the plot and I couldn't sleep without knowing what would happen the next, the next, the next page. I think a good book does that to its reader.The language is very fanciful and the usage of profound words help me a lot to express my words too. it's quite poetic, and for the young readers like me, i think we like how cynical Lord Henry was, and how submissive Basil seemed to appear as.

While years pass by, the portrait starts to reflect the man's sins and wrinkles while he remains as young as it was at that moment.

Until one day, he cannot stand it anymore..."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Back in a world where vanity is a good trait to have and beauty is worshipped. This is a time where the most important thing is preserving a good appearance. Sin is thought of as merely an adventure and the past is only a forgotten bother. The life of Dorian Gray is a race to see who will win his young mind and form it into his being. A most handsome boy, he never had much opinion and was content just to sit and be painted. Basil Hallward loves him for his features. Basil also was in love with the inspiration he felt whenever he was painting Dorian or whenever Dorian was near. Basil thought of finding beauty and living only through art, but none of this was appealing to the impressionable Dorian Gray.Upon meeting Dorian Gray, Lord Henry Wotton becomes completely intrigued. A man who loves nothing more than observing the behavior of human beings and implanting his ideas into anyone who will listen is quite a companion. Where many do not agree with his words, Dorian couldn't agree more with him. As days and years pass, Dorian is shaped into the perfect being that Lord Henry has only begun to imagine.Where there is beauty, worship, and incorrect influence there is flaw. There is hatred, there is jealousy, and there is corruption. Dorian has the strong belief that everyone will love him and he will forever be preserved the angel of time. To himself he is everything, but to everyone he is bad luck. His ideals, taken from Lord Henry, seep into the minds of others and cause them to fall. Precisely because of these beliefs he would never understand he was wrong.With the horror of the ego and the love of oneself there is no clear path again to the light. This is Dorian's story, his desperation, his trials, his losses, this, good people, is his soul.Lovers of philosophy and gothic idealism will find nothing to hate in The Picture of Dorian Gray. I am still baffled by many of the perspectives created and endorsed by Lord Henry. Though there are undoubtedly sections that could put a hyper person to sleep, this book is filled with so much philosophy and plot twists that it is worth the read despite the at times slow plot. Broaden your mind and reflect on your morality. It is time to rediscover your path."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a fine piece of literature- a tale of excess, of corruption, of decay and of facades.Basil Hallward, an artist, paints a picture of Dorian Gary, a handsome and vain young man, whom the artist is besotted with. Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\\"; \\" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\\"; \\"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\\" ; \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\" ; \\" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\\" And \\" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I got this just to read Dorian Gray, and read the whole thing.

The depth and level of realism that Wilde is able to infuse into the characters is almost unbelievable. Addtionally, I am so enamored by this book because of the timelessness of the theme of societal pretense. This is a classic that one should truly make time to read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The quickest way to sum up this book in one word is \\"wow.\\" I will admit that for awhile I didn't find the book 5-star worthy, but I soon found myself thoroughly engrossed. Wilde has written this story like a symphony in four movements with an overture, ballad, climax, and finale. The prose is absolutely lyrical.Beauty is a dominant theme. Wilde excessively alludes to Greek Gods and the perfection of Adonis. The concept of beauty is also represented in the idea of man vs. himself, or better yet as beauty vs. immortality. Dorian wrestles constantly with his inner self and with the immortality his beauty presents to him. But with his beauty comes sins and pleasure that have no effect on him because their consequences marr his self portrait. Dorian uses his beauty to sin which ultimately leads to violence; his emotions often confuse his sins with pleasure.A secondary theme is the absence of reality. In the Importance of Being Earnest, Wilde echoes a similar line as that from Dorian. He writes that the two most attractive types of people are those who know nothing at all or absolutely everything. Three key characters represent varying degrees of reality, as well as Wilde's description of attractive people. Dorian knows nothing and Lord Henry knows absolutely everything, but Basil is the medium ground between the two that represents reality. Basil is the only one who sees/acknowledges things for what they truly are, but he is shunned by others who don't want to see reality. Characters like Dorian and Lord Henry have the idea that to see reality is to be scared of life. It is bad to be a spectator to one's own life. Dorian even admits that \\"He felt that the secret of the whole thing was not to realise the situation.\\" If he didn't acknowledge it, it simply did not exist.Lastly is the theme of homosexuality. Wilde does not mention any specifics of homosexual relationships, but what one has to read between the lines jumps off the page with equal magnitude of the written text.All in all, this book is excellent. Read this book, you will be glad you did!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" by Oscar Wilde is yet another triumph for this talented author. The dark tale of a young man who unknowingly sells his soul in order to stay forever young is wittily brought across through three main characters, each resembling a different part of Wilde himself.Dorian, the main character, represents what Wilde himself said he would like to be, yet Dorian also clearly resembles part of Wilde: the part that was once young and innocent before becoming corrupted by the world he lived in.Henry Wooton, the man responsible for the corruption of Dorian Gray, is the side of Oscar Wilde that the world thought was the true Wilde: carefree and conceited, caring nothing for other people, yet extremely witty. This is also Wilde, as far as the witty and carefree parts go. Only when Henry displays his rare moments of care for other people does this character seem like Wilde.Basil, the man who paints the infamous picture of Dorian, is the character who Wilde found himself to be the most like. Quiet and withdrawn, Basil is a caring man with a good consience who completely adores Dorian. Out of the entire novel, Basil is one of the few truly good people.This novel does, however, have it's shortcomings. Lord Henry Wooton's wife is introduced in a scene and given an extremely interesting description. She is a nervous woman who laughs often and also displays the wit that Wilde was so famous for. This description, however, makes one think that she will be extremely important later, when in truth, she never shows up again (though she is mentioned once by Henry). There is also a chapter that delves a little too deeply into the obsessions that Dorian went through, going into long run-on sentances and too-long descriptions.Overall, this is an extremely well-written novel that portrays what is wrong with society today through the views of the characters and the actions they take. Though it may not be the easiest read for today's society (many of whom are as corrupt as the characters in the book), it is one well worth reading, if only for a new outlook on life."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" - Oscar Wilde\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an excellent novel about the degradation of the human soul. The novel focuses around the handsome Dorian Gray and his interactions with the artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait and Lord Henry, who becomes the corrupting influence on Dorian's soul and Dorian's iinteractions with the British aristocracy. Dorian is compared to Narcissus, who was so obsessed with his own beauty, that it swallowed him whole. Dorian seals his fate with one wish; upon viewing his portrait, he wonders if it would be possible for his portrait to show the signs of aging, in exchange for his mortal beauty. Throughout the novel, we see Dorian's decent into total self - absorbtion and evil all of which culminates in an ending that is predictable but still entertaining none the less.Just a quick side note, there is some great social commentary running throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" specifically Wilde's commentary on the stiff, British aristocracy of the late 19th century, absurd views regarding women, who are painted by Gray as blubbering idiots (a sign of the times) and last but not least, the underlying homosexual undertones present between Dorian, Basil and Lord Henry are fascinating to deconstruct.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was my first introduction to Oscar Wilde and after reading the novel, I was hooked. I would like to return to the quote above, about art mirroring the soul of the spectator, after reading this novel, you will have a sense of how trully frightening that notion is."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"C.S. Lewis wrote that pride is the greatest sin. It is the doorway to all other kinds of evil. Though this was certainly not what Oscar Wilde was writing about, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a perfect illustration of this. The protagonist's pride causes him to go to horrible lengths. In the end it causes everyone around him (and eventually himself) great pain. I have read Wilde's works only a couple of times since being introduced to them in high school. Each time I do, I remember how much I like him as an author. This time, I was once again reminded how masterful Wilde was as a writer. His keen wit and incisive humor is refreshing. His prose is clean and unlabored. I don't know why I haven't read his stuff more often. I certainly will now."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This story is positively a masterpiece. Dorian Gray is a young boy at first, whose beauty is so entirely dazzling that Mr. Basil Hallward, an artist, becomes utterly obsessed with the portrait he is painting of Dorian. Feeling certain he has not only achieved his best artistic work yet, he confesses shamefully that he has put so much of himself into the portrait that were it ever displayed publicly, the world would glimpse his soul. In short, Basil is in love with the image of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry Wotten befriends Dorian, much to the chagrin of Basil, who feels a near homosexual jealousy. When Basil presents the finished portrait to Dorian, Dorian makes a whimsical wish \\" If it were only the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old! For that - for that - I would give everything!\\"From that moment on, Dorian's life changes. Lord Henry becomes his mentor of sorts, and a finer fictional character I have yet to meet. Indeed, Lord Henry has a profound influence on young Dorian, and his philosophies will hypnotize you, as they often do Dorian Gray. The portrait takes on sinister and looming proportions, and eventually Dorian must face the consequences of that one whimsical wish, and fight the ultimate battle - for his own soul. An amazingly fabulous book you absolutely MUST read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When Wilde landed in America in 1882 for a lecture tour, he was asked if he had anything to declare. He responded, &quot;Only my genius.&quot; Okay now, an attitude like that didn't exactly make me want to read any of his works for a long time. Finally, I decided to try The Picture of Dorian Grey, and I found that it really was a work of genius.The novel is the story of Dorian Grey who at the beginning of the novel has his portrait painted by Basil Hallward. The picture turns out to be remarkable, and Grey becomes jealous because the picture will remain young and beautiful while he will age. He expresses a wish that the picture would age instead of himself. To his delight, his wish becomes true, and believing himself to be immortal, he embarks on a path of of hedonism. He always searches for pleasure above happiness, and above all things he loves beauty. Along the way, the portrait chronicles the total moral decay of Dorian Grey.The are a lot of interpretations to this novel. My favorite is to read it as a moral tale warning of the consequences of leading a life of hedonism. It could almost be read as &quot;The Picture of Oscar Wilde&quot; as he seems to be criticizing his own lifestyle. This is probably also the most ironic reading of it since Wilde continued after the novel to preach aestheticism. But anyway, taken within itself, the novel is marvelous. The prose is well-polished. The pacing is elegant and the plot is always interesting. The points is makes are important. The Picture of Dorian Grey deserves its classic status, and Oscar Wilde actually was a bit of a genius."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'd heard a lot about Wilde when I started this book, but this was the first of his works that I'd ever read. I was half-way expecting long, incomprehensible philosophical discussions, impossible to decipher passages...my stereotype of 19th century literature. But when I was through the first chapter, I had a wake-up call. &quot;Wow,&quot; I thought, &quot;this is really GOOD!&quot; I became addicted, and sped through the rest of the book. It is engrossing, absorbing, entertaining, and not the least bit boring. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This novel provides a fascinating story on a young man's desire to keep his appearance while having his age expressed and progressed in a portrait of himself. The story not only has a good plot, it has a strong philosophical foundation which is characterized through numerous epigrams. Among the characters, Dorian Gray and Lord Henry present various explanations throughout life. I have read this book as an assignment for preparation toward the AP [Advance Placement] test in English Literature and enjoyed it. I would recommend this book to anyone who, not only would like to prepare for an AP test in English, but to those who appreciate philosophy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"As Wilde's only novel, it does have it's slow spots. However, the genius of the writing is in the dialogue (as is generally true of Wilde). The depth of the ideas discussed is often overlooked by the simple way in which they are presented.Dorian's example forces us to examine our own lives and face the unmistakable truth: the choices we make everyday determine the state of our souls."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's novel takes us through the dangers and temptations of hedonism. It is a fantastic psychological adventure."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a perfect example of why Speculative Fiction exists. To allow us to see deeper into the human soul than we could otherwise. Although this book was short, it took me a good week to read. I kept having to put it down after a chapter or two so I could read something else. Every word seemed to suck me in while not making me want to read another sentence at the same time. I guess the fact that I was also reading Milton's Paradise Lost at the same time as Dorian Gray doesn't help cut down the long internal debates Dorian Gray forced into my skull. Either way, this novel is a must read for anyone who has even thought that self examination is a part of what it means to be alive. But beware. This book packs a punch."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"As one of the first books I read on my Kindle, this one will always be a little special for me. The writing style took more than just a little getting used to, but overall it is a classic tale that was a lot of fun to read. Not sure I'll do much more Oscar Wilde, but I'm glad to have read this one."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The main thing I have to say about Dorian Gray is--if you haven't read it, do so. Five out of five stars! It's depressing that authors no longer write like this, where there's an amazing revelation or a great quote every couple of pages. I refuse to say anything about the plot, because I don't need to. The plot isn't really what matters in this novel--the insights do. This one is definitely going on my favorites shelf!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I downloaded this as a Kindle freebie based on the other reviews, and found it to be a good read. Although the ending was a little predictable, I enjoyed the book overall and have recommended it to several friends. I received my Kindle as a Christmas gift and didn't even realize there were freebie books to be downloaded. I'm even more pleased with the quality of the freebies available."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Beautiful book. I love the fabric cover. There is also a ribbon book marker in each of these books in a coordinating color!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Perhaps I'm jaded by modern science fiction conventions (ala The Twilight Zone), but I felt Dorian Gray ended predictably. Given a magical portrait that protects the subject from the consequences of immorality, Rod Sterling would have ended it the same way.Still reading through a contemporary lens, Dorian Gray provides rich imagery of life in the 19th century. Wilde disadvantages this strength of the novel by exhaustively listing image after image while Dorian immerses himself in sensory experience. These passages read like mildly interesting dictionary entries.Overall, the pithy dialogue, imagery and wonderfully gothic story wins out and Grey entertains."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Initially heavy on witty dialogue and light on plot, but it gets there in the second half and is a clever story. You can't flick between chapters as you can with other Kindle publications."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Those poignant words spoken by the devil (Al Pacino) in The Devil's Advocate come to mind when talking about Dorian Gray. As a young, beautiful and conceited man, Dorian finds comfort in the company of Lord Henry, a morally corrupt aristocrat in Victorian England. Already teetering on the verge of chronic narcissism, Dorian is pushed off the edge into the abyss of eternal damnation by Henry's seductive, imaginative, and in the end, destructive speech.This classic, cautionary tale of the woes of youth has vanity at its core. Dorian, like all of us, is afraid of becoming irrelevant and unloved as a consequence of old age. Only in his case, he let his paranoia coupled with bad influence (Lord Henry) devour him. The story isn't unique in the sense that it happens everyday in the form of inconsequential lives consumed by gyms, beauty salons and drugs, chasing reluctant love and evasive youth.If you haven't read this classic in school, I highly recommend you do now. Lord Henry's lines, though evil, are very entertaining and almost too poetic. No man I know has a wit and sharp tongue like Lord Henry, but again, he is not a man. He is the devil's incarnate."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"That famous quote from Shakespeare's Hamlet certainly applies to Dorian Gray. And Lord Henry Wotton couldn't help using this quote, much like he couldn't help baiting Dorian Gray. Lord Henry admires the man in Basil Hallward's new portrait so much that he has got to meet him. Is he as beautiful in real life as he is in the painting? Is he ever! He is an Adonis, a young man as pure on the inside as he is on the outside. No wonder Hallward is obsessed with him! So begins Lord Henry's attempts to corrupt the young man. In no uncertain terms, he tells Dorian Gray that \\"beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.\\" He also goes on to tell him that his wonderful youth and good looks are his best qualities, too bad someday they will fade. Dorian Gray is upset. His portrait will remain young and beautiful forever, whereas he will age and lose with his physical beauty. If only it were the other way around...That is all I'll share in terms of plot. You have got to read this magnificent novel to know the rest. The Picture of Dorian Gray, first published in 1890, is one of the most disturbing works of fiction I have ever read. No wonder it is so popular! It is thought provoking from beginning to end. Dorian is a cross between Narcissus and Faust -- his vanity is obvious from the very start, and Lord Henry is depicted as a devil, whereas Hallward is the angel who tries to maintain Dorian's innocence. Yes, as it has often been observed, the novel does have some not-so-concealed references to homosexuality. The aforementioned theme, mainly noticeable in Hallward, is, in the words of Marianne Dashwood in Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, \\"implied but never declared.\\" There was no need for Wilde to say it in so many words, but he dropped hints here and there, like the rumors that Hallward moved to San Francisco. I doubt he would have been able to be more inconspicuous in his time. This novel could cover long hours of discussion. There are so many themes and symbolism and magic realism and foreshadowing here, and Lord Henry's crude but honest musings and observations are fascinating. He is definitely the most interesting character in the book. This is my first time reading this book. I'd wanted to read it since I read Amanda Filipacchi's Nude Men ten years ago. Why it took me so long to give it a whirl I will never know. Better late than never, I guess. And if you haven't read it, well, need I suggest that you do? You won't regret it. This is nineteenth century literature at its finest."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. It's a story of Dorian Gray's journey through life. There's a great quote, which really is the theme for the entire book...\\"what does it profit a man if he gain the world and lose his own soul?\\" The pleasures and sins Dorian Gray enjoys in life are conveyed onto his portrait. Ultimately, his portrait ages and warps with each transgression that tarnishes his soul.Wilde has some great narratives and descriptions in the book. His writing style immersed me in the book. Very moving. I can truly see why it's a classic and wish I had read it sooner."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Besides the clever fiction and vivid details that draws you in deep, this book brings out the shame of humanity and puts it on display so elegantly. The man got jailed for this book and boy was it worth it!!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'm surprised no one has actually managed to portray this books correctly. It was actually why I decided to read it.If you expect exploits as in the movies, where he uses his ability and all that, then you'll regret it.It's a good story about a man who realises what morality is and how to live with it, or not live with it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I heard of the movie first because I'm a Fan of Ben Barnes before I found the book. I read the reviews and saw how people praises the book a lot. I liked the concept so figured I'll read it first before I'll watch the movie. I really thought I'd walk into a grotesque environment but it ended up so intriguing. Its exhilarating and atmospheric. I admire Oscar Wilde's brilliance in creating the characters, specifically Lord Henry. He is Dorian Gray's (the evil one) creator and honestly, Henry is the keystone of the story. His lines are perfectly constructed making them alluring even if he wasn't brave enough to do them himself. If I were like Dorian who grew up seeing only 4 walls and suddenly got freed, then get to talk to a man as eloquent as Henry is, I really believe his influence will be so great too. The characters of the book also show deep interest in art of different forms including Painting of course, literature and fashion which reflects the artist within Oscar himself. The author described Dorian Gray as \\"art\\" himself, I figured it will be challenging to find a person to play the part in the movie so beautiful to be called \\"art\\". Amazingly, Ben Barnes lived up to the role. Being chosen to play that role brings pressure and flattery of course, but the challenge is, if he can bring to life the Dorian Gray Oscar Wilde created. Its a good read! Oscar Wilde is a talented writer as we all know. This book can change your point of view of some aspects in life if you let it!! As what Ben said, \\"there's a great difference between pleasure and real happiness\\". You can try the movie too, its wonderfully made; great acting and the story line is nice. they made a few modifications and additions from the book at it made it more interesting. Colin forth and Ben Barnes were fabulous! The movie is lush, exhilarating and extremely sexy!!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A fascinating look into the human ego and basic selfishness,this story could as easily have been written regarding our society as that of 1890s England. The only rough spot is chapter 11, which can easily be skimmed over. My best guess is that it all would have been fascinating to Wildes contemporaries, but is somewhat meaningless in this age."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I would happily listen to Edward Petherbridge read a telephone book but he truly does make this a very enjoyable book to listen to.

Some of their friends sent their children there long before I was born. Pastor Jones might have had Dorian Gray in mind when he said: \\"Dissipations of youth must be paid for with a draft on old age.\\"Wilde's Dorian Gray is devoted to the fanciful premise that a soul might scar itself with the most horrible of depraved debauchery, which in Victorian London included opium dens, prostitution, and in the case of Mr. Gray, murder, both by proxy and in personal excess of temper. So, if you exercise patience, a murder mystery unfolds. (Lots and lots of patience!)What dark meditations crossed my mind, and how like ice was my countenance while feasting in Wilde's psychological eulogizing of scarlet sins and opulence from dozens of characters famous in classical Western history. As my mother was a history major with emphasis in fine arts, I've seen many of the anecdotal persons from art and mythology named in this book, experienced their art and literature and stories in our own collections and the local library. I've read their sad, sordid sense of moral turpitude, the decay of dynasties possessed of great art, luxury and wealth.Dorian's zeal to experience every pleasure on which he might lay his hands is reminiscent of the Ecclesiastes, though more lengthy and of less lucid outcomes. Accused sometimes of misanthropy, Oscar Wilde is nonetheless a master of florid verbosity. As once observed by author Ursula K. LeGuin, each sentence must dedicate it's reason for being, to an introduction of the next sentence.I might not have read all of this novel, except that I'm awed in admiration of the incredibly artful architecture of Wilde's sentences. One simple sentence might introduce what literature teachers will scold their students about being a \\"run-on-sentence.\\"But Wilde philosophizes elaborate arguments in the heads of his characters. There is nothing wrong analytically, or logically with attaching the cohesive phrases and clauses of two or more sides of an argument all together into a unified thought, even wielding a dozen commas to conjoin these articulated opposites.The style evokes memories of reading St. Paul in the King James English Bible, or the sublime constructions found in the tragedyRamona (Signet Classics), by Helen Hunt Jackson. I would never subject juvenile readers to the philosophy of Dorian Grey. Even as an adult, I'm grateful to have experienced a healthy dose of Shakespeare, prior to microscopically examining the minutia of a deeply troubled mind preoccupied with male beauty."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I started out disliking this book: too much silliness, not enough serious message. However, as time progressed, it turned out that the silliness (often shown in people's favorite quotes) is froth, and the body underneath is substantial: good, evil, innocence, and corruption. Wilde is a sublime genius at meshing the two levels in one work."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"this was a well written book but I wouldn't suggest it to anyone who wants a relaxing read. If you like well written novels that have an almost disturbing sense to it then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Art for art's sake? Oscar Wilde's \\"Dorian Gray\\" is about youth, corruption, and esthetics. Reflective of Wilde's own life and revolt against Victorian era sentimentality, young Dorian Gray slowly changes after his philosophical discussions with the cynical Lord Henry Wotton, whose cold criticisms and harsh wit are often humorous in an addictively jaded kind of way, and tempting to arm oneself with; however, read on and observe Wilde's destruction of Lord Henry's young protoget. The immediate power of Basil Hallward's portrait of Dorian retains a demonic hold on its confused subject, taunting and torturing his vanity with its strangely metamorphizing characteristics. Who's changing, and what exactly is changing? Wilde creates an unforgettable \\"portrait\\" here of one man's (or is it the whole of Victorian society?) demise. Many critics of Wilde have seen him and \\"The Portrait of Dorian Gray\\" as pure evil and criticized the undertones of homosexuality, and linked it with a lifestyle of debauchery and degradation. Wilde was thrown in jail for his \\"unlawful activities\\". To them I must concur with Wilde, that \\"Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's Dorian Gray is such a powerful book because it explores the path of one man's sins and their effect on his life and the lives of those around him. Wilde uses Dorian as an example to demonstrate the struggles of humanity coping with its flaws. Wilde's plot is simple enough. Dorian was a man who had everything going for him. He was young, beautiful, wealthy, and unspoiled. Then he met Lord Henry, whose bizzare philosophies that he himself didn't even take seriously had a great impact on the impressionable Dorian. Lord Henry had convinced Dorian that once his youth had passed, he would have nothing enjoyable left in life, which caused Dorian pray aloud that a portrait he had of himself would take on his own physical burdens. As Dorian becomes more and more corrupted by Lord Henry and commits more sins, he notices that the painting (which represents his conscience) is becoming more and more wretched. He occasionally feels remorse and tries to change, but his plans always fail when Lord Henry draws him back under the shadow of his influence. The discouraged Dorian finally resolves to start his life anew by destroying the painting, the only record he has of his sins. When he stabs the picture, however, he kills himself.This is a powerful story that portrays the important lesson that sins are inescapable and everybody's actions catch up to them. This isn't a hard concept, but Wilde's writing is very challenging. He uses very poignant expressions constantly throughout the book that can get the reader off track because they tend to cause him to attempt to frequently stop and process what has just been said. I think that this was a great book, but it wouldn't be good to require it at Mercy High because it takes so long to get through."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"More than a story, The Picture of Dorian Gray contains many of Oscar Wilde's most famous commentary on life. Unlike any other work of fiction that I have read before I actually read this book with a pen in hand, underlining Wilde's eloquent thoughts about art, tragedy and life.No need to recap the story here other than to say that it continues to be applicable to every human being born into this world. Each of us has our own picture that reflects our deepest and truest feelings, thoughts and actions. Facades abound but there is no getting around our frequent trips inside to have a look at the portrait that only we can see.A masterful book that goes far beyond the well-known story."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"What does it profit a man if he gains the world, but loses his soul?\\" This is the core question raised by \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", Oscar Wilde's reworking (if that isn't too unkind) of Goethe's Faust for the Victorian era and his attack on the values of the middle classes caused a scandal when it was first published in 1890 and over 100 years later, while not particularly shocking to the modern reader is still a deeply unsettling tale. The novel revolves around our hero Dorian, the tensions within his own character and the forces that conspire in his eventual destruction.The book begins with Dorian seeing for the first time a portrait of himself painted by his friend Basil Hallward and Dorian's wish that the portrait would age while he remained forever the same as he was on that day. The \\"prayer of his pride\\" is answered and not only does the picture carry the assault of time for Dorian, but also the full weight of the casual cruelties and crimes he commits, evolving from a reproduction of his physical form into a mirror image of his soul. Realising this, Dorian is driven to even greater excesses safe in the knowledge that he can get away with it until finally his own guilt catches up with him.In his only novel, one can't help but feel that Oscar is giving us an insight into his own soul and the guilt he suffered over his sexual orientation. But on a deeper level, Wilde shows us the damnation of one soul and in that gives us a metaphor for our world and ourselves. Despite the Victorian idea that a person&#65533;s nature is written on their face, which is frankly ludicrous with the hindsight of the last century, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a truly wonderful and thought-provoking story heavily laced with the famous wit and wisdom of the great man himself."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" - Oscar Wilde\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an excellent novel about the degradation of the human soul. The novel focuses around the handsome Dorian Gray and his interactions with the artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait and Lord Henry, who becomes the corrupting influence on Dorian's soul and Dorian's iinteractions with the British aristocracy. Dorian is compared to Narcissus, who was so obsessed with his own beauty, that it swallowed him whole. Dorian seals his fate with one wish; upon viewing his portrait, he wonders if it would be possible for his portrait to show the signs of aging, in exchange for his mortal beauty. Throughout the novel, we see Dorian's decent into total self - absorbtion and evil all of which culminates in an ending that is predictable but still entertaining none the less.Just a quick side note, there is some great social commentary running throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" specifically Wilde's commentary on the stiff, British aristocracy of the late 19th century, absurd views regarding women, who are painted by Gray as blubbering idiots (a sign of the times) and last but not least, the underlying homosexual undertones present between Dorian, Basil and Lord Henry are fascinating to deconstruct.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was my first introduction to Oscar Wilde and after reading the novel, I was hooked. I would like to return to the quote above, about art mirroring the soul of the spectator, after reading this novel, you will have a sense of how trully frightening that notion is."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"To be honest, I had two reasons for choosing this book. One was for a class assignment. Having a list to choose from lead to the second reason I picked this- a friend told me she had greatly enjoyed it. Therefore, I began reading with the expectation of having a &quot;nice&quot; read. Other than that, I didn't expect much from the novel. This is one of the times I am glad to say that I was wrong. &lt;i&gt;The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/i&gt; providea, first and foremost a good storyline. A young man, worried that once his youth and beauty departs he will lose everything, wishes that a portrait painted of him bear all reprecussions of time. After a period of time, this young man, Dorian Gray, discovers he has gotten his wish. However, an old maxim proves true once more in this novel: be careful what you wish for, as Gray learns he will, in fact, get what he deserves as a result of a life of debauchery. Yet an interesting (and certainly unsettling, at least at the time it was written) story line is not all the book has going for it. Wilde provides the reader with three main characters who are well-developed enough to make them convincing. We are given a tempramental artist (another good reason to read this book: anyone with any sort of artistic temprament will greatly appreciate some of the commentary made within the dialogue of the story), who is given to jealousy, a jaded, rather intellectual man who always has an opinon and never hastens to inform those in the vicinity of it, and, finally, a young man who begins the story as a very naive person and changes throughout the book in a seemingly natural manner. A wide variety of smaller characters also help to enhance the plot. In short, this book was one of the most interesting I have ever read. At times, I found myself getting the attention of someone nearby, to point out a line found in one of the passages that I felt they might enjoy or somehow relate to. In one way or another, it is my opinion one would be hard-pressed to find someone who did not relate to something the book. Overall, it was an excellent read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The idea of never growing old and having a painting take on all your admoralities is appealing.Dorian reacts as anyone would. He lives life with full adbandonment pays the price.I believe the moral of the story is this. In the end we all pay for our actions.Wilde does a great job building characters and leading the reader into the world of the Englis upper-crust."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is sooo good, I think no jaded reader can deserve that title without having read this book. Dorian Gray, an astonishingly beautiful young aristocrat, receives the gift of eternal youth in the form of a painting one of his friends has made of him. Later, prompted by another friend, the divine dissolute Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian gradually falls into a dissipate lifestyle and the eerie painting shows both the ravages of age and the advance of Dorian's moral decay, while he retains his breathtaking looks. As Dorian becomes more and more obsessed with the painting's worsening appearance, the changes in his once sweet and naive personality are explained in the story, and Dorian lives in fear of the painting being exposed to the world, therefore showing him beyond any doubt as the sleazy creep he is, until it comes to a point when the gift he prized so much ends up turning against him. Dorian Gray is one of the least likable characters I have seen on print, but I really liked his wicked friend Lord Wotton, who in the story is the one in charge of leading Dorian astray and dishing criticism after witty criticism of nineteenth century English society. I later learned this particular character was a sort of mockery of Oscar Wilde himself. A mellower version of this character can be found in another of Wilde's works, Lord Arthur Savile's Crime, my second favorite story by this author."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Contrary to some opinions I've come across, this book does NOT romanticize or promote a loss of morals. It is the exact opposite. Yes, Dorian becomes corrupted, but does the ending suggest that Wilde was making Dorian a hero for it? By no means. Dorian did not live happily ever after. It is a very moral book in that it clearly reinforces the principle of inevitable consequences of one's actions. Yes, at times it was a little slow (that is when the characters went into long life-philosophies)but all around it was very interesting and provided an insight into the late Victorian world in which Oscar Wilde lived. It addresses some key concepts such as appearance and its relation to virtue and the double-sidedness of one's character. Overall this book was not bad at all. A good read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I am a fan of many writers, but Oscar Wilde holds a special place in my non-existant but nonetheless real Hallway of Marble Busts of Famous Dead Guys. Obviously, Wilde was aware of his already-forming legend status at the height of his popularity, and his arrogance is permeated throughout every one of his works. This does not, however, disqualify him from being rightly honored by his huge and admiring readership. It also doesn't change the fact that he was victim of his own irony, dying young and humiliated in jail. No one illustrates tragicomedy better than Oscar Wilde. This particular book is the Bible of the Infinitely Quotable Strokes of Verbal Genius. My personal fave: &quot;Cigarettes are the perfect form of the perfect pleasure. They are exquisite and they leave one unsatisfied.

It was an interesting book, and while I cannot say that I liked it as such, it is good to have read it - my curiosity is satisfied.It was very sad that Dorian went so completely \\"off the rails\\", so to speak, under the influence of Henry, and I found the worldview difficult to cope with. At times the irony in the situations was very poignant - such as when Dorian tells Sybil Vane that she is selfish, while he, in fact, is the selfish one. I suppose that justice was met at the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"First published in 1890, Oscar Wilde's now classic novel is a meditation on decadence, art and morality. At the center is a young man of strikingly good looks who's portrait is painted by a dear friend - a portrait that then absorbs and reflects the young man's soul as he makes decisions that affect others as he slides into a life of debauchery.Highly stylized, the prose contains classic lines such as \\"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\" Wilde's only novel, the book was viewed as scandalous and immoral when published despite the fact that the immoral - or, more accurately, amoral perpetrator of ill deeds suffers as he chases empty pleasures and eventually comes to reflect upon the impact that his actions have had upon others and himself.The book is not the easiest of reads given the heavy style, the setting, and pervasive use of cultural references from high society in the late 19th century. However, for those who want to fully understand the commonly referenced trope of \\"Dorian Gray's portrait,\\" nothing serves bettern than the source."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book because it was a bookclub read.

I am happy that I read the book and I did find it to be a good story and plot overall. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read the classics."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I really have no idea why \\"Illustrated\\" is included in the title of this work. The only part of this book that is illustrated (besides the cover) is the short biography found at the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It must have been around 1870 when very capable artist Basil Hallward brilliantly painted soon to be very rich 20-year old Dorian Gray. Hallward's wordy, witty friend Lord Henry Wotton on their first meeting in the painter's studio persuaded Dorian Gray that youth was any good looking human's greatest attribute. And youth, since it did not long endure, must be lived to the utmost while it did last. This meant Dorian's \\"expressing,\\" externalizing every insight, impulse and passion that most people learn to keep bottled up inside them. An early version of \\"let it all hang out.\\"Oh, how hitherto naive and innocent Dorian wished that he would never have to say farewell to his youth and beauty! If only he might stay young while the young man in his portrait did all the aging? That wish was granted. And THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY (1890, 1891) unrolls the next 18 or 19 years of Gray's while everyone around him grew older but he did not.It can be argued,that Dorian's wish for eternal youth was morally indifferent, neither good nor bad. It might have remained harmless, like Ponce de Leon's search for the Fountain of Youth. It was conceivably a well-meaning God who granted Dorian Gray's wish. What would matter in the end was what Gray did with his youth.He was given good albeit secular advice by painter Basil Hallward and very bad, cynical, character-ruining advice by Lord Henry. Unfortunately for Hallward (whom Gray would later murder) and for Dorian himself, the young man consistently heeded Lord Henry. In consequence, Dorian Gray learned to separate art from reality, learned to value clever words and eptithets more than unselfish deeds and denied himself nothing that his fertile brain could imagine. This self-indulgence included frequent visits to London opium dens, brawls with foreign sailors on the docks and viciously spurning Sybil Vane, the teenage Shakespearean actress, whom he loved for her acting skills but who renounced them because they seemed unreal compared with Dorian's love for her. Hours after a scathing denunciation by a disappointed Dorian, young Sybil swallows prussic acid and dies.All this dissent into hell is faithfully reproduced in the increasingly cruel, vicious lines of face and body in the portrait of Dorian Gray. The picture becomes the conscience of the novel's hero who often sits spell-bound before it. It sometimes persuades him, very briefly, to make half-hearted efforts at reform. But the portrait allows Dorian to understand that every single one of his half-hearted good deeds is hypocritical, is bad acting. For 18 years, until he destroys himelf with a knife intended to destroy his portrait, Dorian Gray remains a handsome 20-year old while all others move steadily toward the grave.Telling the bare story of Gray's decline takes up perhaps a third of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. The rest is ballast, starting with excursuses into Gray's sometimes year long fads of the moment: tapestries, music, religion (especially Roman Catholicism), mysticism and decadent French literature. Then there are teas, dinners and parties among the swells and aristocrats of London. These are all contrived social stages for Oscar Wilde to let his decadent characters like Lord Henry Wotton and handsome young Dorian Gray skewer institutions like marriage and preen themselves before admiring audiences as they drop several hundred seemingly spontaneous epithets into sparkling conversations. The London ambience of useless Duchesses, members of Parliament and wealthy society widows is lovingly limned by Oscar Wilde.Let one party and its smart talk suffice for many. As brilliant for its repartee as any other social occasion in the novel is Chapter 15's small, hastily puled together dinner at Lady Narborough's. Dorian Gray appears, having mere hours before having stabbed to death his friend painter Basil Hallward and having then blackmailed another onetime friend to dispose of the body. At Lady Narborough's Dorian was wildly excited but outwardly calm and his manner \\"as easy and graceful as ever.\\" The company was rather dull. His hostess's married daughter had \\"one of those characteristic British faces that, once seen, are never remembered.\\" Things became livelier when Lord Henry Wotton arrived, very, very late. The table discusses the amours of Madame de Ferrol. Lord Henry summed her up: \\"Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary. When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.\\" Henry preens himself when accused of wickedness: \\"It is perfectly monstrous ... the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.\\"The question arises at Lady Narborough's: are we such a sorry lot because it is \\"the end of the century\\" (fin de siecle)? or the end of the world (fin de globe)? Certainly none of the players is morally outstanding or even self-content. They are useless and they know it.-OOO-"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This was a English summer project for my daughter in school. She really enjoyed it.

It centers on a young dandy who is rather shallow and self-absorbed. He makes an off-handed statement about how he wishes he would never grow old and that a picture painted of him would suffer the ravages of age instead. This wish is granted and the story follows the events that unfold up to Dorian's realization that he has received everything he \\"wanted\\" and is now miserable. Two main acquaintances Basil and Lord Henry abound. Basil in some ways is a God figure in that he represents the good path and encourages Dorian to better himself and be an upright person. Lord Henry on the other hand is more of a Beelzebub. He encourages Dorian to debase himself, follow his whims and not concern himself with the wreckage he leaves in his wake. One of the two advisors wins out as the story proceeds and it ends in the only way it could."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I listened to the audio version, which was a delight. This classic impresses upon the reader the importance of Christ's rhetorical question: what does it profit a man to gain the whole word but lose his soul?

This is a book to read and re-read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was highly impressed by this novel of arts, society, morality and immortality. It has to be one of the most deepest things that I have ever read. One thing that bothered me a little was how Oscar Wilde went through this long winded prose and at times became a bit essay like but it had gave me food for thought."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When asked to pick a favorite passage from a book, a lot of people will choose a vivid description. These people like authors to create beautiful scenes for them that they can forever conjure up in their heads. For this kind of reader, The Picture of Dorian Gray is probably a pleasure. Unfortunately, I am not this kind of reader.It is perhaps fitting that a book about beauty is defined by the images it creates rather than by the story or the dialogue. However, Oscar Wilde's mastery of dialogue is what makes his plays such a pleasure. For me, The Picture of Dorian Gray will never live up to Wilde's plays. This is not to say that the book is completely irredeemable; whenever Lord Henry is around, the book becomes better (but only insofar as it becomes more like a play, more focused on dialogue).You will love this book if you like descriptions, if you, unlike me, were able to read the chapters of The Grapes of Wrath that rambled about the land and that did not contribute to the plot. If you are like me, on the other hand, this book will be readable but not particularly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The storyline is very good and the theme is thought provoking. However, the great weakness for me are the characters in this piece. Character driven novels have characters that bring out some form of emotion from the reader. Be it fondness, admiration, sympathy for the hero or hate of the villain. I had no emotional interest in any of the characters in this book. I simply didn't care about any of their fates. Had Wilde developed the characters better this could have been a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If you have never read an Oscar Wilde book, read this one. It is easy to read, entertaining and throughly enjoyable. The language doesn't trip you up. I have enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have watched the old movie of this story and the newer one but had never read the book. This was excellent!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The most disappointing part of this book is that it read more like a non-fiction philosophy book than a story or novel. I would say 70% of the pages were portrayed as thoughts of a character or a speech of a character contemplating life, women, how we are suppose to live, etc.The actual story was hidden throughout the book, but you have to drone on through many pages to find it. The story itself is highly predictable and yet still has many missing parts to it. Many years of Dorian Gray's life is missing where it is hinted to that he commit's the most awful sins. I think reading of those sinful actions was to be more entertaining than the rabbit trails that Wilde goes on.Despite these facts, I am glad that I read the book once. It held my attention enough and was brilliant enough that I did learn something from the book, which is a great accomplishment in itself, to teach a reader a few principals that may slightly help or change on any small level, the readers actions. So I do recommend this book if you have no more pressing serious books on your reading list.On a side note, I do disagree with all the reviews I have seen on this book where the reader says that they can not relate to Dorian Gray's sins and that his sins are outdated. His chief sins in the book are (SMALL SPOILER ALERT) murder, drug use, pride, treating others harshly and without respect, using women in many ways, etc. are all sins practiced today even if they are not practiced exactly the way they are in the book. If you can relate to none of those sins in any way, then you are a better person than I, or suffer from foolish pride which is the chief sin in the book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'm being made to read this book for the third time (once in high school, twice in college), but I've always rather detested it. I've been told I need to \\"appreciate\\" it, and to that effect I've been reading a number of reviews (both positive and negative) of this book, trying to get a grip on *why* it's so highly regarded. The basic story is this: Dorian (a pretty twentysomething without much personality) makes a tacit (implied, not stated) bargain with a painter: his portrait will grow old and sick while he remains young and beautiful, no matter what he does to himself. And he does *plenty* to himself. 230 pages later, he grows a conscience and tries to destroy the painting, bringing age/sickness on himself and thus dying, unpunished for his \\"sins.\\" The Faust parallels are evident; unfortunately Dorian Gray is no Faust, and lord Henry (his \\"corrupter\\") is no Mephistopheles. The book is told as a series of banal witticisms and jests which sound good the first time you read them but get chewed up and spat out the second they're exposed to intelligent analysis. (Example from the preface: \\"All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex and vital. When critics disagree the artist is in accord with himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely. All art is quite useless.\\")Synthesizing all the reviews, I get the sense that people who *really* like it--the \\"witty\\" verbiage, the Faust-lite storyline, and the moral heavy-handedness--like it because it shields them from the knowledge of their own inner emptiness. That sounds harsh; let me explain further. Since everything is stylized, pre-determined, and \\"fake,\\" there's no danger of self-discovery--no danger of discovering anything true. Oscar Wilde was deeply alienated against his own self (most homosexuals living at that time and in that society were), and so is not capable of feeling honestly, or expressing himself with any sincerity. Human nature (in the wider, not baser, sense) is \\"reduced\\"--that's the only word I can think of to describe it. Words are everything; appearances; everything. But words are empty sounds without the meanings attached to them (anyone who knows more than one language knows *that*), and appearances are superficial and deceiving, to trot out that old cliche. Human beings do not exist merely to think up verbal ripostes to personal attacks, and yet, here, this is all they do. Well, that and \\"sin.\\" But what a \\"sin\\" is is never really defined, and Dorian Gray doesn't really \\"sin\\" much (he seduces a girl, dumps her, and there's some implied homosexuality---*yawn*).\\"Dorian\\" is a morality tale, like the story of Jesus. It is something to tell children with no imagination, to warn them of the dangers of societal rejection--the dangers of being \\"different.\\" In a subtle way, it encourages conformity--and it *definitely* encourages repression. It is false to me in so many ways that I can hardly stomach it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"nicely bound, beautifully embossed, priced especially well considering the binding and compared to other retailers such as Anthropologie; contains a sewn in ribbon bookmark which I love.

Yes, just a Dorian's body defied time, this book is equally as powerful a metaphor today as it was when it was first written. And with our plastic narcissistic society, perhaps its more powerful today then ever! Sadly, perhaps it will be even more so in 100 more years hense.These are powerful reasons to read and enjoy Wilds only full length novel. Besides the wit and satire that can be enjoyed for the sake of humor, the book screams out to each of us, to live for pleasure or wisdom.This is one of the choices Wilde plays with in many of his works, and this is one of the best to understand and think about.I can't imagine someone who has not read this book, but if you have not, and you are hear today, then its time to do so. You wont regret it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was lucky enough one day to be browsing in my local bookstore when I came across a copy of Dorian Gray for only a dollar brand new. I bought it and shelfed it for awhile until one day I picked it up and was subjected to its enchanting content. When reading about such characters such as Lord Henry for instance, you can only admit that you are being worked by the words and charms of a great novelist. It is sad that this is the only full novel Oscar Wilde ever did.(he did do a fair amount of plays, short stories, and essays however). After reading it, you will find yourself quoting it for a good while. And the plot device used is one of the better one's in all of fiction. I must say I plan on re-reading this one, the language, the wit, and the overall story that Wilde creates is very alluring and worthy of all the praise you might hear about it.Pick it up, read it, love it, and then recommend it to all of your friends."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"After a few months of cajoling, my parents finally convinced me to read \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" by Oscar Wilde. Actually, part of what motivated me was not my parents' persistant pestering (and occasionally threatening), but the fact that Oscar Wilde is the favorite author of the lead singer from my favorite out-of-date band, The Smiths (Morrissey, yes).But anyway, to the book. When I started to read, I was in some kind of rapturous awe of Wilde's writing. It was so utterly beautiful, shaped and molded as finely as the face of the man Wilde so eloquently describes, Mr. Dorian Gray himself. It has the operatic and tragic occurence of an opera, or at least a play, but had The Picture of Dorain Gray been written as a play, it would have shirked the story of the wonderous use of the English language that so holds this novel up.Admittedly, it was a bit thick to wade through at times, but other than that, it's a ripping good ride, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about the evils and attraction of physical beauty."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a true classic that should be read by everyone. It may be fiction, but truth lies within the pages of this book. Oscar Wilde has painted a truly perfect representation of the human species with his character Dorian Gray. A character so full of life that you can't help but be drawn into the book. I was unable to put it down after reading the first page!When you open this book, you are not just reading a story, you are looking into a mirror. You see yourself in Dorian Gray's position as he goes through his trials and tribulations. Regardless of who you are, everyone feels and, at some point, thinks along the line's of Dorian Gray. For some, they may have even traveled down a similar path. It is for this reason that Oscar Wilde was able to create such a realistic character. He created something that people can relate to because each of us has a Dorian Gray within us, at least, to some degree.I don't know if Wilde meant to be so philosophical or psychological with this story, but it is a work of genius. I believe that this book should be part of the required reading material in some age appropriate schools. I doubt that it will, but I feel the character of Dorian Gray and his 'life' would be an eye opener for many.I highly recommend this book to anyone even vaguely curious about it. I honestly cannot understand why this has a single bad rating! If your still not sure after reading the reviews, check with your local library about borrowing it. If you like it, then buy it and save it to read for later. I've re-read mine several times now and have yet to grow bored or tired of it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray is absurdly good-looking. Utterly infatuated, Basil Hallward captures Dorian's youthful beauty in a portrait.While posing for this portrait, Dorian meets Basil's friend, Lord Henry Wotton, who charmingly preaches hedonism. Lord Henry's efforts to corrupt Dorian work quickly. Convinced that youth and beauty are the only things worth having in life, Dorian looks upon his finished portrait with cruel jealousy. His image will never grow old, but he will.One wish sends the plot of the novel into action: Dorian wishes the portrait would age, while he stays youthful.Enter a lover whose heart Dorian breaks. Her despair coerces her to suicide. With her death on his conscience, he notices an evil glint in the eye of his portrait. Over the years, Basil's painting begins to age. Dorian sabotages reputations and even commits murder, all the while looking as young and beautiful as he did on the day his portrait was painted. However, the portrait-a grotesque reminder of his double life-documents every immoral act.Focusing on duplicity and aestheticism, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a captivating and cinematic tale. Oscar Wilde's knack for dialogue is what made him a famous playwright and parts of Dorian Gray are rich with clever play-like exchanges.Lord Henry's wit is exceptionally tantalizing. But he doesn't seem to take himself too seriously, whereas Dorian adopts everything Lord Henry preaches with the conviction of a Southern Baptist. He's basically just a dumb pretty person that everyone coddles despite the fact that he's a terrible human being.**Side note**The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's only novel. The book was scandalous when it was released in 1891 because of clear homoerotic undertones. Dorian's lovers are both men and women. Though not overtly sexual, Basil's infatuation with Dorian is questionable. Wilde himself had an affair with Robert Ross."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read quite a lot and I have not been so entranced by a book in a very long time.

Based on this merit alone it is worth reading. If you're a connoisseur of literature it's mandatory, and if you're not, it's highly recommendable.It tells of the life of Dorian Gray, who, upon meeting Basil Hallward (his painter's) friend Sir Henry Wotton, begins to fret over the ephemerality of his youth, and makes an involuntary wish for...Well I don't want to ruin it for anyone, so I'll leave that out. Chances are, going in, you know the premise of the novel, but I still don't want to risk a spoiler. Either way, slowly, he starts to lose himself, and the gentleness of his nature, and he is driven to \\"sin\\".It's a good read in many ways. For one it is an easy read, it can be enjoyed whether you are sitting at home or travelling. In another it is thought provoking, you could pull about two hundred quotes out of it and apply them to your daily life (and I'm not exaggerating). And lastly, the story line is gripping.If you're approaching this after experiencing Wilde's plays then I should warn you, there is no comedy here, in fact there is barely even a resemblance to the tone of his plays (although some of the dialogue is fairly similar).Either way, this is a damn good read and I certainly recommend it.If you're interested in gothic literature, this is highly, highly recommended, as are the above titles."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The story is pretty standard.

Some classics are just kind of boring, but this one was quite a surprise! I really enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is one of the most elegant novels in the Gothic canon; that it is also one of the most sinister is hardly surprising given Oscar Wilde's curious aptitude for tempering the macabre with the sensuous and the frivolous with the fatalistic.A considerable scandal upon its publication in the early 1890s, the novel still reads as slightly homoerotic, even if only in the most clandestine and aphotic of ways. Woven through its themes of beauty, decadence, age, and the nature of art is a thread of shimmering doom that becomes more poignant the longer one spends with DORIAN GRAY and the more one considers its relationship with its author.It is a peacock's fan of luminous wit and glimmering color, dripping with venom and smelling of strange perfumes. We are all familiar with the general flavor of things: an innocent and exceptionally beautiful youth has his portrait painted one fateful afternoon; upon viewing the piece, he is paralyzed by the sudden revelation that one day he will be old and hideous while the painting will retain its beauty and life. In a devil's bargain, he wishes that it would be the other way around. And then, under the influence of a particularly deleterious gentleman, Dorian Gray begins to change: his innocence gives way to corruption and his beauty seems apt to languish under the spell of opium, cruelty, and languor. One day Dorian notices that the painting has begun to transform, while he himself retains all the beauty of an innocent despite the ever-swelling ocean of his sins...Few works of literature are as effervescent as DORIAN GRAY and just as few are as utterly pessimistic; that it is capable of fusing remarkably disparate parts into a whole that is absolutely cohesive is a fascinating example of its author's gifts. Like Wilde's SALOME, DORIAN GRAY is as colorful as it is bleak, and even its weaknesses, in context, seem like strengths.Seldom is an artist's most famous work also his most erudite and brilliant: this is one of those works. I have approached it perhaps six or seven times in the last five years, and each reading has left me more enraptured than the last--which is high praise for a novel that relies a great deal on suspense and aesthetic splendour. I consider it one of the finest things I have ever read--daring, sultry, venomous, eloquent, and radiant in its own decay.(From my Gothic fiction blog:[...]"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"My impetus for reading this book, since I read few novels, was a book entitled \\"The Ripper Code\\" by Thomas Toughill. That book's author posed the theory that in writing \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Oscar Wilde was attempting to point the finger of guilt at one of his erstwhile friends, and possible homosexual lovers, as London's \\"Jack the Ripper.\\" This intrigued me, particularly since Wilde's book was published only a year or so after the last of the Ripper murders, and, as Toughill noted, Wilde and his suspect lived only about six miles from the Whitechapel district, where the murders took place, and Wilde clearly chose the date of the last Ripper murder, November 9, 1889, as the date which brought his story to its climax. So, in reading this book, I couldn't help but bear that in mind.After reading this book, it is clear that Wilde based some, if not all, of the main characters in his novel on persons whom he knew and, in all likelihood, on actual conversations he had had with those and other prominent people in London society. And there are certainly clear similarities between at least two of the most prominent characters in his novel and Wilde's friends: namely Dorian Gray, himself, and Wilde's presumed suspect, George Francis \\"Frank\\" Miles, an artist who contracted syphilis and died in 1891 shortly after the final Ripper murder; and Dorian's first love and suicide victim, the young actress Sybyl Vane, and the actress, Lilly Langtree, who Miles and Wilde both knew in her early days and whose career they clearly advanced. Other than that, however, there is little to suggest that Wilde was attempting to point the finger of guilt at Miles or at anyone else.As for the novel itself, I found it to be extremely interesting and hard to put down. I was particularly impressed by the author's apparent insight into human nature, as reflected in some of the ideas expounded on many occasions by Dorian Gray's friend and mentor, Lord Henry Wotton. Some of those passages were rather long, and perhaps a little tedious, but still interesting if one persisted. I consider this to be a classic which most readers would enjoy, but, in my view, Wilde simply drew on his experiences and chose certain events and characters to help sell his book. Frank Miles can rest in peace --- at least for now."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I knew what this story was about long before finally reading it. That's probably common. The famous premise is a fascinating one, though I found myself wondering if the narrative would have been even more impactful if written as a short story or novella length rather than stretched out to a full novel. The Lord Henry character who serves the purpose of putting bad ideas in Dorian's head gives multiple speeches throughout detailing his hedonistic world view. If the number or word count of these lectures was cut in half I don't think the story would suffer much from the absence. Another decision made by Oscar Wilde was not to show readers very much of Dorian's behavior. His first act of cruelty is laid out before us as is his final one, but in between we are only told that his bad reputation precedes him without being shown what he has done to earn it. It's left to our imagination. A few more scenes exhibiting decadent behavior rather than various dinner party conversations in which a pro decadence philsophy is expressed would have made for a juicier read. Would it have made for a better read? That's arguable, as perhaps it also is whether this book is intententially homoerotic or simply written during a time when heterosexual men were much more comfortable going on and on about how good looking a guy was. What's beyond debate is that Oscar Wilde came up with a great idea to build a story around, one that is as timeless as the desire for eternal youth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I've developed a general rule to avoid free Kindle editions of virtually anything, and it paid off handsomely when I picked this edition. There were two Penguin Kindle editions. This one for $.99 and another for free. As with other free Kindle editions labelled \\"Penguin\\", the edition was not Penguin, it was a \\"Pocket Book\\" edition. This one, for a buck, is true blue Penguin.To further validate my point, this edition has many addins which are often missing from a cheap Kindle edition. First, it has a history of the book's writing and publication, an outline of Wilde's life, an excellent bibliography covering both 19th and 20th century works, two appendices on 19th century reviews of the book and on the provinance of this edition. It also has notes on the chapters which explain things understood by a late 19th century Londoner, but which have been lost to us. An example is the term \\"Japanese effect\\" referring to a style adopted by some late 19th century painters, mimicing some aspects of Japanese art. A leading example was the great portrait artist, James MacNeill Whistler.In a word, it is a complete, genuine Penguin edition, cheap."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was reading the graphic novel: Jaka's Story (Cerebus, volume 5) by Dave Sim and Gerhard (which I strongly recommend anyone to read, together with the sequence: Cerebus, volume 6, Melmoth) when I met the fictional character &quot;Oscar&quot;.In that story, &quot;Oscar&quot; discussed with Jaka's husband, Rick, about a poisonous book (&quot;The Picture of Alfred Douglas&quot;), written by a certain Lord Henry Wotton! Any resemblance with the reality? :) &quot;Oscar&quot; told that he asked to Lord Henry how did he explain his success after saying that &quot;to be popular one must be mediocre&quot;? Lord Henry answered him that &quot;in this matter as in many others, he was the exception that proved the rule&quot;.Reading these passages, I was charmed with the Oscar Wilde character and decided to read the true &quot;The Portrait of Dorian Gray&quot; written by the true Oscar Wilde.I think the passages in Cerebus clarified to me what this book was about (modern graphic novels have the power to illuminate one's thoughts). One should not read this book looking for coherence. All the characters are incoherent, and this is one of the genial points in this book. People are not coherent, so fictional character must not be coherent either!In the preface the author, himself, says that art is quite useless, though it is the thing he loves most to do! The artist Basil says initially that a picture, done with heart, belongs to the artist. Later, he gives the picture to Dorian Gray. Henry Wotton throws along all the story a series of poisonous thoughts that he doesn't follow!Other genial point is that Dorian, although being evil (and could be considered a villain in his own story) is not punished for what he does!Sybil Vane commits suicide because of him, but nobody was able to connect her death with him. Later, he kills Basil, but he just disappears with the body, with no consequences. Near the end, when we think that he is going to be killed by Sybil Vane's brother, he escapes easily from him. Only when, by caprice, he makes the foolishness of trying to destroy his portrait, is that he finds death. That is, he dies merely by accident, not because of his vicious or crimes.If, instead, he just tried to cut the picture he would learn that it would have the effect of hurting himself physically. Then he would guard the picture, and proceed living his life of eternal youth and beauty (that is, until some day some insects, or rats, or something, decided to eat his canvas... :) )These are for me the mistakes of many writers, and what turns the end of many stories so boring and so unsatisfactory! The first one is that they want to produce a plot and tie all the characters of the story (as though it was necessary, and as though all characters deseverd to be well developed!!). The second is to try to create characters that evolve learning with their mistakes (as if everybody learned with their mistakes and stopped continuing doing them for all their lives!!!).Borrowing the words of Lisa Simpson (in one of those funny, crazy, genial, Simpsons' stories), the moral of Dorian Grays story is that it has no moral!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"All art is quite useless. Or so believed Oscar Wilde, perhaps the foremost member of the Aestheticism movement of the late nineteenth century. Wilde and his followers believed in art for art's sake: he thought his works needed no meaning beyond beauty. The Picture of Dorian Gray achieves some level of philosophical meaning nevertheless, but whether the book is worthy of the label 'genius' is questionable.This novel tells the story of Dorian Gray, a vain young man with a powerful personality. At the beginning of the novel Dorian has a portrait painted by the artist Basil Hallward, and Basil decides never to publish the painting because he put too much of himself into it. Dorian keeps the painting, wishing that its image would grow old while he himself stayed young. Eventually his wish comes true, and his increasingly Epicurean lifestyle causes the painting to rapidly age and grow uglier while Dorian himself stays young and beautiful.Despite its authors claims about art, the novel provides considerable insight into human behavior and the depths of apathy and vanity a man can reach. It is at times horrifying, but at others the writing itself can seem vain. Wilde often seems more concerned with flattering himself through his writing than with producing anything valuable which, of course, is consistent with his aesthetic philosophy, but that hardly benefits the reader, and I at least disagree with Wilde and believe that a work of art with no real value should not be considered art. Strewn throughout the novel are quotable passages which give the impression of intellectual depth but at closer inspection seem to contain little more than vanity: \\"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\\" \\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\\"I did enjoy the novel overall and found it insightful, but I think Wilde's writing is generally too selfish, which is a natural result of his philosophy: the core issue is that I disagree with his philosophy and am therefore bound to find at least some fault with the art it produces."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is quite a book. Mr. Wilde has quite a literary ability. His characters are as vibrant as a Van Gogh, his plot is tense, and he has quite a gift for quips and comebacks. All of this combines for a great piece of literature, regardless of the topic or story.This book explores the darker side of humanity, along the lines of Faust, Dr. Jekyll, and Lord of the Flies. We all feel this dread and anxiety deep within our soul; Wilde does not hold a mirror, but a picture for us to look upon and marvel. You get the chills up and own your spine as you watch Lord Henry seduce Dorian Grey.I think the high point of the story was in Chapter XI when Dorian sets a mirror next to the foul picture and goes back and forth looking at his baby-face and then the incubus in the painting. What is crucial is that Dorian is so detached: he sees himself as the smooth-faced god, but in reality, he is the demon in the picture. But his detachment is what is so crucial. He knows what his soul looks like, but he doesn't care!At times this books seems like a play, which has Wilde's native element. But the prose has such a smooth flow that you do not notice. I found myself constantly underlining Wilde's aphorism. He has a gift for one-liners, and his book is quite a charming read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book is very interesting, although it starts out slow.

Oscar Wilde was a \\"wild child\\", and he gives a glimpse into the often vain and decadant world of English society through the wanton excesses of Dorian...who appears to remain beautiful, youthful, and untouched by evil. It is Dorian's portrait that decays with every misdeed, including murder. The picture haunts Dorian as he travels among the rich, and also into the opium dens and low life of the waterfront. This edition contains a glossary of lesser known terms and references, for us modern folk. It was a quick and fascinating read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I knew relatively little going into this book...and what little I did know was from less than 100% accurate retellings such as in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen or references from cheesy shows or horror flicks (I think perhaps there was a reference in Scooby Doo somewhere?). I had the basic gist...there's a guy, Dorian Gray, who has some magical painting that ages while he stays young and wonderful forever. Not much to go on, but I was still excited to read it. I was pleasantly surprised that the book had much more depth to it.&lt;u>Plot&lt;/u>The plot is intriguing and has been used in other stories, though I think this one has more depth than I've seen before. Essentially, Dorian makes a wish that he will be forever as pristine as the painting made of him and that instead the painting will take on it the toils of his life. Whatever supernatural forces allow this to happen are irrelevant...the wish is granted.It's more than a simple \\"young forever\\" contract. Although age plays into the plot in a couple of places, the primary things that distorts the picture are the vices that Dorian engages in. The first transformation of the painting happens after an intense argument with the first woman he loved. It was interesting to me how quickly Dorian recognized the cause of the change for what it was, but had he belabored the motive for too long, the pacing of the book would have stalled and become unacceptable.Dorian uses his \\"power\\" to be ruthlessly reckless in his living. Dorian Gray becomes entirely uninhibited, taking everything to its limit, seeking absolute pleasure. He even sneaks out at night (so as not to tarnish his pristine reputation) to the \\"bad side of town\\" and lives a sort of double life in opium dens with gangs and prostitutes.In many ways (perhaps because I so recently read it), I felt many similarities to the morale commentary presented in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. I felt that Wilde did a better job of delving into the psyche of the hypocritical character, largely because we were able to get into Dorian's head and think and feel with him, while in Jekyll/Hyde, we were kept at a distance by a third person narrative.&lt;u>Characters&lt;/u>There are three pivotal characters in this book.The first, obviously, is Dorian himself. For the first many chapters (perhaps nearly the first half of the book in fact), I wasn't terribly pleased with Dorian as a character...he felt very flat to me. He was basically a mirror to one of the other primary characters (Harry) and didn't ever show his own opinion. He was hailed as pure and beautiful. Perhaps it's all the art references in the book, but I often felt as if Dorian existed more as a classical statue than as a living, breathing character. As his interaction with the 'picture' progresses and once he takes some rather unexpected steps, he became a deeper character and a lot of fun to be with.The second primary character is Lord Harry (or was it Henry...blast those Brits for swapping those names interchangeably so often *grin*). Harry exists as the provocative, cynical, always-with-a-comment-about-anything mentor to Dorian. Harry is absolutely encouragable and a lot of fun to listen to. His speeches often have to do with the pursuit of pleasure at any and all costs and the hazard of a virtuous and peaceful life. His influence over Dorian is profound. As I mentioned above, it often felt as if Dorian existed merely as a mirror for Harry's advice. Harry didn't seem to follow all of his own advice, but Dorian took it readily to heart and strove to live a 'come-what-may' existence. Harry had some of the funniest and most profound comments of the entire narrative. He's a fabulous character.The third character I want to point out actually existed as more of a background character, but I feel the need to call him out merely because of his pivotal involvement in the plot. I actually can't even remember his name now...but it will suffice to call him, \\"the artist.\\" He's the one who paints Dorian's picture. He's the one who introduces Dorian to Harry. He's the one who tries to give Dorian good advice to counter all the reckless advice that Harry poisons him with. The artist was kind of like Dorian's \\"Jiminey Cricket\\"...his conscious that was often (always?) ignored until it was far too late. He showed up in surprisingly few scenes considering the huge importance he had to the plot.&lt;u>Style, Pacing, etc&lt;/u>The language used in this book was truly beautiful. Wilde wrote flowing, vivid descriptions of characters, places and actions. At times it was very poetic. It may be a bit too flowery for readers who don't enjoy that sort of description...it came very close to being 'over the top' to me in a few places. Still, I generally enjoyed the formality of it and the life it gave to the text. The first dozen or two pages were tedious to me...whether because of the language or just the style and thematic pacing, I'm not sure.The pacing was a bit slower than I would have liked. The main difficulty I saw was that Wilde was trying to present so many themes that he often had to result to lengthy passages praising or condemning one thing or another. There were often very long monologues by one of the three primary characters mentioned above. Harry's were generally offset by bits that made me laugh by their extremity while speeches from Dorian and the artist sometimes made me want to slap them and tell them to shut up.&lt;u>Overall&lt;/u>I was a little torn on my overall feeling for the book. It took me a while to get into it and there were long passages that were drudgerous to push through. However, from a high level, this is one of the better books I've read this year...or even for numerous years. It had a plenitude of intriguing themes that left me thinking in between readings. It had a lot of humorous quips and paradigms as presented by Harry that I laughed out loud at. It had surprising twists and tension that left me curious as to the true outcome (as opposed to that from rip-off stories). There are a couple of spots that could be considered \\"climax\\"...the confrontation with the artist is the main turning point in the book. Personally, I would have rather seen more pages after that turning point than before it. I think the last 1/3 of the book was far more engaging. At the same time, the buildup was necessary to promote the intended mood.Overall, this is a book I definitely recommend, with the caveat that you should be aware that it does slow down at points. Just push through those. The overall work is worthy of a couple of slow zones. In fact, perhaps those slow zones serve the purpose of allowing more pondering.****4.5 stars"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This was a rather difficult book to get through.

The use of descriptive language and mood is exquisite.The only downsides that I can mention would be how slowly it moves in some spots. Once in a while, the story takes sort of a vacation, and you are given a lot of details that don't really apply to the overall plot. Some of the things that are discussed are good at shedding light on some of the things that Mr. Gray was doing throughout the years that this book took place, but they can get a little boring. Truth be told, I skipped most of one chapter because it went on, and on, and on about the things that piqued Dorian Gray's interest. It doesn't stop there, but it explains why it did, what he did about it, and some other people that he associated with while he was pursuing a certain subject, like gemology. In this edition, many of the names that are given through these pages are given an endnote in the back, but to the average person these don't hold much interest. Even to some hardcore fans of classic literature and Gothic Horror could find certain chapters (one at least) very tedious.That being said, there is certainly more good in this book than needed to balance out the less interesting parts. In the beginning, we get to see where the corruption of young Mr. Gray comes from. As the book progresses, you can see the corruption finally consume him, culminating in a surprising finale. I read at work, and my jaw dropped more than once, which I only realized after a co-worker brought attention to it. Even though most people have heard of the themes in the book, this is a fine example of taking an existing theme, and making it into a brilliant new idea.The ideas contained in this book can be a little disturbing to some with a weak stomach. Some of the language can be a little stiff and hard to read, but remember it was written in the 1890's.This book is highly recommended for anybody who has an interest in the Classics or Gothic Horror. Not for the faint of heart, but if it's ever crossed your mind to read The Picture of Dorian Gray, pick this book up! If you want to start reading Gothic Horror, I would suggest something a little lighter to start with -- Edgar Allan Poe, The Phantom of the Opera, or something like that. Those are a little easier, and give you a good idea of what the genre is all about.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\`So, Henry, how is that young Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of yours progressing, hem?Lord Henry paused to saviour his glass. Pleased, he set it down, just so, beside his dinner plate, and turned to Lord Fermor.\`Pundits say troubles come in threes, Uncle,' replied Lord Henry. \`What the pundits omit in their gabardine rush to spread their misery to others in a foolish attempt to alleviate their own, is that the best in life never travels solo. Take, for example, the wine and dinner before us. Both French. Together they constitute a meal to entice the gods down from the Mount. When did you ever come across a bad French meal, or a good French man? Yet when wine and food march together, they repay the Creator.'\`No doubt,' replied Lord Fermor, \`but you evade the issue. I asked about the young chap you have taken into your entourage, you know.' Lord Fermor struggled to recall the name, \`that chap who poses for Mr Hallward here.'Basil Hallward felt the heat of recognition first on his brow, then running through his whole body. A retiring man, more at home with his easels and sitters than at high table, he shrank from the public glare.Recognising the signs, though failing to sympathise with them, Lady Agatha piped up.\`Mr Hallword has many sitters, do you not, Sir.'\`Er, yes, indeed I do,' replied Mr Hallward, grateful for the prompt. \`For example, just today I encountered a young man of exquisite appearance, youth in all its pomp. He has promised to sit for me. Lord Henry, I fancy, will try to take him away and teach him of the world, thereby spoiling him as a object d'art.' He laughed to denote humour, simultaneously glancing at his friend to convey the serious meaning behind his joke. Keep away Lord Henry, the glanced announced, shielded behind the laughter. Keep away from this young man lest you send him on the eternal search for fulfilment and in so doing corrupt his soul.Lord Henry roared.\\"Why Basil, you surpass yourself! Hiding a serious message behind a joke so that you may deliver it in public. Would that the Good Book decked itself in such garlands, the better to frighten the masses. You are a greater artist than your canvasses know.'\`I fear my husband is avoiding your question, Lord Fermor,' laughed Lady Victoria. \`When it comes to hiding a serious message behind the veil of farce, he may rival Dante himself.'\`What is the name of your young beauty?' Inquired Lord Henry amidst the general humour. \`I only ask,' he pressed, \`so that I may avoid him. Let us hope I have more success than Eve, who expressed no desire to harvest the only tree in the garden that contained a serpent, until admonished not to. Of course,' Lord Henry continued, \`our Creator did not warn off the firstborn with laughter on his lips. Had he done so, perhaps we would be consuming ambrosia still. Mind you,' he reflected, \`this French cuisine is an adequate substitute.'\`Yes yes yes Henry,' broke in Lord Fermor, \`but what about your young Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e? Has he a fine future, seeking the dark mysteries of life of which you profess to be so fond?'\`Should he avoid hubris, I see for him a long, comfortable and satisfactory life.'\`And should he fail to avoid hubris?' teased Lady Agatha.\`Then I see for him immortality in print and prose. Hubris is man's affirmation of his living soul, his insistence that all must be as he ordains, and his rage that it is not. Should Basil paint hubris he would reveal Caliban.\`Modesty, on the other hand, is pleasing to the casual senses but fleeting, like snow on the chimneystack. Modesty and prose combine to produce the barely adequate. Hubris and prose combine to produce immortality, but not personal happiness.'\`And this choice, modesty of hubris, is one you see before Dorian Gray?' queried Mr Hallword.\`Dorian who?' Lord Henry responded. He reached again for the reassuring certainty in his wine glass. \`I was referring to my Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, Oscar Wilde.'"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is definitely a disturbing book. I think there is great worth in reading it, particularly when paired with a book such as Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe or Les Miserables by Victor Hugo. Contrasting Dorian's sordid downfall with with the heroic ascension of Uncle Tom or Jean Valjean is particularly beneficial.The Picture of Dorian Gray begins with Dorian, a young and handsome gentleman who is involved with philanthropy, sitting for a portrait while his new friend, Lord Henry, a sarcastic and hedonistic man of society, watches on. Dorian is described as being \\"unspotted from the world\\" and his beauty inspires the artist to his very best work. Lord Henry exclaims how lovely the portrait has turned out, but laments that it is too bad that the picture will stay young forever, whereas Dorian will eventually age and lose his youth and beauty. A vexed Dorian makes a wish that he will stay timeless and the picture will age instead of him.Taking Lord Henry as a mentor, Dorian sets out to apply Lord Henry's selfish and narcissistic worldview into nearly every facet of his life. In time, Dorian realizes that his wish has magically come true. He remains beautiful, while his painting takes on all the consequences of his wicked actions. As the debased Dorian sins more and more, the picture becomes more hideous and tortures Dorian's soul.Despite being filled with Wilde's signature wit, this is a haunting story showing the consequence of selfish character and the downfall of the soul due to despicable and hideous behaviors. Dorian loses his inner beauty long before he realizes that his soul's ugliness will destroy him.It's interesting to note that he chooses a French novel as his own Core Book, a personal classic which guided him throughout his life. In comparison, Uncle Tom and Jean Valjean both chose the Bible as their Core book. Near the end of the book, Dorian laments, \\"You poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive that. Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one. It does harm.\\"Wilde clearly shows that books exert an amazing influence over our lives. We must be wise in our choice of what we read. As Thoreau once said, \\"Read the best books first, or you may not have the chance to read them at all.\\" I would only add to that, \\"Read the best books most often, for they will color your soul.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A classic and moving novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde discusses man's desire for youth, as well as his involvement in vanity. A tale of two differing personalities, the story is enticing, yet grippingOscar Wilde does an excellent job of revealing the contrasting atmospheres throughout the book. He does a fine job depicting the lighter side of Dorian Gray with images of life and excitement for example when he is getting painted, the light is bright and it takes place near a garden filled with beautiful flowers. Wilde is also able to portray the dark and menacing side in Dorian Gray as he eventually commits murder. Dorian Gray comes off as such a complicated character which makes him so interesting. He wants to fulfill his desires but is unable to do so successfully. People can feel how each person has a part of Dorian Gray in him or her. We all have our flaws we want to fix, but we should not become obsessive over them or it leads to destruction as seen in the book.The story is fascinating in that it is able to capture reader's interest because the mysteries in the plot are so intriguing. Although the book has that characteristic gothic element of a man living without the fear of death or consequence, The picture of Dorian Gray is still an accomplishment because it is written beautifully through the character description.The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth the read, as readers are guaranteed to be captivated by the mysteries the character Dorian Gray holds."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Story:Dorian Gray is an adonis who is reminded or rather made attentive to his own beauty by a gentle artist friend (or lover) of his, Basil Hallward, who makes a breathtaking portrait of Gray. The portrait eventually becomes a favorite with Dorian, which also mirrors, in its painted face a sombre reflection of his own misdeeds and immoralities -- each time he commits it -- by growing uglier and uglier. He guards it with extreme care and caution everyday wanting none to see it found marred by his iniquities. Early in the story Dorian happens to meet with a reckless rich man, Lord Henry, a friend of Basil, who cares not a tithe for morality and its dull unattractive ways but believes in living life to the fullest at any cost. He preaches hedonism as sacred and purity a sin. Both Lord Henry and Dorian take an instant liking towards each other the day they meet. This friendship has an obvious deleterious effect on Dorian in that he kills himself repentantly after realising the worthlessness of his having lived a pompous, immoral, wicked and greedy life. Just before the story ends, he kills his well-wisher Basil too.How the story is arranged:Initially, the first few chapters seem to move fast and the story gains momentum. Just as the reader becomes inquisitive, a dull tone appears making the following chapters languorous. Wilde becomes a bit didactic in elaborating on the various interests Dorian picks on in his later adult life. Also, as one naturally imagines Dorian as a young lad, we then suddenly find him a thirties something in the last few chapters without a clear and smooth manifestation of this transition from adolescence to manhood. Most of Dorian's life is sinfully adventurous and in spite of that is portrayed quite uninterestingly. No events are specifically narrated upon and the emphasis on homosexuality can be smoothly sidelined. Overall, the story is good only if viewed as a philosophical inquest into human nature. Anything beyond that may disappoint the reader.Relevance, Reflections and Conclusion:The entire story is a narration of essentially how importantly one's mind makes one's personality, how one's personality makes one's deeds, and how in turn those deeds make one's soul. Of course we do not really fashion our soul, we only help it manifest it through our deeds. Gray's character is a reflection of the kind of narcissist weaklings in humanity who lack the courage to face their dark corners, while constantly finding strength and support in being mentored (actually misled) by feckless perverse people, like Lord Henry here, who lead them increasingly towards moral obscurity. How different the world would be if each one of us could reason out \\"responsibly\\" all that seems perverse and sacred, and yet not give in to anything perverse or sacred until one has found it true himself! I have also found the concept of blame game in this story very interesting. Do we not often dutifully blame others for our own darkness and failures, just as Dorian Gray blames his friend Basil Hallward for turning him into a deplorable narcissist? A responsible man always shares the burden of his own actions, rather than carelessly and callously point fingers at others -- a good lesson to learn! The story also raises deep philosophical arguments at every nook and corner if one plunges deep into the characters of the story attentively. Simple sentences like \\"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing\\" had me thinking and I found it strongly relevant in today's consumeristic hegemony. There are many more such dialogues which raise questions about the importance of femininity, marriage, purity, aestheticism and so on. Anyhow, to read it for its \\"own sake\\", or to try to finish it in a hurry, will certainly make it very boring and tiresome. But for those who inveterately love to question and investigate the world they live in with its various dogmas, theologies, philosophies and doctrines either propagating or thrashing morality, this book makes an interesting read. Since I do not possess a bent of mind that appreciates a tragic ending, -- I consider human life very precious --, I was sorely disappointed to see the protagonist, Dorian Gray, dead in the end. In fact I find this style of defeatist writing/ending a flaw in itself though it appeals to many. Plainly, if I were the author, I would have given my protagonist a new life, a new philosophy, a new guidance, and a new hope. HOPE...without which the entire humanity cannot exist."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is the real, classic story: a beaut!

I'm a fan of Oscar Wilde, and I could'ntmiss this great classical novel. The book is dominated by two amazing and strong personalities :Dorian Gray,a character full of life, and his friend and mentor Lord Henry Wotton.The story is deliciously dark and unusual, and as far as I know this is the only novel Wilde hadever written. It provides an interesting look on the society of the time through this multi-layeredstory, and Dorian Gray is a perfect representation of the human species. The novel depicts anundeniable influence of the French Decadence movement of the late 19th century, and allows thereader to understand better why it upset the British society that was emerging from the socialconstraints of Victorianism. I appreciated the beauty of his writing style, always elegant, witha flow that looks like poetry all along the book. The conversations exchanged are also witty andpoignant.Maybe some people could find the flow of the story quite slow, or with too many descriptions,which may not give enough room for imagination. Also the text was a little small, but remainedvery readable.Anyway, I highly recommend this book.

You're supposed to read it because it's a classic (no need for quotes around classic). On the other hand, it's pretty much about giving in to one's lesser wants and needs. We've all probably seen Dorian at one time or another. If we're lucky, we see him before the fall. There is something about a beautiful youth who has yet to fell the fingers of corruption. Many have seen him during the process of corruption (gosh...we may have even participated in said corruption). We've probably even seen him near the end of the process. Oscar Wilde's novel is brilliant. It covers the process of corruption very well. The ending is cliche, but it wasn't (probably) at the time.And, since I'm writing this for the e-book (uncensored), the model on the cover of the book is, ummmmm..., worth considering being corrupted by or corrupting."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This free classic version for my Kindle was very good!

Most of the book is what used to pass as witty dialogue between stifled, elite Englishmen and women. Most of this dialogue displays the thinking of a totally amoral Lord Henry who verbally paints everyone he meets as a slivered character reflecting his own amorality. To Lord Henry, one's belief in anything is proof of one's deranged thinking. Both he and Dorian experienced continued hedonism but with no gratification.The reader is forced to accept the premise that an artist painted the portrait of Dorian and in so doing captured the young man's soul on the canvas. While Dorian lived the portrait kept aging while Dorian retained his outer, youthful appearance. Thus no other living character in the story had any evidence of the aging ugliness of the portrait. At Dorian's death the living portrait, the soul of Dorian, returned to its pristine, youthful glow.Throughout the story the reader is joined with the character Dorian in accepting the portrait's brutal transformation. But with the array of deaths that followed Dorian's heartless cruelty the reader kept being confronted with the pointlessness of the tale. The reader would like to have witnessed Lord Henry's response to the apparent suicide of Dorian Gray who he worshipped throughout the tale.

After the forthy-somthing page the reader begins to understand that Oscar Wilde uses a lot of words to say nothing. And he does say something, you won't notice it because it's strangled to death with a lot of useless information.However, I do think the book does make a good read. You can't really blame Wilde for writing the way he does, since he, himself, says on the second page of this book: &quot;The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one adimers it intensely&quot;, and Wilde does admires his work intensely and for that we &quot;owe' it to him to read &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I enjoyed reading the book, and thought that it was a great allegory.

But, cultural handicaps aside, let's give Wilde his due: The book is a treasure trove of wit--from his brilliant epigrams to its very fascinating plot, which anticipates Magical Realism by at least 50 years.

It's easy to see why the book aroused so much controversy when it was released, and why it had an integral role in Wilde's subsequent imprisonment: the moral dilemna the book presents is disturbing even today. Wilde was truly a great writer; it's obvious from reading this book. Not only was his wit top-notch as is often ackwnoledged, but his prose is very smooth and polished, very refined. Wilde's attitudes towards art are well-known - indeed, he says in the book's introduction that \\"all art is quite useless\\" - but it seems obvious now that he was a natural talent. I hesitate to say things like He was meant to be a writer, but it certainly seems true of Wilde. This is one of the books that shakes our moral foundations. Wilde's high-class lifestyle is well-documented - it seems his surname was utterly appropriate - and one can definitely see where the plot and perhaps some of the details of this book came from his own experience. Undoubtedly, the main premise of the novel - a man selling his soul for eternal youth - most likely sprung from a desire that Wilde himself expressed. Perhaps he was having doubts about his hedonistic lifestyle even when this book was written, several years before his imprisonment. One can conjecture all one wants, but the fact remains that this book is a marvelous piece of work. The wonderful, polished prose is a joy to read - with aphorisms abound - and I, for one, see it as a deep regret that this was the only novel Wilde ever wrote. We missed out on a lot of great literature, especially with the general disdain the plays are now looked upon with in our society. Alas, read this masterpiece, and you will miss out less."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book in 6th grade and have loved it ever since.

After his two year sentence on Abnormal Sexual Vice his career literaly ended but even though he is gone, his writing is still fresh, enjoyable, and always a favourite."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"&quot;Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist...&quot; says Oscar Wilde's Basil Hallward - and every book is the author's autobiography. Wilde provides an irresistible coupling of his fascinating wisdom and seductive voice in THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY, a self-portrait.In a story of forbidden love, Wilde languishes in an idyllic setting eager with curous onlookers whom he delights in stimulating. He insists upon being provocative and alluring, taking 'strange pleausre in saying things that he is not sorry about having said.' THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is an image drawn by a lover whose passion for realism is transcended only by the hands of a writer who leaves everything to your imagination. As Dorian Gray protests, &quot;Let me think. Or, rather, let me try not to.&quot;But this IS a book about thinking - and deeply. A book that fathoms the deep erotic recesses of the human heart and speaks its language perfectly."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray was definately an excellent book, although the wording was somewhat outdated. It is an excellent piece of work, but I just had one question about it. Do you really think it was all Dorian's fault that everything happened? I believe Dorian's horrid fate would never have existed if Lord Henry had not been introduced to him. Lord Henry put outrageous ideas into an innocent litte head, and should be noticed as the fault of all of Gray's actions. It just killed me that no one realized what was really happening! But besides that question of fault, it was a grade A book, that I would read again, but not without a dictionary by my side. I recommend it to anyone who likes intelectual reading, and who is willing to sit through outdated talk. Just go for it, it's worth your time, and better yet... it's a short novel!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A tale of beuty, love, innocence and cruelty. Wilde did a wonderful job of telling the story of young Dorian Gray, a timeless beuty that never shows his age and whose face never displays his sins. He betrays close friends, is fuel for many a suicide, is down right cruel and unfeeling to any of his numerous loves, is selfish and self immersed; yet his young, beutiful face never shows a trace of ill being. Being in a room with him, drowns anyone with pleasure, peacefulness and charm- it is impossible to look at his face and believe that someone so sweet and innocent in looks would commit any of the evil he is rumored to have done. Instead of himself being affected, a portait of him as a young man endures the strain of his uncouth behavior.This timeless tale, set in England at the turn of the century, would be an excellent story line for any modern novel and would make a wonderful movie. Wilde's writting style is proliferic, poignant and delightful. It captures the language of the time period, yet was easy to read and easy to relate to. Wilde conveys the evil of the aestetic world and how it can drive one to stop at nothing for fear of losing it. And though he hints at such controversial topics such as drugs and homosexuality; it is neither detailed nor graphic; and is only slightly touched on. Throughout the novel, Wilde creates an image and lets the reader fully develop it for himself. I absolutley adored this book and highly reccomend it to anyone. Not for a moment did I think it dull, or too wordy. It is a very easy read (which is difficult to say of such a classic), and incredibly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book fits Wilde's description of a cigarette as a perfect pleasure - portable and brief, yet leaving you unsatisfied. Like Dorian Gray himself, this book is superficially charming, with its numerous and clever epigrams, but with some very ugly undercurrents, e.g. virulent anti-semitism, misogyny, and homosexuality. We never connect emotionally with Dorian Gray, who never matures into a complex or interesting character, but remains as some gay ideal with psychosis. Read Henry James' &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot; or Edith Wharton's &quot;Age of Innocence&quot; for a far better written, devastating attack on Victorian morals and hypocrisy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"THis book is not only about \\"The Picture Of Dorian Gray\\" but it is a few short stories by Oscar Wilde. His intellectual prowess not only perceives him as a mystical thriller but between the lines you can see the seductive yet fanatical characters he enlists. Before Stephen King his writing is considered fascinating and is still to this day one of the premier writers of history. Though his stories are not too long they embark on psychological journeys you won't want to miss. If you enjoy real writing from a talented, no commercialized, writer than you will love this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Although the entire book is solid, the dialog in the first chapter should be required reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"In roughly three weeks Dorian Gray starring Ben Barnes comes to DVD in the UK (and I intend to buy it. I have a region free DVD player and sadly there was never a US release of this film). I haven't seen this film version yet and I know it strays from the original novel but that's not the worst thing in the world. I've seen a version where Basil was a woman and it was set in the nineteen sixties with really bad acting. Now that was terrible. And there's also the 1944 version of The Canterville Ghost that turned it into World War 2 propaganda. So I don't mind what they've done with the Ben Barnes version of Dorian Gray.But since I am waiting for this adaptation I would like to write a review now for the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. I LOVE the work of Oscar Wilde. Allow me to stress that. I absolutely love the work of Oscar Wilde. My two favourite works of his are The Canterville Ghost and The Picture of Dorian Gray.The Picture of Dorian Gray tells the story of a young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. While he remains flawless, a portrait of himself grows uglier every time he sins. He cannot die unless you destroy the painting.Thanks to temptation and vice Dorian falls into hedonism and debauchery. As he externally remains pure and untainted his soul bears the burdens of his actions as reflected in the painting. Dorian learns the hard way that it's not physical beauty that matters but the inner beauty of one's own soul in qualities of kindness, mercy and compassion, things that he had lost along the way for selfishness, hedonism and greed.Dorian's fall from grace is a road lined with wit and humour. The story is riddled with clever epigrams (witty, short sayings) mostly said by the morally questionable character, Lord Henry.Lord Henry is a surprisingly naive character who plants bad ideas and temptations into Dorian's head while he, himself, doesn't seem to actually commit any sin he talks about. He even has the naive notion that people of their status don't do things like murder, as if such crimes are vices only of the lower classes.The picture of Dorian Gray is a very good and interesting read that talks about social conformity, morality, hedonism, and good and evil. The messages are not heavy handed and it's an intelligently written story.People of Oscar Wilde's era who called it an immoral book were made uncomfortable by Dorian's descent and lack of redemption but ultimately he was punished for his sins. Others noticed the subtle hints of homosexuality and bisexuality in the story but these things were kept subtle as this was a Gothic Victorian novel.Many people over-estimate how much homosexual content there is in this book or they don't see it at all but in fact it was actually very subtle and you only notice it if you are looking for it.However lines such as 'The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold. The curve of your lips rewrite history.' - which was engraved in a cigarette case given to Dorian by Lord Henry make the relationships obvious to the astute reader.The sexuality of the characters isn't even an issue. Poor Oscar Wilde was far ahead of his time in this regard.It's Dorian's decadence, hedonism and selfishness that cause his downfall and prove the moral lesson of the story; the value of the soul and inner beauty over external eternal flawlessness.Dorian might have had eternal youth and beauty but it was at the price of the eternal beauty and youth that comes from a good natured and kind soul. And Dorian, being an aesthete could only see this transformation when his soul was physically manifested in a portrait that changed with the changing of his nature.The 1940s movie adaptation of the story (the first film adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray) held the hope of redemption in showing that in acts of compassion the portrait could change for the better. This was something the novel lacked though it is still a fine novel.Oscar Wilde was right when he said there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. There's only well written or poorly written books and The Picture of Dorian Gray is very well written.This isn't an action packed thriller (though there are some intense moments). This isn't a romance about an immortal with a teenage lover (though something of that does happen). This is NOT Twilight. This story actually has substance.This is more of an exploration of a character's nature and all of human nature in the process, the flaws of modern superficiality, selfishness and hedonism and the power the spiritual can still have over human consciousness. It's sad that for all of Dorian's shallowness he had to physically see it to feel the weight of his conscience instead of just knowing what he was doing was wrong but this is the flaw of the character and the reason behind his downfall. Dorian was a true aesthete to a dangerous extreme. Oscar Wilde was making a statement about society that many even today either don't get or don't want to get.The Picture of Dorian Gray is written in a nice flowing prose. It's written in a third person perspective novel, not first person perspective, not alternating, and certainly not epistolary (which was a very popular style of fiction writing in Oscar Wilde's time).I strongly recommend The Picture of Dorian Gray.

It is a true classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was born in Dublin in 1854. He was a poet, playwright and author, though is perhaps a little more widely known for his wit. He studied at both Trinity College Dublin and at Oxford's Magdalen College - where he became a part of the Aesthetic Movement. At Trinity, he won the Berkeley Gold Medal while at Magdalene, he won the Newdigate Prize in 1878. He subsequently graduated from Magdalene with a double first - however, he failed to be elected to the Oxford Union, which is something I'd imagine they're very embarrassed about now. After a very colourful - though, at times, difficult - life, he died in 1900 and is buried in Pere Lachaise in Paris. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is Wilde's only novel, and was first published in 1891.Basil Hallward is a highly-regarded and well-known artist. As the book opens, he has just completed his latest portrait - one of his latest muse, a young gentleman called Dorian Gray. Hallward's friend, Lord Henry Wotton, thinks it's the finest work completed by Hallward and suggests it should be exhibited in the Grosvenor - Hallward, however, disagrees. He feels he has put too much of himself into the portrait, insisting it would reveal more of the painter than the subject. Basil has become obsessed with Gray : he sees him daily, and describes his presence as \\"absolutely necessary\\". Wotton naturally becomes intrigued, and is keen to meet Gray. Basil, on the other hand, wants to keep them apart - knowing Henry would be the worst possible influence. Unfortunately, Gray calls round unexpectedly and he has to introduce them...Basil's fears were well founded. By the end of their first conversation, Dorian is completely in Henry's thrall and is convinced that his youth and beauty will only gradually fail - leaving him with nothing of value. He offers his soul, if his looks remain as they are, while his portrait ages in his place. Under Henry's guidance, Dorian dedicates to the \\"new Hedonism\\" - and, in time, he notices the portarit not only ages but becomes more hideous with each sin.I found it difficult to see exactly how Basil and Henry came to be friends. Apart from a little pretentiousness and plenty of flouncing - especially in the book's early pages - they appeared to have nothing in common. I did find it a little difficult to take Henry seriously, though - luckily, for the book - Dorian proves to be as impressionable as he is vain. He is dominated by Henry's malign influence and - despite occasionally considering returning to the straight and narrow via Basil - generally remains happy to follow the path Henry set out for him. A book that gets better as it goes along, as it starts to deal with Dorian's internal struggles - and is certainly much better than some other classics I've read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have never read this book before getting it for my Kindle. I love it, the book makes you tink about how you conduct your life and how it shows on you.This book also gives the reader a window into the life of a the rich of England at the time. I find the book to be well writen, a great add (or like me a great beginning) to your classic collection."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oh what sinister fun! A morality tale wrapped up in a story dripping with homoeroticism and hedonism. I can't imagine how much pleasure Wilde had when he wrote this story and how much went on his head that never actually made it onto the page as a result of the laws of the time. This luscious, lusty Faustian tale is so dark and delicious; discreet when it has to be, suggestive when it wants to be. And the picture I have of Dorian Gray in my mind is that of the most beautiful man on earth--yes, we're all suckers for a bad boy, aren't we!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'm really not sure why a lot of people have not read this. It truly is a work that can only be appreciated when read and reread. This is my second time reading through the pages that Wilde weaves with this epigrams and curious cascading delight for words. Each sentence is as interesting and beautiful as the last as he speaks of sin conveyed in the most interesting of manners.Truly, Dorian is a fall from grace. A Lucifer that could have looked upon what he would become if he had the choice. Perhaps the concept of the Devil hanging over Dorian's shoulder is what makes this story so interesting. Sin never weathers Dorian's face, he remains as beautiful as he was when he was in the prime of the human age. Only the tell-tale signs of age and sin and hate and cruelty are etched upon the portrait that Basil so intricately painted. It is an ugly thing that portrays every crime Dorian ever committed. Even, towards the end of the novel, when he wished to become 'good' the old sin cannot be washed away. Even so, Dorian cannot conform to the 'good life' and instead forces himself to an unknowing demise because he cannot cope with the prospect of living a wholesome life. He would have to give up the sweet taste of sin, that which he had known without reprimand for years."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray is an exceptionally handsome young man, but when he sees his portrait and realizes his own beauty he wishes that the painting would grow old while he could remain young. At first he is mortified when he finds changes in his painted image, but influenced by a friend Dorian begins to seek the pleasures in life. No matter what depths he sinks to his handsome face remains unchanged, while the portrait grows uglier and more hideous, burdened not only by age but by his debauched lifestyle.I don't know if this work of literature is as widely read as it maybe once was but I was quite taken in by the story. It's interesting that Dorian, instead of using the portrait as a type of conscience to correct his actions, instead takes strange delight in observing the change. He revels in his freedom from outward consequences and digs deeper, delving into every pleasure. In some ways the separate manifestations of the individual reminded me ofDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, while his recognition of his outward appeal and how it would fade seemed to have shades of Bradbury'sDandelion Wine. And the character of Lord Henry is interesting, always in the background congratulating him and encouraging Dorian's sensual hedonism. But it's also a critique of society, both Victorian and today: we spend our time and money trying to reverse the effects of age (the gym, cosmetics and cosmetic surgery, etc.); companies spend billions idealizing (or idolizing) \\"youth\\"; and some even even seek to excuse away weakness and place blame elsewhere. In all, it may not be a perfect story but it's very interesting and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is the question I kept asking myself as I read through Oscar Wilde's book. The narrative is characteristic of the author's flamboyant nature and readers will find certain descriptions a little uncanny. Overall, this is an interesting story, written with purpose and to me this was the most important thing. Although the moral of the story has been copied over by many other authors (with slight variations), the dilemma remains the same - is one willing to sacrifice his internal peace for the price of the eternal beauty? The best answer to this question is a quote from Thomas Wolfe: \\"The surest cure for vanity is loneliness.\\"- by Simon Cleveland"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What would you do if someone or something else took all the falls for your sins?Dorian Gray made a life changing wish, that he might, forever, stay looking young and beautiful, that his portrait should bear all the marks of age and sin that would ever befall him. Under the influence of Lord Henry, whose philosophy rest entirely upon self gratification that looks upon those good in life as those who are too weak and timid to live life, Dorian Gray trades his youthful innocence for a life of self pleasure at what ever cost. As he falls deeper into sin, taking all those around him along, his portrait receives all the marks of sin while he remains looking as young as he was the day his portrait was finished. Even though he has been able to live his life the way he thinks is the best, doing whatever he wants and not paying any price for it, he winds up feeling loathsome as he is haunted at night by the deeds of his sins and Lord Henry's theory of \`relieving the soul through the senses' no longer works for Dorian. His portrait also haunts him as it tells of all sins. He tries to reverse the process of contamination by behaving in a way he thinks is good, but being good for selfish means is almost as bad as a sin, and though we may repent of our sins we still bear some scars from our past sins, so seeing no instant change he tries to destroy the painting, but the painting is a link to his soul.~And the moral of the story is don't live for self"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A book for all time.

It's quick, it's short, it's exciting, it's thrilling, it's very well written and it's a good summer read - I promise."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture Of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is set in London, England. This story is about a young man who grows to be a sinful and terribly vain man driven by love, beauty and art.The Main character, Dorian Gray, at the beginning of the book is a beautiful and youthful man. Dorian was a man everyone wanted to be around just because he had innocence and he was different. \\"He has a simple and beautiful nature.\\" Says Basil Hallward. This innocence and beauty changes as he becomes friends with Lord Henry and his values of life change him. Because Dorian was so nave, Lord Henry lured Dorian into a whole new life and new philosophies about love, beauty and selfishness. This is not the only deep friendship that is developed in this book. Dorian also becomes friends with Basil Hallward and Basil paints a portrait of Dorian and Basil puts his whole heart into this painting for it to ultimately destroy himself and Dorian. Anyway, Dorian wishes that he could stay young all his life and always be beautiful. As he grows older Dorian does many terrible and shocking things but he still remains beautiful and untouched while his painting of himself shows the real nasty, terrible, and corrupted Dorian.One part of the book that really captivated me is when Dorian murder's one of his good friends. I think this is one of the turning points in the book because I believe Dorian realizes that life shouldn't be based on the appearance of things but more about quality and spirit. Dorian understands that his lifestyle of upscale parties with London's elite, and his friendship with Lord Henry is not all that it seems to be. You can see that after Dorian murders someone he questions himself and the painting because he realizes what the painting has done to him. During the last pages of the book we can see how Dorian self-destructs and finds away to restore the painting of exquisite and youth.This book was very different from anything I read and I loved it. I like how Oscar Wilde wrapped me into this book with many compelling and interesting thoughts. The main lessons I learned from this book is question your role models and to value your life. Another lesson I learned is to not worry about beauty because if we only pick things that are beautiful we miss the wonderful and mysterious things that don't look pretty but deep inside they are."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel is one of the best books I have ever read. The story is fascinating, and one that most people have heard of--that Dorian Gray, a young, beautiful man, makes a fervent wish that he would never grow old, and that the portrait just painted by his artist friend would age instead. This occurs, leading Dorian down a path of debauchery and cruelty, most of which must have been too horrific for Oscar Wilde to go into detail without violating obscenity laws.The book is a masterpiece in examining manipulation. The artist introduces Dorian to a friend, Lord Henry, who calls Dorian's attention to his beauty, and Dorian, formerly innocent and sweet, becomes vain. It is amazing to see just how potent the power of suggestion is, and this novel demonstrates it perfectly.The writing is less than perfect. One chapter goes on and on about artifacts that Dorian has collected around the world, leaving the reader saying, &quot;Okay, and who cares?&quot; Wilde's prose is far from flawless, but the story is so engaging that the reader will be willing to overlook the imperfections and will be intrigued in spite of this."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This fascinating story of extreme narcissism and moral dilemna provides food for thought on the author's strange and sometimes twisted views on society as played out by the characters.

I find that rather offensive..."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book \\"Picture of Dorian Grey\\" by Oscar Wilde that I ordered \\"used\\" arrived with the front cover defaced by a pen being used to totally cover the picture's face and hands and then a sticker of a Freddy Crueger (sp) type mask placed over the face. There was no mention in the description of this used book as to the front cover defacement and I find that negligent."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is well-written, contains compelling ideas, and evocative. But it lacks substance. In my opinion this story is not really a novel because Oscar Wilde just uses it as a medium through which he can profess his views. While his views are not banal in the least, they are forced. He should not have to lower himself and preach to the reader."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was really looking forward to this book, since I heard glowing reviews about it. However, I found it to be perhaps the most excruciating reading experience of my life thus far (with the exception of mathematics texts), and I wish I could've given it 0 stars. I don't mind it when authors digress a bit from the story to reflect on a theme or two, but Wilde did it so often it seemed like I was reading a 100+ page philosophy essay on art. I think Wilde is a fantastic writer with an almost perfect sense of wit, and I think he had a good story, but something went wrong when he was writing the manuscript and he ended up making this novel a university lecture for his beliefs."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"which is a waste of paper. What makes me say that? Could it be that the sins are too vague or too outdated? No, I judged this book based on my enjoyment or lack of enjoyment in reading it. Wit without substance, characters without passion, dialogue without reason. I found myself reading other books just so I had an excuse not to continue reading this one. In the end all I can say to truly show how I feel about this novel is that this book BORED me. 177 pages of art that is 'quite useless'. The only reason I finished was because I hate to start a book then walk away and also I wanted to do review (and to do a review without finishing the book is unfair)."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book some time ago for a book club, and we all thought it was a total snooze. I really love reading classics, but this one was painful to get through. I swear there was a whole chapter on curtains."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"As was the case with quite a few other readers, I had been snookered into believing this was a near-universally lauded classic. Hello? The emperor has no clothes and this book has no redeeming qualities. The writing style was absolutely maddening!The only reason I read the entire thing was because I purchased the book and felt compelled to get my money's worth (not entirely possible with such a low quality \\"classic\\")After reading it in its entirety, I felt the type of satisfaction one feels after completing a particularly odious chore. Removing my copy from my home will be most satisfying. Bottom line: Boooooooooooooring!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Honestly - the book came brand new, but it didn't have any of the footnotes that other people's versions had. I was disappointed by that. Also, the pages are HUGE with small print. Don't get this version if you're reading it for a book club or school, you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I did not like this piece. I feel that Oscar Wilde used this as a semi-autobiographical vehicle to transport his radical, eccentric ideas and ideals. He speaks through his characters of Lord Henry and Dorian Gray. They seek to justify debauchery and murder and they kill off anyone who is good, kind, moral or differs in opinion with them. A good read, perhaps, for the likes of the 42nd president of the USA. This book falls far short of it's hype and offers absolutely nothing of merit."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"i thought that might get your attenton.this book takes your breath away. to be honest, i dont want everyone out there to go and read DG because it is too fine a thing for popular consumption and the ensuing dicussion.if you have a soul, read this book. if not, find one."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"My feelings about this book are nicely summed up by Dorian Gray's description of a hedonistic book he has received from Lord Henry Wotton: \\"I didn't say I liked it...I said it fascinated me. There is a great difference.\\"The basic plot of the story is well known: thanks to mysterious/magical intervention the physical consequences of Dorian's action affect his portrait rather than his physical body. Urged on by Lord Henry Wotton (whose shocking/amusing/wicked epigrams are classic Oscar Wilde), Dorian descends into a life of ever-increasing debauchery, manipulation, hedonism, and the love of beauty above all else.Wilde brings up a number of themes in sometimes dizzying succession: the ability to \\"dominate\\" others, beauty as the supreme virtue, self-actualization as the guide to morality, yielding to temptation as a means of getting beyond temptation, physical consequences vs. consequences in general, the fascination of wickedness, etc. It is often unclear where Wilde stands on these matters since their proponent is Wotton who is \\"wicked\\" and the cause of much suffering, but speaks in the manner of Oscar Wilde. The moral ambiguity of the story lets the reader draw their own conclusions...fascinating."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Part humorous fable, part mystery, part gothic suspense, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is another example of the late 1800s fascination with the soul, the senses, and science.Dorian Gray is a mere teen when the story begins, the muse of a local gifted artist, who paints Dorian's portrait in hopes of capturing his youth and beauty. Dorian's charm is also appreciated by Lord Henry, a rascally fellow, able to twist phrases and morals with his sly tongue. His winsome ways captivate Dorian, but Dorian soon finds himself pulled in the direction of a beautiful actress as well. These two loves tear Dorian in different directions, resulting in unexpected turns of events that send him down a road of sin and pleasure, though never with the rewards of true happiness. As his actions lead to even more drastic results, he finds himself fearing every shadow and questioning his own sanity.These events do not occur in a vacuum. With Dorian's sliding moral state, the portrait of his beauty begins reflecting the dark decay in his soul. Even as his own face refuses to age or show corruption, the painting becomes uglier by the day. Dorian is both fascinated and appalled by this. When, at last, he faces the consequences of his own selfish choices, he makes one final decision to try to destroy the evidence.I laughed aloud at many parts, particularly early in the book, then found the tone growing eerie and black. What a thought-provoking book! And one that kept my attention throughout. This is no glossed-over portrait of Mr. Gray, but a grisly depiction of evil--even when it masquerades in a cloak of civility.Oscar Wilde joined other writers of his day--H.G. Wells, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Joseph Conrad--in wrestling with concepts of the soul and the senses in the light of scientific discoveries. What about the conscience? Where did theology and psychology fit in? What about free will? In the last few pages, Wilde paints his own sobering portrait of a man who has tried to live as though the soul and senses have no effect on each other.This now ranks as one of my favorite classic novels. The results of Dorian Gray's experiment serve as a mirror for all those who consider themselves holy, heathen, or hypocrite."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is another one of those classics that I'd heard mentioned in passing or read about but never actually sat down to read. It's short, only 200ish pages long - but don't let the short length of it deceive you, it packs a fairly powerful punch.The premise fascinated me from the moment I read it. Innocent young man who manages to remain that way on the outside, but a portrait of him changes to reflect the corruption of his soul. Fascinating, no?I'm positive that this book has been dissected and analyzed from all sorts of different points of view, so let me tell you what I got out of it.I felt the tragedy, deeply. The corruption of a soul is something that is unpleasant to read, unpleasant to see and seeing the effect it has on others is difficult to deal with at times.It's interesting because I read this novel while I am still continuing to work my way through George Eliot's Middlemarch. Whereas I am having such a difficult time relating to and feeling emotions from Eliot's characters, there was such a wealth of emotion being poured out of Wilde's it was almost overwhelming. I felt the passion of love and the despair when it was lost.By the way dialogue was incredible, it makes the book, honestly. I highly recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it. And if you haven't read it in a while, go back and read it now. It's going on my \\"yearly re-read\\" shelf for certain."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I've always known the basic premise but never actually read The Picture of Dorian Gray. Also like many here, I couldn't resist the free version after reading the reviews. The story is original (though of course well told after over a hundred years of publication) and the writing is eloquent and witty. I agree that the chapter about Dorian's exploits and collections did drag on a little but it acted as a segue from youth to middle age and was kind of necessary to show how the years were passed. Otherwise, the entire work was very engaging. I highly recommend reading this book!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have heard a lot about this book and, having read a few of Oscar Wilde's plays and enjoyed them, decided to give it a try. Overall is was a good book, if a bit inconsistent in pacing at times.Dorian Grey is a beautiful young man, who is corrupted by a Lord to worry about how his looks might one day fade. While a portrait of him is being painted he wishes to never grow old. Later he realizes that the portrait is changing to reflect any cruelty in his nature, yet he remains the same.Oscar Wilde is a genius at writing. The cleverness of the language he uses and the sharpness of the commentary on society is deftly done and makes the story a joy to read, most of the time. The footnotes in this version of the book help to explain some of the more subtle jokes that I would have missed without them.The book does have some flaws, especially when compared to modern literature. Wilde takes nearly half to book to set up his characters. You can tell Wilde is a playwright at heart because many of the characters wander off into multiple page long dialogues that get to be a bit too much and sometimes a bit boring. Even in the second half of the book there are times where Dorian is reading from the book he is obsessed with and it just goes on and on and on.The second half of the book is by far the strongest. Wilde stimulates the imagination by talking about Dorian's unspeakable acts but never revealing what the majority of the horrible acts are. I was a little disappointed that there isn't a lot more to the plot than what you read on the back of the book. That being said, the end of the book is remarkable and really made the book a wonder to me.Overall this is a very interesting book and worth the read. Some of the lengthy dialogues can get a bit trying to read through, but most of the book has a quick wit to it that is amusing. The ending of the book holds some wonderful surprises. I would recommend reading this, especially if you are a fan of Wilde's writing style."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde (1856-1900) is best known today for his witticisms and classic plays such as \\"Lady Windemere's Fan\\" and \\"The Importance of Being Ernest.\\" However, Wilde also wrote short stories, poems and in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" a short but fascinating novel.The tale is a retelling of the Germanic legend of Doctor Faust. Young Dorian Gray is influenced by the evil Mephisto figure Henry Wotton to make a pact with the forces of evil. Gray will not age despite a career of debauchery, decadence, opium usage and murder. However, the portrait of him by the artist Basil Hallward will age as Gray descends into an inferno of crime.The Marguerite love interest from the Faust legend is young Sybil Vane. Sybil is a \\"vain\\" callow actress who portraits the great Shakesperean female roles such as Rosalind, Juliet and others every night on the stage of a seedy London theatre. Gray marries her but she commits suicide since the girl realizes he fell in love with the stage heroines and not herself. Sybil's brother the sailor Jack Vane will return from sea to seek out vengeance against Dorian Gray. He will be unsuccessful being shot during a hunting accident on a wealthy estate at which Gray is spending a weekend. Basil Hallward is the young artist who will be murdered by Gray who is driven mad by the haunting picture of himself. The novel ends in a way never to be forgotten by the reader.Oscar Wilde published this short novel in 1890. In many ways it resembles the better book \\"Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" published in 1886 by Robert Louis Stevenson. That earlier work, like Dorian Gray, also looks at a character with a divided self in conflict with the norms and morality of society.Wilde's book is filled with aphorisms most of which are delivered by the cynical Henry Wotton The author is good at painting a scene so we feel as if we ourselves were in the garden and drawing room of wealthy Dorian Gray's London home or seeking an opium den in the foggy slums of fin de siecle London.The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of the best selling classics in the Penguin Classics catalogue. It is a satisfying piece of fiction which will make you think on the nature of evil, the human mind and how role playing and mask wearing are part of everyday life."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have read this book many times, and enjoyed it more each time that I did. I have to admit that Lord Henry's wit and wisdom was what kept me coming back to the book, not the important and intellectual issues about art, life, temptations and all the literary matters. I know there are other reviews with the literary facts and theories presented there, better than I can, so I'm not going to try.All I will say is this is a classic, worth more than 5 stars, should be read by everyone at least once in your life, first for the great writing, if its your first time reading Wilde, this is a great book to start with. You should read it slowly, because Wilde is a word smith, no words for words sake, each one polished like the gems that they are. If one could speak like he wrote one would be like a god, or have a late night talk show better than all others.Second, this is a good, clear and complete edition, so now you have no excuses, read on MacDuff, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses.

Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\\"\\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\\"- \\"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\\"- \\"They were defeated.\\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context.

Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems?

It is beautifully done like a silk tapestry or a work of art. His ideas about life and what place art has in life are equally as interesting. It is obvious to the reader from the moment he or she picks up the book that it is mostly about art, as the title itself shows---The Picture of Dorian Gray. It becomes clear to the reader Art was the true basis for this book. Dorian himself is a physically beautiful man who collects art, and he enjoys all the splendor of a fashionable existence. Oscar Wilde was a man who also shared interest in these things so it clear that the base for his most successful book is his ideas about art ( as show in the preface) the relation ship between artist observer and art. The characters in this book are playing the parts of his opinions of art wonderfully and in doing so reveal to the reader their inner most thoughts and feelings.Dorian and his painting that he holds so dear each have a different place in Oscar Wilde's ideals as the art and the artist .One of Oscar Wilde's statements about art is \\"The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and conceal the artist is the artist's aim\\". (3). Dorian's outside appearance that he \\"reveals\\" becomes an illusion, a sort of mask, which hides or \\"conceals\\" his inner unhappiness and inability to live. Dorian's outer persona becomes his \\"art\\", the elegant illusion that he offers to the world, while his inner feelings are the \\"artist\\". Dorian's \\"artist\\" is his soul, but in fact while he is revealing this beautiful surface to the world and enchanting everyone he is concealing his true self. He separates himself from the aging and corrupted painting. Putting on this act is to \\"conceal the artist\\" which is the artist's aim. For Dorian Gray, hiding away all signs of aging and keeping up a surface youth, beauty, and innocence is creating himself as a work of art. This point is further illustrated in the text when after basil's visit to him he nearly goes mad about protecting his painting or his soul \\"when his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly, and wondered if he had thought of peering behind the screen.... yet he thought it best to be on his guard...his eye fell on a large purple satin coverlet heavily embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century Venetian work ...Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing...Now, it was to hide something that had a corruption of it's own, worse than the corruption of death itself-something that would breed horrors and yet would never die.\\"(103-4). The most obvious point that this paragraph shows is Dorian's need to \\"conceal\\" his soul or himself. The Venetian coverlet symbolizes Dorian's \\"art\\" or need for splendor and beautiful things to conceal his true identy. Dorian's need to conceal himself is shown with literal symbolization he is taking his art or Venetian coverlet and putting it over his \\"painting\\" to hide his soul. As the paragraph goes on he describes the painting or his \\"soul\\" in a way that shows you his true feelings about his soul he thinks of himself as being corrupt, horrible, and worse than death and naturally wants to separate his art or outter self from his painting or inner self. Oscar Wilde's theory's about art and artist's relationship connects perfectly with Dorian grays feelings about himself.Dorian has no conscience about other people's feelings because he does not expect his own which relates to Oscar Wilde's opinion that an artist has no ethical sympathies. Oscar Wilde says, \\"No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style\\" (p. 3). Dorian seems to be without human emotions. He remembers his parents only through their outward appearance--- the lips or shape of the face that he has inherited. He does not remember their feelings for him or his attachment to them. It may have been that he was raised without emotional ties. The only time that his family is mentioned, Dorian calls his memories of them hateful (p. 103). In Victorian High society, feelings and emotions were considered less worthy than opinions or ideas. This has caused Dorian to grow up and not understand moral conscience he believes that the only thing that is important is new innovation and ideas, because he was taught to be that way. That is demonstrated when he decides to show Basil his soul:\\"You can tell the whole world about it afterwards, if you choose. Nobody would believe you, if they did believe; they would like me all the better for it. I know the age better than you do\\" (p, 133). He says that his age---the end of the nineteenth century---was more pre-occupied with style than substance, so his youthful glamour---and the fact that the had a secret for escaping ageing---would inspire envy and imitation, not horror. But it is show in the story with basil's reaction to the painting or his \\"soul\\" that people will in fact be horrified by someone who destroys their soul by keeping themselves enterally young and beautiful or renovating their \\"art\\". And by saying \\" I know the age better than you do \\" he is actually proving the opposite and that he doesn't have any ethical sympathies because he so obviously doesn't the nineteenth- century does care about a persons soul. It also relates to the modern day struggle over plastic surgery whether it is a way to keep yourself beautiful or a way to become obsessed with your appearance and destroy your morality you could say that a modern day Dorian Gray is a Michael Jackson someone who is once loved and admired by his public but then after turning to plastic surgery and shopping to better his appearance he becomes a joke and loses his admiration much like Dorian Gray. They both do not relate to the public and have lost their moral conscience do to constantly trying to better their appearance or better their \\"art\\". Dorian Gray doesn't understand other people's ideals because he is not willing to except the fact that he thinks of his internal self as an ugly disgusting thing. Dorian plays into Oscar Wilde's opinions about artists not having ethical sympathies because he does not understand moral conscience of his society. He also shows the reader his inner feelings that he thinks of himself as something awful.Basil and Dorian are like art and observer basil's ideals about Dorian are mirrored on to him. Basil Howard's influence is reflected in this quote from the preface; \\"All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their own peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" (p. 3). The spectator in this story is Basil Howard. Basil Howard sees Dorian through his own eyes as a beautiful young man who is full of life and innocence. Basil's soul of truth, love, kindness and caring for others is put into his painting. Dorian's external appearance is appreciated by a spectator (Basil) so it begins to mirror what the spectator sees, and other people also come to see Dorian as a prince of art. Like when an observer looks at art they interpretative it in their own way. This is shown when basil comes to talk to Dorian about the way he is perceived to society \\"I want you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you. I want you to get rid of the hateful people you associate with...you have wonderful influence, let it be for good and not evil\\" (p, 132). This shows basils admiration for Dorian and the way that he thinks of Dorian that it mirrored in the way that he will see him. He is in fact saying that he wants to lead a life where the world respects him and that he has wonderful influence because all he knows about Dorian Gray is what he knows about himself. In the page before basil talks about Dorian's face and the way that he looks means that must not be a bad person but that is only a surface opinion, like that you have of art, once you learn something about the artist, you interpret in another way. Basil doesn't know Dorian's \\"artist\\" or soul he doesn't see him he only sees himself, so basils beautiful heart and soul are projected onto Dorian's appearance. Again Oscar Wilde's ideals of the relationship between the artist and the spectator are interpreted on to his characters Dorian is just a mirror of basil, Just as art is just a mirror of the spectator. It also shows that basil wants to respected by the world, and have wonderful influence.A person could spend days and pages and pages explaining why Oscar Wilde's ideas of art reflect on the characters of The Picture of Dorian Gray and what it reveals about the characters true feelings. Here are the most important Dorian Gray and his painting reflect on the his ideas of the artist and the art, Dorian Gray and his ideas of artists not having ethical sympathies, and that Dorian and Basils relationship is the same as the art and the artists relationship.

But right-wing orthodox Catholic monarchist readers will be required to steel themselves through the first two chapters which consist of a drawn-out slap fight between Elton John, Graham Norton and Ian McKellan. Now I like a cat-fight as much as the next guy, but a tussle among effete Brit cats with man parts is just icky. So the narcissistic homo-erotic banter opening the book was significantly under-appreciated by this reader. But after you get through those chapters the book gets much, much better.It is difficult to maintain that the book represents a defense of amoral Aestheticism, since the embodiment of the aesthetic ideal, Dorian Gray, is shown to be a damned man. That is not to say that Wilde embraces Catholicism in the novel, as the narrator often posits confusing opinions on issues of conscience and sin. At times Wilde seems to suggest that only immoderate (quantitatively speaking) behavior is immoral; and yet, at other times, it appears some actions themselves ought to be avoided. Is Wilde acknowledging that there are exceptionless moral norms? And what is the reader to make of rotten Wotton, whose epigrammatic phrases seem so akin to Wilde's? Hallward points out that Wotton's cynicism is a pose. He never says a moral thing, but he never does a wrong thing. So are we to take his Wilde-isms seriously? Are we to take Wilde seriously? Wilde says art is neither moral nor immoral, yet Gray is poisoned by A Rebors, a book by another decadent author who, oddly enough, also converted to Catholicism. And then there's the picture itself, the fruit of Hallward's homosexual obsession, which is clearly cursed, in spite of its initial apparent beauty.Wilde's protests notwithstanding, it is a book with a moral informing the reader that he cannot escape his conscience, that he cannot reject nature and nature's God, and that the wages of sin are death. But therein lies hope, for if God is to be believed regarding the wages of sin, then why should we doubt Him regarding our Redemption? Unfortunately, this message is made ambiguous by an author who, rather than unintentionally creating a distorted image of an idea that cannot be fully represented, intentionally peppers the novel with paradox for the sake of cuteness. But the Truth is not cute. He's terrifying, and Wilde knows better. Therefore the book is best left to the orthodox or the decadent. The lukewarm will simply be confused."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"For me, The Picture of Dorian Gray was a tedious read. I did not particularly enjoy it that much, although I acknowledge that it is a good piece of literature. It is very well written and full of details and vivid descriptions. The story is told artfully and exquisitely but I found it long-winded and difficult to get through at times. Many people would enjoy a book like this, but it was not for me. I couldn't relate to the British aristocracy system and was utterly appalled at how unbelievably shallow the characters were, although Wilde was probably going for that effect. I was also disappointed with the ending. I thought the point of the novel would be to eliminate the stereotype that bad people are ugly, but it just perpetuated it. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a book that makes them think. It is also recommended to people who like books from this era (late 1800's) and have a lot of time on their hands."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray has to be one of Ocsar Wilde's best books. This book, which takes place in 19th-century England, signifies the high price one young man had to pay for eternal youth.Basil Hallward, a mediocre painter, became infatuated with an extremely hansom but innocent young man, Dorian Gray. It was Dorian's picturesque beauty which inspired Basil to paint his best picture ever. Overcome by the beauty of his youth, Dorian wished that he would ramain young forever and that the portrait would deteriorate with age. However, when Dorian realised that his wish had come true and the picture took on the effects of his sins, his lifestyle signifcantly altered. Dorian went from leading a normal aristocratic life, to living a secretive life full of sin and slander.This book is proof that one can not be happy with youth and beauty alone. The suffering of Dorian Gray shows us that there is more to life than mere beauty. Dorian's life was ruined by a simple wish to be forever young. Although no one can stay young forever, this novel is a key example of why one should not simply focus on base characteristics such as youth and beauty, for these things will always fade."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This edition is slightly shorter than the others available, but it is the ONLY one whose text reflects Wilde's true intentions. Don't be fooled by the other editions claiming to be the \\"unabridged\\" or \\"complete\\" version. The material Wilde added later was meant to make the novel seem more morally edifying. It makes the novel worse. This one is WAY better -- and also way dirtier. A bunch of the more explicit stuff was cut by Wilde's editor. The editor of this ebook version has restored it all, based on Wilde's actual typescript, which he went and consulted in an archive. If you're a homophobe, get the other, more \\"moral\\" versions. If you want to read one of the great modern novels as the author wanted you to read it, get this one. You won't regret spending a couple of extra bucks."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's strange and intriguing mind is apparent in this book, which is full of interesting concepts and bizarre happenings. Dorian Gray, a young man who is obsessed with his own good looks, befriends an English Lord and a struggling painter. After Basil, the painter, finishes Dorian's portrait, they are stunned by its magnificence and how lifelike it appears. Seeing this, Dorian is angered when he realizes that the portrait will live forever and retain its beauty while he himself is left to age. Dorian decides to trade his soul for everlasting youth, and to always retain his beauty, just like the portrait.Since Dorian believes himself to be immortal, he dabbles into various sinful acts. He carelessly pursues a relationship with Sibyl Vane, an actress, constantly letting her down and breaking her heart. Dorian is involved in several mysterious deaths, and he even explores the London underground opium scene. Even though Dorian does all of these things, somehow he remains young, to the surprise of his peers. In the end, however, Dorian receives the punishment he deserves through a series of bizarre events. The &quot;what goes around comes around&quot; theme is strongly emphasized in the conclusion of the novel, which serves as a fitting end for Dorian's struggle with sin.This classic literary work is frequently exciting, but can sometimes delve into the monotony of 19th century British affairs (which may be a little tedious.) All in all, the novel is a wonderful concept which is given life by the genius of Oscar Wilde. It is a perfect research topic as well because it contains many themes which can be applied to anything from English rhetoric to the Original Sin. I myself wrote a term paper on the book and it was very easy to express my ideas because Wilde is so straight forward in his literary agendas. So, whether you pick it for required reading or just for pleasure, The Picture of Dorian Gray is definitely a good choice."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Nota Bene: Once purchased, my Kindle download page contained this note near the download button: \\"This title has complex layouts and has been optimized for reading on Kindle DX's larger screen, but can still be viewed on other Kindle devices.\\" This message disappeared after a few minutes.Regardless, the formatting on my Kindle 2 looks good.

The uncensored version is much richer. The other reviews have made very good points concerning this book - I can't improve upon them, but I can simply say that this is a version of the book that is well worth buying if you appreciate Oscar Wilde and The Picture of Dorian Gray. I am glad that I bought it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray is a thought-provoking novel that vacillates between ambling, seemingly directionless conversation and a riveting narrative thread that eventually bubbles up to the surface with the intensity of a volcanic eruption. The Picture of Dorian Gray, though not much more than a century old, has already been deemed a \\"classic\\" by literature-lovers, and after reading the book, I can understand its status. Wilde's command of the English language is almost unparalleled in recent literature.Warning - Spoilers FollowHere's the gist of the book. Dorian Gray is a young man whose physical appearance is handsome and innocent. An aspiring artist paints a beautiful portrait of Dorian. Dorian wishes that he always look like his youthful appearance in the portrait. The wish comes true. Dorian remains the same - youthful and charming, but the portrait begins to transform itself into the image of his soul.When Dorian embraces a life of hedonism, he uses his good looks and charm to obtain whatever he desires in life. His insensitivity drives a friend to suicide. The evil desires of his heart eventually cause him to murder a friend in cold blood. Over a period of twenty years, Dorian becomes a monster on the inside (reflected by the portrait of his soul) even as he remains youthful and innocent on the outside.Oscar Wilde's homosexuality is no secret, and the reader can easily discern certain homosexual overtones in the book (especially at the beginning). Perhaps Wilde's subtle innuendoes of homosexuality have made his works so appealing to lovers of literature who tend to sympathize and approve of homosexual behavior.Upon reading Dorian Gray, however, I could not help but notice how the lifestyle of hedonism is so implicitly condemned by the narrative's outcome. If Dorian's hedonism includes sexual relationships with men as well as with women (and Wilde does hint at this), then homosexuality comes under the same umbrella as the rest of Dorian's sinful passions. One can hardly characterize The Picture of Dorian Gray as a pro-homosexual book.Readers of this blog will find the picture of depravity in Dorian Gray to be intriguing. Throughout the story, Dorian, even in his hedonism, acts in a manner that forces the reader to desire justice and redemption. The book's end emphasizes the need for punishment and retribution - pointing at death as the wages of sin.What does the life of unbridled hedonism look like? What does it do to the soul? What happens to the human being who seeks to fulfill his every passion and desire? How does sin affect us physically? Do we age because we sin? These and more are the questions that Oscar Wilde raises in The Picture of Dorian Gray."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\\"l'art pour l'art\\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \\"Bosie\\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \\"posing as a sodomite\\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \\"gross indecencies,\\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \\"hard labor\\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \\"immoral\\" book, if \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \\"care twopence\\" - could consider this novel \\"perverted,\\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \\"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \\"[a]ll art is quite useless,\\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a classic novel about the consequences of eternal youth. Young Dorian Gray promised his soul in exchange for the favor of his body never aging. Instead, a portrait of him grows older in his place. An eerie idea, indeed.While the concept and story itself are extremely interesting it was not the best execution. As another reviewer pointed out, it's not the easiest read for a modern reader. While the passages did not confuse me they did occasionally bore me. I found the book hard to get into - and once I got into it I had a hard time keeping interest.I do not doubt Wilde's credibility as an author in the slightest I feel that, as a modern reader, this is a book that may not stand the test of time as well as others. An extremely interesting idea, but the book feel a bit short."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book was given to me as a gift. I didn't really intend on reading it, but after fumbling through the first chapter, I was intrigued and soon thereafter was captivated by it. This book has mixed themes that are gothic horror at one moment, amoral and corrupt the next, followed by social political statement. I have not read a book before that compares with this one and is indeed one of the best that I have read. This book is full of quotes and one liners that are striking, thought provoking, and even horrifying to the reader. The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great book to read and discuss with a friend or a book club."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'm a sophomore in high school and usually I don't go for these older, classic books. Usually they bore me so much I can barely finish them. However, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was an exception to this rule. Though the language was a bit more intricate than is commonly found in the books of today (at least the ones I like to read), I found it to be more elegant and eloquent than tiresome and confusing.This book, with all of its discussion of morals, evil, and purity really is a window into late 1800s of England. Despite this, I found the book to actually be interesting. The real appeal this book held for me was its wonderfully potent imagery and mildly creepy, definitely surreal theme. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is also a very short book, which I thought was pretty cool because I don't have a very long attention span concerning books. In spite of how today's people are probably a great deal more jaded concerning morals, or rather the lack thereof, than the people of Oscar Wilde's time, a lot of this book was fascinating in an almost perverted way. That aspect is offset by the theme of good vs. evil, however. The only faults I found with this book were minor details concerning the definitions of good and evil, issues which I think this book was meant to rise anyway.If you're a parent or someone looking to buy a classic book for a friend or relative in high school, I think this would be a pretty good choice, assuming they like books. The vocabulary seemed fairly advanced to me, but they ought to be able to handle it. The conflict between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" in this book is engaging, and the nature of the book is such that the reader has difficulty simply viewing matters in black and white. This makes the book deeper and more interesting to read. The transformations that occur in this book are slightly haunting, and at the end of this twisting tale of corruption and beauty lies a powerful, sudden, and very awesome ending. I really think that everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Four stars because it's a bit slow at times.

It was a true page turner. It left me wondering about Oscar Wilde's state of mind...LOL!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"With his life spanning the later half of the 19th Century, Oscar Wilde wrote in a wide variety of mediums, ranging from poetry to plays and from essays to fairy tales, and one novel. His fairy tales are arguably the most accessible of his writings, and as is the case with fairy tales revolve around some moral theme being conveyed. For instance in \`The Selfish Giant' a giant places a wall around his garden to keep the children out, and thus spring never comes on his garden, causing him to realize the result of his selfishness. Similarly in \`The Star-Child' a beautiful boy is forced to come to terms with his prideful cruelty.The Picture of Dorian Gray can be seen as a continuing of this fairy tale manner of writing, except in novel form (though even then the novel is fairly short).The story begins in the art-studio of Basil, a painter who is putting the final touches on what is said to be his most greatest painting. With him is Lord Henry, a shallow obscurantist of high society who upon hearing of the figure in the portrait desires to meet with him - the figure being that of a young and impressionable Dorian Gray. The two become friends and eventually the philosophy of Lord Henry begins to have its affect on him.In the words of Lord Henry, this amounts to \\"if one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream-I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal-to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it may be... The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\"Throughout the course of the novel Dorian comes to embrace this ideal, giving into his own inner nature: \\"Eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins-he was to have all these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame: that was all... For there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He would be able to follow his mind into its secret places. This portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him his own body, so it would reveal to him his own soul. \\"Thus Dorian Gray enters into a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde type of scenario with himself where he resolves to do away with his conscience - where Mr. Hyde reveals the truth of Dr Jekyll, the portrait comes to reveal the truth of Dorian Gray, and before the end he must come to face that truth.The book is enjoyable, and at around 180pgs can be read in an evening. Like his fairy tales it comes away with a moral, though modern renditions of the character seem to miss this point.Memorable Quotes:-\\"You know how I love secrecy. It is the only thing that can makemodern life wonderful or mysterious to us. The commonest thing isdelightful if one only hides it.\\"-\\"Modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one's age. I consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality.\\"-\\"Ah! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed thatthe portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep theunsullied splendour of eternal youth! All his failure had been due tothat. Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sureswift penalty along with it. There was purification in punishment.Not \\"Forgive us our sins\\" but \\"Smite us for our iniquities\\" should bethe prayer of man to a most just God.\\"Specific CriticismsI don't believe I have any real criticisms or complaints about this book. I do have to say that I greatly disliked the character of Lord Henry, and the book can be read much more quickly if you skip all his dialogue after his first few rants. If you've read one of his conversations you've read them all; the basic model is that he says something absurd or outlandish and then the other characters alternately gasp and fawn over his words.Every now and then this is interrupted by him saying something exceptionally bland, such as remarking that \\"They are both simply forms of imitation\\" when Basil makes the statement that \\"Love is a more wonderful thing than art.\\" Or by making some contradiction in terms, such as \\"I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd attitude to take towards life.\\"Little nuances of character stand out, such as Henry and Dorian constantly remarking about the shallowness of other characters while demonstrating a pointed shallowness throughout the book. Of course this isn't a criticisms of the book or the writing, it is likely in fact a praise of the writing, that he can create such a distasteful character.More reviews at ellipsisomnibus.wordpress.com"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Especially considering the time of writing, this book sets out a rare insight into the workings of the human mind.

However, I was utterly disappointed. The disappointment had nothing to do with the novel's themes but rather its characters and delivery.As a literature major, I am one who enjoys long novels full of detail and old romantic language such as that of Jane Austen. While The Picture of Dorian Grey was written with glorious detail and all the flowery language that I love I found myself very bored. There were many places where I found that the story dragged and though I am sure they were meant to be brilliant social commentary I could not stand the countless scenes where Lord Henry or Dorian sat about with their friends and chatted.I may have still been able to give this book at least a three star rating if the boring scenes scattered throughout the book were the only fault but unfortunately what truly put me off was the characters. I cannot enjoy a book whose characters I do not come to love or at least care for in some small way. By the end of the novel I did not care one bit what happened to Dorian Grey; he was a spineless boy and a cruel man. Lord Henry was always a wicked man and a tiresome preacher of what he considered to be cleverness. Basil Hallward was the only character that I enjoyed and somewhat identified with but he was not enough apart of the story to redeem it and nothing could make up for Dorian himself.I was extremely disappointed in this book and I cannot say that I would recommend it to anyone other than a literature fanatic looking too read as many classics as possible."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Ugh, what to say about this book. I wanted so badly to love it, but I didn't. I didn't even like it a little bit. That's terrible when you don't really enjoy the very first classic you read. This isn't setting a good stage for the future and planning on reading one classic a month. Good thing Alice in Wonderland is next month. That will definitely make up for the suck of this one. Don't you hate it when you hear such good things about a book and you go in expecting to love it only to be completely disappointed? Yeah, that's what happened here.The book follows Dorian Gray (the original Mr. Gray, if you will) who is apparently a very beautiful man who is envied by many only he doesn't quite understand why. I liked Dorian but I didn't feel like his character had much depth. I liked that he wasn't all look how sexy I am you know you want this, but at the same time he was kind of a sissy. He follows this Lord Henry guy around like he's a lost little puppy dog and puts up with him bashing him on numerous occasions. I don't know who this guy thinks he is but I had to force myself not to skip over his parts. The only rational person in this book (minus his psycho obsession over Dorian) is Basil but he isn't in enough of the book to really care too much about.I think I know why I couldn't get into this book as much as the rest of the people who told me about it. Have you seen the movie The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen? Okay, I see Dorian Gray in that movie when I think about him. I see Stuart Townsend in all his \\"I'm the bomb get over it\\" glory. I cannot and will not picture him as the pushover that he was in this book. That movie ruined the book for me. I remember watching the actual Dorian Gray movie but it was boring too. I may have to watch it again just to see how terrible it was in comparison to the book, but I vaguely remember falling asleep at some point.The only reason I didn't give it one butterfly is because I was able to finish it. It was hard and it seemed like forever, but I did it. And the only reason I did it was to get to the end. I read on and off for like five days just to read about the scene I could have watched in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen after only an hour and a half. Stuart Townsend will always be my Dorian Gray. This book just didn't do it for me. However... Dorian is a VERY cool name. Props to Mr. Wilde for that."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I feel perplexed about The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. On one hand, the story is well written about a young man being moulded and shaped. On the other hand, this book was incredibly flowery and doesn't really start for 100 pages. Dorian doesn't really know about life and meets an artist and an aristocrat that help him though his journey into manhood. The artist paints his portrait, subsequently making him keep his youth. The aristocrat had the biggest influence on Dorian Gray, though Lord Harry Wotton is very annoying. He talks and talks the whole way through this book, thinking he's so witty.Dorian Gray starts off in this novel as a blank slate, an easily influenced young man. Thoughout the rest of the story he gets moulded and pushed into shape. After Basil paints his portrait Dorian starts to unravel, afraid to show the picture, he locks it way in a room and never lets anyone see it, protecting it at all costs. The whole thing symbolising the way we hide our real selves from the rest of the world, scared of what they may think.The Picture of Dorian Gray would have been controversial in its day, with strong homosexual themes. Though the book itself is more about the life and morality, Oscar Wilde did a brilliant of capturing this element of the book. For me the biggest downfall of this book was that Lord Wotton was too loud and dominates throughout the entire book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is an incredibly well written, wonderfully illustrated, and very interesting book to read. I have read and already own The Picture of Dorian Gray, but this book adds so much to my understanding of the story, the characters, and the time in which Wilde wrote the book. Plus it has fascinating references to Oscar Wilde's friends, enemies, his views on woman, art, life, and his other stories. I am reading every annotation, every footnote, and the story all at the same time. This book is a must have if you enjoy Oscar Wilde, and wish to understand him better. Buy It!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"First off, for the audience looking to read this book after viewing the character from the movie LXG, know that the characteristics of Dorian are no as they were in the movie. Dorian does not die when he looks at his portrait; in fact his observation of the changes in his picture is one of the main elements of the story. Basil, an artist that is obsessed with the beauty of one man, Dorian, paints a portrait so beautiful that the subject is pained by the fact that the portrait's beauty will outlast that of his mortal body, and he wishes that this formula could be reversed, with the portrait aging in his place. He gets his wish, but at what price? Dorian, now free from the bounds of mortality, is no longer afraid to sin, since there he thinks that nothing can happen to him. But his behavior was not all due to his immortality; it was also due to the fact that the negative influence from Lord Henry corrupted his pure soul. The fact that he was able to keep his beauty but not able to keep his soul shows that judgment based on appearance is not only wrong, but inaccurate. This book is recommended, but not to the highest extent. The story picks up quickly, as it must with such a limited amount of pages. One of the only flaws in this book is chapter 11, the long, unwanted pause. A classic nonetheless, one that should no be overlooked."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde creates a Faustian plot where Dorian Gray wishes to never grow old, and gives up his soul to do so.

The book mainly focuses on a theme of sin and art, and this review will analyze how this novel treats aforementioned two topics and what readers can gain from such perspectives.Is sin inseparable part of one's life? No matter how moral or innocent way of life one seemingly leads, does sin work its way in insidiously to contaminate and destroy our soul? Oscar Wilde would agree. The novel is an intense meditation on morality. Here, As Dorian Gray leads a debauchery life, he is representing the dark side of morality. Once influenced by Lord Henry, who insists that \\"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\\" Dorian Gray's sole purpose in life is to please his senses despite the costs such lifestyle would incur. His sudden, whimsical wish that his portrait drawn by his admirer, Basil Hallward, would physically age instead of himself, comes true, and for the next 18 years, he keeps his youthful appearance while his portrait grows old. During those 18 years, he indulges himself in many indecencies (although readers could only glimpse at the specificity of those acts since apparently the press banned a number of erotic references when it was first published), yet he remains pure and pristine outwardly. His callous attitude toward and apathetic reception of others slowly taints his soul. One's decisive philosophy on life has huge impact on his moral conscious, as can be seen from Dorian's life. Dorian seldom visits his attic where he has hidden his portrait and takes a look at it. The portrait looks more horrific and sinister with the signs of aging everytime he looks at it. His sin is coming alive and reveals itself in the portrait.Here, Oscar Wilde seems to suggest that we human beings are all sinners since no one is immune to aging of one's physical forms. We age because we sin. Sin is one of inextricable condition of human being's life. As written in the introduction to the novel, \\"it portrays the author's internal battles and arrives at the disturbing possibility that \`Ugliness is the only reality.'\\"Then, can we, readers, say that Dorian Gray's sin's are unnatural and abomination? Can we not conclude that his sin is just different kind of sin from all the sins that human beings commit? Is his sin greater in intensity than the sins commited by others? If ugliness is the only reality, then he is merely candid with himself and is living in a true reality whereas everyone else only swims in the pool of illusions.In theology, it claims that God exists because everyone needs redemption. And we need to attain it through Him. If everyone needs redemption, then it logically follows that everyone sins. Although people may have rebuked Wilde's only novel due to immorality portrayed and done by Dorian Gray, they have done so because they were afraid to look at their own ugliness through the reflection cast by this very novel. Sin is a natural rebellion we all harbor, however unknowably, deep in our heart. Lucifer and Dorian Gray, they were just more honest with what their hearts were telling them.The theme of art, although seems peripheral to the theme of sin, is indeed an important facet that makes up the novel. The artist who paints the portrait of Dorian Gray poured his soul in the this very art. This metaphor becomes reality and the portrait embodies the soul of Dorian Gray. In addition, Dorian Gray is hugely influenced by the book given by Lord Henry Wotten, he who is ultra-liberal-minded and paradox loving friend of Dorian's. The latter fact is autobiographical in context as Wilde confesses in his other essay. Art affects lives exorbitantly. Art changes lives. Art roots unrootable philosophy deep inside one's heart. Art has soul of its own, or the soul of its subject.Then, was Oscar Wilde honest when he claimed in the preface that \`All art is quite useless\\"? Anything that has capacity to change one's philosopy cannot be labeled \`useless'. The very constrast that's shown in the story of the book is that Dorian Gray could not have lived such decadent life if it weren't for his portrait drawn by his friend. Art, here, gave him a new life. Art, when applied, becomes indispensable aspects of one's life. Scholars argue that the saying, \\"All art is quite useless,\\" was written after vituperative remarks Wilde received from his critics. It was his defense; yet his novels immediately rejects such claim through inordinate life story of Dorian Gray.Like many great novels, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a representation of a certain movement at a specific time. The movement was called \`Aesthetic Movement,\\" and the book remains as a symbol of its era, must as Albert Camus's book The Strangers remains the representation of existentialism in the 50s. Interestingly, the book is inundated with paradoxes, most of which were conveyed by Lord Henry Wotten, and its purpose is worthnoting. Dialectic has been a method for a couple millennia to get at the truth, and it seems like Wilde is purportedly using paradoxes to give us a chance to see other side by our commonly dull perspective. He is suggesting that morality is not easily defined, that the difference between virtue and vice is paper-thin. Here are some examples of paradoxes narrated by Lord Henry Wotton followed by my own interpretation:\\"We shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.\\" -God's gifts are not a blessing but rather a curse-\\"It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.\\" -People who use their intelligence and rhetoric for the purpose of arguing don't look smart; instead they look lost-\\"Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.\\" -It seems like the phrase is boasting the wonders and greatness of unfaithfulness, focusing on its dramatic elements-\\"And Beauty is a form of Genius--is higher, indeed, than Genius, as it needs no explanation.\\" -We generally think that concept of beauty as greatness is fleeting, that beauty is inferior virtue from other types of virtues; yet Lord Henry claims that beauty is the apex among all virtues.=== Forgoing my own interpretation for here are more wonderful paradoxes ===\\"The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.\\"\\"\`Always' is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it. Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to make it last forever. It is a meaningless word too. The only difference between a caprice & a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.\\"\\"Sin is the only real color-element left in modern life.\\"\\"One should absorb the color of life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar.\\"\\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\\"To define is to limit.\\"\\"Every effect that one produces gives on an enemy. To be popular, one must be a mediocrity.\\"\\"Their strong passions must either bruise or bend. They either slay the man or themselves die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on.\\"This book is riveting and memorable book, full of paradoxies and deep insights and commentaries on life. I recommend this book to ones bored by mediocry of general mass and also to those who would like to see liberal-mindedness in its extreme. Although the main character leads a decadent life, because of censorship at the times, the passages do not contain explicit sexual scenes or drug usage. Approximately four movie adaptations on this novel have been made so far, the last one of which stars Colin Firth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is an old favorite of my mother's.

It was just as good as I recall the movie as being....or better."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If I had read this book decades ago, I would rate it higher. Today it would be difficult to get people to read it. As a former English teacher, I was fascinated and intrigued by Wilde's sentence structure and word choice; most readers today would find it stilted and actually difficult to read. In addition, the class structure adds more problems for understanding how the characters behaved. Lastly, the older British custom of describing men and their feelings about their friends would put off many readers. (Same problem with some of Shakespeare's sonnets.) While it is certainly a classic, there are many contemporary authors who deal with the theme as well as Wilde. It is probably a great choice for English literature majors; however. I suspect the general public could invest their time better with another book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a great book... slow read, drawn out... just like i remember.

At first I thought it was going to be an old fashioned novel hard to understand, but in the contrary, even when it was written in 1890 Oscar Wilde criticizes so many attitudes and behaviors that our society still has. The book was quite \\"revealing\\" for me, it put into words so many thoughts and ideas in which I agree. What I liked the most about it are the amusing quotes and phrases that it has, it was quite difficult to choose my favorite one, most of them from Lord Henry for me the best character. Lord Henry has a unique style, like the book says \\"I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit.\\" For me he is like a paradox, and I like him for that because he is like the opposite of me. I think the book makes you want to have a good discussion with him. In general I think Oscar Wilde like the painter Bassil in Dorian Gray's portrait, puts so much of him on the book. His thoughts, ideas, critics and points of view are clearly reflected. I really recommend the Picture of Dorian Gray, for me is a must read book. Know I can see why it has been so famous for so many years; it has become one of my favorite books by far."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde truly had a way with words.

She was very pleased with the item and would recommend ordering from here again."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The story of Dorian Gray is one that everyone knows, yet knowing what the premise, and most likely how the story ends doesn't detract from this amazing read. This is a fast pased book that doesn't have a single speed bump, you are forced to create them yourself putting down the book every few chapters to marvel at EVERYTHING. The dialog is world class, the theme's truer today than back then, the characters moving and dynamic, all tied up in as few of pages as possible. With the exception of one chapter, you'll know it when you read it.The dialog, I haven't read a book that I am more impressed with. The poet and playwrite in Wilde shows through here. The constant gloomy witt of Lord Henry is awesome. The dinner scenes are great, and you just want to memorize a few sayings to pull out at the next party you go to. Things like, \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yeild to it.\\", or \\"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\\" Now you might come off thinking this is a book for an angry teenager, but there is a lot more here than that. If you are an angry teenager though.... read this book you will not regret it.This book cannot be avoided for anyone who considers themselves well read. Also a great intoduction into the world of literature. I recomend this book to anyone that has only read Harry Potter or Twilight, it is an extremely easy read and for its age surprisingly undated, and shows how older books are just as entertaining, yet more thought provoking, and what good writing looks like. This is a book that should be in class rooms more often."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I wanted to give this four stars, but I just couldn't. This was not a comfortable read for me; in fact, it was quite difficult for me to finish. However, the difficulty did not arise because it was poorly executed; rather, it was so well done that I couldn't bear to watch the destruction of one man's soul.Oscar Wilde writes beautifully and eloquently, and this book overflows with witticisms and epigrams that are eminently quotable. However, many of these bon mots come from the observations of Lord Harry, who is the cynic that leads Dorian Gray down the road of temptation and vice. For that reason, I could not fully enjoy all of these wonderful sallies, knowing from whom they came and whose mind composed them.Dorian Gray is by no means an innocent throughout this book. However, he begins the book as An Ideal - the physical embodiment of all that is good, youthful, innocent and free of sin. In fact, his ideal purity is what inspires his friend, Basil, to paint the titular picture of Dorian Gray. Once Dorian makes the acquaintance of Basil's friend, Lord Harry, however, Dorian is fascinated by Lord Harry's worldly and cosmopolitan views. In a burst of youthful enthusiasm, Dorian wishes for the picture to bear the physical outcomes of his actions so that Dorian can retain his beauty. He soon discovers that his wish has been granted. Adopting Lord Harry's way of life, Dorian descends into a lifestyle of vice and pleasure seeking and perversely (and childishly?) anticipates the devastation he can wreak on the portrait without bearing any evidence on his own physical form.The levels of Harry's influence, Dorian's self-destruction, and Dorian's blindness to the true elements of his fall from \\"goodness\\" combined to make for a powerful read. I couldn't help but get a Faustian vibe throughout this novel, and I found myself calling Harry (in my head) \\"Mephisto! Mephisto!\\"The story told in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" of the ruination of a man's good character and moral compass is terrible, tragic, and, despite the fantastical nature of a portrait that reveals the blackness of one's soul, terrifyingly realistic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is really a must read, I recommend it highly.

I have found quite a few typos in this version. I have actually decided to download it on iBooks because that version is properly edited."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was the only novel written by Oscar Wilde. The basic idea behind it is well-known even to those who have never read the book or seen any of various film adaptations. A beautiful young man named Dorian Gray possesses a portrait of himself, painted by his friend Basil Hallward. Dorian, who is very vain about his looks, expresses the wish that he could remain young and beautiful while the portrait grows old, only to find that he has made an unwitting Faustian bargain, because this is precisely what happens. Influenced by the hedonistic philosophy of another friend, Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian gives himself over to a life of debauchery, remaining forever young while the signs of ageing begin to appear on the painting. The portrait, moreover, does not simply reflect Dorian's chronological age. It also acts as a reflection of the state of his soul. By the end of the story Dorian is no more than middle-aged, but the picture is that of a hideous old man, disfigured by a life of sin and vice.When the novel was first published in 1890 (in magazine form) it was highly controversial, for two reasons. The first reason was its undoubted homoerotic overtones, although Wilde toned these down somewhat when the novel was published in book form the following year. Explicit gay sex scenes would, of course, have been taboo in the 1890s, but coded references to famous homosexual lovers from history and mythology (Hadrian and Antinous, Edward II and Piers Gaveston, Jupiter and Ganymede) can be taken as an indication that Dorian's debauches are not exclusively of the heterosexual variety. There is also an indication that Basil's feelings for Dorian, and possibly Lord Henry's as well, go beyond mere friendship.The other reason why the novel was so controversial was that Wilde was wrongly thought to be espousing Lord Henry's world view and advocating a love of beauty and pleasure as the only good in life. This impression was strengthened by Wilde's Preface, which consists solely of twenty-five epigrams about art, including \\"There is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all\\". These statements appear to align Wilde with the literary and cultural movement known as Aestheticism, or sometimes as the Decadent Movement. This movement adopted as its slogan \\"Art for Art's Sake\\", interpreted by many of its followers such as the French poet Theophile Gautier as a denial of the idea that there was any association between art and morality.Wilde's epigrams, however, should not be taken as the Twenty-Five Articles of a prescriptive artistic credo; they were rather intended as provocative aphorisms intended to stimulate discussion. The author himself frequently wrote works with a quite overt moral agenda- children's stories like \\"The Selfish Giant\\", social satires like \\"A Woman of No Importance\\" and \\"An Ideal Husband\\", poems like \\"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\\". Indeed, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" itself can be interpreted as an overtly moral work. In a letter, Wilde said of the three main characters: \\"Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry is what the world thinks me: Dorian is what I would like to be--in other ages, perhaps\\"- an interesting remark, given that Basil is both the only character in the novel who is a creative artist and also the representative of a traditional, and often explicitly Christian, morality, which contrasts sharply with Henry's amoralism. Henry is a cynical dandy, much given to witty aphorisms, but like other similar characters in Wilde's works is not to be taken as a self-portrait of the author.If Dorian is a Faust-figure, Henry is his Mephistopheles, but he is a devil less corrupt than the man he tempts. For all Henry's cynicism, he never descends into the depths of depravity in the same way as his prot&eacute;g&eacute; does. He never quite has the courage to practise what he preaches, being guilty of what might be called inverted hypocrisy, making himself out to be worse than he really is. As Basil says to him \\"You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.\\" Dorian's sins, however, are not limited to sexual debauchery and drug addiction (he becomes an habitu&eacute; of opium dens). His callous behaviour drives his fianc&eacute;e, the young actress Sibyl Vane, to suicide, and in an attempt to preserve himself from exposure he resorts to blackmail and murder.One thing that does link Wilde to the Aesthetic movement is his undoubted love of physical beauty; the story is written in a very rich, lush style with many striking descriptive passages, such as the opening description of the beautiful summer's day on which Dorian first meets Henry. Yet his attitude to Aestheticism is a critical one, and is perhaps closer to that of earlier writers such as Ruskin and Morris, both of whom promoted an appreciation of beauty not as an end in itself but as part of a wider political and social agenda. Wilde clearly saw the limitations, and the dangers, of a cult of beauty divorced from moral and human concerns. It is perhaps significant that, after committing his murder, Dorian sits down to calm his nerves by reading the poetry of Gautier, the writer most closely associated with the \\"art for art's sake\\" ideology. He breaks off his engagement to Sibyl after seeing her give a bad performance in the theatre; her explanation for the decline in her acting skills is that, having discovered real love, she can no longer be inspired by fictional love. For him, artistic concerns are paramount over human ones; for her, it is the other way round.As one might expect from the only novel of a highly original, idiosyncratic writer, the book occupies a unique place in the history of English literature. It is sometimes classified as Gothic fiction, and the work to which it bears the greatest similarity is perhaps another classic \\"Gothic\\" novel from the late 19th century, Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\", published five years earlier. Like Stevenson, Wilde wanted to explore the duality within the human soul between the virtuous public side and the darker private side which we are compelled to keep hidden. As a homosexual forced to conceal his homosexuality, this theme had an obvious appeal for him.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a complex, multi-layered work, and there is insufficient space in this review to touch on all its many aspects. It is, however, a work which well deserves its status as a literary classic more than a century after the death of its author."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is to my knowledge, the only novel ever written by Oscar Wilde. It is very intelligent and at some points, rather dark, but that all makes it even more fun! The story is that Dorian Gray, is a young man who finds the thought of aging, rather depressing. As it so happens, his best friend is an artist, who has been quite happy to paint a portrait of Dorian. Upon witnessing his youth preserved in art, Mr. Gray wishes it could perhaps, be the other way around...and his wish is granted but, in a nightmarish way. For now the painting reflects his sins. Believe me, he has more than enough. This is a great, if tragic story and I'm so glad it was free, as this was my first time reading it! Also, this book is positively packed with good quotes so, now's the time to create a My Clippings file on your Kindle."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray (Tor, 1891)I cannot comment on the scariness of &lt;em>The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/em>, the only novel ever written by Oscar Wilde. Why? Because, despite the reams of column inches I've read over the years on how scary the blessed thing is, I couldn't find myself even turning a hair. Simply put, Wilde was a comedian, albeit a bitter, misanthropic comedian. The man didn't have it in him to write horror the way the Jameses (M. R. or Henry, take your pick) or Poe did. (Though one should note that none of those three acknowledged masters of nineteenth-century horror ever produced what we would consider, today, a novel-length work of horror, whereas Wilde did; Poe's only novel was a fantasy, while the longest works of James one and James two are both novelettes.) So if you go into it expecting a horror novel, you may well find yourself disappointed. If you look at it, however, as yet another exposition of the incredible strengths of Oscar Wilde's creativity--the biting satire, the homosexuality so repressed it's half-erotic when someone stands up from a table, the rampant quotability--then like everything else the man ever wrote, &lt;em>The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/em> will be right up your alley. It contains some of Wilde's most-recognized one-liners (\\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\", \\"If the cave-man had known how to laugh, history would have been different\\", \\"It is not good for one's morals to see bad acting.\\", and dozens of others), some thoroughly entertaining characters, a plot as old as time itself bent to Wilde's indomitable will, and any number of good, solid laugh-out-loud moments. It also, of course, comes with an excellent backstory that inspired Wilde's most important one-liner of all: \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written.\\" Needless to say, were this not the former, there wouldn't have been such an uproar over it, would there? ***"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", written by Oscar Wilde, deals with the issue of getting old and the question of how you want to live your life. In my opinion the book is a typical book from Oscar Wilde which shows the difficulties and the pressures in the community. Oscar Wilde is a critical author who always writes about his own point of view. Furthermore you can also learn about his personality and the society this time.I think that the Picture of Dorian Gray represents the wish from every person to stay young and beautiful with all the opportunities and chances, waiting for you to grab them. Also the second chance and the possibillity to change is a facility which is usually offered to the youth.Also the end is a perfect rounding which brings all topics and themes together to one point. And as Oscar Wilde shows in his opinion, the point is not how you look, it is more how you lived and what you did. At least the ending says that when you die,you die as the person you were and it does not matter who you pretend you are.The story of Dorian Gray is in my opinion a very gripping book which did not leave me until I finished it. And even then it makes me think about these things. Oscar Wilde's writing is very fast-moving and there are no long or boring scences in the book.Bringing all considerations together I have to say that I enjoyed the book very much, which is why I have read it in only three hours."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's color commentary on the tug of war between Basil Hallward (good) and Lord Henry Wotton (evil--think Wormwood in C.S.

For those who have not read it, I will not reveal the absolute ending.Several themes apply to us all: the high price of pleasure and self-indulgence as a way of life; the absurdity of our superficial preoccupation with outward beauty; and how idolizing appearances blinds us to the truth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What would a portrait of your soul look like?More than anything else, this question beats at the heart of this thought provoking book.For Oscar Wilde, his alter ego Dorian Gray would not be too pretty.As the book demonstrates, years of sin ultimately rob Gray of his youthful beauty. But, consistent with a wish made by Gray, this theft occurs only a canvas copy of him made by an adoring male artist when Gray was still young.While it would seem that eternal youth is a great prize, especially to the very vain Gray, it ends up becoming a curse. Gray locks the aging picture away in an attic only periodically returning to it to witness the ravages that would have been visited upon him were he not to have made his wish.In this way, while Gray is permitted to retain his external beauty, he's also forced to witness his moral deterioration.As with the more contemporary Angels in America, self reproach over one's homosexuality moves deeply along the subcurrents of this book. Though most don't know it, homosexuality was prohibited by law in Great Britain until 1967 and those convicted of it were forced into harsh punishments and even harsher treatments intended to \\"cure\\" them.It's this deeper sense that most people resonate with in one way or another...substituting their own private sins for those of Gray in their estimation of their moral appearance.Having said all that, it still prompts consideration that Gray himself and his friend Lord Henry -- sinful that they are -- are the most interesting characters in this book. Unintentionaly (perhaps), Wilde is suggesting that it's our sins that make us noteworthy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into.The first half is a vehicle for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading. The second half of the book tells the majority of the story and is a much more accessable read.Would I reccomend this book? I think this is one of the few times I would say see the film (1945 starring George Saunders and Angela Lansbury) and then read the book. The book alone is not the best showcase for the genius of Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a review for the Penguin Classics hardcover edition of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", ISBN: 0141442468. Amazon.com, despite its general excellence, fails to take into account the bibliophile for whom the quality of the edition he determines to purchase matters, so, this is not a review for the intellectual content of the volume I have recently bought, but, rather, a review of the quality of this particular volume's production.I had hoped, that Penguin had finally decided to market its considerable store of intellectual wealth to those who desire a book of some distinction, to those who still admire the craftsmanship of a finely wrought tome. Largely, in this edition (and in those others, similar to it) they have succeeded. The cloth covers of these editions are attractively designed; the typesetting modern, attractive, and readable; the cloth marker a thoughtful edition. However--and this is a thing unabidable--the binding is glued and does not have signatures. Sewn signatures are a sign that some care has been taken to ensure the longevity of a book. The crude, merely glued together pages make this volume little better than some cheap paperback in deceiving, meretricious garb. I will not again be purchasing a book from this line, and would advise anyone else to avoid doing the same."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray is a young man of pure beauty. He befriends an artist named Basil, and at first Basil uses Dorian as a model for paintings, putting him into classical scenes. Eventually, however, he decides to paint a portrait of Dorian as he truly is. Around the same time, Dorian befriends one of Basil's acquaintances, Henry, and Henry makes Dorian more cynical and jaded. When Dorian finally sees the portrait Basil has painted, he weeps and wishes that he would remain young, and the portrait would age in his place. When his wish comes true, Dorian will go to murderous lengths to keep the secret.Sometimes, a girl just needs a little bit of the classics in her life. Thank goodness Amazon offers a wide variety of public domain books available for free Kindle download. This was my first foray into Wilde, and I wonder how different of an experience reading his work in his own time would have been. To me, the homoerotic undertones leap from the page, but I wonder how much of that was intentional on his part, and how much of that is me being influenced by what we know of Wilde himself. Regardless, there is something sensually sinister about the interactions of the men in this book. And while most of them do have relations with women, very few seem to value or enjoy female interactions at all.I very much enjoyed this dark, cautionary tale of a wanna be Narcissus. It did take me a while to get into the pacing of the more classical language and writing style, having been reading a lot more modern books lately, but once I was about a third of the way through the book I literally devoured it. I know Wilde did not write as prolifically as some classical writers, but I believe I will be seeking out some of his other works.I could not help but feel some pity for Dorian Gray. He became exactly what everyone groomed him to be, then everyone scorned him for being what they had wanted him to be in the first place. Someone needs to get this book to Lindsay Lohan as soon as possible, she may find it familiar. Which make me wonder, with all the modernizations and mash ups of classic literature out there, why hasn't anyone done anything with this story? It seems to me that it could be redone with a modern twist, or vampires or something really well if the right person did it. Of course, if the wrong person did it, it would be wretched, so maybe it is best left alone."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This novel is one of the best classics available. It is more entertaining for its controversy value than for anything else. Lord Henry Wotton is probably the most engaging character in the entire novel, and one gets the impression he is the mouthpiece of Oscar Wilde himself. For the rest of this review, it will probably be enough to suggest you read it if you haven't, and include some quotes from Lord Henry:There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies.Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love; it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.You are a wonderful creation. You know more than you think you know, just as you know less than you want to know.It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old men want to be faithless, and cannot.I always like to know everything about my new friends, and nothing about my old ones.She behaves as if she was beautiful. Most American women do. It is the secret of their charm.I can sympathize with everything, except suffering.Humanity takes itself too seriously. It is the world's original sin.

Women are a decorative sex. They never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly. Women represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.Men marry because they are tired; women, because they are curious: both are disappointed.The people who love only once in their lives are really the shallow people. What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination. Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect - simply a confession of failure.You will always be fond of me. I represent to you all the sins you never had the courage to commit.Women love us for our defects. If we have enough of them, they will forgive us everything, even our intellects.A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he does not love her.It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.Each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved. To be popular one must be a mediocrity.It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.A woman will flirt with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on.Anybody can be good in the country.To get back my youth I would do anything in the world, except take exercise, get up early, or be respectable.The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is haunting, lovely and a great read.

I don't generally like historical fiction much, but I got an assignment in my English class about banned books where we had to pick one to read, so I decided it was the perfect time to pick it up! I surprised myself when I ended up really enjoying the book. It's a great work and definitely a book that everyone should pick up at some point in their lives.Although there were a few characters I didn't enjoy so much, this book was overall incredible. Every book has a couple stumbles and can't really be perfect; but you know you have a true classic when the spectacular parts of the book are so spectacular that you kind of forget about the things you didn't like so much and fall in love with the book anyway. But it's not one of those books where I can easily point out what it is I liked about the book-the love for it was so gradual, I'm not sure at what point I feel head over heels for it or why!Important note! I'd recommend reading the introduction (if you read the version I did) AFTER you've already finished the novel!

My experience is that school actually demotivates people from wanting to read. How many of us can relate with the feelings of never wanting to read another book after high school. When grades are the motivation to read, people search for the cliff notes and or look for reviews in Encyclopedias. In my High School English class, grades were given on the basis of how many books one read. If you read 8-10 you received an A. The problem was that after knowing one was going to get an A, all reading stopped. Reading is supposed to be done for the joy of it. I hear the word boring used a great deal when reviewing a book. I know so many kids who end up hating reading because they received a poor grade. The classics are challenging books.

Like most of his works this novel is few in characters, but copious in themes. The novel captures the ideals of aestheticism or \\"beauty for beauty's sake\\", a philosophy for which Wilde was a spokes person and prominent proponent. He used this novel as an opportunity to combine the elements of aestheticism with his observations of larger social themes of the era and really define his philosophy as it pertained to society. As part of the observed social themes, the novel incorporates Wilde's refined ideas relating to the supremacy of art and society's view upon decadence, duplicity, and beauty. Yet despite Wilde's attempt to bring focus to his ideas of aestheticism his novel serves as juxtaposition to his ideals if not the exact opposite.Aestheticism was a movement that sought to free art of the restricting responsibility of having a meaning and also of being moral or immoral. Wilde was under the impression that art, of all forms, need serve no purpose but be beautiful. In his novel Wilde uses two prominent symbols of these ideas: the picture which represents beauty and the unnamed yellow book that served as a symbol that literature also needed to moral restrictions. Though his intentions may have been to advance his own ideas, this novel serves to counter that for despite the idea that art have no purpose this novel gives a purpose to both of the aforementioned symbols. The picture is transformed into a mirror of sorts and through this mirror the world can see the corruption and age that Dorian's physical self has been spared. Wilde created the idea that Dorian's portrait became a portal into which he could look and see the nature of his soul and its transformation as his actions corrupted it. The novel itself may have escaped morality but served as a guide to which Dorian became corrupt. Therefore the novel served the purpose of being the catalyst causing Dorian's corruption. This simply proves that although it is possible to subvert and avoid moral restrictions everything can be interpreted to serve a purpose and thus nothing can escape having a purpose.The primary principle of aestheticism is the importance placed upon beauty to which Wilde ties this in with the superficiality of society. Throughout the novel Dorian is influenced by the philosophy of Lord Henry, who believes that beauty and the senses are the most important values, and beauty reigns for most of the novel. Wilde writes of how society places such high a value on beauty and refers to it as the most valuable of commodities for it is soon to be lost. The idea is that beauty is the only thing of importance. For throughout the novel Dorian is treated the same by the company he keeps despite his ethics. This is a clear representation of aestheticism in which beauty need have no relation to ethics. Wilde juxtaposes this idea with that of another character who believes that the price is too high. The way in which Dorian meets his doom confirms this second idea, for he gives his soul. However, at the end of the novel beauty is still held to the upmost of importance which again refers to the both the value of beauty and society's superficial nature. Yet the reader comes away feeling that beauty is something dangerous to value so highly, as is apparent by the demise of the model of beauty, Dorian Gray.Wilde may have intended for his novel to further his own philosophy however, The Picture of Dorian Gray, does the exact opposite. Wilde effectively illustrated both the flaws in a society that valued beauty so highly and the flaws in his own philosophy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I got this free for my iPad and I enjoyed reading it.

For this, he would give his soul; and that was exacly what happened.This is no ordinary book. This book is funny and interesting.

The book even resists classification today. Is it part of the Decadence movement or the Symbolist movement?Or is it an experimental novel, fashioned perhaps as a psychological gothic study? More importantly, though, Wilde's creation poses the question: Can a book be poisonous? Gray succumbs to the &quot;evil&quot; influence of Huysmans' book A Rebours. As Wilde as written, &quot;there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well written or badly written.&quot; Wilde may have created a well written book, but he also, albeit purposely, created a book when, viewed from its many horizons, can be seen as terrible moral study in the lesson Gray undergoes."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":". . .of what we love about books: superior critical work, excellent physical presentation.

It appeared to me, that Wilde was set on pushing his own philosophy and views of life and self onto others, and, as I read it, I found myself rejecting it with every fiber of my being.

However, The Picture of Dorian Gray gets bogged down with trifles too often, which is distracting. There is an air of stuffiness and superficiality that becomes a little tiresome.Also, there are few redeeming characters in the novel, as the principal ones are nauseating. Take Lord Henry for instance. His long-winded philosophies and monologues dominate a good deal of the book; rather than adding much to the story, they become heavy-handed, like a point is being shoved in our face too often. And, then there is Dorian. So overdramatic and high-maintenance. Everything revolves around him and his precious little world. I get that he is supposed to be vain and materialistic, but there's little sympathy for him at all, especially when you realize he's more about forgetting his sins than actually repenting them. I realize that Wilde is philosophizing through his characters and the plot, but the means with which he goes about this is tedious.Still, there are redeeming aspects to the novel. Wilde does give us a moral to take away from the reading experience, as the Faustian angle of selling one's soul for beauty becomes apparent in Dorian's life. As Dorian ultimately chooses vanity over spirit and conscience, he sets the wheels of fate in motion. With devil in disguise Lord Henry egging him on, he gradually sees the portrait embody his tarnished soul: vanity, pleasures, sins. Wilde does give the book a very Gothic vibe. Dorian's portrait almost seems alive with grotesqueness, something horrible and monstrous hiding behind that sneer.While I did enjoy the Gothic aspects and the moral to Wilde's novel, I didn't like this novel as much as others."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It is just not my kind of book... iT IS ON MY BOOK SHSELLP WITH OTHER BOOKS THAT i HAVE BOUGHT AND FEEL LIKE i MADE A MISTAKES- IN JUDGEMENT."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book starts out OK, with the known Oscar Wilde wit and his excellent descriptive skills.

Over the years I have read plenty of Wilde's works, but for some reason or another, missed this one over and over. I recently sat down, and decided that it was time to give this a read. To be honest, I knew very little about this actual book prior to reading it, other than it involved a picture that aged rather than he in the painting.I expected to have difficulty reading this book, since it had been such a long time since I had read anything from the Victorian era, however the language was surprisingly simple, and Wilde's wit is as sharp as ever. Almost sharp enough to harm the reader should they not be forewarned or guided through the readings. Should someone of a weaker mind read this book, it would be easy to fall into the trap of Dorian, who himself was poisoned by a book and the words of his friend.Summary without giving too much away: Dorian Gray is an Adonis-like beauty, young and full of life and innocence at the beginning of our story. His beauty has attracted the obsession of a painter who paints picture after picture of him. Basil (the painter) tries to keep young Dorian pure and in love with life. Henry, a friend of Basil's comes to the studio as Basil paints his master work - a portrait of Doran. Henry fascinates young Dorian in his vile manner of speaking and sarcastic wit. His talk instills in Dorian both a fear of losing his beauty and a lust for all that is selfish and vile in life. Dorian's notable debauchery follows in exquisite detail with Henry always along for the ride to prod young Dorian down the wrong road. Several suicides and a murder or two later, complete madness begins to make its appearance.Wilde was brilliant in his writing of this book, he captures the time perfectly... the lust of it, the sexuality of it, the debauchery of it... all in the name of truth. In their words they say things that their hearts dare not to believe and their smiles are masks hiding the truth. And what if someone believed in these lies? What if they lived their life according to what they had been told? Then they would be Dorian Gray... and we will see what happens to him. This is a brilliant read, and for those of you who will have to write papers on it... the story is not long, but it is thick with meaning. There are very few stories that I would give 5 stars to, this is one of them."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Published in 1890, this novel by Oscar Wilde is a startling, fantastic portrayal of fin de siecle indulgence and hedonism.The novel is dark in its tone as it describes Dorian's fall from purity, and it involves itself heavily with suicide, death and supernatural occurences. The novel is also somewhat satirical, as Wilde makes reference to the absurd state of social affairs in Victorian London. Ironic and suspenseful, the novel keeps the reader interested in each plot development, and keeps the reader engaged and moved by the beautiful, carefully crafted prose.The story begins with Lord Harry Wotton, utterly captivated by a painting by a friend, the artist Basil Hallward. The painting is of the handsome and unspotted young Dorian Gray. Dorian is stunned at the worldly knowledge of the older gentleman, and soon finds himself under Lord Wotton's care and attention. Harry, the eternal pessimist, schools Dorian in his existential, hedonistic view. Dorian wishes in his vanity that the beautiful painting might age instead of he. When Dorian falls in love with and coldly rebukes a young actress, he returns home to find that the painting bears a faint expression of cruelty and callous; a certain sneer about the mouth. His wish had come true; \\"the canvas [bore] the burden of his passions and his sins.\\"As the story goes on, Dorian falls further and further into his own mind, indulging his every whim, strangling the lives of most everyone he touches by the ropes of scandal that Dorian is entangled in.Resonating throughout the story are the themes of power and love, overriden by vanity and swept beneath by slight homosexual undertones (easily overlooked by anyone who wants to overlook it).I thoroughly enjoyed this novel; the characters were well-developed, and I could identify with Dorian's desire to find a balance between his selfish motivation to indulge himself and his moral need to free himself from his sins. It is the endless plight of human existence: The moral drive to overcome the sins of our nature. The way the novel was written gives the reader a deep appreciation for Oscar Wilde, and the way in which he writes. The novel was a little difficult here and there, not because it was verbose or stylistically challenging, but merely because it was very in-depth. The book itself is a beautiful work; but moreso than the book itself are the ideas behind it. This is a book that makes one think about consequences of actions, the importance of emotions, of repentance and redemption.I would highly recommend this book.\\"Something has changed you completely. You look exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come down to my studio to sit for his picture. But you were simple, natural and affectionate then. You were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world. Now, I don't know what has come over you. You talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you.\\" - Basil Hallward to Dorian Gray, Chapter 9."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have always heard of Dorian Gray, but never got around to reading it until now.

Compelled by my teacher to read it, I didn't think this book could give me so many hints. Thanks to Oscar Wilde I had my first approach to the Aesthetic ideolgy, absolutely one of the most involving and interesting: let's do &quot;Art just for Art's Sake&quot;! Dorian Gray embodies the new intellectual who thinks life should be lived as a work of art, so that it is possible to stop the destructive power of time. He also stated the only reality is that of impressions and sensations, and everything in life should be done in order to experience every kind of sensations, no matter how to do and what society could think. Well, I'm just a teenager and maybe for this reason I share some of Wilde-Dorian's instances: like me, the protagonist tries to reconcile wills of rebellion, linked to his soul's corruption, with desires of worldiness. In conclusion I think this is one of the best book I've ever read - and I have read al lot. I would suggest it to everybody who's willing to descover the most intimate and deepest aspects of his own soul!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a beautiful book in layout and design. Oscar Wilde was many things, but for me he is an Artist first and foremost, and with this book The Belknap Press pays homage to a brilliant writer. The novel's reception is an intriguing story. I have recently purchased OSCAR WILDE: THE CRITICAL HERITAGE, and it beautifully relates the history of the book's reception. One unsigned review, In PUNCH, begins, \\"The Baron has read Oscar Wilde's Wildest and Oscarest work, called DORIAN GRAY, a weird sensational romance...\\" Another review, in DAILY CHRONICLE, begins, \\"Dullness and dirt are the chief features of Lippincott's this month. The element in it that is unclean, though undiniably amusing, is furnished by Mr Oscar Wilde's story of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. It is a tale spawned from the leprous literature of the French Decadents--a poisonous book, the atmosphere of which is heavy with the mephitic odours of moral and spiritual putrefaction...\\" (How I'd LOVE to get such a review for one of my wee books!)

It is now a classic of supernatural fiction, and I think it has been in-print ever since its first book appearance, or shortly afterward when Robert Ross worked so diligently to bring Wilde's works back into print. This is a beautiful and definitive edition."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" provides a cautionary tale about the dogmatic pursuit of youth and beauty at the cost of one's own soul. Wilde provides an insight into the hedonistic lifestyle that he lived and championed. Indeed, one of the basic tenets of Wilde's philosophy - aestheticism - is presented in contradictory terms. While aestheticism attempts to redefine art as a means of beauty with no moral purpose, the novel's artwork - the portrait of Dorian Gray - shows the moral consequences of Dorian's hedonistic and narcissistic lifestyle.In a way, Dorian is the work of art, for he never changes his appearance. It is his portrait that is burdened with the sins and iniquities of Dorian's wickedness, for his portrait becomes haggard and disheveled as Dorian's soul sinks further into a dark abyss of nefarious behavior. On the outside, Dorian shows the luminous beauty of youth and a pure mind, yet the true soul of Dorian is diseased and dying. Any attempts at changing his inner essence only reveal him to be a hypocrite and egotist.Another cautionary tale is that in one of idolizing others and falling for their influence. Dorian begins his descent into immorality when he becomes enamored with Henry Wooten's philosophies that \\"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it\\" and \\"beauty is the wonder of wonders.\\" The cynical and satirical Henry Wooten espouses his hedonistic lifestyle, yet does not become entrapped in it like Dorian. Then, it is Dorian's influence who corrupts and ruins the lives of nearly all those with whom he is intimate.It is easy to see why this novel was criticized and decried as immoral in Victorian England. From the first chapter, there is a definite homosexual undertone. Henry and Basil admire Dorian's beauty and Basil declares that he cannot live without seeing Dorian everyday. Indeed, Basil's fondness of Dorian could just as easily describe romantic feelings toward a woman. Although there are heterosexual relationships, they are shallow and fleeting. Dorian's own deplorable actions are never revealed, save for opium, yet his corruption of young men implies that he engaged in acts of \\"gross indecency\\", the very same acts for which Oscar Wilde would be tried and convicted years later. Perhaps Wilde is attempting to justify his own lifestyle and criticize moral judgments, for \\"it is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.\\"Although this is essentially a dark, Gothic novel, it does contain scenes of wit and humor. Henry's dialogue and witticisms convey the same tone as many of Wilde's highly acclaimed plays. Through satire, Wilde reveals the superficial nature of the aristocracy. Despite rumors of Dorian's sins, he is still highly desirable in London society, as his beauty and youth trump all.This is a superb novel by Wilde. I only wish that he would have honored us with a few more novels."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray was quite the read.Dorian Gray is a young man who has exquisite, wonderful features. He is good-looking. He is a model for Basil, a painter. Basil paints a portrait of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry, one of Basil's friends, meets Dorian and remarks how sad it is that Dorian will not always retain his youth and beauty. Dorian grows sad about this - and thinks, if only this picture would grow old and I can always stay young! He envies his own picture, because he thinks that the picture will forever retain its youth - while he will bear the wrinkles of life.Then things start becoming strange. After an unpleasant experience with his fianc&eacute;e, an actress, he looks at his picture and notices a cruel twist of the mouth. This is only the beginning. As Dorian makes his descent into debauchery and sinfulness, the picture bears the weight of his actions. Everytime he commits a transgression, the picture grows uglier and uglier. The picture becomes his sort of \\"conscience.\\"This book is one worth reading. I had heard of Dorian Gray and was curious. Wilde's writing was descriptive, yet easy to read. It is one of the easier classics, in my opinion.The only flaw to this novel was, at one point, there is a stage where Dorian collects a lot of things - like embroidery, etc. It describes the things he collects and makes lots of references and allusions to seemingly random people (perhaps famous people in history?). This seemed to me like a non sequitur, and just lots of rambling. Furthermore, it was confusing because I didn't know who the people being mentioned were. It was tedious, although I endured it. I'm glad I did, because the story progressed wonderfully.The ending is... quite morbid, but didn't come across as a complete surprise.The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth your while. It will make you think - is eternal youth worth it? It will trigger lots of probing questions in your brain. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a good classic read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Gray is a beautiful young man who after seeing his portrait wishes that the painting ages rather than his own face. Initially innocent he is corrupted by Henry Wotton his supposed friend, a devoutly immoral character who leads Dorian Gray into a truly sinful existance.By chance Gray discovers his wish came true and the portrait not his own face is aged by his lifestyle, but when he sees the extent to which the image has been ravaged he wishes to recinde the wish. Wilde illustrates the ugly side of our natures and shows there is always a price to pay for it despite the public face presented to the world. Despite the dark message, the biting wit and sarcasm keep the reader amused as well as disturbed, leaving me with a somewhat guilty feeling if I should laugh while reading it (which I often did). The interesting thing is the author does not take a moral stance, maybe because of the life he led himself. Although Wild's only novel and not overly long, it is a truly great work. For the wit alone and a lifetimes worth of quotations it is essential reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I had heard speak of The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I must admit I did not expect the depth and clarity of thought, the utter honesty to be found in this short novel.

Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\\"; \\" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\\"; \\"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\\" ; \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\" ; \\" It is better to be beautiful than to be good.

It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\\"\\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\\"- \\"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\\"- \\"They were defeated.\\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\\"l'art pour l'art\\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \\"Bosie\\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \\"posing as a sodomite\\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \\"gross indecencies,\\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \\"hard labor\\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \\"immoral\\" book, if \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \\"care twopence\\" - could consider this novel \\"perverted,\\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \\"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \\"[a]ll art is quite useless,\\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I found the first half or so of this novel the stronger, more interesting part, mostly for the unbelievable abundance of mercilessly satirical paradoxes of the cleverest quality.The building of the story around three characters, really quite different, is satisfying; though, as the story goes on, it's really only about Dorian and his mysterious portrait.The most prominent character for the first part is Lord Harry, the mouthpiece for all of the novel's notoriously subversive paradoxes. People may find him irritating because of his supercilious, scornful intellectual brilliance - they may even be jealous of him because of this, like I was to begin with; and then others will most likely be offended becuase of his espousal of an immoral aestheticism which disregards corrupting social consequences. Yet, I find Lord Harry as remote and inflexible in his decadent aestheticism as any unsympathetic moralist I've ever met in fiction - it's just Lord Harry chooses to be moralistic in a paradoxical, unconventional way. His attitudes are exclusive and unbending, and he lives out his beliefs uncompromisingly. He is impatient of any other view - yes, he is highly moralistic - a brilliant character. I don't think he's meant to be taken too seriously, in the sense that one tries to warm to him or learn from him, like one does with central, powerful characters in other stories - he does not serve that purpose. He's not there to be engaged with; if you attempt it, he'll laugh at you and push you away. He has a weary dislike of you before you even begin reading. So, if you try to make yourself like him, it won't work, and you'll dislike him all the more, and may dislike the novel because of it. Don't upset yourself: read it in the right way. It fully deserves it, because there are pages and pages of gifted prose to be in awe of.Dorian can be likeable because of his sincerity. If I've mistaken him and he isn't really sincere, then I like him because at least he's never at ease with himself for his bad actions - though even that might not be totally true! Well, he is not the same as Lord Harry; he doesn't repulse your advances towards him as a reader like Lord Harry. He's not untouchable.I don't think the story is making any great moral point. Such is the beauty of the writing style and the ideas and the way the people are, rather than who they are, that I think the characters are secondary, in some strange way. The tragedy that befalls two of the main characters near the end of the book isn't heart wrenching. But that isn't a fault of the author's in not making them likeable enough or not developing them well enough; because, like I say, they are slightly removed from us. What is presented for our delectation is the beauty of how they are, more than the morality of how they ought to behave."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"In books, magazines, television, etc. in the English-speaking world, we often come across references made to Oscar Wilde, as many people quote his witty sayings and lines. Having come across so many of these references and quotations myself, I was hesitant to pick up any of his works, assuming that to understand and appreciate Wilde I would have to be some kind of a literary scholar. Let me set the record straight: this is definitely not the case at all, as Oscar Wilde is very down to earth and easy to understand.He is a gifted writer and I understand now why people quote him so much. He's a master at putting thoughts to pen and paper so ingeniously. After I found out for myself what he was all about, I regret that I never read his books earlier. I picked up this book that included various works and I was truly amazed at his genius. He interlaces humor with the heavy so cleverly.In all of his works you can easily identify a so-called \\"dandy\\", a male character whose one role is to make flippant but ironically true remarks to the dismay of stuffy characters. The quotes we so often see or hear are usually remarks uttered by one of Wilde's dandies. Offering tongue-in-cheek humor with wholehearted honesty, Wilde called a spade, a spade but could so with such brilliant wit. Oh if only I could be even half as gifted with the pen!I am not going to write about any plots of the stories and plays, as other readers have done that already. I simply wanted to say that if you have never read anything by Wilde, I highly recommend you do. I am confidant you will enjoy. You could end up like me, frantically longing to get your hands on as much of his writing as you can."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray is a great work of fiction. Its interplay of Hellenic thought and Judaeo-Christian ethics was light years ahead of its time, even though it might come across muddled to the casual reader. Perhaps, this novel was too far ahead of its time, as it was eventually used as evidence against Wilde in two court cases for 'gross indecency' in 1895.It is a simple story; really, Basil Hallward paints a lovely portrait of Dorian Gray, a veritable Adonis. As the Painter puts the finishing touches upon this portrait, Gray is involved with a conversation regarding the nature of beauty with Lord Henry (Harry) Wotton. This culminates in Dorian wishing and praying that his beauty may never diminish; that he'd have eternal youth. Ultimately, the painting would bear all of the marks of sin, decadence, and decay that cause our physical bodies to age, while Dorian kept his stunning good looks. Wilde brings about a rather wonderful conclusion, and it is a very enjoyable story.The Picture of Dorian Gray has its dull parts. It doesn't remain current, and I'd suggest getting a copy with notes, so that you may be able to keep up with all of the references. Let's be honest, in 2004 who really cares about what was fashionable in 19th century France? These are questions the notes can clarify, and make some of the references more amiable. Still there are parts where Wilde just lists things, and these you should skip.When reading this novel, I think it becomes clear that the three main personalities are a reflection of society at that time. While Basil Hallward seemed to personify Christian conservatism, and a mundane attachment to the status quo, Lord Henry is the questioning romantic, a character that seems to argue everything yet prove nothing, and believe in even less. This makes him no less interesting, and I believe Wilde may have included him as a farce of some of his contemporaries, yet some of the best insights and quotes actually come from Lord Henry.Dorian is the romantic ideal of perfection. Though a horrible character that fears no consequences for his actions, he still remains perfection. I think that aristocratic England valued physical appearance, social wit, and worldliness more than an ethical life.Dorian Gray also typifies Wilde's affections for Hellenic culture. Dorian is the stereotypical Greek Tragic Hero. He has a flaw; his vanity; this flaw leads to his downfall; a life of sin; he realizes his flaw in the end, and tries to make amends, but it is too little too late. If you enjoy Shakespeare Allusions, you will enjoy this.I really liked The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I will not advise one way or the other whether you should read it or not. If you want something stimulating that will have an enormity of good quotes that will make your dominating intellect seem even more so to the untrained eye, then check it out. If you're looking for pulp go check out Tom Clancey or Danielle Steele."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Innocent and young Dorian Gray is seduced by some bad influences, and taught to worship youth, beauty, and sensation. Due to a passionate prayer, the physical effects of a life dedicated to self-gratification and pleasure-seeking are borne by a painting of him instead of by his own body. The story focuses not on the actual events of Dorian's life, but the discussions on the philosophies supporting such a life. To this reviewer, the message is that a life of selfishness and self-gratification corrupts, and in the end we can have no separation from this corruption. Dorian Gray is a tad slow at times, as the conversations can get long, but it is still educational, and certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I never would have thought this interesting combination of Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Dickens possible. For those of you who follow my writing, you know that I really liked Mr. Wilde's \\"Importance of Being Earnest.\\" And his \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is enough to put him right up there with Mr. Marlowe, Mr. Shakespeare, and Mr. Dickens. Like any good tale of terror, the story starts normal and plausible. We only get to know Sybil for a short while, but she delivers a very touching passage on her love for Dorian which prepares her very sympathetic character. Her brother is prepared early and resurfaces with good timing. Basil is well drawn as the artist who has an interesting fascination with Dorian. We only see Alan Campbell briefly, but we are permitted to feel some sympathy for him when he is forced into a criminal act and finds himself overcome with anxiety. Harry is a well drawn character who not only provides comical touches, but jokes (unknowingly) about many dark thoughts that are undoubtedly revolving in Dorian's mind. And Dorian? What a wonderful creation! First we get to see him as a normal person. Soon afterwards, we see his dark desires. We see him fall in love, and then we see his love turn to abuse. But even as we see his character descend into evil, Wilde never quite permits us to forget that he is human. This is especially prevalent when he longs for his childhood innocence. Wilde masterfully builds tension when Dorian's unchanged face starts to raise questions. And as if this were not enough, Wilde allows Dorian's reputation to degenerate with his character. What's left? Only beautiful and excellent wording, magnificent suspense, terrifying moments, dramatic irony, some well placed comical touches, etc, etc, etc. This is a phenomenal book that offers an interesting combination of Marlowe's techniques (showing pacts with evil), Shakespeare's techniques (articulate wording and passages), and Dickens' techniques. (Fierce humor side by side with pure terror.) DO NOT let this phenomenal masterpiece get away!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wow. This was my first Wilde, and I don't think it will be my last. Another reviewer said that this book was about people doing horrible things, and yet the book was impossible to put down.Nearly everyone knows the story. Dorian Gray wishes that his portrait will show the ravages of time and wickedness while he remains young and beautiful - and he gets his wish. I knew that Dorian's life was going to be ruined - and at times I could predict what was going to happen next. Usually that turns me away from a book. But Wilde's storytelling is so delectable, so riveting that (to use a cliche) it was like watching a train wreck. Terrible to see, but I couldn't look away. I was fascinated.I have heard complaints about the 'flowery' language, but I loved it!Being the overthinker that I am, this book also raised some questions for me: Was Dorian really corrupted by Lord Henry, or did Lord Henry merely show the world Dorian's true hidden nature? Was Basil to blame somehow for painting the portrait? This was probably Wilde's goal - to make us think, and to make us question our hidden nature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Ever since I got my kindle, I've been downloading free classics and The Picture of Dorian Gray was one of them. I remembered it was an option to read for our British Literature final paper so it caught my eye. I started reading the book knowing absolutely nothing about it and within the first few pages I was caught up in its beautiful writing and witty banter between the characters. It's a great story about how a man basically trades his soul for his youth. Wilde writes about the debauchery that Dorian goes through without being so literal about it, which is probably because he was living during victorian times, but it's great because it lets your imagination wander. He doesn't outright say that Dorian seduces women, gets high, or is bisexual, but you assume all of that from his writing. This is not a story that teaches you to choose the \\"good\\" path in life. It's a story that tells us that if we could be a little hedonistic without consequences we would. I'd love to live Dorian Gray's life for a week to know what it feels like...but then have it erased from my life.The negative reviews were basically that the book is boring. I admit there was this one part of the book where it describes everything that Dorian Gray bought, but it's only for a chapter. Another negative reviewer wrote that this book is full of quotables without substance, and well, I don't think the quotes are a bad thing. It's funny! I personally love reading all types of books, both classic and modern, but the ones that keep me fascinated are the classics. The style of writing is just beautiful."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It felt longer than the actual (approx) 280 paper pages it is. I skipped over some of Dorian's ranting about 60% through. I've never skimmed like that... Even in Anne of Green Gables. Aside from the tangents on his experiences abroad and the scents of different flowers and such, it was a good read. Nice ending, but I feel like it was a bit abrupt.SIDE NOTE ON TECHNICALLY EBOOK ASPECTS:The chapters are not recognized by Kindle. You cannot advance by chapter as in other books."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Rather impressed as I have never read this one. Although, there are a few typos on the Kindle version."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Though many of us no longer believe in \\"corruptible souls,\\" Oscar Wilde's \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" still holds up as literature and a container of meaning. Though the metaphysics of the novel were likely a mere literary device even in Wilde's day, they nonetheless strike at something deep. Essentially, they ask two perennial questions, \\"what does it mean to be a good person?\\" and \\"How do I know if I'm a good person?\\" Unlike most non-literary mortals, the extremely corruptible (aren't we all?) Dorian Gray has direct empirical evidence of the state of his \\"goodness.\\" He receives, via a Faustian pact sans Faust, a \\"soul mirror\\" from the hapless painter Basil Hallward. As Gray develops from an innocent, almost waifish, youth endowed with irresistible masculine beauty into the Marquis de Sade of the English leisure class, the painting records his increasing dissoluteness. In trade, his physical being retains all the luster of youth and beauty he possessed at 18. This would provide a near irresistible bargain for many twentieth century people, and one wonders at the number of real but metaphorical equivalents of Gray portraits that exist today. But universal belief in a soul, especially as a \\"chalkboard of one's self,\\" has become quaint (even those who believe in a soul probably don't imbue their lives with this belief). Who then, apart from religious adherents, today really worries about \\"damage to the soul\\" in an eschatologically consistent manner that would make Wilde's book blare a meaningful warning signal? Hasn't such thought gone the way of the ether and phlogiston (even though exorcists still dwell among us)? Why read this novel?The simple answer is that \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" remains great literature, though even that concept carries far less weight today than fifty years ago. But if by \\"great literature\\" we mean a story with depth, intrigue, drama and unforgettable characterization then maybe more antennas perk up. Many have also called it a \\"horror story,\\" so perhaps one can subsume it under precursors to Steven King and other morally based modern horror novels? Whatever convenient label one puts on such works, great stories, be they novels, movies, video games, hieroglyphics, songs, dances, buildings, or even a splotch on the sidewalk, teach us something about ourselves. They flip that often neglected \\"introspection switch\\" somewhere in our wiring that supercharges the wonder mechanism. So regardless of the now ancient metaphysics and 19th century ethos of this novel, the telling of such a story as a \\"horror fable\\" still touches that ineffable part of us that strives for \\"goodness,\\" whatever that means. Dorian Gray explores this theme by depicting the abstraction of goodness in visual form that morphs in sympathy with some objective measure of that quality. This in itself summons the creeping question \\"what would my portrait look like?\\" As well as \\"what standards would make my portrait writhing and horrid?\\" The novel suggests, amongst other things, that disregarding the situations of others and focusing selfishly on one's own pleasures makes one corrupt. Sybil Vane's tragic end, arguably the result of Gray's selfish cruelty, produces the portrait's first \\"scrupulous twitch.\\" We still experience these wispy twitches today, with or without a belief in souls. But our increasingly individualistic world throws rationalizations up for any parallel behavior. In a curious twist to the enlightenment-inspired right of \\"pursuit of happiness\\" we suddenly find ourselves morally justifying the destruction of others in the name of principles of \\"individual freedom.\\" This novel seems to eschew such thinking all the way to Gray's macabre and unforgettable death scene. The portrait wasn't so detached from the body after all, it seems. Reducing the book's \\"moral\\" down to a platitude such as \\"selfish hedonism doesn't pay\\" belittles Wilde's achievement. Though really, it says as much but in a beautiful and horrifyingly satisfying way. And it says it in a way that even touches the modern sensibility. Fables can still have impact in an emergent posthumanist era.Another reason to read \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is that, being Wilde's only novel, one can claim to the unknowing that \\"I have read all of Oscar Wilde's novels\\" and come across as quite educated indeed. Of course Wilde was well known for his plays. And the sensibilities of the playwright do appear throughout this short book, with the exception of some long passages of narrative summary in the book's second half. Copious dialogue inhabits large sections, especially when the loquacious Lord Henry Wotton spews his neo-hedonist views. These play a role in Gray's corruption and also suggest a fear of contagious and dangerous ideas. Can ideas corrupt? \\"Dorian Gray\\" seems to say \\"yes.\\" But this novel will not corrupt. It will entertain, being a great story, and it will inspire thinking, because it has substance. And since it spins a great yarn it also has the ability to moralize without the appearance of moralizing. Double bonus. So voluminous reasons exist to pick up and chew at this old tale, either in fiber or electronically. And, finally, if you're going to write only one novel, make it a jaw-dropper. Wilde did."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Beautiful beautiful copy. I was delighted to receive this in the post. It looks like an aged piece of literature--which it is.

Print it out from some other source if you are going to buy this edition. The story is amazing otherwise!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil Hallward is an artist, who paints a portrait of Dorian Gray, a very good looking and nave young man. The portrait is a masterpiece that in reality depicts Basil's feelings for Dorian, as well as, Dorian's youth and beauty.Lord Henry Wotton, a seductive emotional predator and selfish pleasure seeker, is a friend of Basil who meets Dorian at Basil's house and gives him a philosophical speech about the fading nature of youth and beauty. Dorian whose greatest qualities are his youth and beauty pledges his soul to stay young and beautiful. As part of the deal Dorian Gray's portrait becomes the surrogate for the disgrace and aging of the real Dorian Gray.Under the growing influence of Lord Henry over Dorian, the later embraces Hedonism and increasingly sinks into a sinful corrupt life and shows no regard for values or morals. A tragic event caused by Dorian's behaviors starts the projection of Dorian's ugliness and self -centeredness on the portrait. Dorian creates excuses and excuses himself with lame explanations for the tragedy and hides his portrait so he can't see the hideous transformation of himself reflected in his picture. As long as his beauty remains, he can ignore the changes in his portrait. It's interesting how Dorian tries to avoid his inner feeling of ugliness by trying to surround him self by beauty, and other beautiful distractions such as roses and music.Basil's love for Dorian, which is likely a real life reflection of Wilde's love for Lord Alfred Douglas, causes Basil to defend and protect Dorian, even from his self destructive acts, until the last shocking event. I'm tempted to describe the ending event, but I won't deprive the reader from the pleasure of exploration and discovery.Given the period when this novel was written, Wilde is artistically candid and courageous beyond belief. Wilde displays his usual wit, sarcastic playful ways and funny style, while he walks us through serious dilemmas like the supremacy of youth and beauty, homosexual feelings, repentance and murder. Wilde grabs the reader through the use of shocking events that not only criticize Victorian morality, but ironically displays a moral lesson about vanity and narcissism.\\"The picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a wonderful piece of literature in which the portrait asserts itself as Dorian's conscience in a superficial society that places values on looks and wealth while ignoring the real value of humans. Simply, a one of a kind work."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If you want a new slant on this classic novel, read 'The Ripper Code' by Thomas Toughill.

It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious.

He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative.

Filled with deliciously witty, catty wordplay and bon mots from a day where banter was highly valued, Wilde was skillfully adept at scrutinizing society and all of its flaws. The Picture of Dorian Gray is tragically ahead of its time, its philosophies on aestheticism and art are still relevant today - and will most likely always be. There were a few downsides (as I said, very few), including some dense chapters expelling the virtues, of well, non-virtue. Wilde would swiftly make up for these with delightful conversations taken straight out of the parlors of the age in which he lived. While some of them felt contrived, Dorian's slow decay into hedonism is wonderfully depicted, and the haunting last paragraph of the novel will stick with every reader. The theses the author conveys are spellbinding and dead-on, and the descriptions colored with imagery and allusions referencing Shakespeare and mythology are vivid. Wilde makes one question their own limits and passions, and engages the reader into being an active participant in life and reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a beautiful and witty tale about a depraved man.

Dorian Gray is captured at the height of his physical charms in a painting and soon discovers that the corruption of his body and soul is reflected in the painting while he retains his youthful attractiveness. His life becomes one of increasing debauchery and narcissism.The most quotable of authors, Wilde uses a friend of the young man to deliver an endless collection of axioms and witty observations that add another dimension to the plot.As Gray becomes more convinced of his invincibility he grows more callous toward others and his actions become less human and more monstrous as the story progresses."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Am I no less agreeable?

But they don't see his other life. His loathing of the once-beautiful portrait which now displays his age, sins and iniquities. This deep hatred drives him to do many strange things in this dark, twisting tale of morale, age and youth. The book follows Dorian through love, loss, murder, disdain, hurt and ofcourse, happiness.

He proceeds to live his life by indulging himself in episodes of increasing debauchery and immorality, wrecking other people's lives and committing blackmail and even murder, and all the while his portrait bears the physical signs of his aging while his own body remains young and fresh. The novel offers some weighty questions: Would we choose to be immoral if we knew we were immortal? Is an artist's work the manifestation of his own latent immorality? Are the world's imperfections, sins, and shames represented better through art than through reality?As much as I admire Oscar Wilde's great play &quot;The Importance of Being Ernest,&quot; I must admit that I found some faults with this short novel of his. Despite its florid prose and dialogue containing wickedly caustic wit and punchy aphorisms that evoke a time when conversation was an art, the novel has a strangely artificial, stiff tone. With dialogue that sounds like it would have to be rehearsed before spoken and many scene descriptions that seem like stage directions, it often reads like a play that's been converted into a novel. Interior furnishings are described in the meticulous detail of a Sotheby's catalog; a nice touch, but what's the point?

Bravo to Mr. WIlde !!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Portrait of Dorian Gray is a classic work of Gothic fiction and a gripping - if somewhat disturbing - study on man's morality. The title character, the beautiful and naive Dorian Gray, sells his soul so that he can remain beautiful forever. Instead of his body ageing, a portrait of him suffers instead. What follows is a tragic tale of decadence and hedonism as Dorian Gray succumbs to a lifestyle of excess and debauchery. The painting acts as Dorian's own soul, mutating with each sin he commits, while he remains untouched. Dorian's journey through the recesses of his own mind is a harrowing study of human nature and one that is impossible to put down."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A bit of an odd read, but I enjoyed it a lot.

Wilde is a genius of literature. Everyone should read this book"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is a classic about the timeless quest for youth and beauty. The desire to find a fountain of youth rings as true today as it did in 1890 when the story was first published. Dorian Gray is a young and dashingly handsome man. When he looks at a portrait that was painted of him it stirs up the regrettable fact that he's at the top of his game now and will never look better. He's irritated that the portrait will continue to look the same and in a sense mock him as he ages in real life. What's a man to do? There was no such thing as plastic surgery back then, and Botox was unheard of. Dorian laments: \\"Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture could change, and I could be always what I am now!\\" Boom. He gets his wish. That brings us to the old adage, be careful what you wish for. Being young and beautiful is wonderful--at first. Many, many years later, it can get tiresome, at least for Dorian. Dorian doesn't know what to do with all that time. He studies many things and that part of the book got a tad tiresome for me. But stick with it, things get better and a lot more interesting. I thought this was a great book. I liked the story and Wilde's writing style. It's a classic \\"must-read.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Nothing that can be said of this book will truely do it justice- you must read it to understand it.Some books are so clearly written that when a character voices a thought all you want to do is agree and quote it so others can see what you didn't even know- but have now relized- you were thinking. This book offers rich ideas on everything in life guided by the moral decay of Dorian Gray who's fulfilled wish of youth becomes the means to vices and sins. Meanwhile two friends offer opposing advice- and through it all there is no black and white and moral judgement. Simply a tale of human desires and dissapointments. Though it was written long ago it could have been told today and still ring just as true (perhaps with just alternate form of transportation and letters being sent via e-mail)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I had to go back and rethink and reread this story, but profoundly moved by how timeless the message seems to be. Modern culture (Hollywood etc...) would benefit from what seems to be the basic MORAL of this story. The more shallow and superficial the pursuits in life, the more corrupt, evil, wicked and proverted one can become. This is a fact, no \\"religious right\\" or anyone else, made it up. Many just turn their backs or ignore the truth. Mr. Wilde himself should have taken a lesson or two from his own story. What a tragedy with his talent to die sick, corrupt, lonely and penniless. At least this classic work came from all the sadness and despair.....too bad.I have often thought that this tale may be one that would be a great stage production/story....Mr. Wilde should have possibly considered it, again............too bad!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When Oscar Wilde published his only novel back in 1890 he caused much excitement among the literary critics and the society as a whole. And I'm a little bit puzzled because there is no evidence that the book deserves some negative feedback. It seems to me that someone who criticizes the ideas in the novel and summarizes it as an \`immoral' demonstrates high level of hypocrisy. This is art and art is about freedom of imagination and expressing. If we expect from art to represent only moral emotions we experience in our daily life then art wouldn't worth so much.The story of the book is somehow very simple. A young and innocent man named Dorian Gray fascinates an artist so much that the artist finds inspiration even in his only presence. Basil Hallward confides his secret obsession to a friend of his named Lord Henry Wotton and at that very moment Henry decides to meet Dorian. From their meeting on, their relationship is the main point around which the story evolves. Henry is a cynic person who has very provocative and fascinating way of declaring his position for most of the aspects of life. His attitude is uncommon for 19th century London high society and could be characterized as immoral. Dorian gradually adopts the lifestyle Henry proclaims and indulges in taking maximum from the life no matter the cost and no matter who will have to pay for it. On the other hand a rash desire expressed by Doran that the portrait Basil has painted of him ages and Dorian himself stays forever young becomes true. With always innocent look on his beautiful face Dorian is in a very good position to take maximum of his life and he does it. By breaking norms, recognized by high society he ruins lives of most persons attracted and charmed by his beauty and charisma. Lord Henry stays always beside him as a \`spiritual' mentor while Basil goes to the background of Dorian's world. The picture Dorian hides in an abandoned room in his house shows not only marks of aging but also is a mirror of Dorian's soul - everything he does reflects on the picture's face expression which turns to an evil grimace that disgusts Dorian. Finally he comes to a moment that feels sorry for the life he had chosen and decides to make everything possible so that to restore his portrait's humane look as much as possible.The end of the story proved quite an intriguing to me and I feel somehow confident that such an end seems to be the most logical for the story although being drastic and direct in his representation.The writing style of Wilde is of a person who knows very well what he has to say and in the same time you don't get feeling that someone is trying to teach you something. On the contrary - this novel looks like a very good related story. On some moments too much attention is paid to the details, something that represents more successfully the atmosphere of the story but the movement suffers a little bit.I personally am in deep sympathies for Lord Henry's character. His directly stated position on the topic is very often shocking but the interesting part is that you could stay and think a while and take from it what you appreciate. Nothing in this world is completely wrong I think. Just be careful not to fall into blind deviation and become second Dorian Gray."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"With today's slippery morals and exhausting vanity, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an eerie comparison to &quot;then&quot; and now. There are many interesting scenes in the book that make this book very exciting. It is about a man who, upon receiving a portrait of himself, is so upset that it will &quot;mock&quot; him with it's permanent beauty, while he will age and decay. He makes a wish that he will remain young and beautiful and the picture will age and take his sins for him. In the end, though he is beautiful on the outside, he is horrendous on the outside.Definitely a good read for high school students. It's interesting and short, and not as cumbersome as other Romantic novels can be. You can relate it to today's times and it is not a hard read. I did not want to read ANY Romantic novels but I am very happy that I chose this one! And you will be, too!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book offers its readers a chance to understand the meaning of true beauty and the reason why time passes the way that it does. If you enjoy really good quotes that make you think, this is a great book for you. It made me think of ideas and concepts that I had never thought about before. Some reviews of novels say they could &quot;never put the book down.&quot; But what happens when the book is over and it goes on the shelf? I would like to hope that, with this book, the wheels in my head will keep turning, and I will continue to think about the concepts it brought up, and apply it to my own life. I think you will do the same if you read this novel by Oscar Wilde"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde tries to argue in the prologue of this book that literature, as a form of art, is not moralistic and that people therefore should not treat it as such.In all honesty, however, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an extremely moral book; it's just hard to decide what exactly the moral is. The very good and the very bad do not fare that well in this tale of elitist debauchery, while those who go the middle path and avoid both evil and righteousness seem to do quite well. Wilde once said that he wanted to be like Dorian Gray (evil), was perceived by the world as being Lord Henry (moderate), but was actually like Basil Hallward (good). Does this mean that Wilde, by his own moralistic views, was inevitably doomed, regardless of what he tried to be or actually succeeded in being?Anyway, all of this moral stuff is very interesting, but don't fear; the novel isn't terribly philosophical and pretentious. Instead, the book has a by-and-large well-done and consistent plot, and by the end of the novel, when all of these questions of right and wrong are flowing through your head, you can barely recall how on Earth Wilde slipped all that philosophical stuff by you without seeming lofty or ridiculous.I read this book to compete in an essay contest, but I never got around to writing the essay and I'm still glad I read it. A quick and amusing romp through the darkest corners of upper-class 1800s England; recommended."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I absolutely loved the novel written by Oscar Wilde, The Picture Of Dorian Gray. When I was beginning the novel it was a little slow and even a little dry. But, as the plot thickened and the story went on, I can say it is one of my most favorite books ever read. Dorian Gray, the main character, is obsessed with his good looks and his youth. Gray sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. But his close friend who is an artist paints a portrait of Gray. As the years pass Gray doesn't age but the picture does. His conscious and eternal youth ends up becoming well ........ You'll have to read to find out.People most likely to read and enjoy this novel would probably be late teens and older. Mainly because it has a lot to do with being young and having all the time in the world to do whatever and learn and experience so much. It also is a little bit harder to read for someone younger. I would really recommend this novel to everyone. The story is great and has a little bit of everything in it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Rod Stewert once sang that &quot;every picture tells a story&quot;, and in no case is this more true than of one Dorian Gray. By now everyone knows that young Dorian makes a childish wish that a beautiful portrait of his should age in his stead, and that he should remain forever young and vibrant, and somehow this wish is granted. What follows is a tale of increasing debauchery and depravity that poison a man's soul, while leaving no visible clue upon his face.This is not the most entertaining or gripping novel that you will ever read. Far from it, in fact, but the real merits of the novel come not from the action and plot, but from the extremely clever dialogue and the shredding social commentary. (not surprisingly, this novel took a long time to get published, and was later used as evidence against Wilde during his trial for indecency) Wilde takes several shots at the aristocracy, especially their values, as well as art itself, hedonism, and the very concept of morality.Perhaps the finest aspect of the novel are Wilde's quotes, often through his favorite mouthpiece: Lord Henry Wotton. Henry serves as a goad to Dorian through all of his excesses, and he waxes philosophical upon almost any subject that he can get anyone to listen to. He's wonderful and horrible all at once, and best of all, he doesn't even believe half of what he says. This is definitely a 'classic' novel, and well worth the read. Again, if you're expecting high paced action you'd probably best look elsewhere, but if you're in the mood to think a bit, then chances are you'll enjoy &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray is a very sinful, witty, humorous and beautiful book. This has got to be Wilde's most personal work, one can tell from the writing itself that Wilde really put himself into these pages or maybe what he wanted to become. The tale of Dorian and the tale of Wilde have the same kind of \\"tragic ending\\" to it. Wilde's downfall of being accused of homosexuality and Dorian no longer being able to bear the pain of his acts and conducts bring tragic endings to their lives. I think that every person has or has had for a certain amount of time the wish to stay forever young and beautiful, the burden of time not affecting you at all but something else, in Dorian's case, it was the painting, anyways I'm rambling on and on, do read this book, it's 2:00 am right now and I have a Physics exam tomorrow, today actually, anyway, do read it, it's enjoyable, funny, touching and everything else that a good novel should be."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY has enough going for it to retain its classic status for some time to come. It is loaded with epigrammic sentences by a writer who continues to hold interest. Its concept was highly original and has inspired generations of science fiction, fantasy and horror literature since its debut. Wilde stows a lot of his themes and notes on society and character into its pages, so that it often reads like a stack of dispatches from the late 19th century. The dinner party scenes are priceless. It is certainly worth reading in order to understand why Dorian Gray has entered our language, so often alluded to.While possessing the above traits, the novel does have its flaws that are more pronounced under the glare of contemporary light. Wilde's bigotry shows through. Some of the passages are melodramatic and wooden. Dorian Gray's physical beauty is a work of art, and as Wilde says at the outset, all art is useless. However much he embodies many of Wilde's ideas, he remains rather vapid, even when he is at his most corrupt. Part of that is due to the fact that many of the actions that condemn him are only spoken of or hinted at. Mostly we see the highlights, the suicide of a young girl to whom he was unjustly cruel and some subsequent deaths."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY was first published in 1890, England was still in the last throes of a Victorian morality that still prided itself on all sorts of morality, especially sexual prudery. Into this realm of things which were not dared to be spoken, along came Oscar Wilde to say them. Wilde's gay background formed a subtext both in the novel and in his personal life that both titillated and repelled much of England.THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is a reworking of the popular literary motif of the consequences of making a deal with the devil. The average Englishmen well knew of Marlowe's Dr. Faustus who had signed such a pact with Mephistopheles involving the exchange of power and knowledge for Faustus' soul. Every human being has a soul worth bartering; Wilde dared to suggest to a homophobic England that even a gay man's soul was as well.Dorian Gray is a young, handsome man whose portrait is painted by Basil Hallward. Beginning with the very introduction of Gray, Wilde consistently combines two seemingly unrelated themes: the role of the artist in society and the role of the gay man in that same society. In the Preface to his book, Wilde maintains his aesthetic belief that the only purpose of art is to have no purpose: \\"All art is useless.\\" Wilde connects this inutility about the nonpurpose of art with the aging and the dissipation of the painting that grows progressively more unattractive the more that Gray sins. Lord Henry Wotton, who is surprisingly the most interesting character in the book with his witty epigrams and biting cynicisms, is the rou&eacute; who leads--or perhaps seduces--an initially innocent Dorian into a life on nonstop debauchery. Dorian, urged on by Wotton to drop Dorian's newest girlfriend, the actress Sybil Vane, crudely berates what he saw as a second rate theatrical performance, causing her to commit suicide in grief at his cutting remarks. After her death, Wotton leads Dorian into a two decade long life fall into sin. Eventually, Dorian considers it time to clean up his act and this is where many readers have become confused with Dorian's advice about art in the Preface and Wotton's advice about art in the book. When Wilde asserts in the Preface that art is useless, he rejects the current Victorian notion that art ought to be used for the betterment of humanity. He states that the contrary is true. Art must not be used for betterment. He further implies that his belief's corollary must be true too: that art cannot harm human life. In fact, as he finishes his Preface, he notes, \\"All art is useless.\\" Yet, in the novel, Wotton rejects Dorian's claim that his painting has led Dorian's beauty on a straight line road to disaster--for Dorian, for Sybil, and earlier for Basil, whom Dorian has murdered. What is apparent, at least to Wotton if not to Dorian, is that it was not art that was responsible for their deaths, but Dorian, who in his hubris wanted to assume the same mantle of godlike near immortality that damned Faustus centuries earlier. Thus, art had nothing to do with Dorian's descent into evil. It was nothing more prosaic than pride gone berserk.Wilde's not so subtle intent at painting his own portrait of a homoerotic connection between Wotton, Dorian, and debauchery has also been a source of much confusion. Wilde could not afford to state explicitly that Dorian was involved on a gay level with Wotton, Adam Campbell or anyone else, but it is pretty clear that homoeroticism was just one in a long line of events that Wilde knew would point out the ongoing degradation of Dorian. But if Wilde allowed Dorian to escape the consequences of his seduction by Wotton, then he might not have been able to find a publisher. It was hard enough the way it was to do that.Readers today regard THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY as a fascinating if not a dated period piece about trading one's soul for forbidden delights, but no other book warns of the consequences as eloquently as this one."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I picked up this book to read, partly because I am a big fan of Wilde's plays, and partly because the concept behind this novel has become such a part of our collective conscious that I wanted to know what was behind it.It was filled with all the wit and cynicism that I expect from Wilde, but, I found it to be a bit tiresome to read. I suspect that this is partially due to the fact that it is so solidly grounded in the late 1800's that the concerns of the characters are a bit distant.Still, I must say that I feel that it is a book worth reading. Anything that has seared itself into the western world's consciousness is worth investigating."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"To my mind, this is one of the best works in all of English literature. Oscar Wilde is a artist who uses the page as his canvas and the written word as his paint. His wit cuts at the human condition like a scalpel with depth and precision. Dorian Gray is his finest work.This is a Faustian tale of a man who utters an oath offering his soul for the youth portrayed in a painting of him, if only it would age instead of he. He discovers that the wish has been granted, only he gets more than he requested, as the painting shows not only the marks of age, but also the marks upon his soul as he slips into a hedonistic and odious life.I have read a lot of criticism of this book by modern and especially young readers as being slow and boring. This is much like the criticism of a beer guzzler describing a fine wine. \\"Forget the bouquet and refined taste, just give me my buzz.\\" This story, and the subtle philosophies contained within, need to be sipped deliberately and relished. There is page after page of astute insight into the paradoxes and ironies of society and the mysteries of being human. To be bored with this is to be insensate to life's depth and meaning.Many have also criticized the book as espousing hedonism and attacking Victorian society especially at the time it was written. Such critics wrongly assume that Lord Henry is Wilde's mouthpiece for a fatalistic and cynical philosophy. Actually, the exact opposite is true. The cynic is the one being satirized, not society.Lord Henry uses paradoxical aphorisms to bolster his sardonic view. However, they are specious and self validating arguments that look at the small truths about the world and draw the wrong conclusion. Rather than assume that these eccentricities and foibles are things that we can and should rise above, he draws the conclusion that we should embrace and accept our instinctive weaknesses. He ignores the higher truths and points out instead how the capitulation to our own desires sets us free. Wilde's refutation of this philosophical connivance comes in the person of Dorian Gray.Dorian was Lord Henry's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. He was living the life that Harry espoused (but ironically didn't live himself). And what was the result of Dorian's decadence? He lived a life of torment and self loathing. He agonized over the hideous marks on his soul as catalogued by the portrait with each dastardly deed. Wilde is telling us that this is what such self indulgence and cynicism about life and society brings. His message is that a civilized society, with all its inconsistencies, paradoxes and ironies, is preferable and superior to living like an animal. By smiting Dorian, he is really smiting Lord Henry and everything he advocates. He is making a case for the soul over the body; intellect over instinct.This is an exquisite and thought provoking treasure that is every bit as relevant now as it was almost a century ago when it was written. I have read it a number of times through the years and I never tire of it. As I have gotten older and more experienced, its truths have become more vivid and resonant. If you've never read it, pick it up and savor it. Don't rush through it for the plot. Ponder it as you read. If you have already read it, put it away and try it again in five or ten years. You may discover new meaning, and much that you missed. That's the beauty of a timeless novel. Its wisdom will wait patiently until you've had time to catch up."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray, a story of morals, psychology and poetic justice, has furnished Oscar Wilde with the status of a classical writer. It takes place in 19th-century England, and tells of a man in the bloom of his youth who will remain forever young.Basil Hallward is a merely average painter until he meets Dorian Gray and becomes his friend. But Dorian, who is blessed with an angelic beauty, inspires Hallward to create his ultimate masterpiece. Awed by the perfection of this rendering, he utters the wish to be able to retain the good looks of his youth while the picture were the one to deteriorate with age. But when Dorian discovers the painting cruelly altered and realizes that his wish has been fulfilled, he ponders changing his hedonistic approach.Dorian Gray's sharp social criticism has provoked audible controversy and protest upon the book's 1890 publication, and only years later was it to rise to classical status. Written in the style of a Greek tragedy, it is popularly interpreted as an analogy to Wilde's own tragic life. Despite this, the book is laced with the right amounts of the author's perpetual jaunty wit."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This has to be one of my favorite books of all time. This is breath-takingly honest look at life when the physical is all we look at...and many of us do.From the brilliant quotes to the numerous times when Dorian Gray proves what a scoundrel he is, this book makes any reader think and enjoy their own lives much more to see what that type of thinking causes. Here is a man who looks lke a Greek God and he takes everything for granted because he knows his powers will never allow his looks to be tarnished. Then he loses his sanity and actually commits murder on his artis who painted him and then does himself in!Not only brilliant, but pretty funny, too!Check out this book! It's a once in a lifetime experience!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. There is a lot of philosophy packed into this short, fictitious account of several (three main characters) rich men who live life in a very nonchalant, yet formal environment. The characters are developed beautifully and invoke strong emotion toward each one. I found myself hating Henry, loving Basil and having strange mixed feelings for Dorian. While there are a lot of different views in regard to the overarching theme of the book, I believe (along with what seems like a majority) that the book is about morality. Man left to his own logic (shown in the character of Henry) is left only with death, and a meaningless existence. Dorian shows (I believe) the struggle of man in choosing a morality outside of human authority and logic. Dorian loses the struggle and of course it ends with his own death, which in reality is the logical conclusion to a life lived for one's own pleasure.It is interesting to note that Oscar Wilde was an accomplished painter himself, and got the idea for this book through an actual experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and the different themes that the book brought out."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"First let me say that this is a very good story. I truly did enjoy reading this book and read it in a matter of days. I very much like the modern library version since it had nice print along with some good notes.Second, this is a deep story. The first 100 pages is about the philosophy of Lord Henry. I am not sure but I equate Lord Henry to the devil. It is either that or the devil is working through Lord Henry. Thoughout the book, it appears that Lord Henry knows what is going on with Dorian even though he was not around when certain events took place. One must read and then read again chapter two of this book. This is the chapter that reveals Lord Henry's philosophy. It is deep so I had to read that chapater twice.After the first 100 pages and it is clear what the picture represents, it becomes much more of a fast paced novel. However, chapter XI (11) is a difficult read. At the end of chapter X (10) Dorian is only 19 years old. At the beginning of chapter XII (12) he is now 38 years old. Chapter 11 basically gives you a history of his life in those 19 years. It seems as if it was added later to give this history. It did add a little to the story but not too much.I very much liked how the book ended but it seemed a little quick for me. However, this book did get me thinking and that is the point of the story.Given that this is a short book (only 254 pages) it is well worth the read. I recommend to anyone that has any type of interest in Gothic stories read this book. Even if you don't have an interest in Gothic stories, this is still a very good, quick read. You will not be disappointed that you read this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The greatest marriage of classic literature and modern philosophy, poetry masquerading as prose, and a psychological epic in art-house clothing ever created! The genius of Oscar Wilde knew no bounds, and this book remains disturbingly chilling and alarmingly familiar over a hundred years after its first controversial publication. Though the plot could never exist anywhere outside of fiction, it is at once starkly shocking and believeable, never once wavering from the quietly accusing mood set early on.Dorian Gray is a beautiful youth who becomes painter Basil Hallward's artistic obsession, and the masterpiece painting Basil creates of Dorian seems to mock the young man, who grows jealous of the fact that it will never grow old or ugly, as he knows he will. He silently curses the painting and wishes it would age instead of him, and eerily enough, the painting becomes in itself a picture of Dorian's vain, ugly, hedonistic, and murderous soul.Indelibly true and deliciously quirky, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a treasure trove of genius observations and statements so true and yet so stunning you'll be forced to look over it a second time, just to make sure you didn't miss any of Wilde's poignant words. Well worth your time and energy, this book is reason enough to fake sick from school or work so you'll have the extra time to read it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde is a man who is obsessed by appearances. In this particular novel, he follows from the moment Dorian Gray sells his soul to the devil named beauty and youth, pleasure and enjoyment, to his death and he describes how someone who looks perfect, perfectly young, intelligent, brilliant, beautiful, moral and healthy is in fact nothing but a monster decaying in all possible immoral actions, deeds and ways just under the surface. It is a very strong criticism of victorian society that considers appearances as more important than real ethics and morality. He exposes the hypocrisy of such a society where a whole class of people are nothing but perambulating pictures of perfection hiding the mire and mud of crime and evil. We can also feel another dilemma in this book. Oscar Wilde's own dilemma who has to keep up appearances, the appearances of a well behaved, well educated and perfectly integrated man in this aristocratic society of his, and who yet lives a passion and a whole basket of desires and impulses that are absolutely rejected as crimes by victorian society. We know he will not be able to hide this deeper nature forever. But the book shows that no one can evade one's being exposed and rejected, condemned and sentenced to some punishment forever. There always comes a moment when one will be exposed and rejected. This shows how deeply Oscar Wilde must have suffered in his life. The painting is nothing but a mirror of the deeper self of Dorian Gray, but a mirror who will become one day his accuser.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Appropriately, I read this book while travelling the dark, sombre tube system in London. I already knew the story, but what struck me most was the perfection of the writing. Wilde uses such beautiful, concise and clear language to convey his own version of the Faustian legend.The subject matter is troubling to some but one cannot deny the quality of the art."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book at times appears to be a sequence of Wilde's best one-liners, intersperced with narrative. Once, when I thought that that was all that the book was, I still liked it: after all, the story was a good one, the one-liners were mostly good, and if the two didn't fit well together, well, that was a pity, but it didn't prevent the book from being fun to read.I realise now that the book packs a greater moral punch than I'd thought. Wilde makes evil seem genuinely attractive; and this is not to be done merely by telling us that so-and-so finds evil attractive, and then giving a spurious causal explanation. When Dorian performs his first act of genuine cruelty, not only Henry, but the author as well, tell us to forget about it, that it doesn't really matter. They even give us some genuinely good arguments. (Whereas Basil, the force of good, seems to be able to do little but utter stolid platitudes.) So we forget about it as much as Dorian does, and are hit over the head all the more smartly by the end of the book. It's true, Wilde still gets a bit carried away with himself in places; and the effect of seeing so many of his epigrams together in the one place is to make us wonder if we could write a computer program capable of creating a couple of hundred more; but I was wrong in my initial reaction. The flippancy and the deep seriousness are both necessary. They contrast, but they do not clash."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book as part of a personal quest to read some of the classic authors and was pleasantly surprised. I read some of the other reviews posted for the book and since it was free for Kindle I grabbed it. It was an awesome read that i felt was very relevant even though it was written many years ago.It tells the story of Dorian Gray who is a beautiful young man who has his portrait painted and upon seeing the protrait's beauty, doesn't think that he could ever live up to its beauty. He wishes that the picture could age instead of him and with that, in effect makes a \\"deal with the devil\\". Who actually turns out to be an acquaintance of the painter. Now I must clarify that the use of the term devil isn't literal or traditional in the sense of a scary creature whom Dorian encounters and actually makes a deal. Over time, it becomes apparent that Dorian doesn't age and that the picture does which causes a emotional distress for Dorian and we see him living his life in seclusion and treachery.People who encounter Dorian seem to have harm follow them or they in fact, harm (kill) themselves. All the while, he maintains his boyish looks and draws the ire of the townspeople and becomes the subject of many comments, rumors, and suggestions.In the end Dorian decides that the only way to be free and have a clean slate is to destroy the very thing that he feels has been holding him back...the picture and what happens next...well...I guess you should just read the book ;-)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book.The Picture of Dorian Gray Starring: George Sanders, Hurd Hatfield"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray, a young man of high English society, possesses a beauty that any man or women would long for. However, the reader soon realizes that even the purest beauty can not save us from the horrors and intrigue of sin. After seeing his portrait, Dorian curses the fact that soon his beauty will fade and declares \\"if it were I who was to be always young, and the picture to grow old! For that - I would give everything\\". Dorian soon finds that his ill-fated wish has come true, and his portrait now carries the burden of age. As the years pass, Dorian becomes obsessed with sins and evils, for they do not afflict his personal appearance, but rather aid in the deterioration of his portrait, his soul. But, although Dorian continues to sin and think nothing of the consequences of his actions, he is consumed with an overwhelming fear that his portrait and sins will be revealed to the world. Through the actions and sins of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde shows human's weakness to the evils of the world. Wilde urges all readers to renounce sinning for it leads to the deterioration of one's moral principles, but more importantly, creates an everlasting fear that can destroy one's soul and eventually destroy one's desire to live. This story should be read by teenagers everywhere for it shows that the true nature of our character is judged by the beauty of one's soul, rather than the beauty of one's face."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Though it's rather slow to get going in the initial chapters, Oscar Wilde's &quot;Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; builds up into a splendidly effective piece, written in highly polished prose. Dorian Gray, who is suggestively described as &quot;charming&quot; and &quot;beautiful&quot; ... is painted by his friend and admirer, Basil Hallward. Dorian, a self-centered social luminary whose character is reminiscent of Narcissus, makes a bizarre sub-Faustian wish which tragically comes true: that his beautiful portrait may age, while he retains his youthful looks. The conclusion is disastrous, the culmination of a narrative containing elements of murder, suicide, blackmail, a confrontation in a grimy alley and an episode in an opium den. The characters are very well sketched out, particularly the triad of Dorian, Basil and the intellectual cynic, Lord Henry, Dorian's mentor and the mouthpiece of some of Wilde's most cutting amoral opinions. The style is, typically, marvellous, characterised by brilliant exchanges and aphoristic gaiety. Wilde lacerates English bourgeois culture, the conceptions of sin and virtue and the attitudes towards art of his time with tremendous aplomb. Some of his quips are patently snide, sometimes mysogynistic, as in: &quot;Woman represents the triumph of matter over mind, while man represents the triumph of mind over morals.&quot; Oh, isn't that just despicable?! I love it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If you could retain your youth, what would you give up? What would you be willing to barter? Imagine, you're always young, vibrant, desired and the envy of all those who age around you?The Picture of Dorian Gray doesn't set out to answer the question, just to pose it. Oscar Wilde writes like no other I've read. The prose moves along along like a tempestuous sea. It rolls, it sways, it rocks and occasionally calms before the next surge. Amazing penmanship. Verbose conversations stir between the players as they seek to answer each other's questions and address each other's comments.The main character of the book, for me, was Lord Henry Wotton. A dandy gentleman who, for his own sake, is way too educated. It always seems to be Henry who plants the seeds of thought, or challenges the conventional wisdom which, in turn, sets the other players thinking. Henry meets Dorian as his portrait is finished by Basil Hallward. Henry, struck by Dorian's youth and beauty, remarks that, as Dorian ages, the picture will constantly remind him of who he was. Dorian wishes it the other way around and, his wish is granted but, at what cost? The picture always remains at the age when Dorian was painted yet, the face reflects Dorian's soul. The soul that becomes more dark and damaged.Chapter XI of this book describes, at Sir Henry's urging, Dorian's exploration into life. I don't think I've ever read anything like it before. Oscar Wilde seemed to have gone mad with the pen as he describes riches, wealth, decadence and hedonism. The finest details of objects of desire are described so richly you can almost feel them. This outpouring of prose meanders over many pages. At the end of the chapter I let out a \\"phew\\" as I felt Wilde had probably thrown down his pen and gone for a nap. I was exhausted from reading it. How he felt after writing it is anyone's guess.Gray does some horrible things as he develops and eventually, he sees what he's become. The picture, a mirror of his soul, becomes darker and darker as his soul becomes heartless and self-serving.It's great stuff. The book is relatively short yet overflowing with rich text and thought provoking idioms. Enjoy it, digest it, this one is a classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What a wonderfull book. I Love the classic's. There are plenty of great books written today, but the classic's are from other periods in time that show life in a different light."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I picked up a an audio cd of 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' at the same time I was reading 'A Stranger's Child' by Alan Hollinghurst. Interestingly the respective narratives move through Edwardian England while peeling back the layers of sexual repression and eroticism associated with the era. The author Diana Galbaldon accomplishes this successfully, too, with attendant similar homo-erotic themes in her Lord John (Grey)series.While both listening and reading similar books simultaneously I was trying to keep the characters aligned with each story. In fact, several characters from each book have the same name. 'Dorian Gray' begins with a prologue by the author that addresses in advance the freedom to publish content that Wilde surely felt would be controversial. This proved to be prescient.The main character for whom the book is named in effect sacrifices his soul for the vanity of youth and life's experiences and excess. Up to a point, one could make a contemporary parallel to a life lived by a celebrity (i.e. Mick Jagger, Lindsay Lohan, etc.) at least from a public perception perspective. The song 'You're so Vain' by Carly Simon could easily have been written as homage to the Dorian Gray character.There exists in the story line a protagonist (the painter of the picture) and antagonist - a friend of the painter's who, arguably is a devil incarnate, guides by suggestion Dorian Gray down a path of self-gratification, vanity and excess.For those of us that recall the Twilight Zone TV series from the 1960's, this book - a classic for it's time - would have made a marvelous episode."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has appeared in nearly a dozen forms, some reflecting publishers' objections, some adding new material by Wilde to compensate for cuts, and some simply bowdlerized in pirate editions. For the first time, Wilde's original manuscript submitted for publication has been printed as he wrote and intended it, before other people's prejudices and pressure caused him to alter the text. This is a beautifully produced large format book, beautiful cover with Caravaggio's \\"Narcissus\\" cropped and darkened, detailed introduction, bibliography and analysis of the complete publishing history of this unusually tortured author and book. All variants are included in the notes and annotations. Of particular interest is the fact that it is this text, which has not previously been published, that Sir Edward Carson, Counsel for the brutal and sociopathic Marquis of Queensbury whom Wilde absurdly sued for libel over an open note in a men's club in which Queensbury, father of Wilde's infamous lover Bosie Douglas, wrote \\"Oscar Wilde posing as a somdomite (sic).\\" But for Wilde's utterly mad legal action against Queensbury, he would not have faced the tremendous wealth of testimony and written evidence placed before the civil court by Carson, and would not have been prosecuted for any crimes, as he was after losing his libel action. Many of the passages which appear only in this new edition of \\"The Picture\\" were used by Carson to paint Wilde into a corner of criminality; and it is interesting to see just which sentences and paragraphs were accumulated to impeach Wilde on cross-examination. All in all, this is a wonderful book, almost too grand for its subject matter. But then Oscar, I am sure, would have expected nothing less."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Well, I had to read this book for a school assignment. I'm not really sure what I expected from this book, but I know I didn't get it. This book shows the true demoralization of our society- past and present. The absloute worst part of the book (about 90% of it) was the long, monotonous, verbose speeches that consisted of the characters'ideals that were just &quot;off the mark&quot; by a little. I would not suggest reading this book, partly because of the boring content, but mostly because of the fact that I still haven't found a plot."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The novel The Picture of Dorian Grey is an unoriginal story line with disturbing morals in which innocent people are corrupted. Written in the late 18th century by Oscar Wilde the novel is an example of homosexual fiction. While the sexual preference of the characters is never addressed it is often hinted at. Many of the morals presented in the novel are very disturbing. Harry presents his views in such a way as to make them seem right. He \\"preaches\\" on living a life for pleasure, and the sensations. He stresses that women are merely brainless playthings there to provide entertainment. His theory on remaining young is to repeat all your youthful sins. This is presenting a lifestyle of self-indulgence, in which material things bring happiness. Harry's corruption of Dorian leads to the corruption of many others. As Dorian begins to live as Harry has suggested he begins to use his influence over people to his advantage. He drives Sibyl Vane to her death, and also her brother who tries to seek revenge. Many close friends become outcasts because of his escalating bad reputation. In this story of twisted corruption, Basil Hallward is a very likely target for destruction. Had is not been for his adoration of Dorian then Harry never would have become interested in him. It becomes obvious that in order to be rid of all the mishaps Dorian must be rid of the originator. Basils death is almost obvious from the start. The main storyline, man sells soul for youth, is one used many times by several authors. It is based on a 15th century German magician Johann Faust. In his time he was considered a fake and a criminal. In the original Faustbook (1587), written by an unknown author, is a biography of Johann Faust in which he sells his soul to the devil Mephistopheles for 24 years in return for power, knowledge, and youth and finally goes to hell in terror. It is ironic that this is also approximately the same amount of time it takes Dorian to become fully corrupted and destroy the painting. All in all the book was a waste of time. With its disturbing morals and unoriginal storyline the book left something to be desired. It was often predictable and uneventful. This is not a book that I would recommend to other people."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Please refer to page 212 of the Baronet Books version of The Picture of Dorian Gray.

Dorian Gray is a very dark work with drug use, murder, and depression. One of the main themes is homosexuality. It shocked and outraged the public when it was first realeased. It is scary. It scared me . Frankly, I doubt very much that many children would appreciate this book. Colleges study this book in literature classes. That's not to say no child would not get stuff from this book, but the few children that could would probably be just fine with the original work. Folks, stick to Treasure Island and White Fang for the kids. And if you want something kinda spooky, try Phantom of the Opera.

During his portraiture, Gray meets Lord Henry Wotton, who preaches self-indulgence and the high social value, yet lamentable ephemerality, of youth. Influenced by Lord Henry, Gray becomes cold-hearted and self-centered. Gray soon discovers that his descent into moral dissolution is being represented by changes in his portrait. Over the years, Gray seems never to age, while his image in the portrait ages in his place and also continues to show the ongoing moral dissolution within Gray's character.

I didn't notice when I ordered it that it's not the size of a regular book--it's more the size of an academic journal or magazine. Nearly 8 X 10 inches. Further, there's no named editor, no introduction, no apparatus at all. Just the text of the story--and that is printed in two columns on the page. The result is a book that won't fit on the shelf and that is unpleasant to read. Baffling."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was a hard novel to get into. But once the plot of the story got underway it transfolded into a page turning, mind questioning story. Wilde tells us the story of a beautiful man who wishes that his soul would forever be part of his self portrait, and that he will forever stay youthful. Little to say, his wish comes true. Though there were many parts of the story that seemed to be described in quite a bit of unwanted detail, they almost give the novel a sense of philosophy. This compliments the many complicated philosophical views of Lord Henry, one of the main characters in the work. As the story progressed I found myself being pulled into the plot. When Dorian fell in love with Sibyl Vane I anticipated each turn of events that followed. Since we know about Dorian Gray's wish, each chapter teases us as to what will happen to him. Throughout the rest of his life, Dorian involuntarily causes accidents and grief to others. From Sibyl's death to the suicide of Alan Campbell, things always turn tragic for the ones in his life. It is inevitable that Dorian will meet his own death by the time the novel finishes. The conclusion to the story couldn't have been done better. The way that Wilde closes the life of Dorian Gray is perfectly written, and paints a perfect \\"portrait\\" in our minds as well."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"great book hard to read because print was so small"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Review by Jason LushOne hundred and ninety pages of political masturbation disguised as a supernatural suspense story. Of the three main characters we have; Dorian Gray, who is a brainless puppet the personifies vanity; Basil Hallward, the artist who painted the fabled portrait and represents the sorrowful conscience; and Lord Henry Wolton, who is the quintessential 19th Century fop whose sole purpose in the book is to act as Wilde's voice on politics, religion and homosexuality and as a driving corrupter of everyone else in the book.The pacing is horrendously slow, the chapters devoted to explaining Gray's hobbies and the pictures of his ancestors in his hallway don't help with the lousy pacing.

It was written in a style of gentle prose that was easy to read, and it did put forth at least a few interesting concepts. On the whole though, the ideas in this book were utterly ridiculous and totally lacking in any true depth. They appear to me to be the vain ramblings of a man consumned in his own deepness, thereby proving how shallow he truly was. I would liken this book to a picture in which detailing, shading, and general looks are pleasing, but the perspective is off, ruining the whole picture. So perhaps you would enjoy this book if you are looking for a few ideas and smart sayings put together in a seemingly random, and almost chaotic order."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Every so often one has the good fortune of discovering an author whose work reaffirms all that is appreciable in literature by exemplifying its worst. Oscar Wilde, after reading whose novel and two fairy tales, quickly obviates any further need or desire to be further acquainted. The knowledge found on the cover of my paperback edition, between the obligatory sickly hagiography that usually betrays the expectation it inspires, that The Picture of Dorian Gray was apparently the author's only fruitful attempt at a \`full-length' novel, leaves one snickering ante facto in not entirely facetious gratitude. Wilde was seemingly more at home in the realm of fairy tales, and this 217-page full-length novel not by itself finding ground to fill the space between the covers, finds itself supported by three samples of that genre.One might be forgiven for assuming that the novel portends to explore an emotional or philosophical metaphor of a relationship between the eponymous painting and its subject, but the implied exploration is unfortunately mostly specious. The metaphor, to be sure, is there, but it is a mere seed that never takes root or grows out of its entirely obvious and superficial form, and the story thus fails to fulfil its promise.Furthermore, the filling leaves one with a bad aftertaste. None of the three characters have any endearing features to redeem themselves for the gall they otherwise freely spew. \`Lord Henry' in particular has no characterizing dimension other than denigration of everything else in the form of dull pseudowitticisms, from which comparison we take it the aristocrat was intended to benefit. We learn his contempt of clergy (bishops \\"don't think\\"), stockbrokers (\\"even a stock-broker can gain a reputation for being civilized\\"), dowagers (they are \\"overdressed\\"), academicians (tedious), the middle class (not modern), Americans, marriage, women, and Jews (I don't believe any mention of the religion ever lacks the adjective \\"fat\\"). The misogyny in particular is so pungent and the female characters so weak that the protagonists cannot otherwise but treat them with the contempt that they do. If indeed \\"women are decorative\\" it is merely because the men do not have a vision that sees beyond superficialities. This is no parody of aristocratic vanity (in the style of Thackeray, for instance) so one quickly finds oneself wishing for one of these maligned targets of Lord Henry's dull wit to return the favor with a dull but well-deserved kick in the [rump].When the characters are not railing against the world, they are theorizing about it, but the obvious inconsistencies and utter inanity of the theories make them impossible to consider seriously. To give an example, and not have one character take the brunt of all the book's failings, the artist Basil Hallward states first (speaking of his own work) that \\"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter,\\" but six pages later that \\"an artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them.\\" A story dealing ostentatiously with a profound relationship between ars and artis, in which the artist doesn't remember from one moment to the next whether or not he put feeling in his art, reveals that its author has lost control of his subject. Othertimes the theories are merely silly and quite impossible to take at face value. What to make, for example, of the idea that \\"beauty is a form of genius- is higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation,\\" or that \\"people say sometimes that beauty is superficial. That may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is.\\" This is just tripe without considerable meaning.Within this theorizing there are faint reverberations reaching toward some oblique philosophy of hedonism, but never quite advancing beyond a mere slogan. Without actually doing the work of fully expounding the philosophy, or having the courage to fully sound its implications, in the way that for example de Sade did, the author cannot reasonably expect us to sympathize or find the actions of his characters anything but wholly unsatisfying and their reactions rather balmy.Wilde quite clearly has no desire (charitably assuming it is not from a lack of potential) to prepare and construct a plot. One of the adjunct characters, Jim, whose sister Sibyl later commits suicide over the protagonist, finds out he is a bastard son, his mother was orphaned, and forgives her (what for, we are left to guess), all within the space of three quarter page. Dorian's swings of attitude toward Sybil from ignorance through love through despisement through sorrow to self-forgiveness are so extreme and irrational that they make a pastiche of emotion. Jim's completely unfounded anger toward Dorian is so unrealistically sudden and out of proportion that it is obvious how Jim's fears will be realized and that there will be a confrontation. There is no mystery, less a sense of a world to discover than of being dragged along by an uninterested parent. The rhetorical questions Dorian asks in his histrionic despair are answered immediately, it is for me simply to get in, sit down, shut up, and hold on.Even more fundamentally, the characters are shallow, undeveloped, and quite stereotypical, the dialog stilted and unrealistic- altogether a surprisingly unsophisticated style, especially in the light of the beautiful writing of his contemporaries. Dialog has a tendency to spin off into unrelated tangents that are unceremoniously and artificially \`snapped back' to the main thread. Henry's inability to speak in any other form than witless aphorism is at first merely unfunny, then quickly boring, later irritating, and finally not bearing further reading. And this is unfortunately barely the only character development in the story at all, the only other characters having little strength of will of their own to resist mimicking this trite ascerbicism.If the book has revealed anything at all, it is not a deeper analysis of art or hedonism, but a much more animal homoeroticism. Dorian Gray is much more than anything else a love story with the trimmings (envy and a murder-suicide), and all the less respectful because it dares not speak its name. Female emotions are contemptible, but the same expressions of liking (Wilde can never bring himself to call it more), admiration of beauty, and extreme flattery by men towards other men, are accepted naturally and not subject to this contempt."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It's amazing how Wilde's words continue to ring so true in this day and age.

It is the first one that I read from Oscar Wilde and I have to admit I was amazed by how good he was in choosing the right words to form sentences. Dorian Gray is an amazing character and I think that it appeals to everyone in a certain way. It is a must-read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What for most of my life I knew only as the answer to a trivia question, I've now read and enjoyed thoroughly, thanks to Amazon Kindle. His only novel, Oscar Wilde's satire of the upper class in late 19th century Britain mocks their vapid lifestyle, while at times glorying in it, though the story arc comes from the tradition of Edgar Allan Poe. The combination is both delicious and shocking. \\"Picture\\" is also a veritable gold mine, or should I say minefield, of ironic aphorisms, most of them emanating from the mind and mouth of Gray's friend and mentor Sir Henry Wooten, who is kind of like Michael Scott of \\"The Office\\", except with a functioning brain.Brilliantly written, entertaining and thought provoking, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" stands highly recommended to readers young and old. It's sad that Wilde lived at a time when homosexuals were persecuted, in his case prosecuted, even moreso than they are now. A giant of 19th century literature could have contributed well into the 20th century, but died penniless, estranged from his birthplace in Ireland, and home in England, at the age of 46 in the year 1900."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was a quick, easy and enjoyable read. I knew the very basic premise of the story from watching the 2003 movie, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. I also had a lot of wrong preconceived notions because of the the movie.The Picture of Dorian Gray was less supernatural in nature than I expected. Other than not aging and having the picture age for him, Dorian was a regular guy. When given the opportunity to live his life without his behavior marring his beauty, he chose debauchery. I found myself thinking, who wouldn't? He tried to experience everything the world has to offer (a noble pursuit) and finds that life can become pointless without boundaries.Dorian's friend, Harry, is the absolute shining star of this novel. He counsels Dorian in the way of the world, full of his own theories and cynical viewpoints. He's humorous and more often than not, what he says makes a lot of sense.The one thing I disliked about The Picture of Dorian Gray was that it seemed like the most interesting pieces of the story were missing. Oscar Wilde was very vague about exactly why Dorian actually did in the years he spent corrupting his soul. People who were once his friends couldn't stand to be in the same room as him and no explanation was given. Perhaps in 1890, when the book was published, saying that he did vile, cruel, disgusting things was enough. Now, 120 years later, I need more. I need to know and it still bugs me that I don't know what Wilde was alluding to."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Beautiful and lyrical told with biting wit.

I AM ALSO A HUGE BEN BARNES FAN"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Most people never truly contemplate the real meaning of beauty. It has an alluring quality that cannot be fully understood, even in an abstract form. One of English author Oscar Wilde's motivations was to write a work that praises beauty as an art but simultaneously reveals its darker nature. That is what I believe he attempts to accomplish in his sole novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray. The work is set in late 19th century London at a time when the cultural excesses of the Victorian era reached their zenith. Infused with elements of Gothic horror, it is a work of Symbolist prose, the Symbolists being a group of literary luminaries who sought to glorify beauty and aesthetic decadence almost as a kind of spiritualism. Wilde is no doubt part of this new endeavor to perceive beauty in an innovative fashion, and he objectively promotes a rather original world outlook through the dynamic characters he creates.The Picture of Dorian Gray is built upon an interesting premise. A local artist named Basil Hallward is fully enamored by the subject of his latest portrait, the eponymous Dorian Gray. Basil, like almost everyone else, is impressed by Dorian's pulchritude and handsome features. As Dorian indulges Basil by sitting for a portrait, another one of Basil's friends, a dignified aristocrat named Lord Henry Wotton, enters and, he too, takes a tremendous liking for the vigorous youth. Later, Dorian holds a discussion with Henry about senility and Wotton reveals to him his hedonistic worldview: \\"To me, beauty is the wonder of wonder. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world lies in the visible, not the invisible. [...] A new Hedonism--that is what our century wants. You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing you could not do.\\" With this in mind, Dorian upholds a new creed by swearing that youth is the only noble quality worth possessing; he would rather have Basil's new portrait of him age in exchange for remaining eternally young. Consequently, Dorian proceeds to engage in every sort of pleasurable vice possible, while the picture of himself hanging in his room slowly decays. The plot proceeding from this point forward holds up well, though the climatic conclusion may seem clich&eacute; in light of the Gothic horror stories that many readers are acquainted with.Wilde does a splendid job of displaying a tone of biting sarcasm. His clever use of wit and double entendre to reveal introspective truths with all the effort he can muster is one of his valiant triumphs. Dorian's lust for sensual pleasure reveals the author's taste as an aesthete and suggests another aspect of the novel's motifs, that of duplicity. Dorian leads a double life by interacting with aristocratic high society during the day and indulging his senses at night. This dualism of Dorian's character underscores the dramatic complexity of his inner struggles.Dorian Gray can be seen as a man willing to exchange his very soul for what he craves. He candidly discards his reputation and eventually risks his life for his lofty desires, which is reminiscent of the Faust legend. Wilde's protagonist is not very remorseful for his debauchery and is constantly being manipulated by his friend and confidant, Henry Wotton. Ultimately, Dorian is a tragic hero participating in an Aristotelian tragedy where he is subtly cognizant of his impending doom and experiences multiple catastrophes. His hamartia proves to be his downfall.While every work of fiction has its shortcomings, Dorian Gray's are minimal. The author exhibits a delightful candor in his narration and characterization, and his nuanced writing style is replete with metaphorical and psychological analyses of flawed individuals. No bookstore should ever be complete without a copy of The Picture of Dorian Gray adorning its bookshelves."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This great story could be called a psychological thriller, a horror story, or a morality play. Maybe even science fiction. It is a superb tale of the corruption within each of us. Wilde convinces the reader that Vanity is a part of every human life.

He wishes that he--not the painting--will remain forever young and beautiful, while the painting ages and decays. Dorian's wish comes true and it is the painting that not only shows his age, but also all his sins. Oscar Wilde crafted not only a brilliant horror novel, but also a treatise on art and reality. Despite the claims of Lord Henry, art does reveal the truths of life. The painting reveals the true soul of Dorian Gray. When Dorian's beloved actress discovers true love (not the dramatic imitation), she is no longer able to participate in the elevated dramas on the stage. Then she loses Dorian's love. A book is what fully corrupts Dorian and causes him to live a life of sin. This is a story of the inability to bring truth and art together. This is one of the greatest books to do the often over-used theme of appearance vs. reality.

I never did, but thought I would give it a try as I really enjoy dry British wit and intelligent prose. Beyond that, I wasn't sure what else I was expecting, but for my tastes, I didn't end up entirely satisfied.The opening 10 or 20 pages insinuated themselves into my imagination and I felt that I would be entertained by the main characters throughout the rest of the novel. The detailed descriptions of the lovely country setting and extravagant flowers gives one an impression of decadence and a high society jadedness that I somehow expected from Oscar Wilde, having read none of his previous work. Unfortunately, the remainder of the novel didn't hold as much pleasure for me.Dorian Grey is a relatively uninteresting central character who is but a blank canvas for Lord Henry to experiment upon; Dorian's own thoughts and musings are not so compelling in and of themselves and yet we are treated to quite a few pages of them throughout. Lord Henry himself is an interesting character whose mean-spiritedness, which approaches evil in some instances, is obscured by his verbose bantering on half-baked, jaundiced observations on Victorian life. These also consume considerable paper stock, and as witty as his musings start out (his thoughts on marriage were particularly humorous to me), they start to run together and become somewhat of a misshapen lump through which I felt I was slogging at times.Anyway, the story is relatively well known to most at this point, regardless of whether you have read the book in question or not. It progresses more or less as one might assume, which is not entirely a bad thing (I would not classify this tale as a mystery or as a horror novel, a genre to which I see it is sometimes curiously attributed). Oscar Wilde is definitely saying something here, and there seem to be many elements of allegory contained within the story. I have read that he saw parts of himself within all three of the main characters, and they do seem to represent different facets of a single personality. Unfortunately these same characters are hamstrung by this very fact, as they each seem only part of a personality, part of a character, and not well rounded or believable in their motivations or actions.This is the first Oscar Wilde I have attempted to read, and I won't say it is my last, but there are classics of English literature which are as well written, more engrossing, and, in the end, more memorable, at least to this reader (\\"Silas Marner\\" comes to mind as a fine book I only just recently read for the first time as well).So, overall, about 3 stars from me. In my opinion it poses some interesting questions, sparkles in a few spots, and held my attention for a few hours, but it's not something I would return to or recommend for pleasurable reading.As a side note, I am somewhat surprised by the criticisms of the homoerotic nature of the relationships portrayed within the novel. Wilde portrayed the passionate nature of what amounts to a love triangle in a very effective (if slightly florid) way, and, as has been noted before, the relationships between the men seem more genuine and believable than those involving the fairer sex. Maybe this type of undertone would be out of place in a Hemingway novel but good grief it's Oscar Wilde! Scratch beneath the surface and read about where this man was coming from and the times in which he lived and worked."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"this book is interesting and deep as it delves into the desires of man. the notes provided are helpful and add more to the overall quality of Wilde's own words"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book(translated to the portuguese), here in Brazil about twenty years ago.Being writen in XIX century, this novel remains a classic book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's literary genious is evident throughout.

It makes you contimplate your interior wishes. The ending is shocking - which just puts another tally for \\"classic\\".If you are looking for a classical novel that you can read over and over again and spend hours discussing it (either with people or just personal contimplations), I recommend The Picture of Dorian Gray."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde is a witty and brilliant writer, and his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is a treasure. One of it's best aspects is something another reviewer mislabeled as a flaw, that every viewpoint presented by Wilde is contradicted in another part of the book. This is absolutely brilliant. By building an entire book out of contradictions, the reader can take absolutely any message they want from the book, or no message at all. It meet Wilde's goal (if indeed anything Wilde said can be taken seriously - remember that the paradoxical Henry Wotton is basically a fictional version of Wilde) of \\"art for art's sake,\\" but it can just as easily be a morality tale for anyone that wants one. Henry Wotton can either be the worst kind of villain or a quite harmless and likeable chap who a dumb kid took too seriously.So read this book for it's witty and memorable dialogue, mostly from Henry Wotton. Read it for the shocking (at least at the time) tale of Dorian Gray. Read it for the myriad meanings you can take from it. Just don't skip it because it doesn't have one, consistent message. Anyone can write a message. It takes a genius to write a collection of messages that perfectly balance and disprove one another."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Of all the fears that creep into a man's heart,the most disturbing is the fear of one's own self. A man may evade the whole world but can't deny his conscience and as William Shakespeare remarks somewhere,\\"Conscience doth make coward of us all\\". One may accomlish painting goodliness on one's visage but would never be able to blend his soul in a similar fashion. The whispers of the soul about one's past sins and misdeeds keep lingering in one's heart.And that's precisely the theme of Oscar Wilde's only novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\". It is a telling tale about a stunningly handsome,almost beautiful,man's bizzare idiosyncracy of authoring his own tragic doom,about how a youth so splendidly bestowed with beauty,wealth,royalty and women could get sucked in by the myriad forces that he himself gave rise to,about a man's confused,complex frame of mind.Dorian Gray is that ultimate effigy of an ideal youth gifted with all arts and talents. He's the instinctive and eternal source of inspiration,\\"simply a motive in art\\" to his friend,artist Basil Hallward. The backdrop is the gentry and the royalty class of London during the late 19th. century and the Irish writer's genius lies in exploiting this landscape to picture in words and absolutely ethereal imageries man's obscure desires. Dorian becomes obsessed with his portrait traced by Basil and in the general flow of the tyde,conceives an unimaginable notion:to remain forever young whilst the portrait may wither! Indeed such a wish lurks deep inside everyone and so does the realisation o its fruitlessness. But for once,at least in fiction,the fantasy is translated into truth,a dark,troublesome truth.Evey novel,and for that matter every incident,requires a certain spark to unfold a series of actions to conglomerate into a rare item called literature. That urge in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is impelled by Lord Henry Wotton, a cynical and witty man just ten years older than Dorian,whose eloquent gush of words \\"touched some secret chord\\" in Dorian's heart and sets it \\"vibrating and throbbing to curious impulses\\". The philosophies and crisp remarks by Lord Wotton about life in general and youth in particular push the youth onto his demise.Supernaturally Doian Gray's desire to remain young for good does manufacture itself into a fascinating reality but there's nothing called free lunch under the sun. Commencing from the time when Dorian turns an implicit murderer of his lover Sibyl Vane through the constant denudation of principles and character in the subsequent fourty or so years culminating in him murdering his friend Basil,Dorian stays protected under the shade of evergreen youth whilst his portrait consistently deteriorates and ages---it even turns a mirror of Dorian's own soul with dark contours signifying the crimes committed by him lining its entire figure and in his attempt to relieve himself of the picture,and with it his hideous sins,the eponymous potagonist brings about his own end.The theme of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is singled out to be about how we get disturbed by our own souls but there're other ideas webbed in as well. That the author Oscar Wilde had an inclination towards gay culture is of course a subtle truth and this is ever so slightly pictured in Basil Hallward's unassuming and suspicious admiration of Dorian. The general occurrences in the gentry society and invokation to women's feelings too are colossaly and humourously penned down superadded by a streak of confusing and often conflicting ideas of life that never falter.There was never really a Faust who sold his soul to the Devil but it was actually Goethe's authorical magic that made it seem so. There was never really a Dorian Gray who exchanged peace for youth but it's actually Oscar Wilde's staunch belief that \\"it is the spectator,and not life,that art really mirrors\\" that materialiases into a concrete portrayal of life in fiction. After reading Emile Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\",we rue that the authoress never composed any other novel and similarly after imbibing the charisma of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\",which just remains on the margins of a psychological insight into a man's nature,we regret that we can't lay our hands on another classic by this wonderful,wonderful writer."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Almost from the day that this novel was first published in serial form it has caused controversy and debate. It was immediately condemned as an immoral work that did not follow the custom of showing that evil deeds would in the end bring punishment to the evil doer. Just those evil deeds, which were acted out by Dorian Gray, were enough in themselves to scandalize Victorian society. Then, just as his novel was about to be published in book form Oscar Wilde added fuel to the fire by adding a preface that seemed to indicate that there was absolutely no hidden meaning or moral lesson to be found in this book. Apparently, according to the preface, it was simply art for the sake of art. The fires have raged ever since and I'm sure that the author's spirit has enjoyed every second of it.The fact is that the reader can read almost anything he wants to into this work and there have been almost as many interpretations as there have been readers. I found myself intrigued by a passage that is spoken very early in the book by the artist who has painted the now famous picture. This painter, Basil Hallward by name, tells a friend that, \\"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the colored canvas, reveals himself.\\" Just what might this book have revealed about Oscar Wilde? Or could this book have been a dark commentary on London's high society of which Wilde does not paint a pretty picture? Maybe this book was indeed as written Wilde wrote in his preface and he had no deep purpose but just wanted to tell a good story. Better minds than mine have pondered this question and have arrived at no conclusive answer to the problem. I have however learned one important thing about this book as I have read it. That being that if one reads this book without worrying about it's implications they will find it a very enjoyable read.Dorian Gray is first introduced to the reader as a young man who was exquisitely handsome and wealthy but he had had a rough childhood. The thing he remembers most about the Grandfather who raised him in such a harsh manner was that he was old. This may well have played into what became of the young man although he would almost certainly not have sank to such depths of depravity had he not met Lord Henry Wotton. For the life of me I can not fathom what Dorian Gray saw in Lord Henry for he comes across as a loathsome, self-centered, tiresome know it all. Gray however becomes enamored of Wotton however and slowly adopts Wotton's theories of pleasing oneself no matter the consequences to others.The real change begins in Gray after an act of particular curliness for which he is already feeling sorry when he arrives home. It is not long until he notices a change in his recently finished portrait, a portrait that was in the beginning as handsome as Gray but suddenly was marred by a cruel mouth. Gray couldn't believe his eyes but suddenly it dawns on him that this picture will bear the scars of his sins and of the passing years. He himself will remain forever young and beautiful no matter how he conducts his life. As I mentioned above, some critics bemoaned the lack of punishment for Gray's acts but I found that there were indeed consequences for his actions. By the end of the book, Gray has become almost mad from the knowledge of his sins and actually seems to long for death. The very picture that has given him eternal youth haunts his every thought for he knows that the picture shows the wretched condition of his soul. That is about all that I believe I can say without giving away the ending and I hate people who do that.Overall I enjoyed this book but Wilde's characters were given to long tedious philosophical pronouncements that only added to my detestation of these pompous blow hards. I can't say that I would rank this book among the all time classics and much of the time the reader will not be able to locate a plot with a team of bloodhounds. Still, if you can get through the dry areas there is often a rich oasis waiting on the other side."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's only novel contains some of the greatest dialogue of any literature written in the english language. There are few books that could be considered more quotable, and even fewer that could be considered more insightful. The novel is enjoyable even upon a cursory reading, but its splendor is revealed only when it is studied. Wilde reveals so much of himself in his art, and through reading of Wilde's biographies, plays, and the literature that inspired him, the reader becomes intimate with Oscar, and is able to understand him more throughly than most authors would allow from a study of their work. This is a piece I have truly enjoyed, and continues to be one of the premier pieces of English literature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book, which I read quite some time ago but will never cease to love, is a beautiful horror story. The language, the surroundings, even the characters, are gorgeous, but at the same time, everything about them is frightening, and even a little grotesque. Lord Henry is utterly cynical, continually saying things one can never be quite sure he means or is only saying. Dorian is corrupted and horrible, and yet at the same time, one almost thinks he may suddenly stop and try to turn back. Basil is one of the only pure characters in the book, and his devotion to Dorian is sweet, but at the same time, one just /knows/ it will will cause something bad to happen to him--as, ultimately, it does.This book is a very satisfying read, although some people might be disturbed by the content, which is rather mature. Besides that, the homosexual subtext runs rampant waving a Dorian's picture. This may bother some people, although not yours truly. :)Personally, I think it's excellent. If you liked Victor Hugo's style, but would rather not hear historic digressions; if you liked Crime and Punishment's moral conflicts, but were highly irritated by the happy ending; if you enjoyed The Invisible Man's supernatural circumstances but would have been satisfied without the scientific explanations, then go forth ye and read Picture of Dorian Gray. (...)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' is an exceptional novel. Through this novel Mr. Wilde presents many characteristics of the human heart and mind. It hits hard telling the truth of the way in which people really are. Mr. Wilde in his novel asks the question how far would one go to obtain beauty and youth forever to please society? And in doing so presents the desires of most humans to remain young forever and the lengths in which they might go to obtain it. This novel illustrates the obession society has with the outward appearance rather than the inward and is shown in the novel by the Dorian Gray being accepted into the 'circle' despite the 'rumors' that he is a bad man. Through Dorian Gray and Lord Henry Mr. Wilde also illustrates the influence of people over people. Resulting in the destruction of character.I enjoyed the book Dorian Gray because of the fact that it does tell the truth and quite often people don't like to hear the truth, but Oscar Wilde went against what society would view as good and did and wrote what he believed, which makes an wonderful novel."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I decided to be the FIRST to review this one here. Haha, go me.Picture of Dorian Gray is a great work of fiction. Its interplay of Hellenic thought and Judaeo-Christian ethics was light years ahead of its time, even though it might come across muddled to the casual reader. Perhaps, this novel was too far ahead of its time, as it was eventually used as evidence against Wilde in two court cases for 'gross indecency' in 1895.It is a simple story; really, Basil Hallward paints a lovely portrait of Dorian Gray, a veritable Adonis. As the Painter puts the finishing touches upon this portrait, Gray is involved with a conversation regarding the nature of beauty with Lord Henry (Harry) Wotton. This culminates in Dorian wishing and praying that his beauty may never diminish; that he'd have eternal youth. Ultimately, the painting would bear all of the marks of sin, decadence, and decay that cause our physical bodies to age, while Dorian kept his stunning good looks. Wilde brings about a rather wonderful conclusion, and it is a very enjoyable story.The Picture of Dorian Gray has its dull parts. It doesn't remain current, and I'd suggest getting a copy with notes, so that you may be able to keep up with all of the references. Let's be honest, in 2004 who really cares about what was fashionable in 19th century France? These are questions the notes can clarify, and make some of the references more amiable. Still there are parts where Wilde just lists things, and these you should skip.When reading this novel, I think it becomes clear that the three main personalities are a reflection of society at that time. While Basil Hallward seemed to personify Christian conservatism, and a mundane attachment to the status quo, Lord Henry is the questioning romantic, a character that seems to argue everything yet prove nothing, and believe in even less. This makes him no less interesting, and I believe Wilde may have included him as a farce of some of his contemporaries, yet some of the best insights and quotes actually come from Lord Henry.Dorian is the romantic ideal of perfection. Though a horrible character that fears no consequences for his actions, he still remains perfection. I think that aristocratic England valued physical appearance, social wit, and worldliness more than an ethical life.Dorian Gray also typifies Wilde's affections for Hellenic culture. Dorian is the stereotypical Greek Tragic Hero. He has a flaw; his vanity; this flaw leads to his downfall; a life of sin; he realizes his flaw in the end, and tries to make amends, but it is too little too late. If you enjoy Shakespeare Allusions, you will enjoy this.I really liked The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I will not advise one way or the other whether you should read it or not. If you want something stimulating that will have an enormity of good quotes that will make your dominating intellect seem even more so to the untrained eye, then check it out. If you're looking for pulp go check out Tom Clancey or Danielle Steele."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde gives a new definition to the good. Dorian Gray's problem, despite the fact all his sin is transmited to a painting, art reminds him of the good, and this reminding is enough to be in discord with himself. I don't feel, as some suggest, that Dorian regreted his wish of eternal youth and beauty, but the images of the painting, art itself, drove him crazy - his self doubt. The art showed his inauthentic life, how his feelings and actions were not in harmony. In De Profundis Wilde talks about Jesus' criticism of the Pharasee for studying, but not living what they know - they have no feeling for life, they are souless driviling intellects. Dorian\`s cognizance of his own inauthentic soulless profanatory abject self did him in, he died killing the reminder of his splintered self, and of the frustrations of being an aesthetically induced schizopherenic. Wotton's warning was that conscience makes egoists of us all. Is it the dualistic nature of conscience that drives Dorian to kill himself, not regret? In the end he desires to do good, but is it? Can he? Is he? Wilde, the master of Paradox, leaves some poignant questions, if not eschatological questions, availab.le to be thought upon. Wilde is highlighting the importance of art as truth and art as a mirror, but in the end who is the mirror? Art makes reality, as far as reality is a truth anyway, a perception of truth and reality that is more meaningful than these nonexistant abstracts. But then there is sin to ponder on, is it real? Wilde would say so."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"After reading Dorian Gray, it took numerous books to accept that not all authors can have the genius and prose gifted to Wilde. Dorian's journey of making his life an art, exploring issues such as hedonism, sin, conceit, deceit and youth is an unforgettable one, and this book has lingered on in my mind since I first read it, and I think will continue to do so forever.

The writing is accessible, even to those who tend to dislike more old-styled English writing, and the plot is certainly among the greatest ideas in literature. However, the character of Lord Henry, who carries a great deal of the novel, often goes on seemingly unending rants of his views on life and they bring the book down quite a bit. With these discourses, the book loses development in favor of pseudo-philosophy in a clever if rough attempt to both attract and repulse the reader. There is a mid-chapter in the book that describes the middle of Dorian's life that is absolute work to make your way through. The philosophy of the book is important of course, but it's much better when the story lends itself for the purpose. Overall, for the brilliance of the idea of the story; it's required reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book surprised me with its Gothic horror and surprising plot twists toward the end. This novel, for all its horrible philosophy on life, captures in a poignant way a lost person's search for fulfillment. Despite his indulgent quest for all kinds of pleasure, Dorian is still unfulfilled and in one of the most captivating passages of the book turns to opium to forget life. His descent into the opium den is characterized as a descent into hell, a personal hell which he has brought himself to and in which everyone sees through him and is against him.Though I wasn't a big fan at the beginning, as the book progressed I think it may have become one of the most memorable books I've read. The theme of the book is sin - its putrefying effect both on the sinner and those around him. One of the best moments of the book and one that sticks vividly in my mind is towards the end, when Dorian, sick of seeing his portrait so mangled and distorted by the sins he has already committed, does a \\"good deed\\" in order to try to start to clean it up. He races up the stairs, unlocks the secret room where his portrait is hidden, throws back the cover, and is faced with the same ugliness that had been there before. Then he is faced with a horrible realization of truth: because he had done the \\"good deed\\" out of motivation of making his own portrait/soul look better, he hadn't done a \\"good deed\\" at all and was now so deep in his depravity that even what he calls love has been warped into an all-encompassing egotism.Dorian's egotism gets progressively deeper. throughout the book. As Lord Henry says, It begins as innocent narcissism, but as it grows it begins to shunt blame for the sin of others and even motivates the good he does at the end of the book. Rather than his heavy sins bothering Dorian, \\"it was the living death of his own soul that troubled him\\" (226). His breakup with the young country girl was motivated more out of a desire to cleanse his portrait from its grime than any love for her, \\"for in hypocrisy he had worn the mask of goodness. For curiosity's sake he had tried the denial of self\\" (228). Being able to view his sin on the portrait in a sense made it more difficult to be selfless - \\"nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner. Conscience makes egotists of us all\\" (106) - and Dorian recognized this difficulty.The idea of pleasure in Dorian Gray is portrayed as a goal to pursue but never reach. \\"A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied\\" (84). Despite Dorian's pursuit of pleasure (and pleasure of the most exquisite kind) he ends us dissatisfied and empty, jaded to the idea of the fullness of life. He is encouraged on by the influence of Lord Henry, who gives advice such as: \\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it,\\" (21) and \\"sin is the only real color-element left in modern life\\" (31). Dorian is quickly influenced by Lord Henry's philosophy, aping to everyone else Lord Henry's views and words and acting out on them by plunging into the pits of hedonism.The portrait itself is a mirror of Dorian's soul. It was a \\"visible emblem of conscience\\" (96). As Lord Henry's pleasure seeking philosophy takes hold in Dorian's mind, he sees that \\"eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins - he was to have all of these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame; that was all\\" (109). However, in with a horrible fascination, Dorian \\"grew more and more enamored of his own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul\\" (131) for \\"what the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image on the canvas. They would mar its beauty, and eat away its grace. They would defile it, and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still live on. It would be always alive\\" (122). Even though \\"the leprosies of sin were slowly eating the thing away\\" (161) the portrait held on to its life of decay, just as Dorian held on to pleasure, refusing to be cleansed and beautiful again until Dorian's death.Quotes:\\"She was free in her prison of passion\\" (65).\\"She tried to look picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy\\" (49).\\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about\\" (4).\\"Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others. One's own life - that is the important thing\\" (82).\\"And how horribly real ugliness made things!\\" (128)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is the most decadent of all the English works in the canon of literature, I think. The prose is admirable, the characters are compelling, and the whole book is full of obvious and implied vice. This book, after having been taken to heart, is probably capable of reforming any provincial folk into cosmopolitan epicures."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is one the masterpieces of the English language. A unique plot, the portait of Dorian Gray aging instead of Dorian Gray and writen in aperfect manner that few writers have/had the capability of doing. A tale of corruption and a cynic man are the eesence of the story that has captivated generations. Read it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"For the past several years, I continually heard the name \\"Dorian Gray\\". As curiosity got the best of me, I finally looked this person up on the Internet. Finding that Dorian Gray was the main character of a most elaborate and interesting tale, enthralled me. Therefore, I set out to read this novel. From the preface alone, I was spellbound and couldn't put the book down.Lord Henry, with his quips and one-liners literally made me think twice. His tranquil ability to convince anyone of anything, sans Basil Hallward, amazed me. Although, I did find a few opinions of Lord Henry to ring true, for the most part I found myself thinking: \\"He's absolutely correct. Oh, wait! That's completely immoral and self-indulgent!\\" Needless to say, Lord Henry was my favorite character in the book.This book truly puts one's own life into perspective. It makes one think, and re-think of the importance of being true to only oneself without influence of others. As Lord Henry said it best: \\"Because to influence a person is to give him one's own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else's music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To realize one's nature perfectly - that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to oneself\\"."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I thought this book was amazing. While the writing for some might be difficult at first, the later chapter are the ones that capture the imagination. The morals of Lord Henry might seem somewhat selfish and shallow, but I guarantee his quotes will make their way back to reader's head. This is definitely the most influencial book I have read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of the greatest books of our time. It is over one hundred years old, but has aged gracefully and is still easily understood and as relevant to matters of life now as it was when it was first published. Though there have been many imitations of it and many film depictions of it, none of them do justice to the real thing. This timeless classic follows the development of a teenager, Dorian Gray, into manhood as the people that he calls his friends corrupt his soul. This is symbolized in a portrait that Gray hides, which was painted by the man who was perhaps his only good-hearted friend, Basil, who later met his untimely demise. Along with the exceptional plot and surprising twist at the end comes the message that Oscar Wilde cunningly imparts to the reader: One must be master of oneself because outside influences often disfigure one down to the deepest part of their soul. On top of all this, the book is also simply well written and entertaining. It is enjoyable because Wilde uses his mastery of everything from satire to suspense to convey his message and an extraordinarily compelling plot to the reader. You should read this book if you are looking for new knowledge, literature with a deep message, or simply a good time. This edition is especially helpful because it has a glossary for the meanings of some older words and supplementary reading written by Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"One of my favorite books. I've read it again and again. Just make sure you don't get an abridged version. Read the whole thing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A change from Oscar Wilde witha touch of the fantasy and the pursuit of eternal youth.

Nonetheless, worth it for a free kindle book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The themes contained in this rather short novel are extraordinary. That should be motive for reading through the entire book because one needs to get to the end in order to appreciate and understand the themes. It is a bit dry for a couple chapters in the middle of the book in my opinion, but it is not enough to seriously mar the book itself."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was tempted to take off a star for the way the second half of the book tales off and becomes so concerned with Dorian Gray's decadence. However, it's a classic, even if parts of the book are disappointing. Nevertheless, the beauty of the prose and the depth of Wilde's words are such that one can't fault the author for not living up to the standards he set for himself. If you're an astute reader and care to analyze the text, the points made by Wilde can change your life and why this book is a must read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book reminds me of other great stories--Faust, Dr. Jeckell and Mr. Hyde, Macbeth--where the main character's corrupt longings become his or her undoing. Dorian Gray searched for immortality through immorality and discovered that it fails to deliver.Wilde presents biblical passages on occasion--usually scornfully--the last of which serves as an apt summary for the whole book. Lord Henry asked Dorian, \\"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?\\" (Mark 8:36). A rhetorical question that pricked Dorian's conscience.I think if we're honest, none of us can bear to stare at our own portrait. We either try to cover it or knife it--anything but face it! In that sense, the portrait is a mirror. But the picture frame is also a window. It reveals the reality of any life that seeks to gain the world through a compromise of character.Basil's dying words are worth repeating: \\"It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and see if we cannot remember a prayer.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I knew what this story was about long before finally reading it. That's probably common. The famous premise is a fascinating one, though I found myself wondering if the narrative would have been even more impactful if written as a short story or novella length rather than stretched out to a full novel. The Lord Henry character who serves the purpose of putting bad ideas in Dorian's head gives multiple speeches throughout detailing his hedonistic world view. If the number or word count of these lectures was cut in half I don't think the story would suffer much from the absence. Another decision made by Oscar Wilde was not to show readers very much of Dorian's behavior. His first act of cruelty is laid out before us as is his final one, but in between we are only told that his bad reputation precedes him without being shown what he has done to earn it. It's left to our imagination. A few more scenes exhibiting decadent behavior rather than various dinner party conversations in which a pro decadence philsophy is expressed would have made for a juicier read. Would it have made for a better read? That's arguable, as perhaps it also is whether this book is intententially homoerotic or simply written during a time when heterosexual men were much more comfortable going on and on about how good looking a guy was. What's beyond debate is that Oscar Wilde came up with a great idea to build a story around, one that is as timeless as the desire for eternal youth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is a very dark tale of vanity, debauchery, drug use, murder and depression. When a nave and stunningly handsome young man unknowingly trades soul for eternal youth and beauty with a wish caught by the devils ear, he inevitably finds that physical perfection, charm and pleasures of the flesh are worth not at the cost of ones soul.Is this classic an enjoyable read?... that's a tough one to answer for such a ominous story , but I will say it's an interesting one that holds some entertaining characters and introduces many thought provoking ideas. Obviously THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is far from the best piece of literature I've ever experienced, but for me it was worth the short time it took to read, if for nothing else but for the appreciation of Oscar Wilde's famed wit."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The digital version (free) is quite good.

I saw the movie and decided to read it again and it never failed to entertain"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is my first Oscar Wilde book, and I finished the book very happy that I had read it. Dorian Gray is a young man, who has an incredible presence, due to his innocence and uncorrupted state of mind. We are introduced to him through painter Basil Howard, who is inspired by the young man. His acquaintance, Lord Henry Wotton, wants to meet the beautiful young man, and that is how Dorian Gray's demise begins.Everyone probably knows the premise of the book. Where this beautiful young man has a painting that ages, while the Dorian Gray never goes through the aging process that everyone around him inevitably goes through. The portrayal of how one changes over the course of a lifetime is seen through the life of Dorian Gray, as well as the portrait, which becomes more hideous over time.I did not give this book five stars, because I was disappointed in the character development of Dorian Gray. I feel that Lord Henry (Harry) was fully developed through his \\"musings\\" which are common throughout the book, yet the book's namesake sometimes seems to disappears into the background.The Kindle version seems to be complete (at least to someone who has never read the book before). A classic that definitely deserves to be read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde had a wonderful talent of being able to totally take the reader into whatever story he happened to be telling. In this tale of sin and tragedy, one can feel the fog wrapping around them, the cramped and dark opium dens, and the longing in the heart of Mr. Dorian Gray.If you are in the mood for a work of art that will capture your emotions and drag them along for a ride filled with 'shadows and early doom' (as Bob Dylan might say), this is the book for you. At its end it will leave you sitting staggered, feeling like you have been to the depths of a human soul and back again."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I first read The Picture of Dorian Gray in my senior year of High School.

I just think its sad that he got such harsh reviews in his time. The book is full of mystery, and asks a question that is still valid in today's society. \\"What are you willing to sell for eternal beauty?\\"So, ask yourself that as you read this book.

His reccomendation was so promising that I was eager to get this book. After about a week I was in a bookshop and I saw this book, immediatly I had to buy it, and it was so cheap.I've read it in a week or so, and after I finished it, I opened the first page and began reading again - thats how marvelous this book is. The dialogues are so thrilling and full of witty but thought provoking aphorisms, especially from Lord Henry (one of the characters). For example: \\"I am too fond of reading books to care to write them.\\",\\"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.\\" ,\\"Humanity takes itself too seriously. It is the world's original sin. If the cave-man had known how to laugh, History would have been different.\\"Wilde writes so naturally, with no stifness and with so much humour!I won't go into the subject matter because you can get that anywhere on google. But I will tell you that this novel made me a fan of Wilde and also made me read more of his work!Next week I plan on getting his plays (also from Oxford World's Classics, because they put so much to provide you with a good introduction, chronology and resources about the book, and the format is beautiful and easy too read).It's not hard cover, but I like it better as a paperback, it is not thick and you can take it anywhere with you, and its cover and design is unique."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It deals with a commonly met theme in literature, the wish of men to stay forever young.

Short lecture with a great story"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Believe it or not, I had not heard of The Picture of Dorian Gray until the movie League of Extraordinaty Gentleman came out. I know, crazy right. No, I havn't lived under a rock my whole life. I don't know how i missed it. Well, after seeing the movie I rented every movie of The Picture of Dorian Gray I could find and fell in love with the story. Then I read the book... and fell in love with the writing.Reading the first chapter is like being swathed in wonderful writing from head too toe. I felt completely surrounded by it. You can almost feel the warmth of the garden, hear the sounds of the birds and dragonflies, and smell the beauty of the flowers as you sit and listen to this conversation between Harry and Basil. The writing is an immersive experince. And Basil's description of his first encounter with Dorian and the feelings that Dorian stirs in him, sound almost... romantic. At the least there's definately a bromance going on. And we also see the first crack of Dorian's facade in this chapter, which Basil's decsription of how Dorian sometiems seems purposefully cruel to him. Isn't it interesting, the first chapter ends with Harry demanding to meet Dorian and dragging Basil into the house and we haven't even met Dorian yet ourselves.As I read the book it occured to me that it could also have been titled the Influence of Lord Henry Wotten, for Harry's (as he's called by his friends) opinions and influence are as central to the story as Dorian Gray himself and more of a factor than the portrait itself. Hardly a scene goes by that Harry, whether present or not, is not quoted as an authority. It was as if he was the potter and Dorian was the clay. Harry was fully aware of his influence, and Dorian... Dorian seemed to be racing from one sensation to another like a spoiled child.This was by far one of the best written, most interesting stories I have read. I will read it over and over and would recommend it to everyone.STATS:Nook Pages: 240Genere: ClassicRe-readability: Very High"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was curious about this book from another book I recently read. I first picked up the audiobook narrated by Edward Petherbridge (8 disks, BBC Audio, 1994/2010) from my Library, but I couldn't stand Edward's narration. He was terrible. He spoke really fast, then slow all of a sudden. He was british but it just was NOT working. It's was like Narrator ADD, and I just HAD to put the Audiobook down.Then I took out another AudioBook, narrated by Michael Page (7 disks, Brilliance Audio, 1995), and it was absolutely AMAZING!!! Michael does a wonderful job of keeping the pace and volume easy to follow and the words were British and clear. WOW!! Great job! I highly recommend Michael Page for all audio recordings.The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)Moving on to the story....It was great! It is definitely a Gothic classic. It is a story about a boy, Dorian Gray, who is beautiful beyond belief, but naive as well. He is first discovered by an artist, Basil and becomes the artist's muse. Basil paints the most wonderful, telling portraits, when Dorian sits for him. His work like never before. The artist has a friend, Henry, who is an absolute cynic. Henry thinks he is enlightened, but he is just a miserable existentialist mess! Dorian takes to Henry and they get close, thereby pulling Dorian away from Basil the artist.Henry is full of skepticism, and a deliberate, mean, philosophy on life that he expresses through twisted words and phrases. To Dorian, this is all new and he starts to look up to Henry, emulating him, and following his words. The Good, beautiful, kind, and chaste Dorian becomes a wicked, evil, manipulative, infamous character that everyone is afraid of. His good looks remain, through a portrait made by Basil.Just as Dorian is an inspiration for Basil's blank canvas, so is Henry an inspiration for Dorian's mind as a blank canvas.That is the story.But my summary won't really help you understand the book, you just have to read it.It's very interesting, and well written. I definitely find myself getting angry at some of the things said and done. I am repelled, I feel disgusted, I feel for the minor characters. I sympathize with Basil and I hate Henry. This book got me good.It is am absolutely one-of-a-kind novel I highly recommend you read. You might walk away feeling a little dirty inside, and questioning yourself as well."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Occasionally one reads a book that leaves a lasting impact in one's mind for the duration of a lifetime, and crops up at the most curious of times. \\"Dorian Gray\\" by the brilliant Oscar Wilde is such a one for this reviewer. While you are remaining curiously young and ageless to your friends and the world at large, your aging portrait hidden from all eyes is inspected by you alone as the years go by with some trepidation as the case may be, and as time marches on. Not only is your true appearance accurately portrayed in the picture, showing your actual physical age, but revealing in great detail your personality along with your good deeds and misdemeanors etched meticulously across the painting. When friends of mine sent word recently saying \\"Expect us to look younger since you saw us a decade ago!\\", I was quick to respond \\"I fully expect you to look your appropriate age, and far superior than when you were last here\\". Although this was meant as a note of humor on my part, the thought of Wilde's masterpiece came to mind immediately and the air around me was chilly for a moment. As for Dorian Gray when he attempts to alter and amend his portrait (which might be interpreted as his soul), I shall leave new readers to discover the results of such an enterprise for themselves. A powerful and magnificent novel by one of the greatest literary figures of all times."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"My first encounter with Mr. Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray has left me feeling my soul has been put under the microscope and I have been forced to look into those secret dark places that I keep hidden from the outside world. The language and attention to detail envelopes the reader and at times seems to go on for pages with no end in sight (the section on jewels and music for instance). I love this about Oscar Wilde's writing style. How deliciously dark and disturbing this book is. I am astonished it has taken me so long to read such a brilliant book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Set in the 1800's in the streets of London, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a haunting story of corruption brought unto Dorian Gray by the Lord Henry Wotton. Oscar Wilde explores the pleasures of life, beauty, and temptation through the character of Dorian who, one day realizes that his beauty will fade after Lord Henry's comments on Dorian's youth being captured perfectly: \\"Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for that!\\" (Wilde 3). Dorian unknowingly offered his soul to the devil for his physical beauty in return, all his sins would be reflected in the painting.After his friend Basil, paints a masterpiece of Dorian, he tries to protect Dorian from Lord Henry's thinking and goals in life knowing where it would lead him. Although Hayward is only in the novel for a short time, his character inspired me to keep reading until the end where we can finally see how justice is served. Lord Henry Wotton, a friend of Basil Halyward, who grudgingly introduced him to Dorian. Lord Henry is the character you love to hate; he is such a perfect character, you can sense that something is wrong with him.The young and handsome Dorian Gray is the main protagonist who made me rethink my future and how I looked at life. Although very rich and in good social standing, he chooses to hang out in the slums of London in opium dens and around the docks, symbolizing his sins and where his values lie. The way Oscar Wilde characterizes Dorian gives a vivid and accurate picture of a good boy gone bad.The principal theme of this novel is that self-worship leads to self-destruction, this is one of the main themes that pulled me into reading this book. However, another theme that goes hand-in-hand with the previous one is living a double life. Many speculate Oscar Wilde used this as one of his themes because he was inspired by the story; The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde written by Robert Louis Stevenson.Although written over 120 years ago, this book is a must have and should be in every library across the world or on your shelf. This amazing read forcibly opens your mind to imagine every detail and corner of this story you can feel yourself get lost, just be careful you don't end up in an opium den!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is real entertainment.

While the plays spark with wit and wisdom, with humour and satirical fun, Dorian Gray is of another class entirely. It is a serious look at the consequences of immorality, of vanity and greed and selfishness. And it does not flinch to paint the 'picture' in all of its gory details. It's contemporary today, as proved by a recent film adaptation (starring the drool-worthy Ben Barnes) which was quite accurately adapted from the book and is, to my mind, required reading. Or should be."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Just adding my two cents to a list of great reviews.I love British literature, and Oscar Wilde is a lot of fun. I read this book fairly quickly, it seemed that the text flowed well and the subject matter and characters held my interest. It is a lovely novel about vanity and envy. The message may have been written long ago, but it still holds merit today.And without giving anything away, you will be surprised at many points in this novel. Pleasantly of course."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a review of the free Kindle edition.I had, of course, heard of the Picture of Dorian Gray, but with the joy of a Kindle I'm now able to read it for free.Wow.The story is amazing. The character of Dorian Gray shines (sucks the light out of the room?) during the story. The imagery of the picture is wonderful to reflect the corruption of Dorian's soul. Along with Dorian, I do wonder if he could have reversed it, if he had cared enough to try. The ending while abrupt, was perfect for the character, as it seems that Dorian was protected by something, to make sure that his end could only come about the way that it did.Definite recommend."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is not just a book, it is a story that delves into each human's beliefs and views of the world, a book that makes a person really look differently at the world around them. Although Oscar Wilde wastes much space with over-explanatory details, the moments in which he tells his story are moments of inspiration and causes of great self-examination. The story, in which a good-looking young man gains eternal beauty, really makes its reader look within themselves and find the person they are and who they want to be. Also, through some very good symbols, Wilde is able to make his reader find new meaning in the world around them and is able to open the reader's eyes to the magnificence--and ugliness--of life itself.Even though the book is mostly filled with simple dialogue and extended (and sometimes, unnecessary) descriptions, the overall effect the story itself can have upon the reader's mind is overpowering. Not only does Wilde's occasional complex dialogue add to the reader's understanding of the world, the ideals with which Wilde writes (and therefore gives his character) make the reader work to understand where they fall within the spectrum of day to day life.The book was slow moving at first, but really started to pick up, due to its author's ability to excite the reader's mind, with the first meeting between the main character and the man who he would eventually blame for all of his problems. I would definitely recommend this book to those who have an open mind (there are some controversial ideas and lifestyles within the story) and are able to follow a character's complex mindset because, although most of the book is simple and in some people's eyes, artless, it still provides the reader with multiple \\"out-of-the-box\\" type ideas.I enjoyed the book, and the message it sent was one that I will probably never forget. It is one that forces the reader to question what they value in life, make them question what a \\"perfect\\" life would be. Because of the story's ability to reach within the readers mind and plant a new outlook on life, the book would be a great read for anyone who is interested in hearing the story of a man who gave up everything in order to keep the only thing he believed to be important within the world, the thing that he himself feared losing the most."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A classic noir fiction novel were the worship of material values related to physical beauty and immortality drive the ego of a young man belonging to the upper classes of the English society of the XIX century to a tragic fate after circumstances force him to confront his real self.

There's a lot to be learned from Dorian Gray, I promise he's well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I decided to re-read Dorian Gray for an upcoming book club discussion but I knew that I wanted to read the annotated edition because I cannot resist special editions--books, films, and music-- with all the accompanying special features. I had not realized the extent to which Wilde's original version differed from the final published edition. This edition gives me everything I would ever want to know about Dorian Gray, including not only everything he wrote that was edited out later but extensive footnotes, illustrations, photographs and paintings of innumerable peripheral points of interest.The Picture of Dorian Gray bears similarities in my mind with other notable philosophical metaphysical fantasies of the nineteenth century--Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and one less well-known than those others but perhaps an even more direct influence on Wilde--Balzac's Le Peau de Chagrin, or The Magic Skin. In that novel, a man purchases a magic wild ass's skin that is supposed to grant his every wish. He, of course, indulges in every kind of debauchery and decadent, hedonistic activity he can imagine and discovers that the skin magically shrinks and his life span is correspondingly shortened with every wish fulfilled.All of these novels were published before Wilde wrote his philosophical fantasy and they all influenced him, along with other tales of magic portraits by Hawthorne, Poe and Gogol. Wilde used the device in a particularly unique way. The portrait is kept in a locked room in an attic as any reminder or repository of our darkest impulses would be, in a back chamber of the subconscious. In the final published version of the novel, there are connotations of homosexuality and bisexuality among the characters of the impossibly handsome Dorian, the effete artist Basil Hallward and the caustic, witty, married (and bisexual) Lord Henry Wotton. Each of these characters depict aspects of Wilde himself, with Lord Henry being the primary expounder of Wildean bon mots and witty aphorisms--\\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about,\\" \\"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\\" etc.In the original, uncensored version one can easily see from our \`unsuppressed' 21st century perspective that Wilde is writing about characters that are gay or bisexual. Even though Wilde was writing between and through the lines about these matters of sexual identity, it wasn't subtle enough to not be used as evidence against him in his trial for \`gross indecency' a few years later.From the perspective of someone outside Wilde's era, the novel is a strange, nightmarish parable of sexuality, youth, immortality and moral conscience. Without the sexual components, the novel is a strange neutered fable and attempts to heterosexualize it, as in the famous 1945 film version, only produce strangely asexual men with nebulous fetishes.It is Wilde's only novel and it is a brave, noble attempt. Its weaknesses, of which Wilde was aware, stem from his experience writing for the theater. There are pages of dialogue that could have easily been lifted from a page of script in which not a line of descriptive narration appears. On the other hand, there is an entire chapter in which there is no character interaction whatsoever, no dialogue, merely an extensive, descriptive catalog of the cultural stimuli that contribute to Dorian's dissipation.Upon reflection, one wonders if Wilde would have felt the need to write this novel in a less sexually repressed era. In our current day there would be thousands of opportunities for objective purgings of the darker impulses to be manifested not only through painting but numerous other visual media. Wilde would be one of many gay authors. The novel cannot be separate from the time in which it was created, however, and in the England of 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray was an extremely daring shot in the face of Victorian social and cultural customs."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is full of memorable lines. The conversations exchanged are witty and poignant. Definitely worth a read. A good intro into Wilde.I feel it is relevant to young readers struggling to define themselves in a morally ambiguous world. The ideas are timeless and apply especially in today's time, where I feel the average young adult confronts these issues; whereas in Wilde's time, it was likely only relevant to the wealthy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde is one hell of an elegant writer. He focuses a lot on beauty in his writing, and it really shows. The Picture of Dorian Gray is about a narcissistic man, only to fall in love with a a beautiful painting done of himself. He says aloud that he wishes he could stay young and beautiful, like in his portrait, and lo and behold, his wish comes true. He never grows old, but the man in his portrait (himself) does instead. He hides the portrait in the attic (his dirty secret), because he doesn't want anyone to see him growing old in the picture, and the story pretty much goes from there. This book is poetic in its writing, has a lot of witty commentary, and is a must for Wilde fans. All in all, I gave this story 4 out of 5 stars, only because I enjoyed his play much better... The Importance of Being Earnest. Regardless, if not for the plot, read it for the experience in exceptional writing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This a well written unusual story with strong characters and definitely worth reading.

It does ask some &quot;deep&quot; questions but it doesn't make you really care about the answers; the characters are one-dimensional and transparent. It's hard to seriously relate to any of them, or this story. The writers' language is beautiful in a flowery way. If you want a feel for the book, read the intro/prelude; there are some interesting statements Wilde makes about &quot;ART&quot;. Otherwise, don't bother. There's only so much of art-imitates-life-life-imitates-art you can take."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Unfortunately I didn't like this classic story for many reasons. I downloaded theFree Kindle versionand read about half of it. I finished the story by listening to the Librivox audiobook recording using thefree smartphone app.I found Lord Henry to be quite unlikeable. His statements were absurd, contradictory, and got old quickly. Here are some loose quotes... \\"The only things that are necessary are those that are truly unnecessary.\\" He had MANY of those and I saw them coming when only three words of a sentence were out of his mouth. \\"I find people infinitely fascinating.\\" Which he quickly followed up with something like, \\"I pay no attention to people at all.\\" I believe Wilde was trying to paint a pompous, egotistical fool and he did a great job. It made me dislike the character greatly.The story was not balanced well. We started out by meeting Dorian and quickly jumped ahead through years and years of his life. There was very little build up of tension. Chapter nine was completely painful to go through. Did we need to read, in long, boring detail, about textiles and gems?My biggest complaint - various evil deeds and adventures are eluded to, but not shown to us. Dorian's actions are key to the concept of this story, but they are told to us at a distance and with very little feeling. Authors hear often that they are to show, not tell the reader what is happening. Chapter after chapter told us, in only vague hints, what kinds of things Dorian was up to. We skip over incidents very quickly. Some are just a word or two in a sentence. I realize that The Picture of Dorian Gray was written in an era when prostitution, drug use, and vile acts couldn't be written about in detail, but it could have been done so much better.This story reminds me ofThe Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. They both have themes of - Be careful what you wish for. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was also written at a time when sadistic endeavors and deviant sexual practices couldn't be written in detail. Stevenson succeeded where Wilde failed. I felt Mr. Hyde's strength and power. I could see the lust and greed. Wilde didn't bring any believability to this story."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Informative, deep analyis and fascinating to see Wilde's own annotations in the text. Highly recommended for a closer look at a classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Fistly, I would like to tell you why I'm interested to read this book? I have many reasons to read this book such as my friend is the big fan of Oscar Wilde's stories and she told me that it's a great book, another reason that really made me want to read this book is after I saw the movie called the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, in this movie all charaters are from very well-known book or we can say that they are classic characters. For example Dracula or Vampire, invinsible man(skinner), Dr.Jackle and Mr.Hike, etc.Only one character that I don't know is Dorian Gray(forever young guy), so I find the book to read.When I bought this book, at first I think it would be boring book because it's quite a all style.....but after I read a couple chapters from this book, I change my mind. It's fun, in teresting ideas and use a easy language or I can say that Oscar Wilde use a simple word but feel brilliant and amazing.Another good point for this book is explain the character and place very clear that you can imagine follow the story.I can't say that it's a bad point but it's quite difficult to understand some qoutes but if you read twice or more and think about fact or in a present time you'll understand or may think it's a great qoute.For other thing that I received from this book is social life in the past(around Victorian period), especially for the upper and middle-class people."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The beginning and end of this book were fairly interesting, we get to see Dorian Gray first as a young man (a child essentially) and how he was poked and prodded into becoming the man we see at the end of the book. The middle is somewhat lacking, and I completely lost interest for almost a month before picking the book back up and finishing the story.The story is essentially that of a man who sells his soul for something petty, namely, beauty and about the downfall of not only the main character but also those whom he encounters in his life. It is an interesting story, but I feel that the story could have been written better and become somewhat of a mystery novel. Instead of revealing Dorian's secret at the moment he discovers it, it would have been fun to leave the reader guessing as to why Dorain was so afraid to let others see the great picture of himself, and perhaps delve into the inner turmoil of Dorian a bit more before the conclusion.I have only read the story once, but in future readings I'm sure this story will become more intriguing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It's been a while since I read The Picture Of Dorian Gray, but I'll try to review it as well as I can.The Picture Of Dorian Gray takes place in late nineteenth-century England, among the wealthy middle- or lower upper class. It is about Dorian Gray, a young man who is beautiful, charming and popular. His good friend Basil Hallward is painting his portrait, and during a visit at Basil's house he meets Lord Henry, another friend of Basils. Lord Henry is decadent and provocative, and Dorian is very impressed by him and his ideas.Lord Henry tells him about how precious his youth and beauty is, and how awful everything will become when he grows old (\\"When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter then defeats\\").When Basils painting is finished, Dorian sees his own beauty in it and is struck by the fear of aging. He makes a pact with the devil, and sells his soul so that he can remain young and beautiful forever, while his painting grows old and repulsive. His former kind and lovely self is gradually reformed, and he grows evil and corrupt although he still appears just as fresh and innocent as he has always been.This book is not the best one I've read, but it is pretty good. I think that the characters are sometimes turned into caricatures of themselves; they don't really appear to be real persons. Although I really liked Lord Henry's philosophical monologues, they sometimes grew tiresome and a bit too long. The novel, and in particular the ending, is quite predictable.However, the book is beautifully written (like most of the books I've read from that time (but I don't know if it's because of their superiority to the writers of today, or merely because the good ones are the only ones that are left to future generations))(...) There are strong homosexual tendencies in the friendship between Dorian Gray and both Basil and Lord Henry, and their friendship does not feel like a mere friendship.Apart from being a way for Wilde to, through Lord Henry, give voice to some of his philosophical ideas, I think the novel is about the shallowness and hypocrisy of the Victorian society, which considered outward appearance more important than ethics and moral."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"In the book the Picture of Dorian Gray Dorian, the main character makes a powerful wish that impacts his life and the lives of others.

He asks the reader to ponder the unsymbiotic dichotomy of beauty and goodness. Can one possess both while maintaining a clear conscience?As for the irrepressible and intrepidly narcissistic Dorian Gray, \\"I admit that I think that it is better to be beautiful than to be good.\\" The Picture of Dorian Gray is a short work of literature that I read in one day. However, its brevity is due to Wilde's publisher purposefully omitting material at the time that was deemed vile and unprintable. This causes some holes in the story - references made to the many sins Dorian committed along the way to others were left unanswered upon finishing the book. More than a little frustrating. Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised with the Gothic, sordid, and dark themes that Wilde so aptly transcribes. Wilde amuses us with the copious amounts of witty quotable lines from Lord Henry such as, \\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\"I found myself writing down clever witticisms constantly as I read the book. A good read if for nothing else than the unsurpassed wit of Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I usually try to go into English classes with a sense of optimism about the reading materials, and they're actually not usually bad. I find myself finishing almost every book ahead of schedule, and liking quite a few of them. So when I found out we'd be reading The Picture of Dorian Gray in junior year of High School, I started it with a positive mind. It was a famous classic after all! However, in this particular case, I was disappointed.The Picture of Dorian Gray is a novel with far too much unused potential. It's about the adventures of Dorian Gray, an upper class young adult living in the 1890's. Dorian acquires a magical portrait that diverts all physical traces of sin from him to his face in the portrait, allowing him to commit as much sin as he wants and remain looking youthful and innocent (i.e., after his insults drive his girlfriend Sybil to suicide, his portrait develops \\"a touch of cruelty in his mouth\\" [pg. 91] but his actual face remains the same). He gets advice from other characters about how he should live life, and after following his friend Lord Henry's way of life (outlined in a little yellow book that encourages Dorian to remain vain and shallow) and living hedonistically and selfishly for years and years, he finally realizes how \`ugly' his soul has become and launches an attempt at redemption. While it seems like there would be lots of action, I was disappointed at the lack of plot in general, and most of the book is actually rich people talking about human nature. Many of the book's lessons are taken from the obscure musings of Lord Henry, who acts as an outlet for Wilde's opinions, and while this is a decent way for Dorian to learn about life, I would much rather have read about him learning through experience as he traveled around doing something interesting. He could have been living a life of incalculable sin, and yet chooses to have sex and hang out in gardens smoking opium all day; not quite the worst decision ever, but not an exciting book.The lack of action isn't the only disappointing thing about the book. I constantly felt that Wilde was too busy sending messages to the audience to really give his characters life. Every dialogue read less like a real conversation and more like a (sometimes cryptic) scripted debate, and Wilde skips past something like twenty years' worth of Dorian Gray's character development (summarizing the slow corruption in one chapter). Other characters serve only to invoke development in Dorian, and no other characters show any significant development themselves, making the story just slightly distant. Wilde wastes space for the plot to talk about his ideas about human nature, crossing the line between novel and essay too much for my pleasure (\\"...you must keep your good looks. We live in an age that reads too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful. We cannot spare you.\\" [pg. 220] is a good example of Lord Henry voicing Oscar Wilde's opinion on not just Dorian, but on life, and the Victorian generation). Another book that actually balances preaching with plot well is Animal Farm by George Orwell; it manages to simultaneously deliver a message about communism and entertain the audience. If you want a book where it is mostly messages and the entertainment is scarce, Dorian Gray is the book for you.Well, why is the story so famous? Part of its reputation is due to its shock value concerning homosexuality. There were various less-than-covert hints at homosexuality and adultery, which, unfortunately, are no longer effective in the 21st century. Now that the president is praising gay service in the military on national television, it is hard to be amazed about having gay characters in a book, and so a lot of impact is lost on me. Besides these homosexual exchanges between Dorian and the other male characters, the book is fairly void of plot, and Wilde's reliance on shock value make it boring and harder to take seriously at this point in time, no matter how revolutionary his writing may have been back in his era.The book was short enough to read through without losing focus, and to be fair, Wilde's writing is always very elegant with a signature fancy flair. Many of Lord Henry's musings are interesting, and most of the dialogues are widely quotable. The problem is that the story is just a little bit too boring for me to consider it a book you would normally read for fun, and combined with the superb premise of Dorian's magical portrait, this book's plot was really disappointing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I never heard of Dorian Gray until I watched the movie The League of Extraordinary Men. I heard of Dracula [who wasn't in the movie], the Invisible Man, and Jekyl and Hyde, and Captain Nemo. But I have never heard of Quarterman or this guy Dorian Gray, and I wanted to read more about him. The idea of the picture growing old instead of the person, I thought was a brilliant idea. I could not wait to read this book.How disappointing it was for me, but I gave it two stars for two good reasons: the idea and the writer. The idea is quite neat, and I believe Oscar Wilde was ahead of his time when he thought of it. I think he was a genius, and it is apparent in his writings. There are some deep meanings in some of the passages of the book, and it requires a person to sit back and think about what he's saying. I can appreciate that part of it.But I have a huge problem with the characters in the book. I did not like Lord Henry AT ALL. I barely liked Basil, and Dorian was so over the top emotionally. They are all so judgemental and shallow. I knew this book was not going to work for me when Lord Henry kept talking about how beautiful Dorian was. It was just too much. I believe with Oscar Wilde's exceptional talent at writing, he could have made his point in less pages.And then did I miss how Dorian got his wish? Did it just happen out of the blue? Did he go see a witch or someone with supernatural powers? I would love to know how his wish happened. I must have missed it.Anyway, overall, this book is not my cup of tea. No doubt, Oscar Wilde has a lot to say and he's very smart. It is a must in someone's library. Unfortunately, not in mine.Thanks,Joy"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If the book was entitled \\"The Picture of Dorietta Gray\\" it never would have become a classic. The idea of a man's beauty when the book was written and even today is suspect. There is something feminine about a beautiful person, pretty eyes, long eyelashes, a voluptuous mouth and smooth skin. Masculine men are suppose to be rugged even if handsome, a jutting jaw, thin lips and leathery skin. That Dorian was barely a man when his portrait is completed is important because when he wished for eternal youth, he refused to become a man and to be a pretty boy as he aged was itself, a decadent act.The book begins with lots of talk about Art and how Dorian Gray himself was a work of art who shouldn't bother with the hurley burley of real life. His first corruption comes when he can't accept Sybil Vane is so in love him she loses her ability to inhabit the lives the Shakespearean woman she played so well. But then the book become less about how Dorian fails to live up to the art of his life and more about his shadowy, decadent ways.Men and women fall in love with Dorian Gray. After Ms. Vane, it appears that Dorian falls in love with no one but he lurks around the docks, bars and opium dens with other men. What he actually does that is so disreputable is never clear and but for those of us living post Stonewall have a pretty good idea that it involved casual sex with men.The novel anticipates the celebrity that consumes us. It also proudly promotes male beauty in a new way. But after setting up a grand discussion about art and beauty, I think the book transforms into something more pedestrian, a creepy tale of horror where art and beauty are forgotten."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Title of Book: The Picture of Dorian GrayBy: Oscar WildeReviewed by: M.

After the picture was finished, Basil gave the picture to Dorian as a present, and Dorian made a wish that he would always be young, and the picture would grow old. His wish came true. Whenever he did something bad, the person in the picture would get older. Dorian's face never changed after the picture was finished. He never let anyone know about the picture. One day, Dorian showed Basil the picture and showed him how much the picture was altered. Dorian then murdered the man by digging a knife behind his ear, stabbing him again and again. The day after Basil was dead, Dorian made Alan Campbell (one of his former friends) get rid of the body, by blackmailing him. Dorian then decided that he was going to do. He was going to destroy the picture, because he thought that he was going to be in peace after the picture was gone. He grabbed the knife that he had used to kill Basil and stabbed the picture with it. A cry and a crash were heard. A while later, his coachman and footman went through the windows, up to where Dorian was. On the wall, there was a picture of Dorian Gray, young and beautiful. On the ground, there was a man who was wrinkled, withered, and loathsome of visage. They had to examine the rings for them to recognize who he really was.I liked this book because it was fun and interesting at the same time. This quote is what made Dorian's wish come true: &quot;...only if it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that would grow old!&quot; He didn't know that his wish was to come true. I love when things like that happen!I also disliked the book, because in some parts, it just went on and on about things that I didn't understand. Also, there was too much philosophy in this book. This was something that Lord Henry said: &quot;I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, down-right cruelty, more than anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We have emancipated...&quot; The quote still goes on. I think that Lord Henry is too philosophic.My least favorite part of the book was when Dorian was stabbing Basil, because that was too nasty for me. That is what I hate to hear."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I expected Dorian Gray to be rather dry and restrained when I picked it up. However, it is anything but! This is an enjoyable fast paced novel.Basil Hawthorne paints his masterpiece inspired by (and the portrait of) Dorian Gray. In the blush of innocence, Dorian begins to spend time with Basil's friend, Lord Henry who revels in making shocking statements and defying social protocols. A quick study, Dorian takes this to new levels as he - spurred on by Lord Henry and his own vanity - winds his way down a road of moral corruption all the while horrified at the changes on the canvas. When Basil decides that he would like to exhibit the portait (unaware of what has become of the portait while hidden away by Dorian), Dorian can no longer hide the flaws that have been for so long protected from outside eyes."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This story was really good. It's about Dorian Gray who is about 18 at the time his friend Basil paints a portrait of him. Gray prays that his portrait would age and he himself would remain young, and of course his prayer is answered.Having been written in the late 1800's, it's hard to get past some of the vocabulary in this book, and also there are endnotes which makes it hard to read because you have to flip to the back and find what that part meant and then go back to reading. Another thing that I didn't like was when the author went on and on about jewels and embroidery - it was so hard to follow and it wasn't necessary the story at all.Overall I liked the story, but it was a tough read, and although it's not a very long book (a little over 200 pages) it is not a light read. I think you should read this book if you're into classic literature, but otherwise I would pick something else."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When I first bought this book, I expected it to be one of the best novels I had ever read. Boy, was I wrong. The book held my interest for the first half, but it got very boring.

If all that excess in the middle had been deleted, I would have given the book 5 stars."},{"Title":"Doomsday Prophecies","review":"James R.

I will probably not make the low fat versions of many of the recipes, since that isn't the way we eat, but there are some terrific ideas in here. I like it that she shows us what is possible with the toaster oven and how to get the results you want. It has made me value my new \\"toy\\" more than ever. There are some recipes that I will make as is; the main dishes and sides look good to me, and there were several that I thought sounded excellent. We don't eat a lot of desserts, so that section didn't interest me, especially since it was low fat. We stopped dieting and started eating healthfully, watching portion sizes and eating a variety of foods. The weight comes off if you are intelligent and thoughtful about your choices. You can eat anything you want, within reason. You don't need to do low fat or low carb or any other low thing out there! All in all, a handy little book, and a good resource.

Squeezing your cooked dinner between paper towels to eliminate all vestiges of fat?!? Really?!? Every recipe with dairy uses non-fat yogurt and fat free half and half instead of whatever dairy product would ordinarily be used, and EVERY recipe lectures on all the ways you can take out every last smidge of fat. The author comes across as having an eating disorder, and the recipes are weird as a result. Some of them I can't even imagine working (for example, making split pea soup with split peas that you grind to a powder in your blender and bake with no liquid at all for an hour!). I bought this book because I'm currently without an oven and am committed to cooking fresh, from scratch food, and was looking for some ideas to stretch out from what I've been making in my toaster oven so far.

I was hoping for more home cooking type food, like casseroles....chicken spaghetti, green bean casserole; recipes that are tasty and cut down in quantity for a toaster oven. The recipes in this cookbook were mostly low fat and they were for 4 or more people. Generally, when cooking in a toaster oven, most people are cooking for themselves and maybe a spouse. I generally cook for myself and my husband, so I didn't want recipes I would cook when feeding 4 or more people. I am perfectly capable of doing the math and breaking the recipes down, but if I have to do that, I could just use one of the many regular cookbooks I have. This cookbook needs to be listed as a low fat/diet cookbook. It is full of lowfat recipes....even the desert section is lowfat recipes.

I first saw this book at the library and thoght it might be fun to start a class feature called \\"Saint of the Week.\\" It quickly became the kids' favorite part of the weekly class. The accounts of the lives of these Saints are all lively and interesting enough to keep the class's attention, and the author still manages to be reverent in tone. Older kids, I am sure, would also enjoy the stories, which are long enough to contain some very interesting details, but not so long as to lose the audience's attention. Then again, how can you lose a class's attention when you tell them the true story of, for example, St. Thomas More or St. Joan of Arc?"},{"Title":"Loyola Kids Book of Saints","review":"Amy Welborn has produced an excellent book that brings the lives of the Saints to children at a level they can enjoy and understand. I read a variety of stories and literature to my two sons' before they fall asleep each night. However, we often decide to read a couple stories from the Loyola Kids Book of the Saints. They are just the right length for our nightly ritual. Each story begins with a short moral dilemma or question that children can get their heads around. Then the story of a particular Saint is used to help them work through the question. The stories are always interesting, sometimes heroic, often are poignant. We especially enjoyed the stories about St. Nicholas and St. Wenceslaus this past Christmas season."},{"Title":"Loyola Kids Book of Saints","review":"I would actually rate this book 4.5 stars if Amazon had that option. The reason I can't give it 5 stars is that the author does not use proper capitalization when using pronouns referring to God (i.e. \\"his\\" when it should be \\"His\\"). Also, there is some other ungrammatical language that is clearly a deliberate attempt to appeal to modern kids but that really bothers me. I know Ms. Welborn can write proper English, and as a home educator that's what I expect in the books aimed at impressionable young minds.The stories are very engaging, and there is a good mix of familiar and unfamiliar saints and blesseds from throughout the ages. I like the organization by theme- \\"saints are people who...(love children, teach us new ways to pray, help the poor and sick, change their lives for God, etc.)\\" The author does a good job presenting the stories in an age-appropriate manner, which is always a concern given the violence many of the saints had to endure."},{"Title":"Loyola Kids Book of Saints","review":"This is my 8 year old son's favorite book! I have learned a lot from it as well! The book is chalk-full of 3-4 page stories about saints from all times.

It is artfully written in a way for the kids to relate to the saints' personal experience. I like that it is not syrupy sweet, like the books I used to read when I was younger. The author uses modern vocabulary and poses thought-provoking questions for the young readers. I appreciate that the more well-known saints of the early centuries and more contemporary (recently canonized) saints are included in this collection.

I could see a young child being intimidated by a lot of text."},{"Title":"Loyola Kids Book of Saints","review":"Very simple, Review Title says it all, if you want to keep kids interested it needs better pictures. The perfect subject matter for a book to be full of great illustrations--you don't exactly see amazing (or any) pictures of Saints in everyday life."},{"Title":"Loyola Kids Book of Saints","review":"I was looking for a book to serve as the primary text for a summer curriculum based on the saints. This book exceeded my expectations. It presents a diverse set of Catholic saints balancing genders, geography, and time in history. It also sets up every story with a theme that will resonate with the reader and which relates to the saint's life (creativity, losing one's friends over one's beliefs, determination, etc.) A great bed time book too! There's a sketch for each saint (i.e.very few pictures), so it's definitely something you want to use with more advanced readers or really good listeners who can do without the visual."},{"Title":"Loyola Kids Book of Saints","review":"I purchased this book as a gift for my Goddaughter on making her First Communion. I was so pleased with the clever way in which the wide array of saints were divided categorically. It makes it very easy to equate a particular saint with what they are best known for, most passionate about, and what circumstances were in place during their lifetime. While it is not realistic or necessary to cover each and every saint in Catholic history, this book serve as a convenient resource for child and adult alike. Furthermore, the style in which the saints are described literally comes to life off the page. The ability to educate my Goddaughter on blessed individuals who have helped to pave our path to our Lord is something I will cherish for years to come."},{"Title":"Loyola Kids Book of Saints","review":"I bought this book for my kids and we have incorporated it into our bedtime routine at least once a week. All of us, including my husband and me, have learned so much! Wellborn writes in a easy-to-understand, and easy-to-remember way about our successful brothers and sisters. It really highlights the things we have in common with the saints who unfortunately seem so super-human the way some books tell their stories.

We have a few grownup books - Butler's Lives of the Saints and a couple others. Those were a little too much for her to sit and read - not because of her reading ability, but because they are not kid-friendly. This book was just what I was looking for. It's a thick compilation of saints. It has a hardcover and is quite durable. I like how the book is broken into sections (i.e., Saints are people who like kids, Saints are people who like to teach, etc.). I think it shows that the saints were once just regular people like us and sainthood is something that is attainable. Each saint featured has about 3-4 pages telling about his/her life in an easy, conversational manner."},{"Title":"Loyola Kids Book of Saints","review":"Ordered this for my toddler, but some saint's deaths are shared so too graphic for him, but I really enjoyed it!

This book is in a story format about each Saint, about 60 of the Saints. It provides enough information to draw the Children's attention without boring them. So far we have covered St. Nicholas and St. Elizabeth Ann Seton. The book is easy enough to read (I had three 8 to 10 year old read out loud) and at the end of each section there is a discussion question for the kids.PROS-price: I paid $11-simplicity: Stories provide detail but not too much info-discussion topic at the end-introduction: covers What/Who are Saints and whyCONS-not enough pictures... It would have been nice to show the kids a portrait of the SaintCONCLUSIONI highly recommend this book to any Catechist or any parent who would like to teach their child about Saints. It's a simple read and very informative."},{"Title":"Loyola Kids Book of Saints","review":"I (age 24) am really enjoying this book. I wanted something easy to read to learn a little about the saints.Each saint begins with the author trying to connect with kids and relate things to their lives so they understand with everyday examples. That part can probably be glossed over by adults, but for kids, I think it's great. It segways in well and the text is never boring.One thing I've noticed, after reading several of the saints, is that they may leave out the miracles they did. For example with St. Terese Lisieux, there was a miracle of a blind girl being cured after going to her grave after her death that was not included. Everything else important seemed to be included in an easy to read way, though.Also, with Saint Gianna Beretta Molla, it left out that she made a miracle with another woman who was pregnant whose amniotic sac burst but the baby was still fine after he had 0 chance of survival. Again, this seemed to be the only important fact that was missing.I am in the middle of the third \\"part\\", and so far it seems to be grouped well. The saints' lives don't seem forced to fit into the sections such as \\"surprising\\" or \\"loves children.\\" It flows well in my opinion.I just really enjoy this book. It makes learning about the saints easy and fun. I feel like I'm just reading a story, but now I'm familiar with the saints as if by magic!"},{"Title":"Loyola Kids Book of Saints","review":"I was quite pleased with the book and the price, it did just what I needed it to do, interest my young grandson in the Saints"},{"Title":"Loyola Kids Book of Saints","review":"We are in the process of converting to the Catholic church, and my older- elementary aged kids have loved getting to know the saints as we read through this wonderful book together. There are references to school fairly often, but even as homeschoolers, we can overlook that part and enjoy the wonderful way the stories are told. The only suggestion I have for any future publications is an index of the saints by the date of their feast day, for those of us who would like to follow along by the Church year rather than by the categories the author has divided them into."},{"Title":"Hungry, Hungry Sharks (Step-Into-Reading, Step 3)","review":"Very cool book!

They really help ease reluctant readers into reading novels, and this book is no exception. This is an easy reader that is not a (in the words of one of my students) \\"sissy fairy tale book,\\" which boys and girls both love. The anecdotes about shark encounters and illustrations are appealing to all, including this shark-loving teacher.

It says they can't stop swimming or they will sink. I think this has been dis-proven. It also doesn't address the problem of sharks being killed for their fin or because people don't like them and how they are becoming endangered. None of that info is in the book. In fact is says they have been here since dinosaur time and they will always be here.But other than that it does have enough info for my 4 year old who loves to learn about animals. It has drawings instead of photos. It shows different types of sharks. The book touches on the subject of sharks attacking people without being gory. This book says all kinds of non food has been found inside sharks. Actual items found are MINK coat, treasure chest of jewels, suit of armor, barrel of nails.

The large type will help children in their reading. While most pages have one to four short sentences, a few pages have as many as eight sentences. The book looks at the origin of sharks with dinosaurs, the various sizes of shark species, the pack hunting of blue sharks, and the dangers of the great white shark. There are a couple pages of illustrations of various types of shark with winning illustrations. Looking at the hammerhead shark, the author shows how some animals such as dolphins defend themselves from shark attacks. Finally, there is a bit on what items have been found in sharks, fishing for sharks, and the research around the habits of sharks. Patricia Wynne's bright and colorful illustrations will surely add to the entertainment of this didactic book."},{"Title":"Hungry, Hungry Sharks (Step-Into-Reading, Step 3)","review":"Evan will be letting Grandma read this book to him but he will be so excited to learn that Grandma will be learning about sharks along with him.At almost-seven, he needs help with independent reading but he'll love the pictures and information."},{"Title":"Hungry, Hungry Sharks (Step-Into-Reading, Step 3)","review":"I actually purchased this book for my husband as an inside joke. We had seen it in an eclectic children's store in Santa Barbara and found one particular part very funny: it tells readers that though sharks are dangerous, not to worry because you're more likely to be killed by a bee sting. We thought that was brilliant for a children's early reader. Who are the people publishing these things? I had to give it a 3 because of what other people say about the information being factual and all that. But seriously?"},{"Title":"Hungry, Hungry Sharks (Step-Into-Reading, Step 3)","review":"Hungry, Hungry Sharks has too much sketchy information in it for me to be comfortable reading it to my children. Sure, lots of the facts are spot on. But too many of them are based on conjecture. For example, \\"even a swordfish almost always loses a fight with a great white shark.\\" I have never heard of a white shark being observed consuming a swordfish. That is not to say that it doesn't happen, but I don't think there is enough evidence for the author to make such a statement. If you find this a bit nitpicky, fine, I am a nitpicker. But consider the final sentence of this book: \\"As long as there are oceans, there will be sharks.\\" This God-like prediction is irresponsible (even for a book written in 1986) given that many shark species may be moving toward extinction. The best lesson your kids can get from this book is that you can't believe everything you read.

The illustrations are quite good and of course hold the children's interest from cover to cover. The text is simple and quite easy to follow and understand. I can see why there might be some concerns over portions of the book. Yes, the book dose address the fact that sharks, for the most part, are preditors and I can see why the illustrations might upset some (although I feel it will probably the adults rather than the children who will be upset. Kids are so pragmatic these days about such things). I also have to agree to parts of the one negative review this book received in that I too felt the author was being a bit cavalier as to the probability of the survival of sharks all over the world. As the reviewer pointed out, this is one animal that is quickly getting into trouble in a big way. Perhaps I would have liked to have seen a bit more on the necessity of keeping these wonderful creatures with us. Overall though, I find the book to be quite useful and as I pointed out, the kids all love it."},{"Title":"Hungry, Hungry Sharks (Step-Into-Reading, Step 3)","review":"This is an excellent book for the budding oceanographer (or the beginning reader). It realistically shows the shark as predator (some of the pictures show sea animals being eaten by sharks, but the illustrations will probably not be upsetting for most), and as victim of the smarter, more teamwork-oriented dolphins. The book does a great job of reporting interesting shark facts; for example, there are more than 300 types of sharks, the dwarf shark is no bigger than a hand, a barrel of nails was once found in a shark's belly, etc. 47 pages long, the publisher recommends it for readers in grades 1-3.

Yes, they do.\\" For crying out loud, nothing like scaring the daylights out of kids and making them hate sharks! There's a lot of inaccurate information to boot.

I guess it depends on the kid."},{"Title":"Rock from the beginning","review":"If you want a dry, academic, technical overview of early rock and roll, this is not the book for you. I'm working from distant but vivid memory here, but the author really cared about this music, and shares his enthusiasms and opinions freely. Sometimes, I agreed with him, [he's a Rolling Stones man rather than a Beatles worshipper] and sometimes not. But he always made me want to hear more of the music, and that's a good thing. He's particularly interesting in his assessments of various British Invasion groups, which I admit is also one of my own areas of interest.Out of curiosity, I'm ordering a copy of Rock from the Beginning now, and look forward to re-reading it, with my own altered perspective, and in light of forty more years of music listening behind me. Wish me luck, and if I now feel this is a dreadful book, I'll update my review. As you either know, or will discover, things don't always have the same appeal a few miles farther down the road. Then again, we sometimes find even more in them from another vantage point. In any case, rock on!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"_This is not a book that one easily forgets. True, you can read it as a simple adventure story of life on a turn-of-the-century seal-hunting schooner, but it is far more than this. It is essentially the story of Wolf Larson- and Wolf Larson is the entire mainstream of 19th and 20th century America in microcosm._Larson is no simple brute. He is, rather, a complex brute. He is a master of men and a master of the seas- but that is ALL that he is. Larson is an intelligent, driven, ruthless master of industry (in this case, seal hunting.) He has succeeded through his own abilities, hard work, and talent- or so he would have you believe. Truth is, brutal backstabbing, deception, exploitation, and disregard for the law has played an equal measure in his rise and dominance. You see, Larson believes in the rule of the jungle. He believes in it so much that he is driven to prove that this is all there is to existence. He must always seek to degrade and destroy anyone who seeks to rise above this state. This is also why he must disregard the possibility of the existence of a human soul. Larson is an intelligent, hard-nosed materialist that simply cannot conceive of anything beyond a social Darwinist hell of survival of the fittest. And Wolf Larson must be the fittest of them all. As much as money means to Wolf, it is really power over other beings- men and animals that means the most to him. Without this power to sadistically degrade and dominate others, the money would have no meaning. Ultimately that explains why he has risen to command his own vessel at all costs- he is a control freak that MUST be in absolute, totalitarian command of his whole world. This is why he only mans his ship with the lowest, most bestial types of human being, and does everything in his power to make them worse- not unlike many modern corporations. This is also why the sudden presence of a higher sort of individual, with ideals that transcend mere survival and materialism are so totally threatening to him._There are moments when one is almost tempted to sympathize with the Wolf as a champion of freedom- until you realize that in his sort of world his \\"freedom\\" means that everyone else must be a slave._Ultimately, the Wolf meets the inevitable fate in a world ruled like the jungle. When he loses his sight and strength, the monsters that he has surrounded himself with turn on him. In the last measure there is nothing great about Larson after all, for in facing death he proves to be a petty, murdering, weakling that would rather take all those around him down with him. It seems that despite his grand pretensions, he was no Lucifer at all, but merely a sick, pathetic, sociopath incapable of making the leap into being truly human."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The Sea Wolf by Jack London. This book is about Humphrey Van Weydon who is a gentleman that lives in San Francisco. He is a wealthy man through inheritance of his father. He is traveling across the bay to visit a friend when a collision occurs and he is sent overboard. Wolf Larsen and his crew rescue him and decide to keep him onboard for the seal-hunting ship bound for Japan. During these times Humphrey Van Weydon learns how to stand up on his own, because he has never had a real job before. I like the book because of the vivid descriptions and it keeps you interested because of the story being out at sea."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"London details Jack Larson in such a way he allows the reader to really get to know this 'wolf'. London has a gift for development of characters like no other author I have read.Great story!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Dick Hill does a brilliant cockney English, a satisfactory Van Weyden and the narration is acceptable. As for who Wolf Larsen is, Hill doesn't have a clue. His reading of Larsen is flat, stuck in a monotone. From Larsen's first word to the last, with one exception that left me wanting, Hill is expressing Larsen's moments of anger, elation, sadness, passion, force, pessimism, reflection, (rare) mirth, depression, and in general every word of normal conversation- in variations of barking, snapping, shouting, bullying, threatening and spitting.In depicting Larsen as nothing but a brute, Hill is depriving him of his extraordinary intellect, his magnetism, his social skills, the intelligence guiding his power and his beauty.The five stars are for London's masterpiece since they apply to rating the book and not the CD. This recording is worthless to me."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The Sea Wolf, by Jack London is a very interesting and unique book. The story starts with a gentleman, a Mr. Humphrey Van Weyden taking a nice cruise on San Francisco Bay. All of but a moment, a simple twist of fate changes his life forever. The large ferry-boat he was on, the Martinez was suddenly struck by a steamboat in the dense and sometimes deadly San Francisco fog. As he was floating through the water he is picked up by the schooner Ghost whose captain is known infamously for his cruelty, Wolf Larsen. Soon he is thrust into a world of hard labor and death waiting around the corner always.The book is a coming of age story, although it is unique because the one coming of age is already 35 years old. His whole life Humphrey Van Weyden never had to work for anything. He was a scholar; his job was a literature critic because his father had made all of his money for him. Once employed on the Ghost he must learn to fend for himself or be killed. But he finds that his incredibly muscled brute of a captain with no regard for human life or suffering actually has an incredible intellect. They end up discussing the philosophy of life multiple times. Soon, a pretty scholaress from the east of which Humphrey enjoyed reading very much appears on the Ghost setting a gap between Humphrey and Wolf Larsen. From then on the story takes an interesting turn and keeps you on the edge of the railing if not your seat.If you like swashbuckling adventure, great philosophical arguments and outlooks on life unique to the brain of Jack London, even a love story here and there, then I would recommend this book against all others. I have never read anything like it at all."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The Sea Wolf is a gripping, thrilling and stunning peice of work. Van Weyden and Larsen come to grips with eachother and with themselves in this book. The confrontation scenes between the two are amazingly written and the stark realism of the boat, it's crew and the violence that is almost an everyday occurence combine to make this a book that can not be put down.The introduction of the female slows the book considerably but in my honest opinion, the ending is fine. Larsen's final fate is surprising and heart rending. The repeated phrase &quot;Bosh&quot; leads to one of the books best moments. While I wish London hadn't included the female, the book is well worth the read. At least before the female comes in, the book is darkly violent and challenging. The social implications of the debates between Van Weyden and Larsen are extremely sobering. All in all, this book is one of the best I have ever read. Brilliant is the best word I can come up with."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"If you enjoyed &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; or &quot;White Fang&quot;, then you'll probably like this book as well. The plot is basically the same...a weak creature is torn from it's sheltered life and forced to endure hardship. (Whatever doesn't kill us, makes us stronger.) A must read for fans of Jack London and adventure on the high seas!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"This is the first recreational book I have read in years and I couldn't put it down. There is so much in this book about life and the meaning of life, if there is any, that it will definitely force you to think about what it all means to you.This book rocks! The romance part was critical for Hump so just ignore the other comments! 8-)"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"This is probably one of the best examples of character devolopment that I have ever read. London paints a pictures of Humphrey, Wolf Larson, and the rest so that the act as real people. It is also topped off with a great story of adventure and romance. However, the most important point of the book is the good versus evil, or the one who believes in God versus the one who does not. The reader struggles with the same questions placed on Humphrey until the good finally triumphs in the end."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"This book is a classic, and with good reason. Wolf Larsen is perhaps the best-developed character I have ever encountered in a novel. The story never lets up, and you will not be able to put the book down. Overall, it's a very exciting tale of the sea. Toward the end, however, the story becomes more of a romance. I didn't like this change of pace right at the end of such an exciting novel, and that's why I only give it 4 stars. But read it anyway, because it really is great!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"This is a really good book. Jack London was one of the greatest writers in history. The story if you don't know is about a refined man who is on a ship and it goes down only for him to be \\"rescued\\" by another one. I put rescue in quotes because the ship he gets on (the Ghost) is ruled over by the legendary Sea Wolf Wolf Larsen. Larsen does not believe in any sort of moral code and also thinks that might makes right. As such, he commands his ship with a system of fear and intimidation and refuses to take Humphrey(the rescued man) back ashore. Instead, Hump, as he is referred to by the other sailors, is forced to stay aboard and goes from being a meek rich-boy whose never worked to a hardened man of the seas. The story is basically a brutal and savage one with London showing all of the ways Larsen can punish his crew and how Hump responds. Larsen is no mere man. He is extremely intelligent and well-read and that's why he keeps Hump on. The other men are not intellectual in the slightest but brutes. The only way Larsen is able to keep control is because he is also strong, nearly inhumanly so. In fact, in one scene, the mean attempt to throw him overboard after knocking him out. He climbs back on the ship and then goes down into the sleeping quarters where he is heavily outnumbered. There the men enact their plan to take over the ship. He fights off like a dozen men and survives, torturing his crew afterwords. Along the way, they meet up with his brother Death Larsen, but he isn't ever more than a faceless phantom. It is here that the book loses steam. They take on a woman who is a writer. Hump naturally develops feelings for her. They escape eventually to an island and, without giving away the ending, have a few problems there also. All in all, this is a really good, kept from true greatness perhaps by the inclusion of the woman at the end and the island. Except for that it's practically perfect. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I wish I had read this book in high school. I didn't get to it until much later in life. London knows his subject and in this case it's the conflict of man versus man, philosophy versus philosophy wrapped in a case of a diabolical captain against a gentleman. The discourses between these two never bog down and the action on the sea and land alike are edge of the seat brilliant. Take one side or the other, but you will be left searching your soul after reading this intense classic by a master of the writing craft."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I was quite surprised by Jack London's novel, The Sea Wolf. In fact, I rather enjoyed reading this book about a man at sea, Humphrey Van Weyden, aboard the ship, The Ghost, appropriately titled and a good metaphor. Aboard the ship, Van Weyden narrates his life at sea and the battles aboard the ship amongst the other sailors and the Captain Wolf Larsen who is also known as the Sea Wolf. The arrival of Maud Brewster adds romance to lonely Humphrey's sailing career. They have quite a story to tell as they leave the ship for Endeavor Island where they learn to survive in the Alaskan landscape in the early 1900s with barely the clothes on their back and their limited knowledge. It's like survivor without television cameras and there is only two people, a man and a woman on a desert island. Remember that question about who you would like to be stuck with on a desert island? Well, this book must have inspired such a philosophical question or wish. Maud and Humphrey get their wish to be alone but it's a struggle against nature. Jack London's writing style comes across with such flair that I believe he is the one of the most under-rated of American writers. Granted, we read his books in middle or high school but the older reader would gradually benefit and understand the depth of the narrator's voice with this book. Jack London should be regarded as one of America's foremost authors even with his focus on nature that his books are still selling and classic story-telling."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Loaded with imagery. The wickedness of Captain Wolf Larsen and the affection between Humphrey Van Weyden and Maud Brewster seems exaggerated but the author is using these things for higher purposes.Also, it's hard to believe that there could be another Wolf Larsen-type character in existence (the other being Wolf's brother, Death Larsen, captain of the ship Macedonia) but Jack London wants us to realize that animalism and death exist, are related, and ever present. Only love (the kind Hump and Maud develop) and work offer respite from this gloomy reality.London adds emphasis through his choice of name for the ship -- The Ghost (the boat piloted by Wolf Larsen, signifying how body and animalism dominate the soul during earthly life). Traveling through the soul (or \\"ghost\\"/spirit) is the best way to combat life's travails that spring up like sudden storms upon the sea.\\"The Sea Wolf\\" succeeds in a way that most great works of literature do -- a popular story that can be enjoyed by the masses but also containing deep parables for elevated hearts and minds. London's story falls into the great convoy of ocean adventures that include the biblical book of Jonah (check out the Vilna Gaon's superb commentary on Jonah -- Aderes Eliyahu) and Herman Melville's \\"Moby Dick\\" that teach timeless lessons.Wolf Larsen proves the truth of F.A. Hayek's theory that the strict rationalist tends to become a barbarian. I found my pro-life convictions challenged by Wolf's superficially appealing utilitarian explanation of why people guard their lives. It's true but not the whole story. I dove deeper into pro-life principles to refute Larsen's materialism uber alles. To wit, why would life (human adults) fight to preserve other life (unborn children) that, in most cases, it doesn't even know. Wouldn't adult life be afraid of what incoming life could potentially take away? The answer there is yes and that helps sustain the pro-abortion impulse. But the fact that there are adults willing, at cost to themselves, to seek protection for lives of coming generations that they have no acquaintance with suggests to the reasonable mind that the soul exists and is at work in such rescuers.This phenomenon doesn't exist in the animal world (animals only fight for their own kind). It shows that the soul makes humans qualitatively different from the rest of existence."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Humphrey Van Weyden, a pampered son of wealth, has lived a comfortable life of bookishness and learning in 1890's San Francisco. But everything changes when an accident on a ferry-trip across the bay leaves him floating helpless in a foggy sea. He is picked up by a schooner heading out to hunt seals, captained by the vicious Wolf Larsen. He is immediately pressed into service as cabin-boy aboard the Ghost, and learns a different kind of life than he has been raised to know. Wolf Larsen is not only brutal and overbearing to everyone he encounters, but he is also highly intelligent, having taught himself reading and mathematics. \\"Hump,\\" as Humphrey is called by the Captain, gains some measure of favor with the Captain as he is able to discuss philosophy and such things of which the rest of the crew is wholly ignorant.The characters and plot are intensely compelling, especially throughout the first half of the book where the drama is intense as he struggles to survive aboard the Ghost. His observations of the other crew members are interesting, as he discovers how different their lives are from his, and he feels pity for the things they lacked and which he took for granted. Also, the character of Captain Larsen is incredible; completely horrible yet you feel a sort of sympathy even for him.My biggest complaint with the story is at about its midpoint where a woman character enters the story. The struggle for life suddenly takes on a different meaning for Humphrey, as he now has someone other than himself to worry about, but this changes the whole mood of the story. The struggle is no longer filled with the painful drama, but practically turns into a romance, and a fairly sappy one, at that. It's also here that the book slows down with quite a few long passages about the mechanics and technical details of ships and sailing. But overall a very interesting tale of struggle - it's just unfortunate that the ending wasn't as strong."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time.A complete masterpiece.You can't help but love the Wolf and his way of life. I think this explores the human soul and if truth were told I think many more people would behave this way if they were not burdened with consequences Whether they would admit it or not. This book would've even been much better if it could be written now.I would love to see the character's view points on women, sex, etc."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I find that this book is the best one London ever wrote. It questions many aspects of our lives. In addition to this he depict his characters so well, that you feel you know them. I have read all of Londons books and no one as well-written and alive as The Sea Wolf. He is truly a magician with words. This is art!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The Sea Wolf is very possibly the best book I have ever read. London describes his wonderful world at sea in a way that makes one feel as though he/she is actually there, and has known the characters since childhood. I strongly recommend, to all, this book. It is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"This is one of my favorite books. London combines high-seas adventure with life's lessons as I believe no one else has done before or since. We all have a little &quot;Hump&quot; (good) and &quot;Wolf&quot; (evil) in all of us, and the struggles between these two seem to reflect those we all face inside ourselves. Hoist yer topsails, mate, and get ready for an adventure!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Normally when I read a book for class I only go as far as appreciating the quality of the book's prose or complexities, but I never thought of them as fun reads. The Sea Wolf was a fun read because of the thrilling adventure, which made it different from other literary books in which not a lot actually happens."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Having a Kindle helps one to discover books which otherwise would certainly have been missed. This is one of them.It's the tale of a rather bookish \\"gentleman\\" who is virtually press-ganged to work on a sailing ship. Through vicious hardship he is faced with the choice of survival (and in the process compromising his morality) or almost certain death. The main villain, if you will, is the Captain of the ship, who's physical strength and presence is overwhelming.Some of the language is a little archaic, but the Kindle dictionary didn't let me down.It's well worth the read. Get past the first ten pages, and you may find it hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"It has been many years since I've read any Jack London and it was good to get back in the adventure story groove. He does paint a good visual in one's mind of the settings even with the 19th century language. The story moves along pretty well although some of the flowery romantic speech seem to drag for me. The conclusion was sufficiently satisfying and it is suitable reading for young readers."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"When I first dipped into THE SEA WOLF, I was struck by its similarity to CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS. Humphrey van Weydon's ferry-steamer, The Martinez, is rammed by another ship in San Francisco Bay in a heavy fog. Van Weydon is rescued by Wolf Larsen, captain of the seal-hunter, The Ghost. Larsen refuses to take Van Weydon ashore, laughing at his offer of money. Once again, I am reminded of another famous book, MOBY DICK, and Larsen is Captain Ahab. Ruthless and single-minded, Larsen decides to make Van Weydon his cabin boy on this four month trip to provide seal pelts for fashionable American women. Van Weydon resists until Larsen catches hold of his arm and squeezes. A man of letters who freely admits never working a day in his life, Van Weydon does everything he's told from that point on, including aiding and abetting the Captain as he mistreats his crew.Early on we learn some of Larsen's motivation when he and Van Weydon have a literary discussion. We discover that Larsen is a literary bully. He's never spent a day in school, but he reads Shakespeare, Robert Browning and John Milton. London's theme becomes clear and Larsen and van Weydon argue about immortality, van Weydon declaring that man has a soul; Larsen retorting with a Scrooge-like \\"Bah!\\" And suddenly we have the first gleanings of an existentialist novel. If there were no God, how should man behave? Larsen, seeing evil everywhere he looks, decides he will do whatever is best for him personally.The conflict is not precisely good versus evil. Van Weydon is a weakling, a pampered rich man, a coward. There is also much to admire about Wolf Larsen. He outduels seven men during a mutiny. He's constantly reading, constantly trying to understand. When Van Weydon's story arc begins to ascend--he learns seamanship, rebuilds the ship when its masts are destroyed--we can't help but give Larsen a bit of credit. Larsen never took no for an answer, no task was too difficult.Another interesting element in the book is London's fledgling steps toward women's liberation. Van Weydon falls in love with another castaway, Maud Brewster, and together they overcome storms, isolation on a small seal rookery, and sabotage.I guess I knew London was a better writer than the man who wrote CALL OF THE WILD (His short story \\"To Build a Fire\\" is one of my favorites), but I wasn't expecting a philosophical discourse wrapped around a sea adventure."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Great book! I had never read Jack London before but after visiting his burnt down estate in Northern California I became interested in his writing. This book is excellent, entertaining and fast paced. The kindle edition seems not to be missing any pages. Great Free Download."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Caution: The Sea Wolf is full of examples of man's inhumanity to man. If you are easily upset by callous disregard of the health and safety of others, you will not enjoy this book. Further, the book describes many of the worst abuses of the ways that seals were hunted for their fur.On the surface, The Sea Wolf is a story about seal hunting expeditions to the Bering Sea. Beneath the surface, this book is an allegory about the nature of a human's life.The Sea Wolf is one of those novels that explores philosophy as its primary purpose. The idea is to take abstract philosophical ideas, and make the philosophies come to life by putting them into interesting circumstances. So while there's an adventure tale on the surface of The Sea Wolf, that story is there merely to provide examples of the philosophical points. So don't be surprised if the adventure falters from time to time in favor of developing the philosophical examples. In the Sea Wolf, action is included primarily for character development rather than the reader's visceral entertainment.In this book, Jack London was obviously fascinated by the new theories of Social Darwinism that grew out of Darwin's Origin of Species, indicating that the most capable people survived and prospered while the least capable fell by the wayside. Another influence was Nietzsche's concept of the amoral superman. A third influence was Milton's poem, Paradise Lost, and the role that Lucifer played in that story. To explore these points, Mr. London developed Captain Wolf Larsen, owner of the seal hunting schooner, Ghost. Captain Larsen is as amoral and strong in body and mind as you can imagine. Think of him as 100 percent traditional masculinity.For a counterpoint, Mr. London looked to the traditional concepts of the Christian gentleman. Such a man is concerned with matters of the soul, helping others, ideas, and pursuing perfection. Taken to its extreme, such a man becomes almost like a woman. To develop this contrast, Mr. London uses the character of Humphrey van Weydon (known as \\"sissy\\" van Weydon to his friends while growing up) who is a literary critic.The story evolves through putting Humphrey van Weydon into Larsen's world. The book's key theme is that a true man combines the virtues of a Christian gentleman with the masculine strength and independence of his sex's superior qualities over many women (like a successful jousting knight), but this true man can only be completed by the company and spiritual connection to a good woman (much like the medieval knight had to have his lady as a source of platonic love). As you can imagine, this theme will not inspire those looking for a nonstop, heart-pounding adventure tale.The power of the story comes in the book's first half, when you will not know what to expect next from Wolf Larsen. If you are like me, you will feel a little involuntary discomfort every time Larsen comes near van Weydon . . . or anyone else, for that matter. The book's second half will be less appealing to most male readers, but will be the more appealing part for many female readers.Many readers will find the coincidences that bring the characters together when they do to be more than a stretch, and draw away from the story. I suggest that you look upon these circumstances as being intended to portray the hand of Providence, in Mr. London's way of thinking.The book's strength is the way that the van Weydon character develops. You will come to appreciate his trials and the ways he handles them. If you find that you don't like that character after 75 pages, I suggest that you read no further unless you are otherwise enjoying the book.May all your endeavors be worthy of your highest ideals and potential!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Jack London's stated intention in writing this book was to place a man and a woman, both intellectual, well-to-do, yet socially soft (physically and psychologically). into the very challenging world of a seal hunting boat and watch them strive for survival. In this context, he has created one of the most fascinating characters of all literature, Wolf Larson, the inhuman captain of the &quot;Ghost.&quot; Larson takes great delight in the suffering he brings to Humphrey Van Weyden and Maud Brewster, but they steadily grow to meet the challenge. This book can be read and enjoyed on two levels: As a rousing sea adventure, or as a discourse on society and sociology. Jack London is my favorite author -- I am in the process of collecting first editions of all fifty of his books -- and yet I find Sea Wolf ranks head and shoulders above all his other works. It could explain why this story has been turned into a film seven times, more than any of his his other stories, including The Call of the Wild. Two of cinema's great Wolf Larsons have been Edward G. Robinson and Charles Bronson."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"It's a real shame that Jack London coupled one of his most fascinating and full-blooded characters with a stinker of a love story which carries no conviction.Maud Brewster, like many of London's female characters (from Skeet, Curly and Mercedes in The Call of the Wild to Beth, Alice and Collie in White Fang), is underdeveloped, a mite hysterical, and completely dependent on the male characters. Without much in terms of psychological complexity, Maud provides a poor, poor reason for Humphrey Van Weyden to rebel against Wolf Larsen.The first half of this book and its final few chapters are superb because London's male characters and their struggles are vividly portrayed. The knife-whetting contest between Mugridge and Hump; the homoerotic segment where Hump tends to a naked and wounded Larsen; Johnson and Leach's struggle against Larsen's iron fist -- London obviously loves these characters and gives them the light of day. Maud is another story.In any event, the first half of this book is the top-notch tale of a Miltonic hero's slow slide from power, and the ending a moving fulfillment of this character's destiny (life, in the end, *is* yeast...but a savagely active and beautiful yeast, at that). Another one of London's terrible worlds unfolding its brutal majesty before us -- and, of course, another book inexplicably relegated to the children's section of many a book store."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Humphrey Van Weydon is an affluent gentleman living in San Francisco during the early 1900's. Because of his inherited father's wealth, he hasn't had to work a day in his life, has gotten a first class education, and spends most of his time reading and discussing the latest novels. One foggy day as he travels across the bay to visit a friend there is a collision, and he is cast into the sea. After being rescued, he discovers that he is aboard a seal-hunting ship bound for Japan with a cold-hearted captain. This captain, known as the Sea Wolf, has no respect for Humphrey's money and decides to keep him aboard to be used for work in the galley. The Sea Wolf also has no respect for life, viewing it as fermenting yeast with the most brutal aspects of natural selection in play. He is a self-educated man and talks with Humphrey about life, philosophy, literature, et cetera. London describes their situation as \\"relations...between king and jester.\\" A gripping tale set on the high seas, this book will keep your eyes locked on Humphrey's changing life, and the Sea Wolf's deadly ways.I recommend this book because many things are taken for granted in today's rich American society, not least of which being the ability to stand on your own two legs. Most of the modern population depends on others for survival, and this dependence has made us weak. When Humphrey Van Weydon begins to stand on his own he goes through a considerable change, as most people do when faced with a crisis. This change can make or break someone, but like the old adage goes, \\"whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.\\" While this story is filled with suspense and amazement, the intriguing philosophical concepts arouse your mind and keep the gears turning. The Sea Wolf is an excellent novel, a classic in every sense of the word, and one that teaches much about the human struggle for survival and self-improvement."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Many consider The Sea-Wolf by Jack London to be among the best sea stories ever written. I found it a moving and epic tale. Not only did it achieve great popular and literary success, but it also was effectively realized in several cinematic versions (most recently as a TV mini-series). The story ranks in the great tradition of one of London's literary influences, Herman Melville, while I saw similarities to another story of a life changed by sea voyage, captured by Rudyard Kipling in Captains Courageous.Drawing upon his experiences seal hunting in the North Pacific, London created a story with a lot of realism. He put himself and his contradictory nature into the two opposing characters, the captain Wolf Larsen, a ruthless and rugged individualist, the superman, and Humphrey van Weyden, a weak, but highly cultivated and virtuous gentleman. It is in the clash of these two forces that London gives vent to his innermost struggles: idealism versus materialism, conscience versus instinct, desire versus soul."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"This is not a book that one easily forgets. True, you can read it as a simple adventure story of life on a turn-of-the-century seal-hunting schooner, but it is far more than this. It is essentially the story of Wolf Larson- and Wolf Larson is the entire mainstream of 19th and 20th century America in microcosm.Larson is no simple brute. He is, rather, a complex brute. He is a master of men and a master of the seas- but that is ALL that he is. Larson is an intelligent, driven, ruthless master of industry (in this case, seal hunting.) He has succeeded through his own abilities, hard work, and talent- or so he would have you believe. Truth is, brutal backstabbing, deception, exploitation, and disregard for the law has played an equal measure in his rise and dominance. You see, Larson believes in the rule of the jungle. He believes in it so much that he is driven to prove that this is all there is to existence. He must always seek to degrade and destroy anyone who seeks to rise above this state. This is also why he must disregard the possibility of the existence of a human soul. Larson is an intelligent, hard-nosed materialist that simply cannot conceive of anything beyond a social Darwinist hell of survival of the fittest. And Wolf Larson must be the fittest of them all. As much as money means to Wolf, it is really power over other beings- men and animals that means the most to him. Without this power to sadistically degrade and dominate others, the money would have no meaning. Ultimately that explains why he has risen to command his own vessel at all costs- he is a control freak that MUST be in absolute, totalitarian command of his whole world. This is why he only mans his ship with the lowest, most bestial types of human being, and does everything in his power to make them worse- not unlike many modern corporations. This is also why the sudden presence of a higher sort of individual, with ideals that transcend mere survival and materialism are so totally threatening to him.There are moments when one is almost tempted to sympathize with the Wolf as a champion of freedom- until you realize that in his sort of world his \\"freedom\\" means that everyone else must be a slave.Ultimately, the Wolf meets the inevitable fate in a world ruled like the jungle. When he loses his sight and strength, the monsters that he has surrounded himself with turn on him. In the last measure there is nothing great about Larson after all, for in facing death he proves to be a petty, murdering, weakling that would rather take all those around him down with him. It seems that despite his grand pretensions, he was no Lucifer at all, but merely a sick, pathetic, sociopath incapable of making the leap into being truly human."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The book is stupid.Don't read it.The plot basically involves a character named Hump (suggestive of London's sexual frustration?) who is verbose and stupid. Eventually he meets a girl and becomes monosyballic and even more stupid.The book is rife with technical detail about sailing, both boring and factually wrong. The author has the people doing things that one would not do (for example, in a heavy storm, the people tighten the sheets, resulting in a firm sail, which would in real life result in the boat capsizing ~ what they should have done is released one of the sails or rigged it half-mast). The boat is tedious for all of its verbosity and technical detail, which, ironically enough, adds nothing to the story and is factually wrong.London is an idiot. If I was not sure of it before reading this book, I am now. Fortunately, he realizes he is an idiot, and so roughly two thirds of this book consists of quotations from more successful, better writers.London repeatedly has the main character talk about how he loves the body of the capitan, and how he wants a relationship...seriously throwing the masculinity of the protaganist into question.Overall, this book offended me. It was so poorly written that my eyes hurt. I feel like my IQ dropped 40 points as a direct result of reading this drivel. Don't let it happen to you."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I can't say anything bad at all about this fine novel which exhibits great storytelling and wonderful characters. &quot;Hump,&quot; also known as Humphrey Van Weyden, a wealthy and sophisticated gentlemen, is forced to endure the hard life of a sailor after being thrown from his own ship.

It was one of the greatest finds of my life. The edition I read was from the sixties and still cost less than a dollar. I read the book in a week. Wolf Larson is Londons finest achievement. He is a man that believes there is no good in man. Just an insatiable hunger for more. This book really made me think &quot;Hey Jack London isn't that far off the mark.

He was not immoral, but merely unmoral.' For him, might is right and weakness wrong.The master's vision on the world and mankind\`Why should I be parsimonious with (human) life which is cheap and without value? There are more sailors than there are ships for them. On the land, you house your poor people in the slums of cities and loose famine and pestilence upon them, and that there still remains more poor people dying for want of a crust of bread and a bit of meat (which is life destroyed). Have you ever seen the London dockers fighting like wild beasts for a chance to work?'The challengeThe master's \`materialism' is challenged \`by the indomitability and moral grandeur of the soul' (conscience): \`Where was the grandeur of life that it should permit such wanton destruction of human souls?'The master's \`unmorality' (\`the culmination of all savagery') comes out of the dark through the eyes of a prefect anti-Nietzschean hero: a woman. At first, she is also fascinated by the barbarous force. But this fascination turns into terror. His \`unmorality' veils only destruction and auto-destruction.Evaluation and relevancyThe reign of the Nietzschean hero is forcefully and masterfully evocated, with now and then some outbursts of sensationalism (e.g. the shark incident). But, from the moment a girl makes her apparition, the quality of the novel sinks rapidly to the level of a \`better' three-penny love story. Superlatives are not enough; they have to be repeated: \`the finest product of the finest civilization'.The mentality of the barbarous hero continues to flourish in our \`civilized' world, where the powerful few show benign neglect for individual lives and kill wantonly via their long arms (army, intelligence services) all those who threaten their omnipotence and interests.Jack London wrote an integer, realistic, but not a perfect (sometimes too sentimental) masterpiece.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"A young attorney finds the life he has always known dissappears as the coast of California disappears in the fog.

Jack London had been my favorite author in my youth mostly because I like animals so much, and thus enjoyed his more creature focused books and shorts. The Sea Wolf introduces us to Wolf Larsen, possibly one of the five greatest characters I have encountered in all of my reading. I can't say that London paints Wolf Larsen as a realistic man because he is superhuman. He is a God, a Ghost, a Guru, an absolute master of his universe.Then the female comes in.The book simply goes to pot. What was building as a tense study of refinement versus the laws of survival simply disappears. The book goes out horribly.The book builds a vast resevoir of intensity and drama, but the dam never bursts. The water just flows back into the ocean. The incredible power of the first two-thirds of the book is forgotten.So in summary, read this book for the character of Wolf Larsen, and for the narrator, who London does a more than admirable job with. Then forget about the ending, and imagine for yourself what should have happened."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I truly enjoyed this book.

Are there those who supersede the expectations and requirements of living within a community? Do some men and women rise above the herd and rule with impunity, out of their own inherent power?Wolf Larsen fancies himself one of these men. The captain of the seal hunting vessel &quot;The Ghost&quot; believes he is above all the norms of socitey. He is one who is not handicapped by social graces or education. He is one who does not buy into the hope of religion or eternal life. Is he an existentialist... a materialist... a nihilist? Maybe he is all of these...?Wolf Larsen uses people and possessions in a way that suits him best. He gains his advantage by doing whatever he feels will advance his postion in the moment. Wolf Larsen is a self educated and self possesed person, wrapped up in himself and the power he seems to wield.Humphrey Van Weydon is swept up into the surging storm of all that Wolf Larsen is. Van Weydon is a pampered socialite who has spent his life in the comfy confines of wealth and academia. He is well read and has a good understanding of philosophy. But doesn't really have a great handle of the practical aspects of life. Where the rubber meets the road, in philosophical ideals, he is lacking.One day, as he is riding as a passenger on a steamer across San Fransisco bay, his life is changed in a heartbeat.The steamer collides with another ship and Humphrey is swept overboard. His next moment of conciousness is on the deck of the seal hunting ship, &quot;The Ghost&quot;. This ship is captained by the infamous superman Wolf Larsen. From this point on two very different... but similar worlds collide.Van Weydon and Larsen spend many days discussing life and how we are supposed to live it. More and more through discussion and observation Van Weydon, the refined socialite, discovers he is just like Larsen, the grizzled violent sea captain. It is interesting to watch Van Weydon's desensitization to violence and the law of &quot;might makes right&quot;. When Van Weydon begins his voyage he fancies himself above all the fighting and violence of the sailors. But as he progresses in this trip he realizes he is one of them. Humphrey finds he cannot help but be swept up into the violence, and see that it is just as much a part of the world he came from as it is aboard the ship.I enjoyed the book, but it does drag a little in places. The ending leaves a little to be desired. But if you like action and philosophical musings you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The Sea Wolf is a real classic. Jack London could put some amazingly descriptive sentences together."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"This is a kind of character study of extremes. The viewpoint of the story is the nice guy's, Humphrey, a literary critic who is propelled into a strange new world dominated by an extremely unnice guy, Wolf Larsen, captain of the sailing ship Ghost near the end of the sailing days. Via a shipwreck, 'Hump' becomes the cabin boy on the Ghost.The Wolf is an archtype of pure amoral power, but 'tainted' with the intellect to observe and describe his own situation. From that perspective Wolf finds it amusing to command and torment the crew of his vessel, and to play intellectual games with the &quot;Hump&quot;. Wolf uses and kills his crew members quickly enough, and promotes the cabin boy to mate after a failed mutiny. In the end the good guys prevail...Actually, there's lots of interesting detail in the story, and London is skilled enough at his writing craft, but I felt that overall it sort of fails. As a morality play, the favorable outcome is basically an accident. Actually, the most interesting character is only mentioned in passing--Wolf Larsen's brother, Death Larsen, captain of the steamship that attacks the Ghost. He's only vaguely portrayed as much nastier than Wolf, but apparently more successful, but we never get to meet him.

This is one of those books I remember reading back in high school and actually enjoying, so I thought I would pick it up again. It is every bit as good as I remembered. And so much more nuanced that I remember. There is a reason why this book is a classic. The main character, Wolf Larsen, is a fierce and fearsome character who holds so tightly to a Darwinian viewpoint on life. The strong survive only as long as they stay strong and it is their right to manipulate and observe what happens to the weak. And he holds unwaveringly to that viewpoint. That viewpoint leads him to deny anything after this life, almost anything useful in this life, and almost certainly anything useful in another person's life. Humphrey Van Weyden, his unwilling companion, holds the opposite viewpoint, that life, even the life of others no matter how weak they are, is worthwhile. No one should be manipulated. And, just like Larsen, he holds to this view so strongly that even when Larsen is in his power near the end of the novel he will not harm him.The two characters do not at all grow fond of each other, and that is as it should be for two characters of such differing viewpoints on life would not likely be friends. But they do fascinate each other. The debates they have with each other throughout the book are fascinating and absolutely spot-on. These are exactly what people with these various viewpoints would say, and what makes it even more interesting is that these two viewpoints are the two most often expressed in our American culture today. To see these two go at it is to see the two sides of American thinking war with each other. And both sides have valid points that cannot really be argued. Which are you going to side with? It becomes even more fascinating with the introduction of a woman into the story that both characters are attracted to. We all know that the woman is going to end up with the nice guy at the end, but just her presence leads the two men into a whole new line of arguments that is great to follow.Up to this point, Jack London's story is perfect. But then, in the last 20% of the book Van Weyden makes his escape and from then on the book is comparatively boring. Oh, but that first 80% of the book makes it all worth it. This commentary on culture is still relevant today over a century after it was written. It still seems fresh. It still seems to fit in perfect to the way we live our lives. Absolutely recommended!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Jack London is pretty famous for his adventure stories \\"White Fang\\" and \\"Call of the Wild,\\" but \\"The Sea Wolf\\" is less-well-known.

There are precious few books I would re-read, but re-reading this one and others is like listening to an old friend re-tell a story of his or her while we share a particularly pleasing libation and pick at some warmed cashews.

I found the first few pages rather cheesy, but very soon London's character of Wolf Larsen, a brutal and all-powerful sea captain, changed all that. I found him one of the most disturbing and forceful characters in all of literature--a sort of Hitleresque beast, yet created almost thirty years before anyone ever heard of Hitler.Contrasted with Wolf Larsen is the main character, appropriately named Humphrey, a wimp extraordinaire--who falls prey to the power and control of Larsen, and slowly learns to find himself and his strength in Larsen's midst. However, for maybe the first thirty or forty pages of their interaction, the book seemed a bit over-philosophical, almost teenage in its grand discussion of \\"life\\" and \\"morality\\" and \\"humanity\\" and \\"death.\\" But then, somehow, Jack London gripped me anyway, and his created world of ultra-violence and distorted masculinity, where physical strength and personal force are everything, became all-too-real, all-too-believable, and all-too-powerful. I couldn't put it down. Kudos to Jack London!Unfortunately, though, the book peters out in the last few chapters. I don't want to give away the ending, but suffice to say that I felt London just couldn't sustain the story. Yes, intellectually the ending works, but emotionally it doesn't. It turned wooden--and false. I found myself bored at the end, and I hoped that London would somehow redeem it. Alas, he didn't.But in spite of the cheesy ending the book is still unique--and a worthwhile read.

The narration angle was awesome, the characters very exciting, the event and scenery projected into my mind as I went from page to page was riveting. With all that, the most amazing thing about this book is that Mr. London could write an entire book about life at sea with a deranged captain and dinghy crew, actually draw you into that small vessel as if you were living, working, eating and sailing with those men, and yet not a single profane word.

Humphrey Van Weyden comes aboard the Ghost not ever completing an honest day of work. He had no legs of his own, always relying on some other person than himself. Wolf Larsen, the rugged captain, was a cold-hearted old man whose life was completely based on fishing. Work, to him, was the only way to survive. Although well educated, he had no common decency and beat his crew.Through the entire story, Wolf Larsen teaches Mr. Van Weyden about truly living and not having someone live for you. By the end of the novel, Mr. Van Weyden had learned to live his life to the fullest. He realized how fortunate he had been. Wolf Larsen was dreaded by his entire crew and did not have a single companion. He was a lonely man who didn't know how to communicate, and therefore resorted to violence. At the end of the story, he finds himself alone and extremely depressed. This is a novel of love, loss and growth which I would suggest reading.

Come to think of it, it's the only book I've ever read!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Not London's most famous story, and with reason, the Sea Wolf combines adventure narrative and commentary on life similar to some of London's other stories. Wolf Larson is a man with an indominatble will who would become a despot if given the chance. However, since the oppurtunity never arose, he must be content to rule over only his ship. While the people under his rule may be few, his power over them is complete. He is harsh, an atheist who views the human race as fermenting yeast. He is one of the strongest characters I have met in literature, and more dynamic than the others anyway. [I mean, Moby Dick's Ahab is strong-willed and rules his crew, but his character is one dimensional]. However, some of the key points in the story are difficult to believe, making the novel more surreal than London's other novels. So, while interesting and worth reading, I think Call of the Wild and White Fang are better written. I read this book when I was in eighth grade."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"As a psychological adventure novel, The Sea Wolf is the story of a writer, Humphrey Van Weyden shipwrecked in the ocean and rescued by the monstrous, brutal captain Wolf Larsen. Van Wedyen is soft, bookish character, and is astonished by the ugly strength and egoism of Larsen. Larsen forces Van Weyden to accompany the ship in its voyage across the ocean to hunt seals, and along the way he learns the toughness of nautical life, measured by the novel's repeated metaphors of callouses and scars on what were his soft, gentleman's hands, and what Larsen calls \\"standing on his own legs.\\"There is a weak romantic element tacked onto the story, when the crew rescues a from another shipwreck the poet Maud Brewster, a delicate aesthete and again a foil against Larsen's brutality. Brewster and Van Weyden fall in love in the course of their adventures but the book represses this until a last page kiss. Truly feeble.But the central failing is that this novel would have been better with a more interesting or believable antagonist. Although reviewers gush about the intensity of the character portrayal of Wolf Larsen -- really, he is not that interesting. Overly talky and one-dimensional despite that, Larsen spouts philosophical cliches (as does Van Weyden) as if he's in a late-night drunken argument in a freshman dorm room. Predictable, and his routine of menacing and bullying doesn't really shock as much as the author thinks it does.The novel's greatest strength is in the telling of the nautical adventure itself, the sailing of the schooner is wonderfully detailed and the descriptions of the techniques of seal-hunting quite interesting."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Great Jack London work. A nice departure from the Yukon. Very well written characters and progression through the tale."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"- nothing in the mind that did not pass through one of the five senses. This is the typical attitude of the 19th century scientific materialist. Wolf Larsen, the cruel captain of the ship on which the innocent gentleman, Humphrey van Weyden, is brought by a whim of destiny, is an amazingly strong and savage example of this attitude. An attitude that is still incredibly vivid in the 21st century. People who can't believe in or perceive anything that is non-substantial, out of reach of their sensual capabilities, find their strongest and most concentrated example in Wolf Larsen. From this viewpoint the world is nothing but a more or less differentiated chaos of 'the strong eats the weak' underpinned with some so-called fortifying philosophy and a (maybe misunderstood) Darwin.A bit disappointed i was that the author offered no guideline how to change the attitude of this kind of people, how not only to defend oneself against this dismal philosophy but maybe open a small crevice to the other-world for all the Wolf Larsen's out there. Probably everyone has to find out by oneself, everyone has to go through such a confrontation with this mental (and sometimes physical) crudeness and, if he doesn't perish in such an encounter, he might arise from it more strongly as Humphrey van Weyden, the sissyish gentleman-hero in this story, does.At any rate Jack London once again shows his talent to desribe the chemistry between people who seem to share nothing at all, the transformations of souls in a merciless environment, depicting souls which don't believe even in the existence of souls.chapter 3, p.24: A laugh went up at my appearance - ...a laugh that was as rough and harsh and frank as the sea itself that arose out of coarse feelings and blunted sensibilities from natures that knew neither courtesy not gentleness. / ...The eyes [of Wolf Larsen] ...They were eyes that masked the soul with a thousand guises... eyes that could brood with the hopeless somberness of leaden skies, that could snap and crackle points of fire like those which sparkle from a whirling sword, that could grow chill as an arctic landscape, and yet again, that could warm and soften and be all adance with lovelights, intense and masculine...chapter 5, p.44: \\"...By the way, do you believe in the immortal soul ?\\" - His lids lifted lazily as he asked the question, and it seemed that the deeps were opening to me and that I was gazing into his soul. But it was an illusion. Far as it might have seemed, no man has ever seen very far into Wolf Larsen's soul, or seen it at all; of this I am convinced. It was a very lonely soul, I was to learn, that never unmasked, though at rare moments it played at doing so.chapter 7, p.62: [Wolf Larsen:] \\"...Of course life is valueless, except to itself. And i can tell you that my life is pretty valuable just now - to myself. ...what is this condition in which i find myself ? This joy of living ? This exultation of life ? This inspiration, I may well call it ? It is what comes when there is nothing wrong with one's digestion, when his stomach is in trim and his appetite has an edge, and all goes well. It is the bribe for living, the champagne of the blood, the effervescence of the ferment, that makes some men think holy thoughts and other men to see God...\\"chapter 8, p.63f: ...I am convinced that he [Wolf Larsen] is the perfect type of the primitive man born a thousand years or generations too late and an anchronism in this culminating century of civilization. He is certainly an individualist of the most pronounced type. ...There is no congeniality between him and the rest of the men aboard ship. His tremendous virility and mental strength wall him apart. They are more like children to him ...Or else he probes them with the cruel hand of a vivisectionist, groping about in their mental processes and examining their souls as though to see of what soul-stuff is made.chapter 10, p.79: ...Knowing him, I review the old Scandinavian myths with clearer understanding. The white-skinned, fairhaired savages who created that terrible pantheon were of the same fiber as he. The frivolity of the laughter-loving Latins is no part of him. When he laughs it is from a humor that is nothing else than ferocious. But he laughs rarely; he is too often sad. / p.81: ..He was not immoral, but merely unmoral.chapter 16, p.121: [Wolf Larsen:]\\"... He is living more royally than any man for'ard, though he does not know it. For he has what they have not - purpose, something to do and be done, an all-absorbing end to strive to attain, the desire to kill me, the hope that he may kill me. Really, Hump, he is living deep and high. I doubt that he has ever lived so swiftly and keenly before, and I honestly envy him sometimes when I see him raging at the summit of passion and sensibility\\""},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The ship GHOST is not a tramp steamer, but rather a mercantile scooner under sail power.

The only thing he even lays claim to is his ship. Although he is so heartless and evil he and Van Weyden seem to get a connection, mainly of Van Weyden's fear of Larsen.

The book is superbly written, but for a book to be included in a list such as the Easton Press collection of &quot;The 100 greatest books ever written&quot;, it should be able to hold its own not only for style, but also for the tale itself, the &quot;myth&quot; behind it. The Sea Wolf does a fantastic job of building such a myth for about two-thirds of the novel. Then Ms Brewster appears, and suddenly the plot peters out. What begins as a gripping, sobering account of life at sea under a ruthless captain and a brutal crew, ends as a bland, unconvincing account of childish romance and &quot;survival&quot;. If London had only combined this book's literary richness with the heart-rending plot of The Call of the Wild or White Fang, he would be truly immortal."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"For those modern readers who find the second half of the book unsatisfactory, I ask you to ponder the following: Was Jack London inspired by the real-life characters of Sir John Franklin and Lady Jane (Griffin) Franklin and the events of the 1840's relating to the doomed expedition of the Canadian Northwest Passage? Were Wolf Larsen's headaches, psychological state, numbness, tingling and weakness symptoms of lead poisoning from the solder that sealed the Ghost's tinned food supply? Was Jack London trying to show Victorians how to survive in life-and-death situations instead of making the same mistakes as Franklin's well-read, materialistic crew who refused to give up their silver plates and crystal decanters after they were shipwrecked? Was London trying to show that even physical weakness, inexperience and lack of skill can all be overcome by cool-headed decision making, and an ability to adapt to novel and challenging situations?Wikipedia was used as a source contributing to the ideas expressed in this review."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The plot centers around a young aristocratic man Humphrey Van Weyden, who is shipwrecked and picked up by a passing boat heading to Japan to hunt seal. The boat is led by Captain Wolf Larsen, a cynical man free of any moral beliefs. The atrocities committed on this boat, the Ghost, shape Van Weyden into a new man, tougher and more in tune with reality. He is no longer \`Sissy' Van Weyden, he is a true man.The prevailing theme in this novel is the concept of life. Is it valuable, something to be guarded at all costs? Or is it valuable only to the one it belongs to? \\"'Do you know the only value life has is what life puts upon itself?'\\" Larsen asks. Van Weyden and Wolf Larsen have many conversations about morals and the point (or pointlessness) of life. Wolf Larsen is free of any of the bonds and conceptions of society. He realizes that life is fleeting, any achievement you make in the long run matters not. He uses the analogy of yeast to describe his views on life. \\"\`I believe that life is a mess...It is like a yeast, a ferment, a thing that moves and may move for a minute, an hour, a year, or a hundred years, but that in the end will cease to move. The big eat the little that they may continue to move, the strong eat the weak that they may retain their strength. The lucky eat the most and move the strongest, that is all.'\\". Van Weyden, on the other hand, has a hard time loosing his hold on the moral codes of society, and fights vainly for the concept of right and wrong. When asked what the value of life was, Van Weyden is speechless: \\"Value of life? How could I answer the question on the spur of the moment? The sacredness of life I had accepted as axiomatic. That it was intrinsically valuable was a truism I had never questioned. But when he challenged the truism I was speechless.\\" In the end, Wolf Larsen is eaten up by his own self, and in this way, Van Weyden's concept of life comes out on top.This story was told in the first person, from Van Weyden's point of view. London makes the story and characters very believable. His first-hand knowledge of sailing, the wealthy, and the working man provide an authentic feel. He draws you into the story with the right amount of detail and dialog. London describes Wolf Larsen's eyes as being \\"...that baffling protean gray which is never twice the same; which runs through many shades and colorings like intershot silk in sunshine; which is gray, dark and light, and greenish gray, and sometimes of the clear azure of the deep sea. They were eyes that masked the soul with a thousand guises...\\". The end of the book also had a very nice twist to it, when the most powerful man in the novel is reduced to depending on others to take of him."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"London's great sea adventure depicts an epic struggle between brute force and pampered entitlement. Its narrator, Humphrey Van Weyden, is a professional critic and the \\"Dean of American Letters the Second\\" (a sly reference to William Dean Howells). When the ferry across the Golden Gate span capsizes, Van Weyden is rescued from the ocean, and then kidnapped as an unwilling deckhand, by a schooner en route to the seal-hunting islands of Japan. The captain of the schooner, Wolf Larsen, is a despotic beast who scorns civility and whose idea of law is to serve his own power as dictator--his self-proclaimed \\"piggishness.\\"Like all of London's fiction, this novel is an allegory, and \\"The Sea-Wolf\\" is as much a philosophical treatise as it is a sea adventure. Against Humphrey's aristocratic pretensions and effete scholarship, London pits Wolf's vulgar blend of social Darwinism and primeval strength. \\"You would like to go back to the land,\\" Wolf argues, \\"which is a special place for your kind of piggishness. It is a whim of mine to keep you aboard this ship, where my piggishness flourishes.\\"There is much of this type of banter and didacticism (in a literary form abused to perfection later in the century by the likes of Ayn Rand and Robert Heinlein). Throughout these often one-sided debates, Wolf overwhelms the arguments of his captive opponent--and this in spite of the fact that London meant to portray the captain-tyrant as an example of the dangers of \\"the superman philosophy\\" as posited by Nietzsche. The tension that results as Wolf even gets the better of his author makes the captain the more interesting of the pair--and one of the most memorable characters invented for fiction.A shift occurs midway through the story, however, when the crew of the schooner rescues another castaway, the poet Maud Brewster, who is likewise held captive. It's easy to see why many readers and critics feel that the introduction of this \\"romantic interest\\" detracts from the tale; as a love story, it fails miserably (never more so than when they are shipwrecked again, on a desert island).On an allegorical level, however, it's a subversive and somewhat brilliant intervention. If Wolf exemplifies brute strength and Humphrey typifies unearned decadence, then Maud bowls over both worldviews as the representative of art and civilization: \\"Books and brains, and bravery,\\" as Wolf leeringly acknowledges in spite of himself; \\"a bluestocking fit to be the wife of a pirate chief.\\" Humphrey hardens under the labor of his duties, Wolf softens under the influence of his newly captured muse, and neither extreme suffices in the face of moderation. From this point, it doesn't take much to figure out who will win this three-way battle of wills."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"So imagine taking the real world brutality that London's wolves or dogs face in his Youkon novels. Now add that survival of the fittest and the most banal might make right themes from nature and apply them to a seafaring novel. That combination makes this novel.The main protagonist is the victim of a ferry shipwreck near San Fransico and is swept out to sea where he is picked up by Captain Wolf Larson's sealing vessel. Larson refuses to returm him or to let him board another nearby vessel heading into San Fransico and so he is forced to serve on the vessel. He is in every way the antithesis of the sealers: weak, educated, literary, and not accostomed to manual labor. Half the story is the growth of the protagonist into more of a \\"man\\" through his experiences.The genius of this novel however is in the character Wolf Larson, the ship's captain. He is stronger, meaner, and smarter than any other man he has met. By his own might he rules the ship. He is also well read and self educated, and his literary knowledge bonds the two main characters together. Larson takes the essence of nature, where the strongest rule and dominate, and applies it to man. Man is a part of nature and therefor not subject to any higher laws. Larson intimidates, beats up, murders, and takes any other measures of strength necessary to rule his vessel. In the end, even when he is dying and needs the protagonist to have any hope of escape, he still tries to commit murder to his would-be saviours. Why? Just to prove he still can. Its a brilliant study of humanity and a dichotomy of beliefs in the very nature of humanity versus nature.A must read for any fan of London, American literature, or just a very good read (like me)."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The Sea Wolf by Jack London tells the story of Humphrey Van Weyden, a literary critic, who is lost overboard and picked up by a seal hunting ship. Instead of returning the shivering man to 'civilization' Wolf Larson, the captain of the ship, forces Van Weyden to work aboard the ship cleaning pots and pans. Although this book has a lot of action and moves fairly quickly, the best parts were the dialouges between the self-educated captain and Humphrey. The captain, as Jack London puts it, is not moral or immoral but is just unmoral, or doesn't have set morals. He doesn't believe in a soul and believes in fulfilling desires. He says that if a man does good it is simply because his desire to do good outweighs the desire to do bad. Van Weyden does believe in the soul and the two man continually philosophize. Overall one of the themes is about the working class being subject to the 'higher' society. My only complaint is that the captain's personality seems to change from the first half of the book to the second half. Also, I happened to appreciate the captain's viewpoint when he was supposed to be the antagonist and wicked man. I don't think that was the author's intention so I hold that against him.

To his dismay, &quot;Hump's&quot; request to be put ashore are ignored. Instead he is held captive, put to hard labor, and made to suffer greatly under the brutal leadership of the fearsome Wolf.Wolf Larson is one of literature's most unique characters, and the mystery of what motivates him and what atrocities he'll commit next compel the reader on. He is not the stereotypical pirate ogre, but rather a well-read, deep-thinking intellectual whose best thoughts justify--in his mind--his callous behavior. He is a firm believer in natural selection and survival of the fittest. On the Ghost, he is at the top of the food chain.As the months pass, Hump is changed by the sea and physical exertion, earning 1st mate status. After plenty of excitement and drama, the plot twists when Maud Brewster, a beautiful young writer, is rescued from a lifeboat adrift a following a storm. Hump is smitten, but so is Wolf. The story plays out well to climax, with classy prose and the best description of sailing I've ever read. A good choice for all adventurers and anyone who loves the sea. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I found myself surprised by how much I enjoyed this story out of a Jack London collection that I recently picked up. Not being familiar with this novel before, having only readTHE CALL OF THE WILDandWHITE FANGpreviously, I didn't really know what to expect with this one. An adventure story was what I was looking for, but I got much more than that. Rather than providing the simple pleasure of following one of London's wonderfully imagined characters through a life-threatening and horizon-expanding adventure, this book provided an intensely thought inspiring look into the human psyche that I won't soon forgot.Published at a time when 'social Darwinism' was just beginning to be thoughtfully and rationally spelled out as far as how it affects and guides our lives and those around us, THE SEA WOLF uses its characters to explore the ramifications of that school of thought. Humphrey van Weydon is the protagonist of this book and presents a less-than-appealing hero in his weakness, dependency, and fear. The antagonist, Wolf Larson, is the unyielding, strong, rational, and brutal sea captain whose brutality simply cannot have a place in a civilized world. As these two drastically different characters clash over everything from human rights to self appreciation to the existence of an afterlife, the reader is treated to a wonderful exposition of what it means to live and what our social positions/obligations should be. Most likely, you'll find yourself sometimes agreeing with both characters' viewpoints from time to time, making this book fun to read for more than just an adventure tale.While it is undeniable that Wolf Larson represents much of what is abhorrent and violent about primal man, most readers will find themselves very attracted to him throughout this book. Something about the self-reliant, individualist, materialist, survival-of-the-fittest attitude and way of life is pleasing to the 'self-made' man. While we cringe at the thought of needless cruelty to others, much of the Wolf's philosophical rantings ring true. Whether London wished to show that the unsympathetic pure materialist has no place in modern civilization or that bringing good ideas (like Individualism) to their extremes can be disastrously evil, he succeeded in creating one of the most intriguing and memorable characters I've ever come across.On the other extreme is the narrator of the story, Humphrey. Here we have a weakling intellectual that has 'stood on his father's legs' his whole life and apparently couldn't look out for himself if his life depended on it. To both his surprise and the reader's, it turns out that when it really comes down to it, he can. Brutally encouraged by Wolf to 'man-up', 'Hump' finds a strength (and eventually a self respect) that he never knew he had. Here we have the civilized and progressive literary critic (ouch!) being cast into an extremely uncivilized environment and learning that what he understood about the human condition doesn't exactly hold true. More familiar, and thus less intriguing, his character eventually comes to represent the triumph of civilization and moral superiority over dog-eat-dog barbarism.Anyway, in my mind, this work actually surpasses THE CALL OF THE WILD and WHITE FANG as far as intellectual stimulation, and I am surprised that it is not more popular. Very highly recommended for all readers!!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I first read THE SEA WOLF at age 12, 40 years ago, and thought it was terrific, for all the reasons mentioned in other reviews: the exciting sea story, the juxtaposition of the values of western civilization with those of the refined thug Wolf Larson, the growth of Hump Van Weyden into a strong and self-reliant man who can hold his own with both Larson and brute nature.When I reread it recently, I still found the basic situation on the Ghost compelling and primal. However, my reservations became stronger and stronger from the time Maud Brewster appeared until the end of the book. Jack London, the great recorder of basic conflicts between man and man, and man and nature, writes VERY unconvincingly about the relationships between men and women. Maud seems a completely artificial character constructed more as a literary symbol of refinement and whimsicality than as a human being.Some of it is ludicrous. In their escape from the Ghost, for instance, Maud and Van Weyden spend several weeks in an open boat, fighting for survival and never once performing an excretory function. They're too delicate for that. When they finally make it to a North Pacific desert island, Hump builds Maud a stone hut as shelter then, exhausted and facing the possibility of dying of exposure, sleeps outside himself. In sum, Jack London, one of the all-time greatest naturalistic writers, perpetrates a great deal of Victorian self-censorship.The symbolic scheme plays out when Larson shows up too, wrecked on the very same island somewhere in the wide, wide, wide reaches of the world's largest ocean, so Maud and Hump can witness his physical disintegration at first hand.I'm a great fan of London's shorter works, the stories of both the far north and the south seas. He is a terrific storyteller, and it's borne out in the first half or two-thirds of THE SEA WOLF. But the concluding portion of this book is a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Jack London was one of the greatest authors America has ever known. It's ironic that because of his dog-centric books that he is often written off as a children's author. I once made the mistake of taking a collection of his short stories on a vacation. Great stories, but among the most depressing, violent, cruel concepts ever put to paper. A poor fit with frozen drinks and palm trees.The Sea Wolf is one of my favorite books largely on the basis of the villian, Wolf Larsen. He stands unique among villians in that he is huge, powerful, intelligent, ambitious, aggressive, with no muzzle of a conscience. He is omnipotent. Absolute power corupting absolutely. He is not a dumb brute that our intellectual hero outwits or outworks. Were it not for the peripheral factors of his even more destructive brother, or his failing health, he would have remained the master of his domain. I would expect that this Alpha male nature of Larsen that led London to name him Wolf.One of the biggest casting crimes ever committed by Hollywood was the casting of E.G. Robinson as Wolf and then remaking it with Bronson many years later (apparently based on having watched the original movie without really understanding the book)."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Parts of the book reminded me of Conrad and others, Milton. London creates an ugly force and sets it on a fishing boat as Captain. This Captain a sailing, fishing, toruring and ing, while defying the odds to live on and torment even after his targets thought they were in safe harbor. The captain is too smart for his own good and his men are very stupid for his own good. Within this sea of &quot;evility&quot; stumbles a neutral force that evolves as &quot;good&quot; as it fights the &quot;evil&quot; captain using brains rather than braun. He saves a damsel in distress along the way filling the romance narative (which seems a tad clumsy in parts). Well developed characters facing their nightmares on a ship with a Tin Angel at the helm. No, this isn't just another sea adventure like &quot;ThePerfect Storm&quot; with more deveolped ships than characters. Read this when you have time to ponder human nature, the battle of good and bad on seas that can be placid and flat as glass or whipped up by a whirlwind into 30 foot swells."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The book is a classic study of two characters - the Luciferian captain Wolf Larson, and the gentleman-turned-neophyte-sailor Humphrey Van Weyden. As Hump learns to survive the brutal conditions aboard Larson's ship, the Ghost, he grows from a soft academic type to a strong and resourceful survivor. Larson, the captain, is presented as a monster with no regard for human life. Larson is intrigued with Hump and engages him in philosophical discussions, but absorbs none of Hump's basic goodness. As Hump develops into a man, Larson degenerates into a blinded, diseased, pitiful creature. Hump overcomes his adverse conditions and even finds love, while Larson self-destructs. The adventure aboard the vessel is described in vivid detail, and the author clearly knows sailing. A wonderful story!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Despite being nearly one hundred years old, \\"The Sea Wolf\\" reads like a modern adventure thriller, only with more formal English vocabulary and sentence structure.The book opens breathlessly, like you are flipping TV channels and happened upon a spectacular action set piece, with Humphrey Van Weyden involved in a sea accident/capsize, and \\"rescued\\" by a passing sealing schooner, helmed by the title character, Wolf Larsen.Immediately, the reader is placed within the sealing vessel itself, and as Van Weyden is clueless about the sea, so are we. His experience is our tutorial. We learn the harrowing lifestyle of the sealing industry circa 1900 (the author having personal experience, reportedly).The claustophobic details of the ship contrast the vastness of the sea. The more cerebral \\"Hump\\" (as he's called) is alone amongst the id-like crew. Furthering my Psych 101 analogy, Larsen appears to espouse the benefit of the primal, yet does so with an eloquence that betrays any sort of simple association. The fact that he is well-read and speaks thoughtfully (if heartlessly) suggests the reason he is the \\"leader\\" of said crew, and a successful seaman, may lie in the understanding and control of instinct, impulse, nature.Anyways, that is probably a lot of folderol. What you have is a struggling protagonist, an evil slavedriving captain, plenty of duplicitous henchmen, and halfway through, a pretty maiden.There are a half-dozen or so amazing seagoing escapades (and I didn't understand one lick of all that \\"jib\\", \\"topmast\\", \\"poopdeck\\" stuff...nor did it matter...) and finally an extended Crusoe-like sequence on an island to tidy things up.Seriously, this deserves every accolade thrust upon it. It has been named \\"one of the 100 greatest books\\", and a \\"literary classic\\", and a \\"masterpiece of American literature\\"...whatever.It's simply a great read. You'll kick yourself for waiting so long to have read it.I did."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"THE SEA WOLF is a fast-moving tale of adventure on the high seas and should entertain anyone who enjoys non-stop action. Of course, the novel offers something more, too, for it paints a very unusual portrait of Wolf Larsen, captain of the seal hunting schooner Ghost. At first blush, one may be tempted to categorize Larsen as the \\"bad guy,\\" the antagonist in the story, and Humphrey van Weyden as the protagonist hero, but let's not be too hasty in our characterizations.Larsen, for all of his cruelty, is the absolute realist in this book. His philosophy is that of utter pragmatism. He is the one who can bring the ship through the worst of storms. He is the one whose physical strength is that which is customarily associated in a reader's mind with a heroic figure. If he has a flaw, perhaps it is his absolutism, for there is no room in his mind for the relativism of what we call ethics and morality, yet his logic in rejecting such concepts is unarguable when seen from a perfectly objective viewpoint. And let us not forget that it is he who causes van Weyden to grow into a survivor.As for Humphrey van Weyden, while it is he around whom the entire story revolves, he is not a traditional hero figure by any means. When we first meet him, he is very nearly as absolute as is Larsen but in the opposite direction, for he knows nothing whatever about the world and its realities, and has, as Larsen puts it, \\"stood on his father's legs\\" rather than his own. He is immersed in the world of bookish philosophy, has no need to work for a living, has other people to handle his financial affairs, and writes literary criticisms. He is as unrealistic as Larsen is pragmatic.Both of the main characters, then, represent extremes. Van Weyden, however, does learn to adapt, to grow, to become more decisive, and to survive. Larsen does not and is eventually destroyed by the universe that he has always viewed as amoral and uncaring (thus proving himself entirely correct in his assessment of it). The universe, of course, works through some mysterious malady of Larsen's that is foreshadowed and hinted at throughout the story by his debilitating headaches. But is it not ironic that Larsen's malevolent absolutism is the catalyst for van Weyden's maturation? In brief, I cannot brand Larsen with a label of pure antagonist or anti-hero, for his rationality is frequently refreshing and he does engender a positive outcome in van Weyden. Similarly, I cannot view van Weyden as a pure hero because. for too much of the story, he is thoroughly unrealistic in his views and expectations. Both characters are complex in their respective ways.Modern readers may well be put off by London's portrayal of women, who are perceived as weak and in need of protection, although Maud Brewster does prove to be stronger and more resolute than the reader initially suspects. Perhaps more off-putting is van Weyden's paralysis--his total inability to act against Larsen when he repeatedly has the opportunity--because his sense of morality precludes such actions. The reader fairly wishes to scream at the man as he misses successive opportunities to remove Larsen as a threat to himself as well as to Maud. This, of course, is part of van Weyden's own moral absolutism and is totally in character for him even while it frustrates the reader.London's characters, while complex, are not as symbolic of broader concepts as are those of Joseph Conrad, a fine author of sea-based tales. I find London to be a somewhat shallower author and to place more emphasis on superficial action to develop his stories than does Conrad. Neither man is equal to Melville as an allegorist, yet both are superior to someone like Patrick O'Brian (adopted name of Richard Russ, English author of the Aubrey-Maturin series of seafaring novels who drowns the reader in nautical jargon and sometimes little else). If one likes fast action with an enticing leavening of unusual character development in an always-interesting and far-from-normal setting, he could do far worse than reading Jack London's works, and THE SEA WOLF is a gripping book with which to pass some hours of fascinating reading."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Absolutely loved this book!Humphrey Van Weyden is a 35 year old bookish man who has never had to stand on his own two feet. He almost drowns when the boat he is on collides with another in the San Francisco Bay, but is soon rescued by the Ghost and its captain, Wolf Larsen. Wolf is a Darwinian philosopher of sorts who has taken survival of the fittest to the extreme with his raw, wolf-like savageness. And this savageness, OH YES THIS SAVAGENESS, makes The Sea Wolf one hell of a read!Wolf exclaims \\"life was a ferment, a yeasty something which devoured life that it might live, and the living was merely successful piggishness. Why if there is anything in supply and demand, life is the cheapest thing in the world. There is only so much water, so much earth, so much air; but the life that is demanding to be born is limitless. Nature is a spendthrift. Look at the fish and their millions of eggs. For that matter, look at you and me. In our loins are the possibilities of millions of lives. Could we but find time and opportunity and utilize the last bit and every bit of the unborn life that is in us, we could become the fathers of nations and populate continents. Life? Bah! It has no value. Of cheap things it is the cheapest. Everywhere it goes begging. Nature spills it out with a lavish hand. Where there is room for one life, she sows a thousand lives, and its life eats life till the strongest and most piggish life is left.\\"Make no mistake that Wolf stays true to this philosophy.Meanwhile, Hump learns to stand on his own two feet in two significant ways - one seemingly unintentional. He unexpectedly becomes an intellectual playmate of Wolf's, which sort of buys him time from Wolf's brutality. Also, he overcomes extreme physical obstacles while on the Ghost and while trying to escape.During my elation while reading this book I became curious as to why it hadn't made it to the Novel 100 list by Daniel S. Burt or other similar lists. I was thinking 5 STARS! 5 STARs! The dialogue was wonderful and plentiful (in a good way). Wolf's character was amazing in a brutal and sordid way. I think most of us can relate to the fantasy of our primitive selves. Why not one of THE classics?Well it seems that some of the works referred to in The Sea Wolf are anachronistic and the story itself is considered \\"patchy\\". Patchy as in melodramatic (But this was funny and interestingggg....), philosophic debate (INTERESTING!), travelogue (Soooo?), and love story (Yeah...the love story was a bit cheesy. A famous female author just happens to be the one who washes up for the bookish Hump????)So, 4 stars because of the out of place references and all too convenient terms of the love story, but still, a thrilling read!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"What Jack London sought to depict in many of his short stories and novels was the realistic, unforgiving brutality associated with man and nature, and, in this regard, The Sea Wolf does not disappoint. The first conflict comes when Humphrey Van Weyden is rescued by a boat after an accident, but little does the protagonist know what he is truly in for, as he will experience a figurative Hell for a good deal of time on board the Ghost. Juxtaposed by Wolf Larson, a character inspired by Milton's Lucifer in Paradise Lost, Van Weyden, a simple \\"bookish\\" literary man of thirty-five, must transform in order to sustain a barbaric and eye-opening ride.Perhaps what separates Wolf Larson from your prototypical villain is that there are moments where Van Weyden can see the philosophical, profound, well-read side of the captain. While the two are as far apart as any two characters can be in their beliefs, backgrounds, or physical appearance, they seem to be on a parallel plane when it comes to their talks about Man's existence, despite the fact that they \\"agree to disagree\\" on these various subjects.The book's most prevalent theme is survival--physically and psychologically. Van Weyden transforms himself somewhat in order to exist, yet he is not consumed by the savagery he witnesses aboard the Ghost. While he has a hard time acting on instincts, there is one point where there is a revolt from Larson in his conscience, which separates any notion that he will give in: \\"Wolf Larson it was, always Wolf Larson, enslaver and tormentor of men, a male Circe and these his swine, suffering brutes that groveled before him and revolted only in drunkenness and secrecy. And was I, too, one of his swine? ...No!...I would work my will through it all, in spite of Wolf Larson...All would be well.\\" Yet, ironically, much of what Van Weyden learns from what he witnesses from Larson and the other men is critical in his survival later on.Another impressive element is London's command of description and detail. He has a way of illustrating a moment of peril, or foreshadowing, or profiling a character. One example is Van Weyden's commentary while looking out to see, while thinking about the Ghost's fate: \\"I, too, leaned upon the rail and gazed longingly into the sea, with the certainty that sooner or later I should be sinking down, down, through the cool green depths of its oblivion.\\" The protagonist seems to know that something is amiss with the Ghost, and, like Melville's Pequod in Moby Dick, there is an ominous feeling on doom on board.One criticism is the later part of the novel, where it gets a little too romanticized and lovey-dovey with Maud and Humphrey. It just seemed a little too forced. Some of the parts seemed to lag a little also towards the end, and the descriptions got a little too detailed about how to prepare a vessel for voyage off of Endeavor Island.Still, over all, it was an impressive read. If you're looking for a book about courage and survival, then this is a great book to check out!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The book that I read was The Sea Wolf by Jack London. The story is about sailors that are out trying to carry cargo to a nearby port and then a lot of different things begin to happen. The book kind of starts out slow and then begins to pick up and gets better by the middle of the book. There are a lot of places in the book that it is going strong and then it cuts out and ends up getting weaker. Even though there are some weak spots if you keep with it, it will be worth the long wait. It is also a good book because it deals with real life crises that would really happen aboard a boat in the 1950's.The book would be great for someone who loves adventure books. This book takes place on the open water the whole story. It involves hunters, cooks,The strengths in this book are that there are a lot of details. Some of the detail that Jack London puts into the story gives you pictures in your head and you also kind of feel like you are leaving your seat and are actually in the story. Also that there is a great deal of understanding and you never feel that you are lost in the book you always know where you are. The detail is very specific sometimes you can feel like you are touching the exact same that that some of the other characters.Then some of the weaknesses that were in the story were that some of the words that he chose had really nothing to do with what he was explaining or trying to say. Even when it would be a really strong statement that he is making it would be strong then all of a sudden it would be weak and you would kind of forget what he is talking about. Also if you felt like you were in the story then you would leave your imagination and go back to reading it because it would be so boring.In conclusion the book should be for people who like adventures and suspense. The book overall was very good has a lot of detail and would have been even better if their were not so many weak spots. People would enjoy this book no mater what age group you are. Over all you should at least try it out and then make a decision"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"i think that this book isn't what i thought it would be. being a 13 year old, i had to read this book for school. i bought this book thinking that it was great after reading the back of the book and the reviews here at amazon.com. when i read the book, my classmates and i talked about how boring the book was and that it had no climaxing plot or any interesting points. then again this is just a point of vie of a some teenagers. to me, i wouldn't suggest this book to any teenager i know."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I have to read this book for summer vacation.

I stress the word ALLEGEDLY. Jack London was a notorious womanizer. He was married twice and cheated on both wives. Yet his female characters are very bland and deprived of any kind of sexual appeal. Yes, London had mated with many women. But he did not understand women. He suffered from the infamous Madonna-Whore complex. There were those \\"disposable\\" women in bars and seaports, whose names he never bothered to remember. And then there were women like his second wife Charmian Kitteridge, whom he deified. Charmian served as the prototype for his Maud Brewster. Jack London uses very reserved, proper diction to describe the physical attributes of Maud Brewster. She comes across as a well-preserved old maid, a cold Dresden doll. London concentrates on her pale face, frail figure and soft hair. There is no mention of her hips or breasts. You don't see any skin below the neck. And then you go back and reread the passage in which Vay Weyden takes care of Larsen after the mutiny incident. The intense erotic language that the author uses while describing naked male body leaves no room for doubt - men were of more interest to him than women."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"The Sea wolf was a well written story of a writer in San Francisco named Humphrey. He was swept overboard a ferry and was rescued by a ship called The Ghost and for months dealt with the hardships of a violently abusive captain and untrusting seal hunters. But he also learned the way of sea life and how to stand on his own two feet for once. I found this book a pretty good read because of the story line and how this one character survived being on the ship with such a raw and violent captain. The only thing that I found hard to comprehend was the advanced vocabulary when the main character would describe something or someone, just because I didn&#8217;t know many of the words and it made me lose my spot in some parts.

The novel is a great adventure similar to all of the others of its kind (Moby Dick, Kidnapped, Treasure Island)but has a dark, sparkling gleam all of its own. I found this book to be a fascinating excursion into darkness. Even though it did evoke a lot of the feelings those books brought I found that it reminded me a lot of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness as well as Kipling's Captains Courageous. The character of Wolf Larsen has to go down as one of the greatest literary villains ever. Just when you thought he might be redeemable he goes one step further with his wickedness and even laughs about it! The book was full of Jack London's typical adventure prose and I often felt as if I were on the Ghost (Larsen's ship) and I could feel the cold of the ocean and wind as well as the pains the crew suffered aboard it. The book kept me at a nervous concern for the main protagonists. I knew everything would be fine but at times...Jack London's prose often surprised me as I read The Sea Wolf. Of course most of it was just like his other work (The Call of the Wild for instance or To Build A Fire) but there were occasionally brief extracts which made me feel that the story was written by someone more modern. I have to admit that Wolf Larsen's continuing drive into darkness made me think a lot of Conrad's evil madman and while Heart of Darkness may have won out on the actually darkness of the soul, The Sea Wolf wins for greatest brutality and cruelty. This is a novel you will enjoy if you like adventure on the high seas. Jack London will transport you onto the Ghost and you will feel the drama (and trauma) brought about by one of the vilest creations in all of literature. Do yourself a favor and read The Sea Wolf. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I will give my personal opinions and insights I gained from this book. You can read detailed plot summaries elsewhere.The most exciting aspect of London's writing here is his narration of Humphrey Van Weyden's thoughts, his psychological reactions to Captain \\"Wolf\\" Larson and the conditions he finds himself in aboard the Ghost. Larson is first introduced as an ubermensch-like caricature, a feared tyrant with superhuman strength. In the early parts of the book Larson is idolized for his ideals of toughness and self-reliance which are in stark contrast to Humphrey's pampered upbringing. He is feared and admired for his great strength, even while he is simultaneously hated for his extreme cruelty and pettiness. As the book progresses, Larson's complexity is slowly revealed through his interaction with Humphrey. It turns out that Larson, despite his brutality, is a brilliant self-educated man. Humphrey is the only person with enough education to have an intellectual dialog with the Larson, but Larson's newfound favoritism for Humphrey creates tension between Humphrey and the other crew members.Later on the more vulnerable side of Larson emerges. He is afflicted with severe headaches and bouts of depression. At the same time the social Darwinist microcosm he created on board the Ghost begins to backfire on him. Needless violent conflicts, uprisings, and acts of mutiny are common. The only thing that unites the crew is their shared fear and hatred for Larson.Later Humphrey finds companionship with an educated writer, Maud, who happens aboard the ship. They fall in love and together decide to escape to an island. Humphrey's relationship with Maud and their struggle to survive causes Humphrey to re-evaluate his stance on individualism somewhat. It's shown that love and empathy can also be a source of strength that enhances the will to survive.Towards the end of the book the Ghost washes up on the island. Larson's crew has abandoned him and he is seen going mad. He is afflicted with a brain tumor and dies in front of Humphrey. Though not explicitly stated, I got the impression that the brain tumor could be an explanation for Larson's sociopath tendencies. Larson's lack of empathy is a weakness, not strength as originally assumed.Anyways, these are my insights. I can't give 5 stars because though there are a few places where the story gets slightly bogged down. The portion of the book about Humphrey's love affair with Maud on the island could have been better. Also, some might not have patience for all the nautical detail. It's easy to skim past the slow parts though."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Jack London I only discovered over the past five years, which by all relative standards is very strange, since I studied creative writing in college, and was an avid reader of the classics as a youth. I despised the classics as a youth, :), but now appreciate most of them during my formative years of understanding literature and the novel.'Call of the Wild' certainly ingnited my senses to the prose power of London, and it was by an odd encounter and chance that a distant friend handed it to me in passing, that I discovered the magic talent of London and his epic sea story of 'The Sea Wolf.'Arguably, \\"Wolf Larsen\\" is one of the greatest characters in literature. He is vibrant, total, fitting for the role in which he is written; belivable, enigmatic and actually quite charming in that raw sense of hostility.However even though Wolf slowly descends into the abyss of madness, he has the mental capacity to be childlike and endearing. In this passage in particular...{\\"Wolf Larsen underwent another bad attack of headache which lasted two days. He must have suffered severely, for he called me in, and obeyed my commands like a sick child...at my suggestion, however, he gave up smoking and drinking; though why such a magnificent animal as he should have headaches at all puzzles me.\\"}...we see an almost patent adolescence in Wolf, and London paints the potrait of the ironclad rascle, as human, with emotions and tenderness that even in the rank hollowness of declamation and ruthlessness, we can see a yearning for sympathy.That is magical.This is one to give to grandkids, your own kids, or to share with others. It holds a special place in my heart this book, and on my shelf next to \\"Master and Commander.\\"Thank you."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Although the time frame of this book is set in the 1700's, the language used makes the book so masterful. It should not be read by people with a low reading skill, as it can be hard to understand in some parts, which is what makes it such a interesting book. After reading a page or two so much can be analyzed. For instance, in the end of the book it can be similar to the movie Cast Away. The same scene takes place and two of the main characters are fighting for their lives. The novel is full of adventure and action takes place constantly. It may be epic fighting scenes or terrific storms, but know matter what this novel will keep you reading on edge."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"This very powerful story about a brutal sea captain and the effect that his depravity and evil have on anyone that he is in contact with is a true adventure story as well. Jack London knew how to tell a story, and this book is a page-turner. Not only that, it has some of the best descriptions of sailing one of the old \\"tall ships\\" I've ever read. There is a chapter in the book that is a superb description of sailing one of these ships in a bad storm. Mr. London's descriptions of this and other catastrophic events at sea is so realistic that the reader sees it all as he or she reads it. London's political ideology does show through in spots. London was a firm believer in Socialism, and he does put forth these ideas at times in the book. His villain - Wolf Larsen, is the most evil man you'll ever encounter between the covers of a novel. The development of Humphrey from an ineffectual, bookish type of man, to a man that can subsist on his own wits and by the actual use of his own hands is the common thread that runs through the book. Even though he is in close proximity to the evil Larsen, Humphrey does not let Larsen's depravity change his own morals and his own essential goodness."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"This book differs somewhat from London's other novels. One thing that is great for a younger reader is that the book is written through the main character's perspective, which makes understanding him easier for the reader. The events that occur in the first 100 pages come fast one after the other leaving the reader wondering what could possibly come next, and then to me as well as some other reviewers the novel begins to slow down especially with the entrance of the female. Overall the story is great and the characters are easy to understand, and London's writing style makes it simple to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I thought there was wonderful character development. London made me feel as if I actually knew the people as well as he did. He used fantastic visual imagery and if I closed my eyes I could see the action take place. He used many sailing terms I was unfamiliar with and to more thoroughly enjoy the book I would suggest any reader brush up on sailing vocabulary and parts of a sailing vessel."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Humphrey van Weyden is a gentleman. He has never had to work for his living, or do a single task for himself. All that changes when the ferry-steamer Martinez, running across the mouth of the San Francisco Bay, is wrecked after a collision with another boat in the fog. Van Weyden is tossed into the sea, and eventually picked up by another boat. But this is no ordinary boat. It is the Ghost, a seal-hunting schooner captained by Wolf Larsen, who is far from being an ordinary man. He snickers at Van Weyden's offers of money in exchange for taking him to shore, and instead conscripts the unfortunate man to replace a recently-deceased member of the Ghost's crew. Van Weyden's trials encompass far more than merely learning how to work on a ship. He must also find his place in the strange web of heirarchy among the men. More precarious yet is his relationship with the captain.We soon find out that Wolf Larsen is a monster of a man, possessing superhuman strength and a complete lack of deference to any idea of morals. He is certainly one of the most fascinating characters I've come across in my reading. You fear him, you hate him, and yet there is still something to admire about him. He commands respect. He can kill a man with the strength of his hands alone, but he is also something of a self-educated philosopher. He has clearly studied Darwin, and continually likens life to a ferment of yeast, in which the natural way of things is for the stronger to consume the weaker. And yet, despite Larsen's superhuman image, London manages to keep him plausible for the reader by giving him his own Achilles's heel, which becomes more and more apparent as the story progresses. \\"The Sea-Wolf\\" is worth reading for a character study of this man alone. Unfortunately, however, the second half of the book shifts its focus, losing sight of the Van Weyden-Larsen relationship and simultaneously losing much of the driving force behind the story.Almost as soon as Maud Brewster entered the story, I began to lose interest. Shipwrecked and adrift in a small boat, she is picked up by the Ghost much as Van Weyden was. She, too, is refused passage to land. And inevitably, a romance develops between Brewster and Van Weyden. The story makes an abrupt change in course from one of survival and complex relationships between the ship's men, to that of a love story. But what a silly and unconvincing love story it is! London just doesn't write women well, nor does he make the relationship between Van Weyden and Brewster in any way believable. Maud is a flat character, and just doesn't seem real. She is also full of ridiculous contradictions. She is alternately described as a frail lily and a cavewoman. She bestows the name of Lucifer on Wolf Larsen, but turns all to pity and mush the moment he is struck by one of his headaches. The story would have been much better with romance left out and the focus kept on Van Weyden's personal struggle with Larsen.The strength of this book definitely lies in its first half. London's writing is strong and vivid, and he does a superb job of capturing the nuances of each relationship between crew members. I only wish he had stuck to that. Every writer has his niche, and London's is not in the romance genre. The second part of the book is contrived, predictable, and does little to hold one's interest. The ending is dissatisfying. It is, however, worth finishing in order to discover what end comes to the aforementioned Wolf Larsen. This is the only element of the latter part of the book that really intrigued me. So read \\"The Sea-Wolf\\" for its adventure component, found in the first half, and read it for the wonderfully crafted character of Captain Larsen. But don't expect too much out of the latter half and its conclusion."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"This is not a book that one easily forgets. True, you can read it as a simple adventure story of life on a turn-of-the-century seal-hunting schooner, but it is far more than this. It is essentially the story of Wolf Larson- and Wolf Larson is the entire mainstream of 19th and 20th century America in microcosm.Larson is no simple brute. He is, rather, a complex brute. He is a master of men and a master of the seas- but that is ALL that he is. Larson is an intelligent, driven, ruthless master of industry (in this case, seal hunting.) He has succeeded through his own abilities, hard work, and talent- or so he would have you believe. Truth is, brutal backstabbing, deception, exploitation, and disregard for the law has played an equal measure in his rise and dominance. You see, Larson believes in the rule of the jungle. He believes in it so much that he is driven to prove that this is all there is to existence. He must always seek to degrade and destroy anyone who seeks to rise above this state. This is also why he must disregard the possibility of the existence of a human soul. Larson is an intelligent, hard-nosed materialist that simply cannot conceive of anything beyond a social Darwinist hell of survival of the fittest. And Wolf Larson must be the fittest of them all. As much as money means to Wolf, it is really power over other beings- men and animals that means the most to him. Without this power to sadistically degrade and dominate others, the money would have no meaning. Ultimately that explains why he has risen to command his own vessel at all costs- he is a control freak that MUST be in absolute, totalitarian command of his whole world. This is why he only mans his ship with the lowest, most bestial types of human being, and does everything in his power to make them worse- not unlike many modern corporations. This is also why the sudden presence of a higher sort of individual, with ideals that transcend mere survival and materialism are so totally threatening to him.There are moments when one is almost tempted to sympathize with the Wolf as a champion of freedom- until you realize that in his sort of world, his \\"freedom\\" means that everyone else must be a slave.Ultimately, the Wolf meets the inevitable fate in a world ruled like the jungle. When he loses his sight and strength, the monsters that he has surrounded himself with turn on him. In the last measure there is nothing great about Larson after all, for in facing death he proves to be a petty, murdering, weakling that would rather take all those around him down with him. It seems that despite his grand pretensions, he was no Lucifer at all, but merely a sick, pathetic, sociopath incapable of making the leap into being truly human."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Jack London had in fact sailed on ships like the Ghost. This is one reason that the portraits of the sailors are so accurate. Also, it's why the storm episode rings so true. The book is worth reading for those reasons alone. London's own struggles with philosophy and ideas seem to be voiced by Wolf Larsen."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"&quot;The Sea-Wolf&quot; by Jack London is about a young man who is forced to work on a sealing schooner after he is rescued from a ferry accident. The title comes from the captain of the schooner whose name is Wolf Larson. Larson is a cruel and brutal man who, while on his ship, lives by his own rules. His morals are very shallow and he places little, if any, value on others' lives. The story continues in portraying the life of Humphrey, the young man, and how he copes with the brutality of sea life and how he adapts to their way of life. Later on in the story a new angle comes in when the sealing schooner picks up a lost boat and brings abourd a female. The men don't often encounter females seeing that their work is hard and they are out on their hunting trips most of the year. So this brought a whole new perspective and the men didn't know how to act. Larson, on the other hand, didn't change much. Humphrey got to know the woman and became attracted to her for she was much like him interest wise. So one night, when everyone was asleep, Humphrey and the woman, Maud Brewster, secretly got into one of the hunting boats and escaped the ship in the fog. After they were on the tiny boat for a long time they began to doubt themselves and their survival. But then they spotted an island and landed there. They made their own shelter and killed seals, like the hunters did, for food. Then one morning they awoke to find the dreaded Ghost docked at their beach. They were terrified, but soon learned that the ship's crew had abandoned ship and only Larson was left. Larson had been inflicted with a horrible disease and he went blind and his body slowly began to deteriorate. After he died Humphrey and Maud repaired the Ghost and sailed back to the mainland. I personally liked this story very much because it was interesting and it kept my attention. It made me want to keep reading the story to find out what obstacle that Humphrey had to overcome next. It had a great plot and I'd recommend it to anybody."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Jack London relates a probing analysis of the captain of the sealing ship Ghost, Wolf Larsen, through the eyes of shipmate Humphrey Van Weyden. Van Weyden had been plucked from the freezing waters of San Francisco bay by Larsen after the ferry boat he was a passenger on, capsized after a collision in the fog. Larsen, ever the opportunist, forces Van Weyden to work on the ship. Van Weyden a book critic and \\"gentleman\\" has never done a days work in his life.Through the insights of Van Weyden we see the cruel, combative, physically imposing and yet highly intelligent Larsen act as if a god over his domain, the Ghost. He holds the fate of his crew in his hands and murders those who he deems unfit. Under the tutelage of Larsen, Van Weyden becomes a capable sailor. After 5 more castaways are rescued at sea including a woman, Maud Brewster, Van Weyden and the woman make their escape by stealing a sealing boat. Van Weyden and Brewster are to fall in love and are stranded on a deserted island. Through a quirk of fate they are again confronted by Larsen, who is marooned and shipwrecked on the same island. There they observe his ultimate and deserved demise.The book was tied up into too neat a little package for my taste. London spends an awful lot of time, and boringly so, on his philosophies of life. I was hoping for another Moby Dick and was disappointed."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"A Review by BrianThis book is about The Ghost, a ship, whose captain&#65533;s name is Wolf Larson and another man named Humphrey Van Wyden. They are the captain and first mate of the Ghost. They were traveling to San Francisco from somewhere in Europe. On the way lots of things happen to them. Maud, a lady on the ship with Wolf and Humphrey, was a cook and was always kept warm by two thick blankets at night.I didn&#65533;t like the action because there isn&#65533;t a lot of it in this book. If there was more action it would be a lot better of book. Without a lot of action books aren&#65533;t as good as they could be.Something I really liked about this book was the dialogue. It was like old English. It made the book seem more of a medieval type of book. Another thing I really liked was that I was real easy for me to read. I thought that the old English made the book a lot better and made it easier to read.I would recommend this book anyone who likes books about people traveling on boats across oceans and seas to another place."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"There was Burt Lancaster as Wolf Larson and Lawrence Olivier as Hump. (There have been several screen versions, none of them featuring my cast members.) I enjoyed the book but imagine it would have been written a bit differently today.

But the first English course was an Honors class and the second was an Accellerated course. The first class understood the book, as did I. The second course, the class had a good idea, but for the most part found the book boring and without meaning. My main comment is that this book shouldn't be taught on an Accellerated level. But I thought the book was alright."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"This book was wonderful. Started out with a bang.. Ended up very different from what I expected. Although I do agree Maude's character was a little unbelievable at times, still a lovable book with a wonderful budding romance. A good book to make you think about things. I was cheering for Humpf the whole time!"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"This was an overall good story. The plot was okay, but I would it boring. I was one who likes to read books that have some action. This book has the action but seems to lack suspense. For those of you who do not care for a book with description, don't read this. This book has a lot of description, character and plot. Don't look for intriguing plot or simplistic description. This book has quite a bit of underlying theme. It deals with work ethic, individualism, ideals, and materialism. Jack London, as a American writer, puts many thematic characteristics of American literaure into this book. In summary, if you are interested in literature, I suggest you read this book. You will probably enjoy it much more than I did, for I am in college in a Themes in American Literature (Advanced) class."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Contrived in spots, but includes some great stuff, and his portrait of Wolf Larsen is a first-rate study of a true sociopath."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I have to read it now"},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"I didn't know anything about Jack London or The Sea Wolf, but I knew the story was set in a nautical setting so I decided to read it. The story started off very exciting but then slowed down to a near crawl for most of the middle. There never was really any climax what so ever; I was looking for it the entire book but never found it. The plot was very predictable. I knew exactly what would happen the entire time which really ruined it for me. The ending was very cheesy and predictable. The protagonist is basically a wuss, and his extremely feminine viewpoint and talking style quickly became irritating. The book is LITTERED with nautical and sailing terms and half the time I didn't know what the narrator was talking about. The book isn't the best read I've experienced. I'll probably be staying away from Jack London from now on."},{"Title":"The Sea Wolf","review":"Other reviewers have given plenty of descriptions, so I won't bother.

Despite the claim that the book is 948 pages long, its printed length is actually 435 pages, which is still plenty hefty.The conference from which the text of this book was taken occurred before the first flight of the shuttle 'Columbia', and is therefore greatly insightful into the early phases of shuttle planning, operations, and design. Needless to say, the program was wildly optimistic at the beginning, and this book reflects that misplaced optimism with papers presented on things like follow on STS derivatives, a 74 passenger shuttle variant (to ferry workers to all the work that would need to be done in space), and most fallacious of all, the concept of launch on demand, in which an orbiter could be launched with minutes notice. Also touted was the incredible economics of the shuttle which was supposed to reduce the cost per pound of orbited payload tenfold, when in reality, it has been more expensive than disposable boosters.There is a great deal of technical information on the shuttle in the volume, accompanied by a very large number of excellent illustrations (for instance, external tank slosh baffles, and other hard to find photos and drawings), therefore, I highly recommend it for serious shuttle historians, but be forewarned that it is very heavy reading, and also contains numerous papers not related specifically to the shuttle on subjects as diverse as VAB reconfiguration, financial regulations pertaining to the operation of large platforms in space, and the excruciating &quot;Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System,&quot; which delves into way more detail on the functional configuration of TDRSS satellites than anyone ever wanted to know.I gave it four stars overall. The shuttle material was interesting and not commonly known, so that part of the book rated five stars, but the large quantity of non-shuttle information of dubious historical significance brought it to a four star overall rating. This is an excellent shuttle reference overall, just be prepared for quite a bit of extraneous or marginally applicable material."},{"Title":"GTO, 1964-1967 (Muscle Car Color History)","review":"As a buyer/seller/restorer of classic Pontiacs, I find this book to be very helpful for that quick numbers check, and originality judge.

As a reader, I felt like a television viewer watching it all unfold for me, as Monica told us of the things she went through. My favorite chapters in the book are 7 and Outroduction. In chapter seven, Monica editorialized her views on love in a good analogy. The Outroduction is what makes reading the book worth while, the same applies to sitting through a Jerry Springer Show, to hear his &quot;closing comments.&quot; In the Outroduction, the character Monica summarizes what &quot;this thing called love&quot; is about and whether it's the search or the having that is important.Michael Faulkner, Author~Freelance Writer"},{"Title":"Bad By Myself","review":"When I purchased this book, I thought I was supporting a good Black female author with her very first book.

The book comes to us with the authority of the foremost culinary school in the country and the aura of being a textbook with which it may seem to be sacrilege to take issue. This book does many very good things, but in popularizing it's subject, it does loose some depth and credibility.The book does several very good things that almost entirely outweigh its few blemishes.The first valuable lesson from this book is its characterization of the way students of professional cooking come to think about their vocation and its materials. In this way, the book can make you a more successful cook by adapting professional methods. The heart of the matter is to \`learn to think critically about cooking' and \`learn how to look at, touch, smell, and taste a dish to judge whether it is coming together'. A professional cook knows how to rescue a recipe when a step fails or an ingredient is unavailable. They know what Alton Brown calls the map of culinary facts and techniques, which surround recipes, and explains how they work. That is not to say that this book deals with culinary science a la Shirley Corriher. The terms \`acid' and \`gluten' don't even appear in the index.The second valuable type of lesson in this book is the descriptions of general techniques and the explanations for how they work. An example is in the technique for preparing stocks where the book explains that flavors are extracted from vegetables within an hour after adding them to the simmering stock water. This means that if you expect to simmer your veal bones for four hours, you can wait for three hours before adding the vegetables. This measure is irrelevant, of course, for fish stocks, where the fish flesh and bones should be simmered for no more than 30 to 45 minutes. Much of this information is given in easily used tabular form as in the table of best cooking methods for cuts of beef, veal, pork, and lamb. My most useful suggestion regarding this information is to recommend you view this information with a critical eye. In one part of the book, it is said that analogous parts of animals are often best cooked by similar methods. However, the book cites braising as a preferred method for cooking beef chuck (shoulder), but does not give braising as a method for cooking lamb shoulder. While I see many recipes for grilling and broiling lamb shoulder, Chris Schlesinger and John Willoughby in \`How to Cook Meat' specifically say that lamb shoulder is an excellent cut for braising. Regarding cooking temperature endpoints, the book is typically very conservative, largely following the USDA recommendations for reaching up to 180 degrees in chicken thighs when cooking whole birds. Reliable sources have recommended that reaching 165 degrees is quite enough, with less danger of drying out the white meat in the bird.The third and possibly most valuable resource in this book is the collection of classic recipes with expert procedures which all but guarantee a satisfactory result. The pasta chapter, for example, begins with a basic tomato marinara sauce followed by such classics as pasta Puttanesca, pasta Primavera, pasta alla Carbonara, spinach and escarole lasagna, and (potato) gnocchi with herbs and butter. The collection does not contain every \`classic'. You will not, for example, find coq au vin in the poultry chapter. But, the selection is very good. Each recipe contains a sidebar giving some insight into either an ingredient, technique, or serving suggestion. Each recipe also contains one or more references to other parts of the book where relevant techniques are explained.One surprising weakness in the book is the cursory coverage of some basic cooking techniques. The chapter on poultry gives a description of how to cut a chicken into serving pieces, with only four steps and four pictures. A similar description in James Peterson's \`Essentials of Cooking' takes thirteen steps with thirteen color photographs. The coverage of other basic techniques seems similarly skimpy.One subtle but surprising lapse is in the description of basic cooking techniques. If you read the descriptions of shallow poaching and pan frying, it is quite unclear what the difference may be between the two methods. Neither method cites the most important fact that poaching is done in water and pan frying is done in oil and the difference in effect is based on the difference between 212 degrees of water cooking and 350 degrees or higher of oil cooking. The description of these methods does have some secrets to offer. I never before saw shallow poaching as an efficient method for creating a sauce by reducing the poaching liquid after the food has been cooked.If you have no other cookbooks or no cookbooks that discuss general techniques, this is an inspiring introduction to cooking. Even if you have a small cookbook library, this book can be a worthy addition if you have no good books covering egg cookery or what this book calls \`Kitchen Desserts'. These are dishes based primarily based of fruits, custards, puddings, cream, and prepared doughs such as puff pastry. The book does not cover breads, pastries, cakes, cookies, or other baked desserts typically done by a pastry chef. If you are interested in thorough discussions of cooking techniques, I recommend Alton Brown's \`I'm Only Here for the Food'.Recommended for sound, straightforward recipes and a great primer on cookspeak. Other books do a better job of explaining basic techniques."},{"Title":"Cooking at Home with The Culinary Institute of America","review":"Lavishly and instructively illustrated, this teaching book presents, in words and pictures, step-by-step instructions for everything from making spice sachets and pureeing soups to carving a roasted chicken and filleting a fish. It even shows various ways of cutting vegetables, preparing garlic, cleaning leeks and mushrooms.A thorough primer, it starts with a discussion of tools, techniques and pantry ingredients, advocates an organized mindset, and proceeds in the same patient, simple manner through each course, discussing market choices and preparation, many illustrated. Easy-to-follow recipes build technique and repertoire, from Onion Soup Gratinee and Thai Hot and Sour Soup to Southern Fried Chicken, Roast Goose with Pan Gravy, Grilled Lamb with Mango Chutney and Beef Tenderloin with Mushrooms.There are stir-fries, curries and classic continental and American dishes, all with painstaking directions.

I was rummaging around in Borders one day and found this book in the discount section. Because it's from the CIA, I thought that it would likely be a great basics cookbook to add to my collection so I grabbed it and brought it home.It is pretty basic, but I never use it. I am far more likely to pull down my copy of the Joy of Cooking or Alice Water's The Art of Simple Food. I think it's because some of the sections are really copy-heavy and the layout tends to be in more of a longer paragraph rather than bullets. I know that sound odd, but I don't like to feel like I'm reading a novel when I'm reading a cookbook - break it down for me. There are also very few quick, easy recipes in the book. I'm all for slaving over a dish for a few hours, but my favorite cookbooks have a balance between the quick and easy and the \\"I get a gold star for cooking this damn thing\\" recipes.For the recipes that I have made (citrus roasted beets or the spinach and arugala salad), they have turned out well. But for me, the types of recipes and overall layout makes this book more likely to be out on my coffee table with a bit of dust on it, then laying open on my kitchen counter with oil or flour staining the pages."},{"Title":"Cooking at Home with The Culinary Institute of America","review":"Don't be insulted or missled.

Something about the typeface and the layout makes this book less than fun for me to read, though.The recipes describe excellent meals for adults with an interest in variety and subtlety. They focus on the protein course and its sauce, so they're off my current track of experimenting with hearty vegetable dishes. My kids turn away meals like this as \\"Dad's Creative Cooking,\\" so I have to leave most of the recipes behind as not a good match for my house.This book contains about 240 recipes, of which almost half caught my eye.

To the stunned disbelief of thousands Freeling killed off his adored Dutch \`copper' Piet Van der Valk after a dozen best-selling novels and several runs of a highly popular European TV series. He claimed that as he had relocated from Amsterdam and was now living in France he felt he could no longer accurately reflect the Dutch culture, and he introduced an entirely new policeman Henri Castang in a series that was actually more developed and multi-faceted than the Van der Valk series.Stunned in his turn by his fans reaction - they even stopped publishing his work in a couple of European markets - Freeling, briefly, reintroduced Van der Valk family in the character of Arlette, Piet's widow whom he had in any case made French in the series, As a compromise Arlette, the widow of the title, begins detective work in Strasbourg, a city set in France but very \`deutsch' in culture.Like other compromises this one, for me, did not satisfy. Redeemed only by Freeling's talented writing and deliberately obscure plot twists, the novel is not to the quality of either the earlier Van der Valk or the Castang series."},{"Title":"The Widow","review":"I'm probably being a little bit harsh in giving this book only three stars-- I think from a writer who was not Nicolas Freeling it would have easily cleared four-- but it isn't up to the par of his usual standard, even while it is a decent read._The Widow_ is set after the death of Van Der Valk in _Aupres de Ma Blonde_ and features his widow Arlette setting up a counseling service/detective agency in Strasbourg with her new sociologist husband. She starts off with what she thinks is a girl being treated badly by her family and ends up in an entirely different and more dangerous kettle of fish.Given that Arlette was one of my least favorite elements of the more standard Van Der Valk novels, I'm honestly suprised that I liked it as much as I did. It's hurt by the initial pages, which are unnecessarily confusing in setting the stage.

If you are looking for one book to help you understand the Rosary better, then this is it. It covers every aspect of the Rosary in depth, and adds much detail, making it a treasure chest of knowledge about the Catholic faith. It is written in a compelling way, never dry; and although it is an expensive book, it is worth every penny. I know that I will reread it over and over again; in addition, I hope to teach a class at my church this year on it. I have several other books on the Rosary, but this is worth all of them put together."},{"Title":"Rosary: Mysteries, Meditations, and the Telling of the Beads","review":"This is a very detailed but clearly written work on all aspects of the Rosary. As a non-Catholic who is becoming more and more interested in the Catholic Church, I found this book very enlightening. It wiped away many of the prejudices I (as a long-time Baptist) had held toward the Church. I would recommend it to everyone, especially to those seeking a better prayer life."},{"Title":"Rosary: Mysteries, Meditations, and the Telling of the Beads","review":"Rosary is both scholarly and inspiring-a rare combination. I am a very fast reader, but it took me several weeks to complete this tome. I read only one chapter a day, as there is so much to absorb and digest. As a purely historical book, it is magnificent. As a spiritual book, it is equally magnificent. The author, Kevin Orlin Johnson, Phd. did extensive and profound research in writing this book and it certainly shows. This book I recommend to all Catholics, but I also highly recommend it to people of all faiths or no faith at all! I guarantee all readers will be inspired by Rosary."},{"Title":"Rosary: Mysteries, Meditations, and the Telling of the Beads","review":"Everyone else is right, this book is truly a blessing.

It tells of the early history leading to the development of the rosary. A history of a people seeking a closer communion with God. The author tells a story that needs telling -- a story of heresies and misunderstandings, of the power of the rosary to draw us to the saving power of Christ. This is a story about how the rosary should be said and has been said over the course of centuries. This story is easy to read, well organized, and answers the call of the many who search for an answer to the problems besetting the Church today. It is excellent reading."},{"Title":"Rosary: Mysteries, Meditations, and the Telling of the Beads","review":"I was really looking forward to this title based on the other reviews and the index which was full of saints .... What I found was very disappointing.Although the author seems initially quite successful at building credibility with his reader - the tone is quite authoritative - not popular piety -- and the content at first glance seems well researched. But when the author mentioned that marriage is the main reason the Roman Empire fell - I started to get nervous. Marriage at best may have been one of several factors, and thats perhaps a stretch - but to assert it is the primary reason for the fall of the Roman Empire is outrageous. And worse in that it calls into question the other facts that the author presents in this work.The meditations are also very wanting. They seem devoid of any personal touch and they are hardly suited to meditation or even a 'science of the saints' type of consideration of related virtues. The author throughout the book is long winded and seems to enjoy relaying facts irregardless of if they have any relevance to the content. For example, I'm not sure how or why a reflection on the 'agony of the garden' somehow launches into a discussion of how all competitive sports are evil.Finally, although the list of resources seems extensive, I was disappointed overall with the selections of saints quotations used throughout the book.Overall, I know that rosary books of any meaningful size are hard to come by (hopefully this 'year of the rosary' will change that), I'd start with 'The Rosary, The Little Summa' or 'Mystery Stories: A Journey Through the Rosary'"},{"Title":"Rosary: Mysteries, Meditations, and the Telling of the Beads","review":"As a recently converted Catholic, I was looking for a book about the rosary to better learn why we pray it and what the words are and the order of the prayers. I already know this author and usually his works are perfect for people learning about the Catholic faith but this book is just too intelectual for me. There are so many references to the Bible that each chapter becomes very long and tedious. However, I did enjoy the prayers being written and I did learn more about the Rosary but would have prefered a more simple and direct book."},{"Title":"Rosary: Mysteries, Meditations, and the Telling of the Beads","review":"This book is wonderful for people who have been away from the Church and would like to understand the Rosary. It is also great for those who have recited the Rosary for years without understanding the history and the whys.

Sadly, not true.The author writes in an authoritative voice which at first is quite convincing, but his \\"facts\\", \\"history\\" and personal theology seem to serve a Pre-Vatican II ideology.I'll keep the book, but assign to the \\"swing and a miss\\" section."},{"Title":"Rosary: Mysteries, Meditations, and the Telling of the Beads","review":"The history of the rosary is fascinating and complex, related to ancient forms of faith. Initially, this book looked interesting, chock-full of historical details, with pamphlets on different devotions enclosed. But the content betrays, muffled in semantics by a linguist. There's no mention of the luminous mysteries added by Pope John Paul II; later editions could have been amended to include them. You would not believe the time the author spent raving in an inappropriate diatribe against sports in the Agony in the Garden mystery. Who cares what Johnson's issues are regarding sports? As an athletic person, I couldn't care less, and as a researcher, I want to be provided real information, not nonsensical opinion. I highly recommend the fun and lucidThe Rosary Handbook: A Guide for Newcomers, Old-Timers, and Those in Betweeninstead.In trepidation, I turned to the Crucifixion mystery, to see if the author stains this mystery too. He does, in the most peculiar way. He horrifically describes Third Reich torture in great detail, sagging skin and all, never mentioning that Jews were the victims involved. A person of real faith does not need to dwell on gore to meditate on the depth of this mystery.As many fine theologians point out, Judaism the root of Christian faith. But Johnson completely gets Jewish history wrong, dismissing two thousand years of Judaism after the final destruction of the Temple. It's a miracle that the Jews, the people of the First Covenant, the brethren of Jesus, have miraculously survived. In the history of the world, no other people kept their language, religion, and heritage alive, while suffering over two thousand years of exile and persecution. Johnson completely misrepresents the truth when he declares that the Sadducees were the seeds for modern Judaism; they did not follow the Talmud as well as the Torah, modern Judaism does both. The Sadducees were lost in history. Unbelievable misinformation; it's incomprehensible that Johnson could write beautifully about some aspects of prayer, yet hatefully in other regards, even lambasting sports.On page 305, Johnson wrote that the Jewish Apostles saw \\"the whole nation of Israel turn into a mob that compelled the Roman governor to crucify Christ.\\" This kind of generalization caused Christian mob violence against Jews over the centuries; only a raving anti-Semite would write such bile. Devout Catholics avoid this kind of thinking, it would be like shooting yourself in the proverbial foot, or root. For the mystery of Pentecost, Johnson makes the common mistake of assuming Jews called this holiday Pentecost too. They never did in Israel, and they don't two thousand years later. This Jewish feast of first-harvest is Shavout, celebrated fifty days after the festival of Passover. It is utter nonsense to state that, \\"because this holiday didn't have a descriptive name rooted in Hebrew like the others, and because by the time of Christ so many people spoke Greek, the holiday came to be called simply the Fiftieth Day - Pentecost\\" (326). Jesus spoke Aramaic, not Greek, and in referring to this feast, he would have used the normative Hebrew term - Shavout.There are better resources out there. This travesty will be discarded. Try this fine book:The New Rosary in Scripture: Biblical Insights for Praying the 20 Mysteries, which contains Pope John Paul II's \\"The Rosarium Virginis Mariae: Apostolic Letter on the Most Holy Rosary.\\""},{"Title":"Rosary: Mysteries, Meditations, and the Telling of the Beads","review":"Kevin Orlin Johnson is my favorite author...and this book is just one of the reasons why!

I admit this makes up for a lot of other issues.

(which would be fine if it was more in CONTEXT.. but it sort of drops in out of no where).still.. the sheer faith and enthusiasm and easy to follow language carry it through a great deal.i suggest \\"The Rosary: the Little Summa\\" if you need more in depth reading, and try looking at \\"The Rosary, chain of hope\\" and \\"The Rosary Handbook\\" as well.if you can tolerate dated... but love history.. try \\"Stories of the Rose\\".i own this book, and love it, so it is certainly a worthwhile addition to my library."},{"Title":"Rosary: Mysteries, Meditations, and the Telling of the Beads","review":"In my many years of reading Catholic non-fiction literature, I do not believe there is a more detailed book on the Rosary out there. This was one of the best I've read and is an incredibly thorough work on not only the history of the rosary but also each of the mysteries that comprise the rosary. It's definitely not an overnight read with over 350 pages but it was surely a page turner. This books goes into great detail about how the rosary was developed throughout the ages as well as the significance the rosary has played in historical events. A couple of chapters are dedicated to both vocal and meditative prayer but not as a \\"typical\\" prayer book but rather what they are and how those types of prayers relate to the rosary. I find that the uniqueness of Dr Johnson's books are that he is able to easily relate to the reader the scientific and scholarly aspects of his subject but also with a flair toward the spiritual side. I particularly enjoyed the chapters in which he discusses the Lord's Prayer in detail as well as each of the promises that are attached to the rosary, giving meaning as to what they actually signify.

The Rosary is the gospel prayed. If you claim to love the gospel but despise the rosary, do your self a favor and read this book. It may open up a whole new world of prayer for you. I've never had so much fun reading a book in all my life. I'm a better Christian because of it. Clear, articulate and concise."},{"Title":"Rosary: Mysteries, Meditations, and the Telling of the Beads","review":"This is a challenging book. Those wanting merely to learn how to pray the Rosary, or seeking a book of meditations to use while praying the Rosary, should look elsewhere. On the other hand, if you are looking for an intellectually invigorating examination of the Rosary, its history and theology, you will never do better.This book explains, in great detail, the history of the Rosary and its development from early meditative prayers of the Church. This history alone is worth the price of the book. For instance, Dr. Johnson describes the manner in which St. Dunstan, by pious example and by encouraging participation in the Little Office, returned England from spiritual and secular chaos to peace. The description occupies a couple of pages but powerfully illustrates the power of communal prayer to support peoples' natural desire to act rightly and live in harmony. In other words, Dr. Johnson doesn't merely mention the miracle (for that is what it is) but explains how it came about. In doing so, he raises the issue of what motivates people to behave justly and soberly: one motivation is external compulsion (usually by the State); its superior alternative is the \\"internal power of virtue\\" (from Johnson's quotation of Pius XI) which must be supported by regular prayer by the community as a whole. In this brief two page description, the author outlined a theory of civil order that is as compelling as it is simple. This is intellectual entertainment of a very high order.In addition to history, however, Dr. Johnson lays out the theology underpinning the Rosary and similar devotions and, in short but pithy chapters, discusses the theology of the individual mysteries (excluding JPII's Luminous Mysteries). There is an appendix of further readings and a good index.My only complaint, a minor one, is that the author's use of Latin and Greek is not always precisely correct. (Two examples: 1) On page 128, \\"Spiritui Sancti\\" should be \\"Spiritus Sancti,\\" as 'spiritus', a fourth declension noun, ends in a long -u- followed by an -s in the genitive case. Unless the word changed declensions from the classical to the medieval period, the form Johnson provides is actually dative; 2) Later, on page 262, he refers to the Latin word for suffering, \\"passio,\\" by its accusative form (passionem), normally the nominative, or subject form, would be used for this purpose.) Do not let this very minor imprecision detract from your enjoyment of this excellent book.I can't recommend \\"Rosary\\" highly enough: it will really make you think. One of the blurbs on the book's back cover says it was worth every penny. I would go further and say it would be cheap at twice the price. It's that good."},{"Title":"The Song of Rama: Visions of the Ramayana","review":"Vanamali is a unique writer. She brings to life the story of the Ramayana in a readable form.

Such is the case with this manga by Masamune Shirow whom could very well be the greatest comics creator of the twentieth century. I'm not throwing gas or anything, I'm rather serious about it! I've read Chris Claremont, Jim Lee, Mark Silvestri, Tom McFarlane and this guy whom is rather obscure publicly even in Japan (Not on the Japanese comic market-he is just busy as Todd Mcfarlane and there is much demand for his work there), I've seen the art work of the American artists and it is great. Unfortunately, they work in a market that refuses to give credit to its clientel. That's right! You the readership!! Listen this book is volume four in Shirows &quot;life's work&quot; sereal comic and is the best so far from the Appleseed series. The Art has made quantum-century leaps from the time of Black Magic and Appleseed book one. Shirow gives explanations on the side whenever he feel its necessary, bu the real treat in this comic isn't that there are is great character development, lots of action, but there is an actual superstrucyture. Superstructure is the underlying theme of the book which it touches every now and then but does not directly give it away like the American comics whom just spoon feed readers the answers. The best recommendation that I can give is that if you love Sanbdman Mystery Theater (Who doesn't?), this book is right up your alley. A true master of the medium. Shirow will flip your world up side down and you night never buy American comics again, unless, like Darkminds, they have a manga theme. Good bye and please buy the book! You don't know what you're missing. The art, the action, the masterful pacing! Tres magnifique!!!"},{"Title":"Appleseed: The Promethean Challenge ( Volume 1 )","review":"Masamune Shirow is definitely one of my favorite manga authors...there is not a single work by him that does not show thought and planning. His storytelling is excellent, and his art is great too. He can be very precise with the artwork, and in the next panel drop in a little cartoony figure to break up the mood. You must buy this book!"},{"Title":"Appleseed: The Promethean Challenge ( Volume 1 )","review":"Easily the best of the Appleseed books, book 4 is an egde of your seat thrill ride that takes the Appleseed characters to their limits. The characters are stretched beyond their limits with more detective work and a complex mystery that comes to a spectacular conclusion. The fight scenes are amazing, and the whole book takes place in matter of a few hours which keeps it almost real-time and it never slows down. This is my favorite Masamune Shirow work. Highest reccomendations."},{"Title":"Appleseed: The Promethean Challenge ( Volume 1 )","review":"Deunan Knute and Briareos find themselves in a war between the many political factions of Olympus. The artwork, like the plot, can become very confusing, as battle after battle is fought in the streets. Just how MANY sides are fighting each other is hard to tell, as we have humans, bioroids and even machines. Who will win the city becomes a side-issue, as all the factions end up just trying to survive and keep the city in one piece.And this is only volume number two!"},{"Title":"Appleseed: The Promethean Challenge ( Volume 1 )","review":"This book could've been much better"},{"Title":"Appleseed: The Promethean Challenge ( Volume 1 )","review":"I love this book and the rest of the series. It is actionpacked but not like a [poor] Rocky or some other movie with noplot. This has all the quallitys for a great book. The drawings are great the plot is good, thats all you need and the charecters are fantastic.I recomend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Appleseed: The Promethean Challenge ( Volume 1 )","review":"&quot;Apple Seed&quot; is the Sci-Fi/Mecha work by popular manga artist Masumune Shirow. This tale of Mechas, government secrets, and a very tough heroine was also made into a anime of the same name. &quot;Apple Seed&quot; is, at times, deemed Shirow's greatest work, a triumph.Art-wise, things are a mixed bag. While I was not particular blown away, the art is not difficult to view. Duenan looks just to cool with her body armor on, and Briareos is...interesting. However, while many of the mecha designs were good, many of the character designs were pretty lame, and lacked any kind of originality.Also lacking are the battles. Some deem the battles &quot;cool&quot;, I beg to differ. Many of the battles should be appriotely labeled &quot;overblown&quot;. The mech flew back back and forth, a couple of explosions, followed by several injuries and apparent deaths. The series of panels holding the images were laid out in a way that was, in my opinion, utterly confusing. It looked as if the images had been swiched up side down, causing bewilderment.The plot is overly complex. Text and battles are unevenly distributed between the pages.for example, think about no text for four pages, then tons of text, trying to depict the story, and mostly failing. There was so much text in some of the panels that I found it difficult to correctly read the text, and I never fully understood the plot. The main character, Duenan, also has a drab, typical personalitie that I've noticed in his other works. Duenan is brave, strong, shoots before she asked questions, but is not entirely the most reliable. Sound familiar?Why, then, do I award &quot;Appleseed&quot; three stars? Would two or one stars be more like it? To its credit, &quot;Appleseed&quot;'s artwork is certainly a step above the first volume of &quot;Appleseed&quot;, marked with a signifigant amount of increased detail. Also, this is a must for Shirow fans. While it would skreching it a bit to call it epic, the book is pretty long, providing countless hours of enjoyment for those who enjoy Shirows work. Those who are looking for a manga with better artwork and easy to follow plot are better off reading something else."},{"Title":"Appleseed: The Promethean Challenge ( Volume 1 )","review":"One of Masamune Shirow's best works. If you like manga, you'll like this."},{"Title":"Appleseed: The Promethean Challenge ( Volume 1 )","review":"This book could've been much better"},{"Title":"Simplicity: The Freedom of Letting Go","review":"I guess the basis for Rohr's book is to Let go of the pre-conceived notions that we all have in regards to God, the church, and differing classes of people including ourselves. I enjoyed the way Rohr think's outside of the box. Overall I found this book to be a very good book. I would suggest buying it."},{"Title":"Simplicity: The Freedom of Letting Go","review":"Superb book by an unique author. This book is for those people who want to live a meaningful life rather than a singularly material one. I feel that it is part of a process, a journey for individuals to learn and change their lives in the direction that is centered on what God want us to be."},{"Title":"Simplicity: The Freedom of Letting Go","review":"Richard Rohr book is a personal exploration of how to respond to the Gospel's without glazing over the bit we often find confronting and try to ignore- Jesus's comments on wealth and how the last shall be first. It also confronts us to stop theorising and start living. You may disagree with his views but it provides a perspective on how to live Jesus's message."},{"Title":"Simplicity: The Freedom of Letting Go","review":"This book is excellent, although a bit hard to get into. On the whole I found it rather badly translated, which means that it doesn't flow, and just when you think you're getting into an idea and able to relate something to your life, it changes tack rapidly, mid-paragraph and is discordant. But looking past that to the spirit of the book, it has an excellent chapter on contemplation, including a section on his year's leave for contemplation. The book also addresses the church, and broadly looks at what the church really needs now (and to be sure, it needs a lot), although here his bias against himself and his fellow Americans shows through. Similarly, as a self-professed Catholic (and a Franciscan friar), he finds fault in his own religion, and is happy to speak out on this. Neither of these are bad things, and on the whole, the book is very interesting, and, if you let it, and if you read it carefully, can make quite an impact on your life."},{"Title":"Simplicity: The Freedom of Letting Go","review":"I gave this book as a gift after reading it myself. Good call. Ideas on leading a simpler spiritual life are excellent."},{"Title":"Simplicity: The Freedom of Letting Go","review":"This is an excellent book by Richard Rohr and I recommend it to those wishing to simplify their lives.

I did not have a chance to read it."},{"Title":"Simplicity: The Freedom of Letting Go","review":"Richard Rohr dives below the surface of rational Western culture in a dialog about God's Kingdom, being poor, social justice and living in a deeper place of simplicity where we are at home with the Jesus in us. The thoughts in this book are profound, simple, and challenging. This book truly captivated me. I did not want to put it down. My mind was stretched and my heart defibrillated as I began to see how simple it all really is... Blessed are those with very little... Blessed are those who have lost something... Blessed are those... Is the Sermon on the Mount just imagery of a life which is unobtainable to us now? His Kingdom seems to be up-side-down. And as Jesus said, &quot;The Kingdom is here now!&quot;"},{"Title":"Simplicity: The Freedom of Letting Go","review":"Richard Rohr certainly is among my five favorite Christian authors. Rohr is a priest, a preacher and a member of the Franciscan Order (OFM) within the Roman Catholic Church. He is both priceless and refreshing because he in a direct, forceful and honest way -- speaks the truth as he sees it. He doesn't view the Church as perfect, certainly not all its leaders. He is a consistent critic of the present capitalistic economic system. And, he points out the failings in socialism.Although this book is entitled \\"Simplicity.\\" only the last chapter really is devoted to that subject consistently.Apparently the book is based on a series of talks Rohr gave in Germany and Switzerland in the late eighties.The varioius chapters range from Christians being active in transforming society, to women's place in the church, to how the Church needs to save itself.An example of speaking plainly, clearly and directly: \\"Chrisitian nations are among the greediest and the most intent on security of any in the world, while they maintain that Jesus is their Lord and their security.\\""},{"Title":"Simplicity: The Freedom of Letting Go","review":"This book looks at simplicty and discusses it through many systems; American Society, Woman's roles, Catholicicsm, the American Church and your image of God. It is based upon talks Fr. Rohr has given and seems a bit disjointed. It is not until the last chapter that Fr. Rohr gets to approching simplicity from the individual perspective. He states \\"Our path, like Jesus' leads us to the wilderness where we have to look the exactly the same three demons in the eye: the need to be successful, the need to be righteous or religious, and the need to have power and everything under control.\\" We also need to embrace the poor one \\"inside\\" so that we have room for compassion \\"outside\\". The Gospel calls us to identify with the poor and crucified Christ and in our weakness we are strong. We are called to service for our less fortunate brothers and sisters, \\"But faith means giving away what we thought we didn't even have.\\" It was a good journey through this book, just not exactly what I was anticipating."},{"Title":"Simplicity: The Freedom of Letting Go","review":"I have been reading about Simplicity for a little over a year and have found that practicing Simplicity truly enriches your life. This book has to be one of the best books I have read on Simplicity! Richard Rohr is right on target when he speaks about simplicity and the condition of America...and when he addresses the church in America! I found this book to be very thought provoking, eye-opening, and this is quite a powerful book. This book also got me interested in the life and practice of Saint Francis, which lead me into other wonderful books. Richard Rohr is awesome and I was truly blessed by this book. I think people who are truly on the spiritual path tend to be lead into Simplicity and this book will truly be beneficial to all seekers of truth!"},{"Title":"Simplicity: The Freedom of Letting Go","review":"This book was the selection for the Fall book club at our church. Although I was expecting more of a \\"how-to\\" format, I found it to be provocative and engaging. This is the kind of book which not only causes me to think but actually makes me want to make changes in my life. Being a Roman Catholic from the cradle and female, I am surprised that Rohr has been allowed to express such radical ideas about the church hierarchy and the position of women without being silenced by the church. It gives me great hope for my church to know that there are people like Rohr in positions of influence and authority who are openly expressing and promoting these kinds of ideas."},{"Title":"Simplicity: The Freedom of Letting Go","review":"This book is a mind blower. Thea author pulls no punches. As when for example he calls bishops echo chambers of the Vatican. But there are profound and startling isights into the Christian spiritual life also. As for example when he says the Incarnation has nothing to do with theology but with vulnerability. For anyone wishing to enrich his or her spiritual life, this book is a must."},{"Title":"Simplicity: The Freedom of Letting Go","review":"Very beautiful and profound writing. I have read it twice and will read it many times more."},{"Title":"Simplicity: The Freedom of Letting Go","review":"Richard Rohr writes beautifully, provacatively, and movingly of what we need to do to live lives of meaning. Talk about a voice crying in the wilderness! I imagine some of what he says rattles more than a few conservative heads (both in the church and out), but no one will ever call him a 'rubber stamper\\" He invites you to look at yourself, at your beliefs and challenges you to become a better person. To do what Christ calls us to do."},{"Title":"Simplicity: The Freedom of Letting Go","review":"I just finished this book tonight and would also recommend the lecture series by Rohr entitled \\"Letting Go: A Spirituality of Subtraction\\". This series will take you much deeper into simplicity."},{"Title":"Simplicity: The Freedom of Letting Go","review":"This is Robert Rohr at his very best. One striking example was his advice that we need to let go of three things: first, the compulsion to be successful, second, the compulsion to be right, and third, the need to be in control. This book is one which can easily be used as a 30 minute start for the day. The theme throughout deals with letting go."},{"Title":"Spoon","review":"First time author Kris J. Ryan scores a solid winner with \\"Spoon\\". Kris creates vivid characters and imagery while maintaining a gripping story line. This book, while directed toward children, will be enjoyed by adults and children alike. Kris takes the battles between good and evil to uncharted areas and does so with entertainingly new twists. Looking forward to your next book."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"seriously!

The main character in this book is a teenage girl named Georgia Nicholson who lives in England. Georgia is a semi-popular at her private school (Stalg 14 as she calls it), and has very funny and supportive friends which she calls the \\"Fabs\\". The Fab Gang includes: Rosie, Ellen, Jools, and Georgia's best friend Jas. The girls make trouble and many memeories throughout the book, and provide lots of comic releif for the reader. The plot of this book is for Georgia to snag her dream guy Robbie,A.K.A the \\"Sex God\\". The only problem is, the \\"Sex God\\" is 18, and not interested in girls who are 4 years younger than him. In this book, Georgia must make herslef irresistible and attractive to get back together with Robbie. She uses a boy named \\"Dave the Laugh\\" as a red herring to make Robbie jeaulous. And of course, you'll have to read the book to find out how this hilarious sequel turns out!!By Mariquita Reese"},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"I thought that this book was a great book.

You never know she could be real or just an image in a lot of people's heads.

First of all Georgia Nicolson is so cool, (just not when she's around Robbie (a.k.a Mr. Sex God)) she's so funny, and she has the wierdest cat known to man (actually it's not just a cat it's also...lol exactly what Georgia says when someone starts complaining about it). This cat literally attacks Georgia and is this crazy mountain lion around Georgia, but as soon as Libby (Georgia's crazy little sister) wants to play tea-party with \\"kitty cat\\" the cat is as sweet as can be. Well, anyways what I'm trying to explain is that this book ROCKS!!

Boys, clothes, thick friends, and is there much more to it? I admit reading this book really does make you feel good - if you can laugh at Georgia's problems, what are your own in comparison? The cover plainly suggests the story is not at all serious and the book remains true to that. So if you're looking for a light read to break you free of a ho-hum mood, this book oughta do it; just beware that the shallowness can get pretty frustrating."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"Who would like this book? Anyone who finds humor in the everyday, ordinary human ridiculousness that goes on around the globe and is accepted as the \\"norm.\\" If laughter truly is the best medicine, then all hospitals should carry copies of Georgia's adventures. This irrepressible teen has got a mouth that won't quit and an attitude to match. Her tongue-in-cheek humor and no-fear approach to life will inspire the meek and outgoing alike. Are there life lessons to be learned from this book? Well, perhaps that none of us should take ourselves so seriously that we miss out on the joys of lipstick, crushes, attack cats, and just plain being female. (If the reader is female, naturallement. Men might enjoy seeing how some teen girls think.) Ms. Rennison has the skill to keep up not just Georgia's character, but the distinct charcters of her friends and family through Georgia's point of view, a not-to-be-shrugged-off talent. Her writing voice has a natural, true-to-thought effervescence. Ms. Rennison has teenage girls' number, and experiencing this book is yet another chance to relive those awkward high-school days and feel you've come out a winner. Warning--if you read this in public, you will snicker and snort and get stared at. Might as well just laugh out loud and make everyone wish they were reading something so cool."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"This book is extremeley funny and gives you an overview of a real teenage girls love life; the ups and downs.

However I am disappointed to say that I didn't like it as much as Angus. I found all the old character to be very enjoyable but I found Georgia in this book to have lost some of her spark and at times is really very self-centered and very inconsiderated of her best friend Jas. She is just flat out mean. However I stil anticipated futher adventures in her life in the next book coming out in May 2002 in the U.S. called Knocked Out by My Nunga-Nungas.

These two books just did it for me, they make me want to read all the time now, and I suppose thats what I'm gonna end up doing, but you really need to check it out if you haven't yet, its a great comedy!"},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"Step into the world of teenage obsession. Remeber those days when all you talked about were boys,makeup, and clothes. But this isn't one of those non-sensical teenage romance books. The main character has a great sense of humor and the book is written with a hint of sarcasm about the teenage human condition. An extremely humorous book, and you don't have to be a teenager to read it. Not as good as Angus,Thong,and Full Frontal Snogging but definitely satisfying as a sequel."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"... But it did have a lot to live up to. Yes the second instalment of the series is full of laughs, but its just not as good/funny as the first. This one is only over the span of two months (the first is a whole year - this isnt a problem, just thought Id bring it up). A few days are repeated from the last book - however our heroine Georgia seems to have done different things!One of the things I didn't like about this one is the words the 'Ace gang' pick up from Ellan's brother, like \\"Poo Parlor Devision\\" or \\"Nippy Noodles\\", they just seemed immature - even for them. Most other 'funny' things Georgia said had something inteligent about them. Unfortunately the same thing can-not be said about these phrases.Also the first book talks about Georgia showing \\"promise\\" in tennis, however in this one she is all about hockey! What happened there?The mother storyline in this one was VERY simmilar to in the first book, and the book on a whole ended in a simmilar way.Having said that I laughed out loud MANY times while reading this book and highly recomend it for anyone hoping for a laugh."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"Georgia is a 14 year old who is on summer break from school.

Well after much heartache Georgia embarks on the project of making Robbie jealous, and dates \\"Dave the Laugh\\".The book is written as diary and you follow the life of this 14 year old.

Many teenagers, both British and American can relate to some part of Georgia's life, while other parts seem very much like fantasy. Although some language is hard to understand, the over-dramatic Georgia gets many points, both funny and serious across to the readers of her diary. I like how Louise Rennison, ( the REAL author of Georgia's diary), leaves the reader hanging. It makes you want to read the next book.

Like the first book you will want to read it over and over, but if you have sisters then you'll have to compete with them. The series is so good it should be publicly acknowledged so that all teenagers know to read them.If you haven't read this yet or the next two in the series then you are seriously missing out. I can't rave about them enough. The funniest books ever written!"},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"It is now official! This series of Georgia Nicolson's confessions by Louise Rennison, are by far the best comedy books I have ever read! I absolutely loved the second book, On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God; it was just as good, maybe better than the first book, and I could NOT stand to put it down!Georgia Nicolson is a fourteen-year-old British girl who lives in England. She attends an all-girls school and has four best friends: Jas, Jools, Ellen, and Rosie, who go to the same school as Georgia. Georgia has a little sister, Libby and a cat, Angus. Fortunately for the readers, Georgia's little three-year-old sister Libby, is still unknowingly \\"torturing\\" Georgia with her regular routine of secretly hiding the dirty nappies at the foot of Georgia's bed, peeing in corners of Georgia's room, and bringing all of her dolls, lifeless creatures made of food, as well as herself to sleep in Georgia's bed. What a life! Georgia's psychotic half-Scottish, half-domestic beast of a cat, Angus, continues his proud parade of teasing and taunting the next-door neighbor's two poodles and occasionally digs holes in their yard too. He still continues to think he is a dog - he might as well be, as he already is the size of a small Labrador.This book starts exactly where the first book left off - Georgia's great-bosomed mother telling Georgia the worst thing she could possibly hear after working so hard to become the girlfriend of a sex god: she and the family are moving to New Zealand as soon as possible, where Georgia's father is currently working.After an incident the family does not have to leave for New Zealand; however, Georgia manages to land herself into a great deal of trouble because of some small, childish prank: suspension. What perfect timing too - right before her father returns home from New Zealand. Great. It's quite comical how Georgia's mother tells Georgia to fake sick for the first couple of days her father is home, and then to make a great and unexplainable recovery.Later in the book, something awful happens to Georgia and to undo what happened to her, she must use her former boyfriend, Dave the Laugh, as a \\"red-herring.\\" Her plan doesn't go as accordingly, though. What happens is she becomes attracted to Dave again and has to constantly remind herself that she is not doing this to get Dave, but to get someone else. Even though she always reminds herself of this, she and Dave end up snogging and she isn't one bit regretful!One thing that I really enjoyed and thought was wicked funny in this book was that Georgia was constantly asking God for help and to fulfill her wishes (a.k.a. make the sex god go out with her again). When the man upstairs doesn't \\"grant\\" her anything she asked for, she resorts to asking Buddha for help, and considers becoming a monk so that maybe her wishes will be more likely to be granted.I can't say one thing I didn't like about this book - it was great all around!!"},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"After getting experience with the great first book, Louise pulls off an amazing tale of...nothing. Once again, no plot, so for those of you who enjoy 1000-page books with depth, this isn't for you.

Its fun and an easy read. Its by far pretty entertaning, i even found myself laughing out loud through out the book. And the dictionary in the back is alotta fun. I recomend the whole series to just about everyone. The only think i could of done with out, was the level off maturaty i found in Georgia but then again she was about what... 13/14? i think in this book, but it tends to get a litle annoying. but over all i think this is a great book, and i had alotta fun reading this one along with the whole series."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"I have read some reviews in which the reviewers said they couldn't relate to the lifestyle of Georgia. As a genuine Brit-chick I can confirm that, in my experience, this is very true to life. Me and my friends do so many of the things that are written about in this book, it's like it was written about us. So it's not some insane tale written by a deluded mad-woman - unfortunately, people like this do exist. But whether or not you are living the full frontal dream in real life, this book is hilarious. It's just so funny. Nothing has ever been as funny as this book. Nothing ever will be.But I have one complaint. This title is fiendishly bad. In the U of K, we like to call it 'It's OK, I'm Wearing Really Big Knickers'. On returning from an American holiday, one of my pals reported to us the shocking title-changing that had occured. If I were you, I'd import a copy, because the title is part of the beauty of the book. But basically, just read it."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"Another hilarious book continuing the story begun with Angus, Thongs, and Full-Frontal Snogging. The British have always been great with humor (or should I say humour) and this is no exception. A Bridget Jones with a teenage protaganist.

It only gets better as the series continues!"},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"Georgia's back again, manic and self-obsessed as ever, but this time, it seems like things are actually going to work for her. She's caught the eye of Robbie (aka the Sex God), and her parents aren't forcing her to move to New Zealand after all! Then, out of the blue, Robbie dumps her because \\"she's too young for him,\\" and Georgia finds herself back at square one.This is a fine book, and Georgia is certainly a memorable and distinct character, though not always the most likeable one. She's not particularly the best friend she could be to Jas, whom Georgia likes to enjoy baiting more than anything. And in both this and the first book, there's some disturbing activities happening in the background with Georgia's mom and doctors/interior decorators while dear old dad's out of the country. But hey, how could Georgia concentrate on things like that when she's got to convince Robbie she's mature enough to date??! An easy to read, realistic, funny book."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read -- I couldn't stop laughing.

Georgia, her mom, and her sister Libby decide to stay home and she is able to continue living her normal life. This book was very easy to read and was hysterically funny. It's great for teenage girls to read and relate to many of Georgia's moments."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"A quick re-cap... Georgia has started dating the Sex God (a.k.a Robbie) and her parents are planning to move to New Zealand (which she has aptly named \\"Kiwi a go-go Land\\").The story kicks off with Gee (Georgia) arguing with her mum about moving and the police stopping by in the middle of the night because Angus (their cat; the horror of the neighborhood, approx. the size of a small labrador) was terrorizing next door's poodles.Georgia can get no peace. With a move that doesn't happen and the Sex God braking it off. Gee creates \\"Plan Herring\\" to get the SG back. By trying to make herself alluring to the god she becomes a \\"Heartless Boy Magnet\\" and starts dating \\"Dave the Laugh\\" (Dave for short). She becomes a Buddhists, must listen about her friends love lives, gets no privacy, is tormented by her little sister and her surprises, wreaks havoc at the high school, becomes the Smoker twins armchair with her best friend Jas, gets mauled by the schools hockey captain; her enemy... the Sex Gods \\"Snogging Buddy\\", and gets sent home in a wheelbarrow with a sprained ankle. Georgia seems to have nothing work right and go her way.... Almost.It portrays how abnormal a teen's life could be and to be thankful of how normal our families are... no matter how strange they may be. Some may struggle to understand the British lingo (though it comes with a glossary in the back) and if you haven't watched Monty Python.... The humor. For strong readers it may be completed in a few hours so it's mid level. But all around it's all a great laugh, a good buy for eight bucks, or free at the library."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"This book was the best book I have ever read. It related to my life very well. The girl on there that was the narrator had almost the exact same thoughs that I had. I liked the way the narrator wanted the sex god and the wau she tried to get him with all her different sly skeems. I recommend this book to anyone who has a troubled relationship with others. At the end of the book the narrator chose exactly who I would have chosen and when she chose him it almost made me cry. The process was so beautiful I felt a tear disperse from my eye, down my cheek, and off my chin."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"Even as a 40+ year old, I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel to Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging. I read the first before placing it in a middle school library and knew right away it would be a hit with the teen crowd, but I also recommended it to several adults. As soon as I knew the next installment was available, I ordered it immediately. The sequel manages to maintain the originality and charm of the first. Georgia's quite a girl--a typical teen, but with a dry sense of humor and an ability to poke fun at herself. The supporting cast returns in full force--Robbie,AKA the Sex God, her friends, family, and of course, Angus who, in this book, suffers along with Georgia through the throes of love. Just as in the first, I found myself laughing out loud, finally giving way to tears. All in all, this is a delightful book that can be enjoyed, certainly by its' intended teen audience, but also by a slightly older crowd."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"Oh, to be young again! Reading On the Bright Side had much the same effect on me as its predecessor, Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging. It was totally reminiscient of my by-gone days; if fact, I pulled out my old high school diaries and laughed myself silly. Georgia is the epitome of a typical 14-year-old high school student, British or otherwise, and readers of all ages will most definitely relate to this wonderful character.This time around, Georgia has landed the Sex God, aka Robbie, boy of her dreams. But with his being almost 18, the relationship is short-lived and he breaks up with her via letter. Well, of all things! Georgia just will NOT stand for this. Thus ensues Operation Elastic Band, Georgia's no-fail plan to get Robbie back. The results are, as expected, spectacularly funny as only Georgia can offer.Readers will no doubt have a great time with this novel - it's just plain, harmless fun. Complete with hilarious observations and sparking with classic British humor, On the Bright Side is unforgettable. I cannot say enough good things. Clear a space on your bookshelf for this one."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"Georgia is like any other 14 year old - which is why I realized that this author had practically written a book about me! Louise Rennison's writing is easy to read and she presents the characters in such a way that you can relate to them instantly. After I read Angus, Thongs, and Full-Frontal Snogging, I went on amazon.com every day to see when the second one was coming out and waited in anguish for a week for my book to come. All I can say is read this book! I thought it was even funnier than the first one, and my only complaint is that it should have taken place over a whole year, like the first one. Georgia's further adventures with the Sex God, wet Lindsay, Jas, etc. will make you laugh so hard that you'll cry. If you laugh a lot, don't read it in school - I had to bite my hand to keep from laughing, and in my next class I fell off my chair.

Well, I wasn't too impressed. Sure, the book is charming like its predecessor, but I just didn't find myself laughing as hard this time. What made the difference?First, I think the novelty wore off. You can only hear so much of this strange teenage slang before it begins to sound forced and silly. Second, I wasn't pleased with the way the whole New Zealand issue was handled. I would have liked to see Georgia's adventures in \\"Kiwi-a-gogo\\" land, as she calls it. However, I can see why the family never went. The author obviously didn't know enough about New Zealand to properly write about it; this is evident in the continuous stereotypes about New Zealand: people sitting around eating bugs, geothermal vents that apparently burst from the ground and injure people on a regular basis. Give me a break. Third, Georgia is unlikeable in this book. She's rather mean to her friends, and seems to be getting dumber as she progresses through school (one would expect that a British teenager her age would know that Sweden is not on the other side of the world). Did I miss something? She doesn't seem to be quite the same character she was before.I'm still planning on reading the third book in the series, but I can only hope that it is better than this second foray into Georgia Nicolson's life."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"&quot;On the Bright Side&quot; is the daily diary of the (mis)adventures of Georgia Nicholson, typical teenage girl.

When my teacher first recommended the book to me, I was a little skeptical because I thought it would be a bit too girlish, and I was right! As they say in the book, \\"What in the name of pantyhose\\" was I doing reading On the Brightside, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God.The book is about a girl, Georgia Nicolson, and her adventures trying to stay/get back with Robbie AKA the Sex God. Meanwhile, Georgia is dealing with having to move to New Zealand, trying to make Robbie jealous, and her conversion to Buddhism after G-d wouldn't give her what she wanted.Although I didn't like the book very much, some parts were very comical and entertaining. My favorite part was the first 50 pages because i found them very funny. When I read this part, I thought I would like the book, but I became tired of Georgia's girlish ways and her constant thinking of boys. Another thing I liked about the book was when I didn't know some English English \\"lingo\\", I could refer to the glossary at the back of the book. The glossary contains words such as nuddy-pants,(nude colored pants)fag, (cigarette of course)and snogging.(kissing)I give this book two stars out of five because nunga-nungas, gorgy boys, and the snogging of a Sex God are just not my bag. However, I do recommend this book to all girls because I think they'll \\"fancy\\" it!"},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"This book really bugged me. Yes, I giggled at some of the funny stuff (Angus and Libby are great), but come on--the plot is thin to nonexistent, the parent-kid relationships are appalling, the way the supposed friends treat each other is awful, and worst of all, the obsession with sexual activity is scary.Do people really think it's OK for a 14-year old girl to be sneaking out to clubs, parks, friend's homes, so she can make out with boys??!?I think Georgia is shallow, dim-witted, and self-centered. She has made the classic mistake of thinking that just because boys like to kiss her and feel her up, they like *her*.Georgia is every stereotype about girls we don't want kept alive: nasty to her friends, stupid, and convinced that sex with boys is the most important thing in her life.C'mon, girls, there are a million other books to read with *real* girls as main characters.Parents: talk with your daughters about the attitudes in this book.

It's the continuation of Georgia's struggles with life and love and the threat of moving to New Zealand due to the fact that her &quot;Vati&quot; can't get a job in England.

Boy, was I wrong. In the first book in the series, Georgia was a pleasantly quirky, self-involved teenage girl. She reminded me of several girls I knew in middle school. In that book she was actually fairly realistic and interesting.The Georgia in this book is exactly the same, except she isn't as quirky and is 150% more self-involved. I found her to be a complete brat and if she was someone I knew in real life, I would avoid her at all costs.While this book is pretty funny and amusing, it is definitely not a great piece of literature. The characters are one-dimensional and I really did not care about any of them except for Georgia's cat, Angus, who reminded me of a dog I used to have. And, the plot was thin and unrealistic.Maybe it's just me, but a good book needs to have a strong, interesting plotline. It must also have characters the reader can relate to and care about. But, then again maybe that's just me.Ok, I'm done. Sorry if this didn't make sense, it was pretty much just a collection of my scattered thoughts on the book. Feel free to call this 'unhelpful' if you couldn't understand it or are a huge fan of the book. ;)"},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"Georgia is like a typical 14 year old who likes someone so much that they cant tell the difference between lust and love. She likes the SG (Sex God a.k.a Robbie). Her friend Jan likes the SG's brother and, Jan tells him how Georgia likes Robbie. She cant tell if she has love for him of if it is another crush. When Robbie decides that he is too old for her, Robbie breaks up with Georgia. She did not like it to much so, Georgia's way of making the SG jealous she goes out with a guy named Dave. In which she calls him \\"Dave the laugh\\". Well when she finds out that it really does not bother Robbie and that he is talking to his ex girlfriend, she gets mad a dumps Dave. Dave did not take it really well. Well we cant forget to mention Georgia's little sister Libby, who shoves Barbie and other things in Georgia's' bed. The cat Angus, is still causing trouble with the neighbors and their poodles. Angus supposedly had the neighbors held up in their green house, and the neighbors had the cops come and get the cat. Her dad Vati, is coming back home from New Zealand. In the end she does not move to New Zealand, what Georgia calls Kiwi - a - Gogo.I liked the book it seemed really original and it used a lot of British terms so I learned new words and it describes what really goes on in a teenagers mind. It also captures the real drama that is in a teenager's life also."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"A book review by Megan Seeds onOn the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex Godby Louise Rennisonfor the seventh hour English class of Mr. Tom FeltieGeorgia Nicolson seems to be just another normal protagonist from yet another diary-style book. She's got a mom, dad, sister, uncle and cat who all seem to be parts of this teenage, English girl's life. But, this family isn't so close to standard after all. Considering her language and vocabulary are all authentic British aphorisms, her sister is near 'mad,' her uncle is 'bald as an egg in leather pants' (in fact Libby calls him 'Eggy' at one point), her cat (Angus) has the body and 'ferociocity' of a large bulldog (he tries to eat Mr. and Mrs. Next Door's poodles and yet he lets Libby drag him around with out mauling her hand), and her parents are... well...you know, they're perfectly stereotypical parents.All this adds up to make a book of confessions full of 'hilariocity.' To me, at least. Because of the type of humor in On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God, it would not be very suitable for any audience over the age of eighteen, under the age of ten and not of the female gender. This fact makes the book less desirable to me. That fact also discourages me to encourage others to read it.I feel that at my age, I should be reading novels that will help me on the path to the great schools I hope to attend; this book wouldn't really help me in that area. Although it would help one who needed to know about teenage life in the united kingdom, it doesn't help many others. After I read it I felt less mature because of some of the scatological humor that the book includes.Overall, it was a very fun book and a good read. But, it is not apropos for a very diverse audience. If you want to learn something out of what you read, On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God is not for you. (Sorry!) But if you want a quickly moving book that will make you laugh (and you are a 10 to 17 year old girl) you are sure to enjoy On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God. (Did I mention I liked the book?)"},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"This sequel leaves off exactly where the first book left us.

It has so many emotions that many teenagers go through crammed into one little book. A lot of it was hilarious and real. I could kind of relate to Georgia, the main character.There were numerous parts that I thought were the best. I especially liked how Georgia and Robbie got back together in the end. I also like the creativity of Georgia's plan to make Robbie notice her. And her attempt to get back together with him.Throughout the book I could picture everything. It was all so vivid, and I had my own idea of what everything looked like. The characters were described really well according to Georgia's eye, and I knew the plot was well thought of.

She's clueless sometimes. She's cranky much of the time. She thinks her parents are from another planet and gets fed up with her friends, whom she thinks are unbelievably selfish--though they are just like her.The twist here is that Georgia's parents have decided to move from England to New Zealand. Tragedy! Not when she's just gotten a boyfriend! The book follows Georgia's efforts to try to dissuade her parents, keep her sister out of her room, get her wacko cat Angus off her leg, and maintain a beautifully rendered teenage relationship with the hunkalicious Robbie.

Like the first one, I read the entire novel, which is written as a series of diary entries from Georgia, in a few hours, frequently laughing out loud as a I did so.A sort of junior &quot;Bridgett Jones' Diary,&quot; &quot;On The Bright Side,&quot; picks up where &quot;Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging&quot; left off, with Georgia the girlfriend of a &quot;sex god&quot; (17-year-old Robbie) with whom she's gone to &quot;number six on the snogging scale&quot; (French kissing). But Georgia's romantic bliss doesn't last long as Robbie promptly decides his new love is too young for him and takes up with his ex, &quot;Wet Lindsay.&quot;Desperate to get Robbie back, while avoiding a dreaded move to New Zealand and keeping her Mum from falling for the new &quot;young George Clooney&quot; look-alike doctor at the surgery, Georgia consults &quot;Men Are From Mars and Women Are From Venus&quot; for advice as well as her friend Jas.If you are now or ever have been a teenage girl, you'll love this terrifically funny book!

It explains basically everything in a teen girls life. This book rates pretty good between all other books. I would deffinatly read this book agien.

I went into a laughing hyena fit that sent my sister jumping six feet in the air when I first read it! Georgia Nicholson is very vapid, very, very shallow and very, very, very cruel to others. That is what makes her so funny along with her general outlook on the universe that it is designed to plauge her life of squeaking, peeing sisters, parents who just don't understand and friends who always have boyfriends. A lot of fourteen-year-olds--boys and girls, but mostly girls--can identify with at least a fraction of Georgia's character--I know I can. In a way, Geogia's tales are a story of how not to act. Lots of snogging, vapidity and just plain humor, I recommend this to anyone who wants a good laugh and a light hearted read.Blessed Be!!"},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"This book is laugh out loud, hysterically funny!!! You really actually feel like you're in the mind of Georgia and I found it in some parts relating to my own life. It reminded me partly of \\"The Princess Diaries\\".

If you're looking for a light-hearted book or just want to escape from your life, \\"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson\\" is perfect for you!

That's what the main character, Georgia Nicolson, has to try and get through. Georgia is a 14 year old girl living in England (in the present day). The book starts out with Georgia living out her perfect dream. She is he girlfriend of a SEX GOD. But soon, she loses him o her enemy, Wet Lindsey. In an effort to get him back, she starts dating one of the Sex God's friends, David the Laugh. Throughout the confusion of that she has to deal with her poodle attacking cat, her (married) mother flirting with Dr. \\"George Clooney\\", and some definitely air-headed friends.This is my favorite book I have ever read. But, I do have a favorite part in particular. You have to understand though, I had been laid over in the Kansas City Airport for 6 hours and I was completely sleep deprived. Anyways, my favorite part is when Georgia described how her little sister was sitting on her lap and she \\"let off the smelliest, loudest fart known to humanity. It came out of her bum-oly with such force that she lifted off my knee. Like a hovercraft\\".After reading this book, it is clear to see that the main idea of this book is just learning how to deal with growing up and moving past the obstacles that life throws at you. You have to make all the wrong choices to finally see why the good choice is the best choice.I loved how the problems Georgia went through were not only hysterical, but could also be recognized by all. The only thing that I would change about the book would be the format. I don't really like the whole diary-entry format. I believe that girls between the ages of 11-17 should read this book. They would relate to the trials and triumphs of Georgia the best."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"On the Bright Side, I'm now the Girlfriend of a Sex God:further confessions of Georgia Nicolson is a book about a teenager named Georgia Nicolson. This book is her diary in which she writes exactly how she feels. Georgia has a rather large cat, Angus, a bestfriend who overly obsesses over her boyfriend Tom, and a Sex God (a.k.a Robbie Tom's older brother). All in all Georgia lives an exciting life which makes for a terrific book.My favorite part of this book is when Georgia is running out to the field and she just lets everything go. She wasn't worrying about how her nose looked or who could see her. I loved this part because she was finally just being herself. Also, she didn't care about what people thought about her anymore.I would recommend this book for anyone who is looking for a good laugh. However, if you're looking to read a little at a time I wouldnt read this book. This book is the kind of book that once you start reading you can't stop. It is a hilarious teenager reality and no one can go wrong by choosing this book."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"Pretty much the same basic premiss as _Angus_ but spanning a shorter period of time.

Still pretty tame language, etc. Suitable for a 14 year old (as that's hold old Georgia is) there is some teen related issues, but they are dealt with like a standard 14 year old--making fun of them.Totally fun read."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"On the brightside, I'm now the girlfriend of a sex god, is the second book in the Georgia Nicolson Series. Its about a teenage girl from England who is obseesed with this guy [the sex god] but he is much older then her. Along her journey to get him to notice her, she runs into a few other problems with her friends, family, school, and just life.My favorite part of the book is when Georgia is goingb out with \\"Dave the laugh\\". Se seems like she wants to impress him and go out with him, but whenever Robbie [the sex god] comes up, she acts as if she doesn't have boyfriend.I like this book for many reasons. One reason is because this girl is about the same as I am, but since she lives in a different country it seems like we have nothing in common, yet we do. I also like this book because Georgia uses all these funny \\"s;ang\\" terms. It's funny to read the book and understand it but then a word like \\"tosser\\" or \\"lurgy\\" can totally throw you off. This book may get confusing at times, but it's a great read."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"This book is about a girl named Georgia who has a perfect life except she is moving to New Zealand with her family and has to leave all of it behind.

Robbie is a tough nut to crack but if Georgia tries hard enough she can do anything.I like this book because it is a book that you can't put down and you have to keep reading till it's done. This wasn't my favorite book but it was pretty good. What I dislike about the book it is kind of confusing because the story takes place in Britain and they use words that are confusing and hard to understand.

She described her exactly. This would also be a good way to describe this book. Georgia is a fourteen year old girl who becomes the girlfriend of a popular 17 year old boy named Robbie. She stresses horribly over the so called relationship and when he's going to call her because she has unfortunate news, she and her family must visit her dad in Whangamata, New Zealand for the summer. She reacts like any teenager would and throws a tantrum. Just when I became annoyed with this melodrama (wanting the book to progress further), the author Louise Rennison sets up another scene. Robbie breaks up with her because she's too young. Enter Operation Red Herring. Georgia makes it her mission to a)show him that she is not immature and b)spark his intrigue, curiosity, and interest in her to want her back. Will operation Red Herring work? You must read it to find out. This is an enjoyable book written especially for preteen or teen girls. It is beautifully written in a moment by moment form as if you're reading her diary. Although difficult to read at times due to British cultural language and made up language, there's a handy glosary in the back of the book to keep you up to par. I think it's handy to pass on this tip since I read the book all the way through and didn't find it till the end. In fact, anyone might appreciate reading Georgia's adventures. Her melodrama, after all, was engaging and one really wants to know if she gets the SG aka Sex God (Robbie) in the end. Read it and find out!"},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"Georgia is back with a hilarious bang!

I loved reading about Georgia Nicolson's experiences as a teenager, including issues from snagging the &quot;Sex God&quot; to having her sister Libby leaving &quot;wet nappies&quot; in her bed. Written in diary format, this book shows you how to keep a happy face in the toughest situations. No matter what happens to Georgia, she takes it in stride-even the looming move to the &quot;less important side of the world&quot; (New Zealand). This is a &quot;fabbity fab-fab&quot; book that will have you laughing your heart out."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"This book was so awesome!!! I'm 13 years old and I can very well relate to the main character, Georgia. Rennison does a fantastic job remembering how it was like when you are a teenager. I recomend this book for anyone 12-18!!! The only part I had trouble understanding was the words they use in England that aren't in the glossary. I learned a lot about those words though! You should buy this book and the prequel, too!!!!"},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"I was very unsure how this one would set up against it's predesessor but it's brilliant.

Louise Rennison's writing is easy to read and she presents the characters in such a way that you can relate to them instantly. After I read Angus, Thongs, and Full-Frontal Snogging, I went on amazon.com every day to see when the second one was coming out and waited in anguish for a week for my book to come. All I can say is read this book! I thought it was even funnier than the first one, and my only complaint is that it should have taken place over a whole year, like the first one. Georgia's further adventures with the Sex God, wet Lindsay, Jas, etc. will make you laugh so hard that you'll cry. If you laugh a lot, don't read it in school - I had to bite my hand to keep from laughing, and in my next class I fell off my chair. Rennison's books are destined to become teen girl classics. So, just read this hilarious sequel and try not to roll off the bed, get in trouble, or experience any other side effects of the book."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"After reading ANGUS, THONGS and FULL-FRONTAL SNOGGING I couldn't wait to read this book, and I am very happy to announce that I was not in the least bit disappointed. Georgia Nicholson is just as entertaining as before, and her diary is just as much fun to read. She has to deal with being forced to go to &quot;Kiwi-a-Gogo Land&quot; (aka New Zeland), executing &quot;Operation Rubberband&quot;, being around her crazy friend Jas, and a number of other things, while also being back at school under the tyrannical tutleage of Slim &amp; co., and at the mercy of the &quot;Bummer Twins.&quot;The writing is excellent, since, unlike in most books that are supposed to be the diary of a teenager, the style of writing is kept realistic. Georgia is neither profoundly deep nor repulsively shallow. She's pretty normal, if there is such a thing. The one real problem that I have with this book is that I can't really relate to any of the characters because their way of life seems so completely different. Maybe it's because I'm from the USA and this is a very British story. It doesn't bother me all that much, but it is a little weird, and is the reason that I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5.Anyone who read and enjoyed ANGUS, THONGS AND FULL-FRONTAL SNOGGING will definitely get a kick out of reading this book. Probably teenage girls will enjoy this and AT+FFS more than any other group of people. The only thing left to say is thank goodness Louise Rennison is already working on two more installments of Georgia's diary, because after all:&quot;What in the name of pantyhose is going to happen next?&quot;"},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"I really liked this book.I liked it because, Georgia has problems that most 13 year old girls go through.I understand everything thats going on in it. I didnt really like it because,it had some big words in it,and it also had words that they made up like \\"snogging\\" and \\"wet\\".The main charecters are Georgia,Jools,mutti,vatti,and libbs. I would recomend this book for kids ages 12 and up. You could really learn alot,of what teenage girls are going through. This book is about a Girl named Georgia and how she is ubsessed with a guy,and he leaves her for another girl. Her best friend Jools is really annoying and is ubsessed with school and her boyfriend.

Georgia is also not getting any smarter in school. As far as i'm concerned the barette thing was really unneeded in this book.

I consider these books as a version of my life if told by my utterly hilarious best friend - somehow, Georia is achingly funny, but still very real. I love it. Love it, love it. It is my firm (and highly bossy ;) ) opinion that ANYONE who reads ANY GENRE will, so long as they are actually BREATHING and capable of LAUGHING, ADORE these books.

I read it so quick that I had to read it again to actually get most of it. Yet Georgia is now like a sister to me. The thousands of ways we're alike surprises me and every time she gets into trouble, I always feel for her. It's a grippy book that you'll be able to read over and over.

I found the British humor of the book refreshing and enjoyable, and was able to sympathize with several of Georgia's frustrations. While the novel's ending was not as satisfying as its predecessor's, it was still a great read. Georgia's methods of dealing with her ferocious cat, boy-crazy best friend (not that she isn't a bit boy crazy herself), and parents who just do not understand her are fun, comical, and pure teenager.

This is truly the life of a young teenage girl.On the bright side I'm now the girlfriend of a sex god is one of the most hilarious books I have ever had the chance to read. Louise Renison who writes the book is also the author of the rest of the books in the series. Renison takes a look into the life of a young girl going through adolescence. I really like how Renison keeps you laughing throughout the whole book. She truly captures a young girl's life in the process from child to woman hood. The characters are so real! It sounds like a girl's diary...wait it is. I love how it is in diary form so the author can use words that are more slang than formal. In the back of the book there is a glossary of all the words that Georgia uses that we Americans wouldn't necessarily know.If you loved Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging you'll absolutely love the further confessions of it, On the bright side I'm now the girl friend of a sex god."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"This book was just an awesome sequel.It is totally up there with the first book.While these books may not have much depth or meaning, they're not meant to.They're all about laughs,laughs,laughs x1000, and just feel-good girly fun.Every girl needs to have these babies!"},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"My 11 y/o daughter picked this out and I thought I had better \\"preview\\" it.

She is 14. I never wanted to put the book down because i wanted to find out what will happen next. Louise Rennison has a great writing style. I read all of the Georgia Nicolson books. The books are consecutive, but they are a bit confusing. When I read the book, I felt a bit older, and I was in Georgia's life. Georgia's life is isolated except with her friends. Her parents ignore her, and her sister is crazy. As i mentioned, her boyfriend dumps her, so she tries to do the Red GHerring to get him back."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"I thought Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging was a riot, so when On the Bright Side... came out I couldn't wait to read it. I was slightly disappointed. Georgia was always a bit on the selfish side in the first book, but it took on all new meaning in the second. I no longer felt I could relate with Georgia, she became the annoying, self-centered, never-was-all-that-close-anyway friend that always hangs around and ruins all the fun for everyone else. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the book and even laughed out loud at some points (like the nose comfy or Angus' new love interest), but I've always found that a book is much more enjoyable if the reader is able to relate to the main character and I lost that somehow in this sequel."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"Georgia Nicolsen is so blunt and funny and real, that you just can't help laugh at her funny outlook on life and feel like you know her. About half the eighth grade has read my copy of this book (and the first one...also great) anda can't stop telling me how much they like it! Yes, the price is a little steep, but it's not worth it to wait till next year when the cheaper paperback copy comes out. Besides, you'll need the hard cover because a paperback would wear out when you read it over and over and over..."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"..or maybe I just wish I had these books when I was a 14 year old American girl? Georgia is an absolute hoot, and so are her mates. Every character is well-developed (as seen from Georgia's perspective, though), and the journal-entry style just sucks the reader in until suddenly the book is finished. Georgia herself is extremely realistic, completely self-centered, but also marvelously lovable. Much appreciated is the British slang glossary at the end, which Georgia has written herself, in her own unique style. Excellent book for teens and pre-teens and a nice break from reading depressing things for 28-year-old me."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"I am far from a teen, but I absolutely love Georgia. I was surprised that I liked the first book, but this one I knew I would love as well, especially having stalked the sex god and aquiring him :) Georgia's diary is such a good read. funny and very entertaining."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"If you don't enjoy laughing hysterically until your sides hurt, do not read On the Bright Side, I'm now the Girlfriend of a Sex God. Even when your \\"sheer desperadoes,\\" it will have you bursting into laughter regardless of whether or not you're in a public place.I've noticed some of the reviews indicate not to purchase this book, because \\"Georgia [the main character] is every stereotype about girls we don't want to keep alive.\\" Should we notify the author of her moral indignity of publishing such trashy material? Could she be oblivious to the fact? Is she implying that young girls should act this way? Of course not. Anyone who believes such ridiculous statements has apparently never studied literature and has certainly never studied satire, which finds its humor in holding up to ridicule the vices and follies of mankind.I read this novel as a fourteen-year-old, like Georgia herself. I did not feel at all compelled to attempt to create a lunchbox out of my hair beret, and I wasn't convinced that I was going to be knocked out by my own \\"nunga-nungas.\\" Likewise, I recognized that \\"snogging\\" boys does not bring happiness. This book showed me how silly some of the teenage fads were, and after reading it, I was less inclined to be a part of them.I entirely recommend buying this book either for yourself or your teenage daughters. Rather than encouraging stereotypical behavior, I believe this book discourages it, and in the process, it brings a smile to your face."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"The only thing I am going to say here is that Dave the Laugh is the best boyfriend ever. I have no idea why, for so long, I thought the Sex God Robbie was a good choice for Georgia. Dave is a total dream boat......and yes, I know I am twice his age.This snippet is for my present and future entertainment:\\"8:35 pmYou can make a sort of nose sling out of pair of knickers [panties:]! Like a sort of antigravity device. You put a leg hole over each ear and the middley bit supports your nose. It's quite comfy. I'm not saying that it looks very glamorous. I'm just saying it's comfy.8:40 pmIt's not something I would wear outside of the privacy of my own bedroom.8:45 pmIt's a good view from my windowsill. I can see Mr. Next Door with his stupid poodles. He's all happy now that Angus has gone off poodle baiting in favor of the Burmese sex kitten.8:46 pmOh hello, here comes Mark, my ex, the breast fondler. At this rate he will be the one and only fondler. I will die unfondled. He must be coming home from footie practice. I don't know how I could ever have thought about snogging him; he wears extremely tragic trousers. He is looking up at my window. He has seen me. He's stopped walking and is looking up at my window. Staring at me. Well, you know what they say - once a boy magnet always a boy magnet. I'm just going to stare back in a really cool way. All right, Mr. Big Gob, Mr. Dumper. I might be the dumpee but you still can't take your eyes away from me though, can you??? I still fascinate him. He's just looking up at me. Just staring and staring.Mesmerized by me.8:50 pmOh my god! I am still wearing my nose hammock made out of knickers.8:56 pmMark will tell all his mates.8:57 pmHe will now call me a knicker-sniffer as well as a lesbian...\\""},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"Okay, so On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God picks up almost exactly where Angus, Thongs, and Full-Frontal Snogging left off (two days later to be specific). As Georgia continues her diary, she is very disillusioned by the prospect of going to visit her father in New Zealand on \\"the other (useless) side of the universe\\" instead of having time to spend (snogging) with Robbie--the Sex God.Like the first book in this series, this one basically just follows a few months in Georgia's life. Mayhem continues to follow Georgia as she and her friend devise new Beret-wearing methods at school among other kinds of mischief. This includes some chaos on the hockey field (the first book featured a rather disastrous tennis match). Rennison writes Georgia as a bit of a spaz--always thinking about herself and her appearance, heaping scorn upon Robbie's more studious ex--so it's nice to see her being athletic without really trying and without any ulterior motive.Meanwhile, Georgia also has to figure out how to get back in Robbie's good graces when he once again decides that she is too young for him. Part of her plan? Maturiosity and Glaceriosity. Yes.Basically anything funny that came up in the first book has been revisited in this one. A personal favorite: Georgia's continued bewilderment when faced with the phrase \\"see you later.\\" (Does it mean \\"see you later\\" or something else? No one knows.) There are a lot of developments in this volume in terms of inter-character relations (Georgia, her friends, Robbie, and so on). But there isn't as much intra-character development. Again. By the end of the book, Georgia does have some new quandaries to think about (is it a problem that the SG doesn't make her laugh for instance), but it's still too early to tell if her new introspection will lead to a bit of enlightenment.By the time I read this book (in a day), I was basically over my qualms about liking Georgia but feeling like I shouldn't. The plots are simple and fun, Georgia makes me laugh. It's fine.That said, I have noticed that, like a few other laugh-out-loud funny books for teens, this one gets a lot of the humor from Georgia having kind of low self-esteem. A running theme in both books is Georgia bemoaning her ugliness as a result of her large nose. It doesn't really impact the story, or send any message about beauty ideals or anything, I just wish Georgia could be a little more sure of herself. All of her friends (and snogging partners) seem to indicate that people think Georgia is pretty cool. I wish that she would figure that out as well. Maybe in the next book . . ."},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"This book is just as funny as the first and all of these books are amazing"},{"Title":"On the Bright Side, I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God: Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","review":"Poor Georgia!

How will it all work out?Georgia continues with her abnormal life, forming new relationships and still battling her love for Robbie, while more arguments with her parents, Jas, and craziness ensue.I couldn't put this book down and can't count the number of times i laughed out loud while i was reading.
