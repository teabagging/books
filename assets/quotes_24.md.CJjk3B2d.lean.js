John Milton is a famous author that lived in England during his life span from 1608 to 1674. Milton led a very interesting life ranging from his suspensions from Cambridge to his role in the English Civil War. John Milton is most known for his book, \\"Paradise Lost.\\" This book explains the fall of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden.Edmund Fuller does an excellent job in portraying the thoughts of John Milton. The reader understands the excitement and anticipation as Milton waits in the lobby to see Galileo Galilei. The reader also experiences sadness when Milton can not win the heart of a singer from Italy.The only complaint I have about this book is that Fuller does not tell often enough when an event happens in Milton's life. This leaves the reader often to guess the year in which an event happened. Other than that, Edmund Fuller does an excellent job explaining the life of John Milton."},{"Title":"Managing Change and Transition","review":"This is one of several paperbacks in the \\"Essentials\\" series, each of which offers \\"cutting edge\\" thinking on a major business subject. Mike Beer served as the adviser to Richard Luecke while he wrote this volume. Brief information about both is provided. There are seven chapters following an Introduction in which Luecke observes that \\"Accepting the necessity and inevitability of change enables [all companies and their decision-makers] to see times of transition not as threats but as opportunities -- opportunities for reinventing the company and its culture.\\" Indicators include a merger, acquisition, or divestiture; the launch of a new product or service; a new leader; or a new technology. \\"In this book you will learn how to manage change constructively, and how to help your company, division, and people deal with the upheavals of change. You'll also learn practical things you can do to make change initiatives more successful and less painful for the people you manage.\\"Each of the seven chapters (which are arranged in a logical sequence) focuses on a separate but related component of effective management of change and transition. For example, in Chapter 2, Luecke explains why leaders must be respected and effective for change to happen, the role of motivation in change-readiness, the importance of a nonhierarchical culture in implementing change, and then offers several \\"tips\\" on how to become \\"change ready.\\" To me, one of the most valuable chapters is the sixth (in which Luecke examines the four stages of reaction to change (i.e. shock, defensive retreat, acknowledgment, and acceptance and adaptation), how individuals can help themselves navigate change, how managers can help employees cope with change, and alternative ways for managers to think about change registers.At the conclusion of each of the seven chapters, Luecke offers an especially useful \\"Summing Up\\" section which facilitates a periodic review of key points. I also appreciate the provision of Appendix A (\\"Useful Implementation Tools\\") and Appendix B (\\"How to Choose and Work with Consultants\\"), both of which provide basic but sound information to supplement material covered in the previous chapters.Those who share my high regard for this volume are urged to check out Jim O'Toole's Leading Change, William Bridges' Transitions and Managing Transitions and Jon Katzenbach's Real Change Leaders, all of which are available in paperback editions."},{"Title":"Managing Change and Transition","review":"Institutional change can be scary, but this Harvard Business Essentials entry does a solid job of demystifying it. The book provides immediately applicable conceptual tools, from broad theoretical frameworks to specific tables and checklists you can use during the change process. It pushes readers to take action, but only action they have planned, tested and researched. Its suggestions have all been shown to work in many situations. The book's brevity makes it easy to use, but it also means that a number of complex issues are only sketched out, leaving the reader to figure out how to best apply them. We, therefore, recommend this competent starting text to managers who are just beginning to think about guiding change, and to experienced change managers who can extrapolate its ideas and will welcome it as a focused reference."},{"Title":"Managing Change and Transition","review":"This book came in really handy for my dissertation on change management.

I recommend for anyone wishing to carry out organizational changes, even simple they may be."},{"Title":"Managing Change and Transition","review":"While I have read and reviewed several books on the subject of change management I find two emerging positions. The one side that speaks to change from an institutional theoretical position and with me being a practical and seasoned change professional I find them good but not necessarily good in their relevance to the real word. The other position is coming from those offering basic observations, tools, practices and methodologies that can be applied in any real world situation. The ADKAR model and the books that come out of that camp are informative and useful. They come from those in the trenches with credible experience of having been there. This book, \\"Managing Change and Transition\\" is of the latter group even though it is coming from the Harvard Business School Press. Do not fear that this is an all-academic endeavor because it is not. Managing change is a critical skill for anyone that needs to lead, manage or motivate people to take action. It is a must-have skill for all managers and those qualified to be leaders. This book will help you manage change."},{"Title":"British Enfield Rifles, Lee-Enfield No. 4 and No. 5 Rifles, Vol. 2 (For Collectors Only)","review":"have a enfield rifle, so It had a lot of info about my rifle. learned great deal about the history of lee enfield rifles."},{"Title":"British Enfield Rifles, Lee-Enfield No. 4 and No. 5 Rifles, Vol. 2 (For Collectors Only)","review":"The late Charles \\"Skip\\" Stratton wrote several books on the longest-serving British service rifles, and had planned two more before going to his reward in 2006.

Therefore, he goes into detail about markings, construction, wood used, serial number ranges and so forth, and places line drawings throughout adjacent to the written points he is making.The book does not have copious history or extensive photographs, but for the price is very well worth the money for the information gleaned.

Like the Mosin Nagant and M1 Garand manuals, this one goes into very great detail about the different variants, how and where to find markings, etc., and yet it never overwhelms the reader like some manuals do. It's a bit light on the historic side, but definitely an improvement over what you typically find with other how-to manuals.

To alleviate this the city has constructed a huge entertainment complex, \\"Carnevalle\\", where harried citizens may lose themselves and their cares in extravagant diversion. Here we meet our mysterious, masked hero who will guide us through his world impelled by his own terrible and urgent needs.Vance likes a mystery and this one should keep you guessing.Also, as Science Fiction, it is a very early exploration of the themes involved - at least twenty years ahead of anyone else.Did I like it?

The art work is superb and the interview with Donald Turnupseed tells us what so many fans like myself long expected.Last but not least I loved the section called 'What they said about Jim' - you will not be disappointed either.

Ang's \\"Tao of Photography\\" is apparently aimed at such a photographer. Unfortunately his aim isn't very good.The title of this book suggests that by examining the ancient Asian philosophy, Tao (often translated as \\"the Way\\"), and incorporating it into one's photographic approach, one will open new doorways to creativity. The suggestion is not unreasonable since many of the great photographers of the world have suggested adopting photographic approaches that sound remarkably like the Tao.Unfortunately Ang never really explores many facets of Taoism other then Yin and Yang, a principle that suggests that there are two possible approaches to almost everything in life and that the wise person threads his way between to follow the Way. And even when he refers to this dualism, it is only to suggest that it exists. I would have hoped that he would show us sign posts for the Way. For example he notes that there is a relationship between film speed and film grain, i.e., faster films are usually grainier. But how we are to transform that knowledge into creativity is not suggested, or at least, not usefully.Moreover, the book doesn't seem to be well organized or sure of its audience. Ideas and sections appear thrown together randomly, as if from a stream of consciousness. And the ideas may apply to a beginning photographer or an advanced photographer. For example a comparison of range finder cameras to single lens reflexes would be old hat to an advanced photographer, while a discussion of the curves function in Photoshop seems designed to scare the beginner.I found particularly disturbing a number of sections of the book that Ang calls workshops. I expected some kind of exercises here but instead encountered a few more hackneyed aphorisms like \\"The Tao photographer sees opportunities but does not force results\\" and \\"The Tao photographer understands that being awake means knowing when to sleep\\".The Tao is not about technique, it is about philosophy. If you want a book that suggests how the Tao can be incorporated into your photography read \\"The Tao of Photography: Seeing beyond Seeing\\" by Philippe L. Gross and S.I. Shapiro. On the other hand if you don't want to consider changing your way of living but want to work on your creativity read \\"Photography and the Art of Seeing\\" by Freeman Patterson. For outdoor photographers, I would suggest you look at Galen Rowell's \\"The Inner Game of Outdoor Photography.\\""},{"Title":"Tao of Photography: Unlock your Creativity Using the Wisdom of the East","review":"Though the title may capture the audience, the book itself is not much different from other photo technique books. I bought this book for some nice photo in their but that only the photo I found at bookstore. Other photo are completely mundane. I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone. If you want to see more art appreciation book, you may look at Freeman Patterson book."},{"Title":"Tao of Photography: Unlock your Creativity Using the Wisdom of the East","review":"I found many very good essays in this book.

As a result the book is rather dated (especially comments like, \\"You can think of digital cameras as being a little like the fast-food of photography.\\") His photos are Camera Club OK, but leave you asking, \\"If this is what Tao did for Ang, does it have anything to offer me?\\" If you want an introduction to Tao and photography, buy Tao of Photography: Seeing Beyond Seeing by Philippe L. Gross, S.I. Shapiro."},{"Title":"Tao of Photography: Unlock your Creativity Using the Wisdom of the East","review":"I think reviewers are too harsh on this book. I have been working with photography for 20 years. I am still a beginner, and so am always interested in why a picture works or not. Reading Ang's book has helped me go back to photos I've taken with a new eye. The process helps me think through why I took the picture and why it does or doesn't work for me. Having some technical data next to his photos helps me better understand why or how a similar attempt of my own might work better. As with any book on an art form, the goal is get you moving on your own project. I would reccomend this book for that. It's also an exploration of rules and their modest place in a process."},{"Title":"Tao of Photography: Unlock your Creativity Using the Wisdom of the East","review":"In my opinion this book does not serve a functional purpose for either beginning nor advanced photographers. It seems as if the author had a pile of unused photos (mostly snapshots, taken while traveling)and decided to write something about the pile. He mentioned that it took 3 months to assemble the book and it shows. There is little continuty between topics, there is virtually nothing on composition and what data that are presented are not very useful. I do not reccommend this book!"},{"Title":"Tao of Photography: Unlock your Creativity Using the Wisdom of the East","review":"While this book is filled with some pretty pictures, none of the actual writing contains any substance that will teach you anything about tao or photography. The author just keeps making analogies to yin and yang, most of the time not explaining what he means.I guess that if your purpose if just a pretty book for the coffee table, this might do, but then again there are so many better choices in the same price range, such as Cartier-Bresson's &quot;A Propos De Paris.&quot;If you are really interested in tao and photography then check out the book by Cross &amp; Shapiro with the same title as this one. If you're just interested in improving your photography, and not necessarily about tao, then check out &quot;Learning to See Creatively&quot; by Peterson."},{"Title":"In Perpetual Motion (Rethinking Childhood)","review":"This book offers a genuine, new approach to the educational discourse. By analyzing texts by Locke, Rosseau, Herbart and Hall, Bernadette Baker re-writes the history of education.Baker reads these canonized educators through a brand new pair of glasses: Foucault's theory of power and Derrida's de-constructive ethics.Through her elegant analyzis, she questions both common educational beliefs and our inherited, non-refelctive conception on Power, Pedagogy and the Child.This book therefore prooves the intelligibility of &quot;postmodern&quot; educational research."},{"Title":"125 BEST GLUTEN FREE RECIPES","review":"I have already baked the white bread and the chocolate cake, and they taste almost liked they were baked with wheat flour."},{"Title":"125 BEST GLUTEN FREE RECIPES","review":"If you have celiac disease, which is an allergy to wheat products/wheat protein; autism or lactose intolerance, make this book your best friend.

The authors have the recipes in one chapter for bread machines; this is followed by a section for those of us who can't or won't afford a bread machine. It gives clear, concise directions for using the mixer to make the same breads, which really impressed me. Most authors aren't willing to go that far for their readers, and I truly appreciate the work that they put into this book. I really like this approach and wish that more books were this user friendly. This is the first book that has given me an interest in baking my own breads, because some of the others are way too complicated. Not all, there are notable exceptions, but this book makes me want to get back into the kitchen and bake some loaves, just as I did for years, when my kids were at home. Some day I will buy a bread machine, but for now, this book will be a great aid in my new kitchen adventures.

I have adapted recipes and cooked for my celiac husband for over 10 years and I thought I knew a lot about good gluten free baking. However, this book has given me a ton of good ideas (and recipes that work) and has rekindled my interest in baking. I particularly liked the lemon yogurt scones, shortcake, and white cake recipes.I tried the breadmaker recipe for white bread and for the first time produced bread that looked good,was sliceable, tasted great (according to my husband) and was so easy to make. Not to mention much cheaper than buying it at a specialty bakery! Another plus is that the recipes are good enough for me (a non-celiac) too! The wealth of information about alternative flours has given me the means to adapt a lot of my own recipes successfully."},{"Title":"125 BEST GLUTEN FREE RECIPES","review":"Celiac disease is a poorly understood digestive disorder that affects both children and adults. It is an auto-immune disease that affects the small intestine, and is the result of an intolerance to gluten found in wheat, rye and barley and products derived from these grains. There are no drugs or a cure for this disease. Only a diet free of foods containing gluten is effective in living with the disease and avoiding the symptoms which make celiac disease so troubling.While there are a number of gluten-free cookbooks on the market, Donna Washburn and Heather Butt have elevated gluten-free (GF) cooking from relatively boring, excessively \\"healthful\\" recipes to delicious, easy to prepare recipes made from easily obtainable ingredients. The book is well laid out, with good, sensible information on the ingredients required for safe gluten-free eating. The illustrations are well-done and colourful, and accurately reflect how the dishes look when properly prepared. All the recipes we have tried have been successful and tasty, but several stand out as exceptional. These include ciabatta (p. 38) an excellent substitute for regular bread, without the pound-cake texture normally found in other GF breads; the batter fried fish (p. 59); and the chocolate chip cookies (p. 160).The equipment and ingredient glossaries provide useful tips and important information for making the recipes successfully. The common sense approach to what is a serious dietary problem for many children and adults alike truly helps to demystify some of the more poorly understood aspects of this disease, and makes it less of a chore and a lot more fun to eat well without wheat and wheat-based products."},{"Title":"125 BEST GLUTEN FREE RECIPES","review":"Donna Washburn and Heather Butt have a real winner on their hands here. They have taken the specialized cooking and baking required for a gluten-free diet and re-thought it from starter to dessert. For those people suffering with celiac disease this book can give them back their appetites for the foods they lovingly remember. Many of the recipes are very innovative and everyone I've tried works well and is delicious. 125 doesn't begin to account for the variations given for each recipe - what a great way to make a new favourite into three new favourites. The equipment and techniques glossaries as well as the helpful hints on each recipe make this a valuable resource book for anyone stuggling with gluten-free cooking. What a treat to salivate over the delicious pictures of pizza, battered fish and cakes. Each of the bread recipes includes detailed instructions for making with a bread machine or with a mixer, so everyone can accomplish fabulous results. This book is loaded with information about the gluten-free diet and it's ingredients and will appeal to the cook and non-cook alike. My Gluten-Free cookbook library wouldn't be complete without it!"},{"Title":"125 BEST GLUTEN FREE RECIPES","review":"I have celiac disease, which is essentially an allergy to wheat protein, and I've been GF for 5 years now. (Why does that sound like I'm at an AA meeting?) Bette Hagman's books are the first couple of books that I got, and they're pretty good. There are still a lot of recipes that I make out of those books.*125 Best GF Recipes*, however, is my new favorite book. Unlike some other cookbooks that include recipes that bear astonishing similarities to Hagman's recipes, Washburn and Butt (Heather Butt is the co-author, oh Amazon person who deleted that the first time. It's not a naughty word. It's her *name.* Look at the cover.) have devised new, intriguing, useful recipes that use even *fewer* ingredients than traditional GF recipes. One of my favorites is the \\"Lavosh,\\" (p16). I omit the yeast and the vinegar (there's no proofing time, anyway,) and add a 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder. Then, don't spread it as thin as a cracker, but pretty thin, and bake it at 375F. You get something between pita bread and Indian fry bread. Phenomenal! And in under 45 minutes from start to eating! This has become my staple bread recipe.The only thing that I don't really like about the book is that it is essentially divided into fourths. The first quarter is odd-type breads, like the lavosh and scones. The second quarter is bread recipes for the bread machine. The next quarter is those same recipes for hand-mixing (thus repeating a bunch of recipes.) The last quarter is cakes and pies.Highly recommended.TK KenyonRABID, coming in 2007 from Kunati Book Publishers"},{"Title":"125 BEST GLUTEN FREE RECIPES","review":"This was my first Gluten free cookbook when I was diagnosed with Celiac spruce. I believed in the reviews and thought that I was getting the best GF book around. Big disappointment! When I didn't know any better, I thought I would just have to get used to crumbly bread and hard, dry, completely pale muffins. What a surprise when I borrowed Bette Hagman books from the library! There's not comparison! Hagnman's book are far superior and her knowledge of Gluten Free ingredients proves that the best GF cookbooks are written by Celiacs, not cooks who are just curious about GF cooking and experimenting with alternative flours. The good reviews for this book must have been written by the authors' friends.There are a few good recipes in the book (brownies, pie crust), but the muffins and bread where just horrible, almost inedible. Some of the beautiful pictures in the book are misleading . The orange cranberry muffins shown are golden on top and speckled with red cranberries inside, but the recipe says to use cranberry juice. I knew that would produce totally red muffins so I used orange juice instead. Still the result was a hard block of rice flour that crumbles when you bite on it. The top never browned.I am an experienced professional chef, and I would not recommend this book.

The bizarre use of the pole concept is utterly out of step with modern magnetic physics. Abbreviations for measurement units are indicated on graph axes without any discussion in the text about what the units mean. The figures are the worst I've ever seen in a technical book, consisting mostly of low-resolution bit maps. I suggest that the author thoroughly review the American Institute of Physics style manual on how to draw figures before doing another edition. It would seem to me that a book of this size (&gt;800 pages) would be able to reveal the linear bit density on a standard 3-1/2&quot; 1.44 MB floppy disk, the orientation of the magnetic moments on the disk tracks, the magnitude of a one-bit magnetic moment, the depth of the magnetized regions in the film, and what encoding scheme is used in a single table or on one page of text.

More ominously, it speaks of the &quot;new depths of invention&quot; to which the Nazis sank in the torture and execution of members of the Kreisau circle, suggesting that the bestiality of the SS is another part of the disavowed inheritence of modern Europe. The interrogators played records of children singing folk music to drown out the screams of their captives; does not our culture also have recourse to &quot;children's / songs to mask torture&quot; (cf Benigni's _La Vita e' Bella_)?Not all of _Canaan_ is as good as this. Hill's &quot;Psalms of Assize&quot;, for instance, read like marginalia on marginalia, simultaneously clenched and lyrical: the &quot;singable remainder&quot; of a calcinated theology, perhaps, but too brittle to last in the reader's imagination. But much of the volume is more than worth sticking with. The poems are more often than not about the disappearance of their own referents - &quot;the names / and what they have about them dark to dark&quot; (&quot;Sobieski's Shield&quot;) - but this is the very opposite of a willed obscurity: Hill's language calls after lost things into the darkness into which they have fallen, and sometimes manages to recover &quot;lost footage, / achieve too late prescient telegraphy&quot; (another name for 20/20 hindsight?). Perhaps this marks Hill ineradicably as a grumpy old modernist: whilst other poets, other poetics, have devoted themselves to exploring and even celebrating the contingency of language and meaning, _Canaan_ remains anachronistically committed to an elegiac mode. But in fact its particular glory is that it shows what the elegy can be and go on being even amid a society and culture besotted with the evanescent and continually on the make, yet afflicted with a deep and inscrutable nostalgia for a loss it has little way of knowing how to confront."},{"Title":"Canaan","review":"Despite the extreme difficulty of these award-winning poems--difficulty for which Geoffrey Hill, considered by some to be England's greatestliving poet, is notorious--I like them very much. And there I find myself hoist on my own petard, having frequently raged against theobscurantism of authors like James Joyce, but now endorsing a poet who is nearly as impenetrable at times. So, first, let me acknowledge thatI am willing to forgive more from Mr. Hill because I favor his dark moral/religious/political take on modern England, than I would be fromsomeone who was just being obscure for obscurity's sake, say Joyce or Pynchon. Second, I do think we, justifiably, tend to give poets moreleeway than novelists; after all, by the very effort they have to put in to achieving a chiseled brevity they earn some right to ask a little moreeffort of us readers. The nearly forty poems here do not fill even eighty pages, so if you have to read them once or twice, or ten times, itdoesn't seem as onerous a task as trudging through hundreds of densely printed pages of a novel.Mr. Hill's themes and methods are signaled early on, in the title of the collection and in the epigraph :...So ye children of Israel did wickedly in thesight of the Lord, &amp; forgate the Lord their God,&amp; serued Baalim, and Asheroth ... Yea, theyoffred their sonnes, and their daughters vntodiuels, And shed innocent blood, euen the bloodof their soones, and of their daughters, whomethey offred vnto the idols of Canaan, and theland they defiled with blood. Thus were theysteined with their owne inuentions ... oCanaan, the land of the Philistims, I wil euendestroy thee without an inhabitant.Judges 3:7; Psalm 106: 37-9; Zephaniah 2:5(from the Geneva Bible of 1560)The Geneva Bible of 1560? Okay, so he's delving back into the past, to a vibrant and impassioned form of ruggedly fundamentalistProtestantism and a Bible written by Brits in exile (note that Professor Hill himself is and has been at Boston University); comparing modernEngland to ancient Canaan, and casting himself in the role of doomsayer. The reader has been warned.Here's an example of one of the more accessible pieces :DARK-LANDWherein Wesley stoodup from his father's grave,summoned familiar dustfor strange salvation:whereto England rous'd,ignorant, her inaneMidas-like hunger: smokeengrossed, cloud-encumbered,a spectral peopleraking among the ash;its freedom a lost haulof entailed riches.I've no idea who Wesley and his father are, though I assume it's John Wesley (1703-91), the founder of Methodism, but can tell you that thisbleak vision taps into three of Mr. Hill's favorite themes : of England as having become excessively materialistic, even hedonistic; ofhard-won British liberty as a thing of the past; and of post-War Europe as an ash heap. That much I think I follow.Or consider just two of the images from a poem, most of which I didn't understand, DE JURE BELLI AC PACIS, which is written in memoryof Hans-Bernd von Haeften, who plotted against murder and was executed in 1944. The first :Could none predict these haughty degradationsas now your high-strungmartyred resistance servesto consecrate the liberties of Maastricht.followed later by :To the high-mindedbase-metal forgers of this common Europe,community of parody, you stand ec-centric as a prophet.Even without being able to follow every elusive allusion in the poem, and without knowing anything of von Haeften, you can easily discernthe message that Mr. Hill is contemptuous of the new European Union, based solely on economic integration, with no thought given to theunlikelihood of ever turning these disparate nations into a genuine community, and little regard given to the surrender of sovereignty andfreedom it will require.Even if you are unmoved by the specter of England subjugating itself to French and German bureaucrats and indifferent to the economism ofmodern British society, you may have trouble figuring out why Geoffrey Hill sounds so angry, so much at times like an Old Testamentprophet. But think on this quote from Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor :It does seem in our countries in Britain today, especially in England and Wales, that Christianity, as a sort of backdrop to people's livesand moral decisions - and to the Government, the social life of the country - has now almost been vanquished.or this one from Dr. George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury :A tacit atheism prevails. Death is assumed to be the end of life, bleak though that thought is. If we need hope to clutch to our breast at allit will be in such greatly scaled down forms, such as our longings for family happiness, the next holiday or personal fulfilment. Ourconcentration on the here and now renders thoughts of eternity irrelevant.All of which brings us back to the Biblical Canaan, where the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the Lord and so were sold into slavery. Simplyas a literary matter, Geoffrey Hill's poems here are a powerful evocation of the idea that something similar is happening now to England andthe British people, that they have become a post-Christian and demoralized society. And if, like me, you agree with the specific charges helevels here, however oblique the terms in which he couches them, then you'll like the book very much and be honored to put some effort intoreading it and wrestling with his meanings.GRADE : A-"},{"Title":"Canaan","review":"I'm a great fan of Hill's work--the Mercian Hymns, for instance--and of the Blakean early poetry, but this book, I think, is Geoffrey Hill at his worst. I say he is at his worst, not because of the allusions and the lack of notes that allow us inside the particular cloister he inhabits (the culture allows us to uncover such things), but because he fails the first obligation of all poets, and that is to the mother tongue. We do not find the old burly force of Hill at his best, but instead encounter effete language, lost in a perfumed cloud of erudition. Lacking memorable language, we search for mastery of poetic form, but even that is denied us. Hill sticks to a kind of slack, unrhymed counting of syllables, and we are all the worst for it. Go back, Geoffrey Hill, to the vernacular. Tell us more about that grandmother who made nails for a living, and leave the dons to their obscurity, and the priests to find God among the worm-casings and the dust. Look at the best of R.S. Thomas, if you need to see again.

Charlotte County - Paul R. HueyConclusionComments:The Other New York is a series of essays that survey the circumstances of the rest of the colony of New York outside of New York City during the American Revolution. Each essay, except one, focuses on the issues and events within a single county. The other essay combines three Central Hudson Valley counties because their circumstances and dynamics were similar. The essays clearly demonstrate the variety of issues and priorities that divided and often distracted various regions of the colony of New York during the Revolutionary period.The essays work as surveys giving basic information about factions and motives within each county. In some cases, factions were largely divided along religious affiliation. In some counties, class divisions were a major factor with many in the lower classes looking at a change in government as a opportunity to improve class standing. The frontier counties had varying issues such as Indian alliances and who had granted the land patants. The population of Charlotte County was often more concerned with whose land patents (New York's or New Hampshire's) would be recognized as the legitimate patents.The essays each briefly cover the individual issues of counties over the twenty-five years of the Revolutionary period, although some essays are more tightly focused on the ten to twelve years of violence, war and uneasy peace. The essays each supply several pages of notes a for continued research into a county's circumstances. The notes often include recommended texts that explore specific aspects is much greater detail. The book is all too short in content in that the essays are rich with content and hint at a much greater level of knowledge and research on the part of the authors. The book is nonetheless a good reference tool because of the number of notes, which cite many highly regionalized and less well-known sources."},{"Title":"The Moon-spinners","review":"I first read this book when in my teens and have lost track of the number of times I've reread it. Needless to say, this is on the top of my favorites list. Alas, I've always wanted to visit Crete, but haven't been there yet."},{"Title":"The Moon-spinners","review":"Nicola Ferris is a young English woman working in Athens. She takes a break to go on holiday to Crete. But things go wrong. She gets there before her cousin Frances, gets off course, and encounters two men, one of whom is seriously wounded. It appears that he's witnessed a crime taking place and is now in hiding. The worst part is that his fifteen-year-old brother is missing. Have the killers kidnapped the boy? What is going on in those exotic yet isolated lands? What transpires is something sinister and dangerous indeed, and Nicola will have to deal with both the man she's decided to help and the group of people surrounding them on her own.The Moonspinners, first published in 1962, is my sixth Mary Stewart novel. Three of them I loved, the other two not so much. The sixth one falls into the former. Imagine, if you will, paradise: beautiful and exotic surroundings, no one in sight except you and perhaps a few local shepherds. Then you realize you're on your own and involved in something where you may end up dead. You can't escape; there is no escape, for you're surrounded. Mary Stewart creates the perfect atmosphere for beauty, romance and terror. Her descriptions draw you in from the first page. The Moonspinners, like the other Stewart books I've read, is quite a quick read. You'll wish it were longer. This is one of Stewart's most popular titles. There is even a film loosely based on it (never seen it). She's a great author. Even though most of her novels were romantic suspense, most of them are very unique, not very repetitive. She also chose some rather exotic settings for each book. The Ivy Tree and Thornyhold are the only books of hers I've read so far set in England. I have My Brother Michael and The Rose Cottage on my TBR pile and I can't wait to read them."},{"Title":"The Moon-spinners","review":"A young English woman who lives in Athens chooses the small town of Agios Georgios, in Crete, for her vacation.

The Moonspinners is awesome, one of Stewart's best.Nicola is a young woman on holiday from her job at the Embassy in Greece, who agrees to meet up with an older friend on Crete. She arrives before her friend, and goes exploring in the mountains above the village where she will be staying. There she finds Mark, who has been wounded by a gunshot, and his Greek friend Lambis, and ends up tending to Mark for a night while Lambis goes back to their boat. Nicola finds out that Mark's brother Colin was kidnapped by Cretan men after they witnessed the possible murder of a Greek man, and Mark himself was wounded and presumed dead by the kidnappers/murderers. Nicola goes down to the village and meets up with her friend Frances, but can't seem to stop thinking about Mark and his brother, and does some sleuthing of her own, though she promised Mark she'd stay out of it.I think what I love most about this book is how subtly the romance between Mark and Nicola develops--they're only together for about twenty or thirty pages of the entire book, but their interest in each other is very believable and not contrived or forced for the sake of the story."},{"Title":"The Moon-spinners","review":"I, too, was amazed to discover how different the book was from the screen adaptation. As much as I enjoyed the movie, the novel is on another level entirely. After reading it, I would suggest that the movie should bear the sub-title &quot;Roughly suggested by Mary Stewart's novel of the same name&quot;.Nicola may have her moments of weakness, but unlike many other Stewart heroines who seem to go around in a bit of a fog to keep the suspense level higher, she does the best she can mentally with the information at her disposal. Her actions and reactions were uniformly true to her established character, and her courage was both admirable and somehow believeable.The suspense builds steadily right up to the end with no let-down, and unless your satisfaction depends on a heroine who also qualifies as a kind of samauri-warrior, I don't think you'll be disappointed in Nicola's personal involvement in the climactic sequence. (Compare her end-role with that of the heroine in Ms. Stewart's next novel &quot;This Rough Magic&quot; - which bears a striking similarity to &quot;The Moonspinners&quot; - and I think you'll see what I mean.)Personally, I rate the mystery and suspense books I read on a scale from one to ten, and &quot;The Moonspinners&quot; is one of only three that has gotten a 10 from me."},{"Title":"The Moon-spinners","review":"While the Disney film 'The Moon-Spinners' starring Hayley Mills is a fab movie, it doesn't do this book justice.

There is also a movie version of The Moon Spinners, but do not read the book first if you want to enjoy it - it changes too much of the story.

Moonspinners is set in Greece, and you do feel as though you are almost there with the main characters of the story. Nicola Ferris is a secretary at the British Embassy in Athens and she takes off for some R &amp; R on Crete, little knowing that her vacation will bring adventure and danger and of course romance. My only quibble with this book, as well as with other Mary Stewart romance/mysteries is that the heroine tends to depend on her male friend a little too often and also gets rather weepy on occasion. The fact that almost all the characters smoke contantly also dates the story a bit. But all in all its a good book and the perfect companion for holiday reading."},{"Title":"The Moon-spinners","review":"Mary Stewart is a brilliant author.

I had Mary Stewart's THE MOONSPINNERS. I just returned to it after, ahem, 36 years, and found that in many ways it held up the 14-year-old's original assessment. It is witty, the characters attractive, the action spritely and believable. The scenery of the Greek isle of Crete is rendered intoxicatingly, so much so that I can see why it helped inspire the 14-year-old to become the 16-year-old who went off on her own parentless adventure overseas. The almost 50-year-old is surprised to relearn that the oh-so adult heroine and hero are in their very early twenties. Mere children! Ultimately, the book does not hide its romance genre genes or its era. The heroine, who initially bristles at the male characters' sense of superiority does give in a little to it, and a little gratefully at that, at the end. There is use of the word &quot;greedily&quot; in place of &quot;hungrily&quot;--a pet peeve of mine. The author's ability to quote classic works at the drop of a hat was awe inspiring to the 14-year-old reader; it has all the suspicious cache of Bartlett's to the almost 50-year-old. There is a bit of a nationalist subtext, too: the Brit abroad sees American characters as friendly and nave and the native Cretes as rather primitive and amusing. The 14-year-old went on to read other novels by Mary Stewart and others like her but none matched THE MOONSPINNERS. There is something about it that is better than what I know of its genre, and it may have sent me on the path to serious literature sooner rather than later as much as it sent me abroad."},{"Title":"The Moon-spinners","review":"Not as spellbinding as M Stewarts usual books, but still a good read and a lovely glimpse of the Western Isle."},{"Title":"The Moon-spinners","review":"One of my daughter's favorite read for fun books.

I'm delighted to report that The Moonspinners does. Unlike a couple of other novels of romantic suspense published about the same time I've recently reread and thrown across the room, the heroine of this one is independent and resourceful, makes decisions and saves the day.Nicola Ferris is young but courageous. With only a rudimentary knowlege of Greek, she gets a job in the British Embassy in Athens and spends her weekends and holidays exploring the countryside. Of course her language skills improve, but it is that intrepid spirit that sets the scene for The Moonspinners. Enroute to a small village on Crete to meet her cousin for an Easter vacation, Nicola stumbles onto a mystery and the hunky Mark, who's been shot in the shoulder. For safety's sake, he urges her to continue her journey and forget she met him, but that's not our Nicola's way. What follows is a breathless cat and mouse game as Nicola tries to locate Mark's missing younger brother and find out who shot Mark and why. Set in a charming Cretan village, Mary Steward took full advantage of its sights, sounds and smells and her prose is so descriptive, it's like being there.Mary Stewart wrote for educated and civilized readers. Her characters have lovely manners and it's a pleasure to read about them. Another thing I really enjoy about her books is their frequent allusions to classic works of literature, with the assumption the reader will get them. I always learn something from her books, things that stick with me long after I've forgotten the plot and the characters, and I've remembered the story of the Moonspinners since I read the book for the first time. I'm looking forward to rereading all of Ms. Stewart's books. It'll be like meeting up with old friends."},{"Title":"The Moon-spinners","review":"\\"The Moonspinners\\" is an excellent Mary Stewart adventure novel, first published in 1962. The story features a plucky young Englishwoman named Nicola Ferris, a junior employee at the British Embassy in Athens, who goes on vacation in Crete at a remote location on the coast. While out on a walk, she stumbles into the middle of a deadly situation involving a wounded but dashing young Englishman and his kidnapped younger brother. Over a matter of just days, Nicola will save the life of the wounded man, then search for his missing brother, right under the noses of a deadly gang of Greek thieves. Their Greek enemies will retaliate, leading to a suspenseful final confrontation offshore.Mary Stewart wrote a number of these novels, mixing adventure and romance with proper 1960's decorum. What makes \\"The Moonspinners\\" stand out is her intricate plotting, her almost reverent sense of detail for the scenery and culture of the Greek Isles, and her ability to keep the exploits of her heroes and heroines within the realm of the believable. The result is a crisply written, fast-moving story with adventure around every turn. \\"The Moonspinners\\" is very highly recommended to fans of Mary Stewart and her novels."},{"Title":"The Moon-spinners","review":"If you appreciate an 'old fashioned' tale free of graphic intimacy and violence, if you appreciate vivid description, romance and intrigue this is for you. I read all but one of Mary Stewart's books in my early twenty's through late thirties. Now, nearing seventy, I am rereading them and cherishing the stories I read in my young years. I have divested myself of hundreds of books. Mary Stewart's remain a constant. Though I prefer some over others \\"Moonspinners\\" is one of my favorites. It tells of a young girl traveling with her aunt in Crete. I enjoy Ms. Stewart's chapters that open with an English poet's work from Keats to Shakespeare. Moonspinners was made into a Disney film by the same title that did not do the story justice. Like most of Mary Stewart's work there is murder, intrigue and betrayal. This story is no exception."},{"Title":"The Moon-spinners","review":"I've read all of Mary Stewart's books and owned most of them at least once.

Nicola Ferris takes a vacation from her job at the British Embassy in Athens and plans on meeting her cousin Frances in a small village on the island of Crete. Arriving a day early, she decides to traipse through the White Mountains and in true Stewart fashion soon finds herself in the thick of danger, mystery and of course a hero in need of feminine assistance. Mark Langley and his younger brother Colin had been attacked after witnessing a crime, Mark was wounded and they assume Colin is murdered or been taken hostage. Nicola spends a night tending to Mark as Lambis goes for supplies and she is then forcefully sent on her way to forget what she's seen and continue her holiday. But of course it's not quite as simple as that and once settled into her hotel she recognizes Mark's attackers from the description he gave her and the adventure begins.And that's all I'm going to tell. What follows is a darn-near unputdownable tale of mystery, cat-and-mouse intrigues and unexpected plot turns all leading up to one incredible nail-biting finish (I must get hold of the film now). I really enjoyed Nicola and Mark, they had just the right spark and spunkiness to play off of each other and add a perfect light-heartedness to the story (lol, his comments at the end when she had to wear his brother's slightly too tight pants), and I loved the way she can set up her scenes - everything on the island literally came alive for me from the tiniest flower, to the windmills, the mountains as well as those treacherous rocks alongside the bay.

A woman working at a mundane job going on a calming and quiet, mundane vacation is immediately whisked into the mountains and smack dab in the middle of a murder.

I know Nicola was instantly intriqued and helpful but she continued because of a love interest (though she denies it most of the way through).

The rising action parts were really great too."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Throughout this book Gerstner discusses the changes IBM made and how he helped turned the company around. I have no doubt that he was a large part of the dynamic shift at IBM to again make it the successful, global company that it is today, but I felt that I went through the book without completely understanding what those changes were. There was a lot of discussion of how IBM was operated and managed when Gerstner took control of the company in 1993 as it was falling apart before the public's eyes, and there was a lot of explanation of how IBM was successful and reborn when he stepped down from the CEO position in 2002. But there was little substance in between. I am not sure if that is because the day-to-day steps taken throughout the mid and late 1990s are too mundane for the average business reader, of if the details were just left out. Gerstner does share some insight into leadership skills and his management style, but IBM as is left in the shadows. All in all, this is not a bad book, but be aware that the reader is left wondering exactly how IBM regained its dominant position in the marketplace."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"I like the part where Gerstner outlines his management philophies:1. I manage by principle, not procedure2. The marketplace dictates everything we should do3. I'm a big believer in quality, strong competitive strategies and plans, teamwork, payoff for performance and ethical responsibilities4. I look for people who work to solve problems and help colleagues. I sack policticians5. I am heavily involved in strategy, the rest is yours to implement. Just keep me informed in an informal way. Don't hide bad information - I hate surprises. Don't try to blow things by me. Solve problems literally; don't keep bringing them up the line.6. Move fast. If we make mistakes let them be because we are too fast rather than too slow7. Heirarchy means very little to me. Let's put together in meetings the people who can help solve a problem, regardless of position. Reduce committees and meetings to a minimum. No committee decision making. Let's have lots of candid, straightforward communications.I don't completely understand the technology. I'll need to learn it, but don't expect me to master it. The unit leaders must be the translators into business terms for me.The main points of note from the book were:1. How strategy became customer focused and how Gerstner broke down the fiefdoms that allowed various divisions to provide an integrated solution to customer problems2. The thought process that went into deciding the strategy - almost like an MBA case study in competitive advantage3. Performance based pay and differentiation (very similar to Jack Welch's philophies)4. A historical perspective of the strategic changes in the technology industry and the rise and fall of various technological eras culminating in the final decision of IBM to become a service oriented company that could provide a total solution to any customer's problem5. The cultural change required at IBM (and at just about every large organisation that I can think of) - Product based to customer based, do it my way to do it the customer's way, from 'manage to morale' to 'manage to success', from decisions based on anecdotes to decisions basede on data, from relationship driven to performance driven (and measured), from conformity to diversity, from looking good to accountability, from US to global, from rule driven to principle driven, from silo to holistic, from analysis paralysis to make decisions and move forward with urgency (80%/20%), from not invented here to learning organisation, from fund everything to prioritise.6. Above all - how do you turn a obsolescent lumbering product based, rule based company with deep divisions into a nimble service company with competitive advantages where decisions are made quickly by empowered and capable employees acting with a customer centric bent of mind.Overall it's a really interesting story. However I would say that if you want to know in general how to run a company in the long term (rather than turning around this specific one) then 'Winning' by Jack Welch or 'Good to Great/Built to Last' are better buys."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"REVIEW: This book falls into the standard popular management/business book category for the mass market similar to the book published about a year earlier by another retiring prominent CEO of a large multinational company, &quot;Jack: Straight from the Gut&quot;. However, there are significant differences between the two and the main differences are reflected in the titles. As the titles suggest, &quot;Jack&quot; is more of an autobiography told in a very opinionated manner whereas Gerstner's book is more about the company during Gerstner's years and how (in broad terms) the company transitioned to a more flexible, entrepreneurial organization.The book is organized into five parts: (1) Gerstner's beginnings at IBM, (2) Strategy, (3) Culture, (4) Lessons Learned, and (5) Observations. The first four parts are mostly about IBM and the transformation whereas the last section is mostly about Gerstner's views on industry, society, journalists, etc. I highly enjoyed sections 1-4 but felt section 5 didn't really fit the book purpose and it seemed almost as though the editor/publisher convinced him to add the section in order to make the book the standard size. The problem with section 5 is that Gerstner's states clearly that he believes the book should be about IBM and the turnaround, but section 5 is a half hearted attempt to give some personal musings about miscellanious things that at best seem like good political opinions and at worst sound like whinings.However, excepting section 5, I got more out of this book more than Welch's. Gerstner clearly tries to lead the reader to greater understanding of the IBM situation, the thinking behind the decisions that were made, and the resulting turnaround. He does this in a style that doesn't suggest his answers are universal ones. He recognizes that imparting better understanding rather than the right answers is the appropriate goal for helping others to achieve better results in complex environments. This book probably doesn't deserve a permanant place on your bookshelf (i.e. it is unlikely to be a classic), but if your looking for better understanding of the IBM turnaround or of large business in general, this is a good book to read. If your looking for a better understanding of an individual CEO read Welch's book.STRENGTHS: Written in the standard style of popular business books so it has fairly short chapters and is easy to read. Doesn't try to espouse too much theory or universal answers. Does a good job at explaining why certain decisions were made and certain strategies selected. Doesn't get bogged down in stock prices and financial data.WEAKNESSES: Section 5, Gerstner's observations I thought was off target and weaker than the remainder of the book. Little insight into Gerstner himself (but that wasn't the book's intention). Some sections were a bit too brief and could've used additional detail."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"IBM is still in awe of Gerstner. In the 1990s, the board voted to award him ridiculously excessive retirement benefits -- such as the use of a company jet whenever he wants -- so you can bet that his words will continue to be treated like tablets of stone for years to come, much as those of the two Thomas Watsons used to be.The joy for all of IBM's competitors, and perhaps dismay for IBM's partners and employees, to be found here are threefold:1. That IBM will continue to run its entire operation as a portfolio, getting in and out of businesses as soon as they seem unattractive, which in IBM-speak means one, or at most two years of declining sales. This is almost the exact opposite of Microsoft's approach. To succeed in the IT industry, you need to show exceptional commitment to your customers and partners -- to demonstrate that they can safely invest in your products because you're still going to be in that business for five, if not many more, years.2. That IBM will continue to believe that open is good and proprietary is bad. Before Gerstner, IBM believed in open, standard interfaces between products; now in Gerstner's world, it says it believes in open standards within products. One wonders how long it will take IBM to realise that if it pursues this belief to its logical conclusion, everything proprietary will be stripped out -- in other words, there will be no added value in IBM products that you can't get anywhere else.3. That IBM continues to believe its best strategy is as an integrator of other firm's piece-parts rather than as a creator of the best piece-parts itself. More than once in the book, Gerstner says this is where he believes the IT industry is headed. He needs to look back at IBM's history. IBM kicked off the desktop PC industry by being the integrator that brought together the piece-part suppliers Intel and Microsoft. What is happening now? The original integrator, IBM, is slowly withdrawing from the desktop market, while Intel and Microsoft increasingly dominate the processor and operating system markets.I strongly disapprove of much of what Gerstner has left IBM with. However, unlike one reviewer here, I cannot criticise him for avoiding the topic of IBM's WWII involvement with the Nazis. There is a common feeling among the IBMers I talk to that, though the involvement was awful and reprehensible, it cannot be blamed on today's IBMers, none of whom worked for the company during 1939-1945, and none of whom have gained from that terrible episode."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Consistent with Gerstner's cold and impersonal management style, \\"Elephants\\" is a clinical and sterile analysis of the author's days at IBM. What is surprising is that while living in the eye-of-the-storm through this mostly tumultuous period in IBM's extraordinarily rich and often bizarre history, Gerstner writes from afar, more an outsider looking in than the leader credited with the turnaround.It is the success of the System 360, which carried IBM for decades and helped entrench an already insular and isolated culture, that was the villain, claims Gerstner. IBM needed to get in touch with the customer, get focused, and get back to the basics of execution. This is all true, and provides some interesting reading and insightful observation, but it leaves the reader yearning for more of the infighting and political maneuvering that was occurring both inside and outside the boardrooms. Those not familiar with IBM's unique culture will chuckle at some of the sparsely used anecdotes, while insiders will be disappointed in the virtual absence of any of the real drama that occurred, especially in the early months of Lou's tenure. Always the politician, names aren't named except for fleeting praise for select individuals. While Gerstner closes by claiming his deep love for a devotion to IBM, he still comes off as the perpetual outsider.Perhaps one of the more interesting elements of the book is not what is told, or even what is left out, but rather what yet cannot be told. That is, five-years from now, will Gerstner's grand but unfinished plan to transform IBM into a services company still be considered a brilliant and bold strategic coup? Or will many of the changes in IBM over the past decade be simply attributed to adroit realignment of employee-related benefits and retirement benefits and long overdue expense reductions? We'll have to wait for Sam Palmisano's book to find out."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"When Gerstner took over IBM in 1993, it had a arrogant reputation, an immovable hierarchy, and was 90 days away from bankruptcy. Gerstner announced his ascendency to CEO with the words: \\"A customer is now CEO of IBM.\\" Having sat in the helm of both Nabisco and American Express, Gerstner had dealt enough with IBM to understand it as only a frustrated customer could.Gerstner's two great insights was his recognition that 1) IBM's greatest strength was its people, and 2) IBM's greatest weakness was its culture. He attacked the antiquated and entitled culture by immediately ending the \\"jobs for life\\" rule, and laying off countless workers in bloated, nonstrategic business units.Gerstner shows a real understanding of how important IBM, as a singular institution, is to the world in general, and the United States in particular. Interestingly, Gerstner pays tribute to the life-long IBM'ers, saying that he was never really \\"one of them.\\" He does so in a caring way, that flies in the face of all the attacks on him by bitter IBM'ers who had been let go.In the end, this book is an outstanding portrayal of the fearless vision and dogged discipline that a true leader must have to be successful on the world's biggest stage."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"I was reading this book when it was released 10 years ago, and many of things said in it still hold true. In software industry 10 years look so long with rapid changes happening. Good to be retrospective and look how things were. I am sure there are aspects which we can replicate and which we don't want to. Lou Gerstner is credited with bringing back IBM to a glorious state. Must read for people interested in IBM and the tech industry."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Gerstner polarises opinion with this book as much as he did throughout his IBM leadership.There is no doubt that Gerstner made tough decisions that were hugely unpopular amongst long term IBMers, particularly around the dismantling of the IBM 'welfare' system and large scale redundancies. These changes undoubtedly changed the company's direction dramatically.The book gives a good insight into how Gerstner saw IBM(tm)s strategic positioning and what, in his view, it could and could not do to change successfully. Sufficient focus is given to why he saw things the way he did to give context to the decisions he made. In doing this, the book is a good portrayal of how the strategy changes were developed and executed.Whilst being specific to the challenges of the IT industry during his tenure the book gives good coverage of cultural and organisational changes that are of relevance and interest to managers in any industry.Gerstner is often portrayed as arrogant, probably with good reason, yet this book has enough anecdotes and examples of decisions not panning out the way he planned to show a different side as well.It is an easy read yet gives enough industry, strategy and execution depth and detail to be thought provoking and informative.I would recommend this book as an excellent, educational read, whether you ultimately agree with Gerstner's approach or not."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?

It provides principles how one can improve work life, with practical examples. . My favorite quote in this book \\"there is an opportunity to learn in everything we do\\".Whatever mentioned is true, I see this now in lot of IT companies. Many of them perish after couple of years.

On the other, I feel that Louis cheated the reader and himself by not sharing more about his decision making skills. I found that the most important part of this book was the last third \\"Lessons Learned.\\" It is there that he shared some insight, but again, superficially. He is either one that plays things very close to the vest or has actually made important decisions. In either case, he did not share his insights as well as other books by executives.\\""},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"It is easy to think about IBM as the old guard struggling to keep up with the new crowd favorites such as Microsoft and Google. However, IBM's four hundred thousand employees make it a small nation, and one of the largest employers in the world - more than four times than Google and Microsoft combined. Imagine trying to make sense of that as a CEO, you are not managing a company; you are managing a small nation state with thousands of satellites across the world.The book is non-technical and easy to read. Lou Gerstner places a lot of focus on corporate culture and the initiatives that the company spearheaded under his watch to what is arguably one of the most spectacular business comebacks to date. A must-read for any entrepreneur or a business manager."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"The critics were predicting IBM's demise when he took the rains, apparently after much prodding. He took the bold step of listening to customers and cutting the price of their cash cow, the 360, to raise cash. He also decided that the business model (proprietary) that had worked for IBM in the 50s-70s just wasn't going to work, and he made a big bet on middleware and services.What's important to his management philosophy? First, he considers big to be good: IBM doesn't have to scrounge for resources to do something. He also loves to win and wants to hear the same from his people.That said, the book reads a bit like he's trying to sell us IBM: the brand. I also find myself asking what it means to save IBM if he has to lose almost 200K employees (they were hired back eventually) and change the culture. How much can you change something and keep it the same?"},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"After reading Gerstner's self-aggrandizing book, I must agree with the recent Miami Herald review which castigated the man, the book and the company for obstructing the investigation of Edwin Black in his investigative bestseller, IBM and the Holocaust, and for then avoiding all reference to the topic in the Gerstner memoir. The Miami Herald review reminds that it was Gerstner who personally obstructed Black's attempt to access corporate archives, and then oversaw the launch of a disinformation campaign that has been unsuccessful. Gerstner's book should have dealt with this very public issue squarely instead of pretending it did not. I cannot look at the cover of Who Says Elephants Can't Fly and Gerstner's smiling image without thinking of this act of omission and commission."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"A previous reader review suggested that Mr. Gerstner's was out of touch and if readers want the real story they should read Soldier of Fortune 500. Who better than Mr. Gerstner, the man responsible for turning IBM around to write about it? Who Say's Elephants Can Dance is wonderfully candid and well written (and by Mr. Gerstner himself, without the assistance of a ghost writer). I particularly liked the passages on \\"inspect versus expect,\\" managing by principles vs. process, focus on core competency and impact of culture and how to change it. These can be applied to any company.I am author of Soldier of Fortune 500. In fact, my book is very positive about Mr. Gerstner and what he did for IBM. I think the Gerstner book is brilliant and would recommend it to all. Rather than contradicting, my book echoes similar themes, albeit the employee view vs. CEO.Steve RomaineAuthor, Soldier of Fortune 500"},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"The first part of the book, which covered Gerstner's background and decision to join IBM, read very well. Unfortunately, the rest of the book lagged and didn't clearly address the actual turnaround. Rather than writing about turnaround techniques and difficult decisions, he spent most of his time discussing corporate emails, giving a high-level overview of the industry, and describing general business observations."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"There's a lot of fiction in this document. Hopfully, some of the folks that Lou forced out of IBM in an effort to pad his lifetime income will also provide input. Folks who have a positive view of Mr. Gerstner's account of his results in turning IBM around, are not aware of the lives he ruined in the process. If you sack enough people, the results are bound to reflect a temporary profit. As a work of fiction, this book would have five stars. However, based upon facts, it is grossly lacking."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Some books sweep you off the feet by their accurate narration of larger-than-life issues and of the results that sweep people off their feet... This book is in the same league, and does a lot if you are blessed with a lot of imagination... Organized into five parts: (1) Gerstner's beginnings at IBM, (2) Strategy, (3) Culture, (4) Lessons Learned, and (5) Observations, the book is a racy description of IBM's flirt with history-rubbish, and of the slow and painful recovery. Spanning IBM's history from 1992 to 2001, the book provides a perfect view from the hot-seat and is especially relevant if you are aspiring to become a CEO of a fortune 500 company. The last section contains Gerstner's views on society, industry etc, and provides an even better glimpse of the man himself. The book is especially relevant if one wants to understand the IT industry and the source of all its problems and virtues, but only to a certain extent. The insights are available in bits and pieces only, and one has to connect the dots oneself. Another problem with the book is that the thoughts in various places aren't really fully developed, and one has to look someplace else for all the answers. \`Big Blues, the Unmaking of IBM (by Paul Carroll, Jim Wade) provides a much better description of the firm, is what I think.Overall, it's a good buy, and will make for a good weekend read."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Of course elephants dont dance - they drop stuff on the floor and everyone walks around it pretending not to notice the stink. The problem with Lou Gerstner is that he didnt realize everyone was pretending not to notice his smell.I go with the reviewers who will not buy this book - I looked at it and it made me sick. Why? Because it honors he who did not honor his employees. This book is about a self-centered megalomaniac who thinks in this most aggrandizing way that change comes from the top. First there was no change here. IBM grew during a period where anyone in the computer business would grow. Secondly, anyone who knows anything about leadership knows that real business change and innovation does not cascade down through the organization from the top, any more than change cascades through all of society. If you look closely at successful change efforts in American organizations, you will see that the innovation started from the middle and spread outward.I just wonder how well IBM would have done had Gerstner actually been being a real leader?Don't buy this book thinking you will learn how to manage an organization for the benefit of anyone but yourself. If you plan to get rich at the expense of your employers and stockholders, if you plan to reduce the size and morale of your organization, if you intend to create fear or doubt in your employees, or if you just like to stay out of touch with your employees and pass down non-sensical management edicts to hear yourself talk and impress yourself - hey this book and this mentor is for you. Good luck."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?

He stopped training and investing in people. If you didn't have current skills, you were fired and someone younger and more naive was hired, for a while...Ya, what a genius!"},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"The initial history as presented is interesting, but much of the rest seems to lack consistency with what one reads in the press.Lou Gerstner began his career at IBM with one of the biggest layoffs in history, and finished by moving out roughly equal numbers. In between the culture changed; the new \\"culture\\" lost more ground to Microsoft &amp; Sun, gave up billions of $'s to upstart EMC, slipped Lotus' marketshare, gave away networking to Cisco, bailed out of the \\"unprofitable\\" PC business while Dell was growing like gangbusters, spun off \\"unprofitable\\" printers via Lexmark, sold off big segments of the business to competitors, etc. (And now want to get into highly competitive consulting practices.)I'd like to get an accuracy check of the book from some of the consultants who follow IBM for a living..."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Lou Gerstner writes this book from the perspective of having worked as a transformational leader at companies during periods of growth and change. At American Express, he oversaw the global adoption of the Amex Traveller's Card and other services. As a consultant, he moved from company to company, making recommendations, and moving on. Finally, as CEO of IBM, he presided over a period of great change - from 1993 to 2002 - before turning over the reins to Sam Palmisano.Gerstner's experience, then, is as an architect of change; not as one who \\"stays the course\\". I recommend this book for managers and leaders in all industries who want ideas on how they might lead change in their own organizations. Gerstner's book mirrors his life in business: It gets your attention in the beginning, holds it through the middle, and wanes at the end.What Gerstner lacks in penmanship, he makes up in concise, direct, and articulate prose. This is as honest a book on business as any I've read, and I wholeheartedly recommend it."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Yes Mr Gerstner called all the shots in the 90's and yes he, the company, and the stockholders made a lot of money doing it - and no IBM doesn't need another cheerleader but I must say this book does do a good job of describing what it took to turn around IBM. As a side benefit it also helps bring some logic to the reason \\"why\\" the computer arena runs the way it does. In addition it also gives a \\"business persons'\\" look at the other major players in the market not just an insider techie perspective.The target market for this book is for experienced business leaders, young IT managers, AND the everyday computer client.I would categorize myself as an everyday client. As a client and growing up with Apple as a market leader in the 80's and Microsoft in the 80 & 90's. I would have to say Lou Gerstner's \\"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance\\" book was the missing piece to the computer puzzle for me. It balances out what I previously read in Bill Gates' books \\"The Road Ahead\\" and \\"Business at the Speed Thought.\\" The Microsoft desktop with it's web and email access was the standard as far as I was concerned. I simply was not aware of the IBM history that occurred prior to 1990. Looking back, when I was in school we had personal computers on our desktop and in college we had internet access, and when I starting working, email was the norm. So you can imagine my surprise when I picked up this book and discovered that these three technology's were not the norm prior to 1990. I had no idea that much of IBM's work from the 50's & 60's made a lot of today's e-lifestyle possible. Being in the computer industry for the last 12 years and seeing the web reach critical mass and its' subsequent explosion shed little light on what preceded it.POSITIVES:Here are a couple of the ideas I liked from the book:Gerstner's/IBM High Performance Principles: Drivers for success:1 The marketplace is the driving force behind what a company should be involved in2 What is at the core of a company: In IBM's case, it is a technology and nothing else3 Look outside to measure success via customer satisfaction and increased shareholder value4 Operate as an entrepreneurial organization with minimum of bureaucracy and never ending focus on productivity5 Have a sense of urgency (Planning & analysis is secondary to action)6 Never lose sight of strategic vision, direction & mission Reward teamwork8 Be sensitive to ALL employees needsNEGATIVES:When comparing this book to that of GM's Jack: \\"Straight From The Gut\\" where you almost need a score card to keep track of all the players - It seems to me, that the entire story of IBM and its' turn around was not told, for what ever reason some information was omitted. I can only recall Mr Gerstner pointing out at the most 4 people.I think it is fair to say Mr Gerstner does minimize the impact that the phone companies, like MCI, had on rolling out a individual customer based internet product in the early 90's.Furthermore, one of the other things that Mr Gerstner failed to address was the on-going concerns between access types in the public vs private domain: business vs personal use of access, cost sharing and privacy issues when at work. Issues like, on-line shopping, stock trading, personal email, etc are vague and unsupported. Maybe this is because he is not a so-called \\"techie.\\"Whether you buy this book or not I think it is safe to say what happens in your cube on your desktop right now was made possible in large part by the people in this book, ALL the IBM folks (past and present) as well as their competitors.In summary I can say that I looked at this title a year ago and now in retrospect after finishing it, I wish I hadn't waited so long to read it. I picked up the CD version at the library"},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?

The book combines history with tips and observation and paints a picture of IBM from outside and inside. Gerstner is a genius of simple, but powerful actions. His insights are valuable for every manageron all scales; his passion for excellence and winning is admirable."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"I am glad I read the book before reading the reviews on this site since my perceptions of Gerstner's narration did not get coloured by some of the writings on this site! It is also possible that being a non-IBMer, I may have taken many of the pronouncements in the book on a face value as compared to the guys who probably had a personal and possibly more insightful encounter with Gersten's leadership style from within the organization.Anyway, all said and done, I must confess that the book and its contents have impressed me a great deal. Some of the key impressions I walked away with after reading the book are:a. Lou is a no nonsense leader, somewhat like his other famous contemporary CEO - Jack Welch. A total focus on execution and very little tolerance for usual organisational BS!b. But, unlike Jack, Lou does not come across as a guy full of himself! The fact that Lou starts with a broad disclaimer that this book is no autobiography but simply his account of what happened at IBM in last decade tells you a lot about the difference in two personalities.c. Although it is obvious that both men were looking at e-business from rather different perspectives (one as a technology provider and other a user of technology), it is probably not coincidental that both of them were amongst the greatest proponents of e-business and recognised a huge opportunity in leveraging e-business for their respective businesses.d. Till the end, Lou remained faithful to the initial pronouncements he made immediately after joining IBM about &quot;vision&quot;. The book is short on &quot;CEO Vision stuff&quot; but full of illustrations on his obsession with execution and painstaking but vital details required for successful organisational transformation.The section that left the greatest impression on me was chapter 26 - where Lou debates about lessons learnt from &quot;centralization vs. decentralization&quot;. Having seen many CEOs struggle with the critical issue of trying to create a &quot;synergistic/integrated&quot; strategy, Gerstner's candid but insightful observations on this vital issue were indeed insightful. For someone who has been visibly successful in driving a synergistic/integrated strategy for a mammoth organization like IBM, it was pleasantly surprising to see Lou caution other business leaders from blindly adopting the &quot;synergy/integration&quot; mantra! Hope such warnings from a veteran who has been there, do not fall on deaf ears.Business acumen and the guts to step back and take a fresh look at critical issues rather that blindly following the prevailing &quot;industry trends&quot; and &quot;analyst wisdom&quot; is what make an extraordinary leader stand out in the crowd. By going against the prevailing wisdom that downsizing the organization by spinning off smaller size nimble entities is the only &quot;viable&quot; approach for IBM, Gerstner not only managed to successfully preserve IBM as a US &quot;national treasure&quot; but forcefully demonstrated that for those who dare...there is always a better way forward!Judging by other reviews on this web site, some of my above observations may look rather oversimplified and nave to the guys who had the misfortune of being on the receiving end of Gerstner's brash style. However, as they say - the proof of the pudding is in eating! Seeing an \\"integrated IBM\\" of today with robust financials and a dominant industry position is any day a much better proposition than attempting a hypothetical \\"what if\\" analysis about a disparate group of \\"baby-IBMs\\" that may have resulted from the break-up of IBM a decade ago!"},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Never forget that Gerstner was one of the big dog tobacco executives before he came to IBM.Although he was not one of the tobacco executives who took an oath and swore before Congress that he did not believe that tobacco was addictive, he ran the company just before the time of that testimony. Tobacco was known to be addictive since at least 1932 according to the tobacco companies' own records.Before you believe anything that Gerstner wrote or (more likely) had ghostwritten for him, always keep that in mind."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"A kingdom grows and prospers by conquering new lands. For years it stands virtually unchallenged. Things change. It loses battles to new competitors, and shrinks. Their aristocracy seeks a winning strategy from a new general. Forces are withdrawn from areas not worth contesting to reinforce areas where the battle is critical. Having accomplished his mission, the general retires. The kingdom is now in better shape for having shed their colonies. THINK of an overloaded lifeboat (Boston case in 1850s). The first mate reduces the number of passengers, allowing most to survive. The blame should be on the situation, not the correction. (My condolences for those thrown overboard.) Or pick your own parable.This is written for a general audience, but not everyone will benefit from the contents. I think a lot of stories were left out. This easily read book shows Gerstner would make a good journalist.Gerstner's first and basic decision was to reduce the cost to mainframe customers. They used CMOS transistors (like in home computers) for a lower cost, and IBM renewed its emphasis on customers. This reversed the decline in mainframes and saved the company. The loss of billions required drastic cuts, not just in a bloated administration, but in surplus productive employees. Expenses would have to drop faster than the decline in gross profits (p.63). Page 59 says \\"competitors in the computer industry, unlike any other industry I know, try to create unique standards that they own\\". This is the result of Anti-Trust Laws that allow you to put a generic tire on a Chevy or Ford. Page 64 tells of the fiefdoms of multiple accounting systems, and the need to update and simplify them. Didn't General Motors go thru this same trial around 1982? Page 66 tells of the sale of \\"unproductive assets\\". Page 72 mentions the interaction between ability and morale or reputation.Gerstner's proudest accomplishment is that his successor and the heads of all major business units are longtime IBM veterans. This happens when a company brings in outside consultants to do what is needed, and then leave.Page 257 mentions the \\"wild pronouncements\\" like \\"the paperless office\\" (people want tangibles, and read in may places), or \\"dot-com universe\\" (people want social interaction). Did these originate as customer demands? Chapter 28 underlines the problem of a corporation. High-level managers who get rich through fraud or embezzlement is not new; read the history books for similar events from the 1870s to 1930s. Today's dot-coms are like yesteryear's railroads. Was the media flaunting the \\"new economy\\" a few years ago? Doesn't the business side of the media always control the editorial side? Gerstner mentions the role of \\"investment bankers\\" (p.260); they have been the most powerful members of our ruling class since the 18th century. Pages 261-3 list some common sense cures. A company controlled by its owners is better than a corporation run by hirelings. Page 271 explains the difference between \\"cash flow\\" and \\"revenue\\".Chapter 30 asks about the corporation and the community. Before the 1860s no corporation could be chartered unless it served a public purpose (canals, waterworks, railroads). Corporate contributions may be a vestige of this tradition. Preventing companies from incorporating unless they served a public purpose would answer this question."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"I have not and will not buy this book. Gerstner's approach was pure abuse, such as the way some animal trainers get wild animals to perform. Gerstner was able to rid IBM of company loyalty, sacrifice investment in future products for immediate profitability, and bloat the salaries of a select few while making &quot;the most important resource&quot; totaly expendable.

But if you want to know what separates a great leader, then this is the book.This book demonstrates how clearly Lou saw the issues. Despite his effort, IBM is a big organization, and some of the same problems continue today.Lou can claim a lot of credit for what IBM is today. And most of us can see how far he has brought the organization. What sets this book apart is that Lou is really writing from his gut. In the book, he was unsparing about his feelings with various incidents, and revealed a person who not only has the business mind to turn this business around, but is passionate about it.

Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Gerstner had a big constraint while writing this book - he was writing for a general audience who may not have the inclination to know every single thing he did at IBM. Even after accounting for this, it is particularly disappointing that the book completely glosses over the real details surrounding the decisions that turned around the company. As he himself says, hard and tedious data crunching coupled with solid analysis is the basis of any decision and while the general public need not know the intricacies of every single thing, it is sad that he did not include a single case-study end-to-end.The book starts and ends well but the second part gets bogged down with generalities. Business books that are replete with words like strategy, vision, execution and so forth are nothing new (that does not mean that the words are untrue but without supporting details, they makes the book cliche-ridden).Retrospection over something that turned out well is a strange thing - it causes one to justify everything that one has done. It would also have been interesting to read what did NOT work out well during the authors tenure and what could have been different.

Gerstner Jr. is one of those unique corporate biographies that transcends the genre. It is, and this is its most attractive feature, instead a history of IBM and its internal workings at what has probably been the most important transition period in its recent history. Mr. Gerstner sets the story of the transition of IBM's once staid-white starched corporate culture within the context of the then emerging PC industry. To change the IBM corporate mantra of small computers as a threat, rather than the opportunity that it was (and is), is a major focus of the book. The author chronicles his initial arrival at the company and provides the details of his campaign to remake the company's culture that was, by turns, responsible for its magnificent success over the years while at the same time, a hindrance to its continued growth and success in a drastically changing marketplace.Unlike other corporate biographies where the dominant theme has been \\"me.... me...... me..... me...... look what I did.....look what I said..........\\", Mr. Gerstner places himself within the overall context (albeit at the pinnacle) of the company, as well as the industry and the overall economic climate. Changing the focus of the company's dominant culture of \\"we're IBM, we know what you need,\\" to a customer-solution based culture illuminates the benefits of highly principled, innovative leadership that allowed the company to return to the market prominence in a rapidly changing business. The prose is clear, to the point, and engaging, capturing reader interest from beginning to end. The book is well worth the time and effort and provides additional insight as to successful leadership principles in any field."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?

The section on Strategy and culture was quite educating for a CEO who wants to keep his company sane and the employees he reqiures. It is worthy of note though not all his decisions were the best around, but he was decisive and that is key for leadership.Very Good book on Management and especially visionary leadership, though he belived more in strategy than vision!I particularly liked what he said about Compaq!

Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"I'm going to be an intern in IBM starting June and I was told to read this book as an introduction to what Gerstner did with IBM. Quite honestly, all I knew of Gerstner was the simple fact that he turned around an ailing IBM and made it into the company it is today. This book certainly gave me more insight into the workings of the company and the man who changed the way it worked.What struck me most is that I felt like I was learning to hold on to the reigns of IBM as Gerstner described he did. He not only mentioned that he was unfamiliar with the technology coming in as the CEO, but also the large diaspora of products and services it touched. It felt like both he and I were learning about IBM in that regard, which is something I liked. As a first time reader, I appreciated the fact that I wasn't lost in the daily business jargon and it made me want to read more.Now like a lot of reviewers have mentioned, it's a self congratulatory work, and he makes no qualms about it. But why should he be modest? He doesn't discredit others when the names need to be mentioned, then why should he leave his name out? After saving a nearly dying 'national treasure' from a never returning point, I think he deserves it all. He also mentions how he had to fire over 130 thousand people and lay down the law when it came to enforcing his way. He didn't hide the fact that he was stern, ruthless, and straightforward with his methods, because they were ultimately methods that worked in a big big manner.Obviously, this is a one sided account of the IBM story of the 90s. But it is a good one-sided story. At the end of the day, the story ends happily, and that's what counts."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?

I use the comparison to gPoor Richardfs Almanach a lot, but it seems to fit and describes it quite well.Again, this is not a bad book, not at all.

Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"The most interesting part of Louis Gerstner's book is the three fundamentals that define a successful enterprise and executive.* They focus.* They execute.* They lead.First, companies and their executives that lack focus tend to be mediocre, Gerstner says. When they encounter tough times in their base businesses; they decide to enter new ones. Too many refuse met the challenge to resurrect, resuscitate, strengthen their base businesses and head off into uncharted waters.Second, getting things done, he says, is the most underappreciated skill of an effective business executive.Third, they lead by creating high performance cultures. They are visible, set goals, measure results and hold people accountable.This is a well-written book that Gerstner claims was compiled without the aid of a ghostwriter. So, not only can the former McKinsey &amp; Co. executive focus, execute and lead, he can also write. IBM was a disaster when he was recruited to revive it. Few thought it could be done without breaking it into smaller pieces.

The book also completely avoids any mention of the greatest moral crisis to grip the company when in February 2001 the world learned that IBM had become Hitler's willing efficiency expert during the Holocaust, from 1933 to 1945. IBM technology organized the concentration camps and the Extermination by Labor campaign. Instead of simply owning up to the history and apologizing, IBM, under Gerstner, blocked access to records, launched a disinformation campaign, refused to apologize to survivors and consistently claimed the firm simply had no information on the topic. The Hitler-era crime and the 21st Century cover-up forever tarnished IBM. Yet Gerstner has conveniently deleted the entire matter from his chapters.

Within IBM as a worker bee we didn't realize much of what Lou describes here. We saw the company sink, and the only pre-Lou idea offered to 'fix' things was to fragment the company(and thereby destroy it). Gerstner came in, developed plans to save the company intact, and got them done. The public surely couldn't see it. So it is enlightening for all.Yes, there was a great deal of pain in this, especiially for the downsized ex-employees, which he doesn't cover to any extent (perhaps he can't).

In 1993, IBM was losing market share and perhaps on the verge of bankruptcy. Louis Gerstner accepted the job and walked into this situation without really knowing whether he could revive IBM to its glory days. A job he completed remarkably well, considering revenue generation and profitability during his tenure (other change initiatives may well have been considered controversial by IBM employees, such as the culture change, especially the 'job for life' ethos with associated perks etc)I will finish off the review with a sign in Louis Gerstner's office, again stamping his work ethic:THERE ARE FOUR KINDS OF PEOPLE:THOSE WHO MAKE THINGS HAPPENTHOSE TO WHOM THINGS HAPPENTHOSE WHO WATCH THINGS HAPPENTHOSE WHO DON'T EVEN KNOW THINGS ARE HAPPENING"},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?

He won me over immediately when he decided to wear a blue shirt because everyone else was wearing white. Thoreau would have applauded his individualism.With my current profession dedicated to improving individual and corporate communication, I agree with Gerstner's assertion that \\"No institutional transformation takes place, I believe, without a multi-year commitment by the CEO to put himself or herself constantly in front of employees and speak in plain, simple, compelling language that drives conviction and action throughout the organization.\\"Another striking bit of Gerstner wisdom: \\"Success in a company comes foremost from success with the customer, nothing else.\\"He's right on target again when he observes that \\"lack of focus is the most common cause of corporate mediocrity.\\"Yet Gerstner goes beyond mere platitudes: \\"Execution--getting the task done, making it happen--is the most unappreciated skill of an effective business leader.\\"Possibly two of Gerstner's words capsule his approach to awakening IBM to its possibilities: \\"constructive impatience.\\"In my judgment, Louis Gerstner should rank alongside Jack Welch as a take-no-prisoners leader.

Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Most MBA programs utilize case studies to one degree or another. As you work through them you develop mental habits of analysis that help you get to the nut of the case fairly quickly so you can get prepared for class. One of the problems is that most cases are oriented as marketing cases, or operations cases, or strategy, or finance, or organizational behavior, or accounting, or whatever cases. A few are used by multiple disciplines, but very few integrate all the management disciplines.This book is a terrific integrated case. I enjoyed it tremendously and feel I have learned a lot from it. What I enjoyed most was the way Mr. Gerstner demonstrated the way all the disciplines are important in leading a great corporation. And especially the difference between the emergency room behavior he had to engage in when he first joined the company and had to start the bleeding and the different emphases he had to have in transforming IBM into an organization that could thrive in today's marketplace while remaining a great corporation.I am glad to read about his emphasis on corporate culture while retaining a fierce focus on operations and backing strategy with constant, continuous analysis with hard numbers. All fueled with passion to win. I think this is a winning recipe. And it is very easy to write down, but almost impossible to really execute. Mr. Gerstner did a great job and we all owe him thanks for keeping IBM together and making it competitive once more.People who are angry that the old IBM is gone shouldn't blame Mr. Gerstner. The old IBM was dying and was going to be broken up. Finding the right markets for the organization to compete in and remain together was a bet not many would have made. Certainly, it is not likely that Mr. Gerstner made perfect decisions nor did the people who worked for him act with transcendent brilliance either. The point is not perfection; it is competing effectively, actively, and with some intelligence. Mr. Gerstner shows us how he and his team did that in the 1990s and I thank him for this great book that I encourage all students of business to read closely."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? is Gerstner's chronology of and reflections on the years that he ran IBM. He details the situation that he faced when he left RJR Nabisco for IBM and how he was unsure initially as to whether he could turn the company around. Gerstner outlines the steps that took and the policies that he put in place to change the strategy and culture of the company. He notes that when he came, IBM was a company where you were \\"guaranteed\\" a job for life, even while the company was laying people of by the masses. He also points out that as opposed to competing with their competitors such as Unisys, HP, Dell, Oracle and others, most of managers time was spent in internal political contest.Through a strategy of listening to customers' needs, eliminating the compensation and recognition systems that created the internal fiefdoms and partnering with customers, quasi-competitors and other industry leaders, he was able to restore IBM to a more stable position within the industry. He also changed the perception of the company from the conservative black suit, white shirt previously required to be worn by all employees to that of a dynamic company which became synonymous with e-business (a term coined, incidentally, by IBM).As Gerstner says towards the end of the book, his strategy was based on a simple concept, that of an elephant dancing: While an elephant stands still, ants can scurry around the floor, but if the elephant can dance, all of the ants will be forced from the floor.Will the strategies Gerstner mentions work for others? Potentially -- Gerstner cautions against simply trying to drop his strategies into other situations. If nothing else, knowing what worked at IBM (and more importantly what didn't work and how it was fixed) provides additional management tools for us all.The book, which was written entirely by Gerstner (no ghostwriter, etc.), is remarkably candid. Gerstner outlines the areas where he feels he succeeded and those where he failed or which remain a qualified success. He also highlights the struggles along the way and the way he refined and changed his programs over time. Gerstner's candidness is really this book's greatest strength and will make it a business-classic in the years to come."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?

His callous disregard for employees and the lives of long hard working employees is obvious as he describes \\"How he made the Elephant dance\\". Sure, IBM was in trouble in the early 90's but IBM wasn't the only one, every company gets in trouble at some point. When the corporations realized that the PC was not going to replace mainframes, the turnaround was easy to implement and IBM was postured well when large capacity mainframes were required and necessary for the Fortune 500 to do reliable business. Was it necessary to throw out the principles that built IBM over 85 years into one of the most admired companies in the world? I think not, and now it is questionable of whether IBM will ever come back, to what it was before, a Great Company to work for and for the world community. Not mentioned in this book was that Gertsner walked away with $630,000,000 Million in net worth, gleaned in part from \\"creative accounting\\". His successor at American Express was one of four who determined his compensation, of which he has more than 600,000 stock options left to be exercised now that he has left IBM.

Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Imagine a nation without defense, health care and education. And imagine these services without IBM. It is this company (despite criticisms on various fronts) that was responsible for bringing computing to a scale that could run large organizations and even nations. It is natural that such a business assumes elephantine proportions in terms of size and product portfolio. Soon it is accused of monopolistic practices and the elephant slows down. In business terms it turns into a white elephant, slow and sick, on the verge of being dismantled; everyone looking for their fair share of the ivory. Such an elephant needs special treatment, and the ideal person to put it back on its feet, and bring in the agility of a horse should be adept at the skills of a mahout and the training of a Vet. Enter Louis Gerstner Jr.Over the years, thanks to the unbridled market success and subsequently the shadow of antitrust, IBM by the late 80's was a large dysfunctional bureaucracy. IBM had a dress code that again had outlived its times. I remember a joke during the early days of IBM in India: \\" If you see a man dressed in a three piece suit crossing the road on a hot summer noon in Delhi, chances are that he is mad or he is from IBM.\\"IBM's basic Beliefs were misinterpreted and practiced contrary to the very purpose of their origins. \\"Superior customer service\\" came to mean, \\"Servicing our machines on customers' premises,\\" instead of paying real attention to their business. \\" Excellence in everything we do\\" became an obsession with perfection and a led to several layers of checks and approvals, slowing down decision making and delaying product launches and response times. \\" Respect for the individual\\" soon became an interpretation for life long employment, entitlement for rich benefits and the freedom to ignore organizational priorities over that of the individuals'.As a group, the employees served themselves better than they did their customers.Among the various issues on product portfolio, pricing and customer service, the greatest challenge faced by Lou appears to be on the cultural front at IBM. Being an outsider, and the time it would take to gain acceptance in a multinational organization as big as IBM, the biggest challenge is his battle is against IBM's insiders; entrenched bureaucrats, steeped in old ways who kill initiatives in new directions.The transformation that Lou brought starts with the compensation system. Commonality, Fixed rewards, Internal benchmarks and entitlement was what he saw in IBM. These words were replaced with Differentiation, Variable rewards, External benchmarks and Performance.The chapters that deal with product portfolio decisions, strategy and e-Business make interesting reading. But the bull, I am sorry, the elephant is caught by the horns, I mean, by the tusks, quite early in the book. In the end, when Lou bids farewell to the new IBM, he admits that his heart has become a \\"true Blue\\". Jim Burke had mentioned to Lou before he took the IBM job: \\" You owe it to America to take the job\\". A job well done, now America owes it to Lou for saving the national treasure."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?

He also has good self esteem, but he definitely needs to get a second opinion. Looking back there is no question he did this for the money and he has left a trail of many angry employees in his wake. I for one can tell you the turnaround was occurring before he showed up to take all the credit. He never responded to any of my emails while I was an employee and hasn't responded to any since my retirement. HR did respond to the emails that I submitted and their response was that &quot;it was OK that I had sent the email to Lou&quot;. HR then went on to reiterate the company line.

Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"This is a fairly good book by an immensely talented CEO. It takes up more or less a few decades after the retirement of one of the greatest businessmen of the 20C (TWatson Jr.), when the business had lost its way and was under attack by extremely nimble rivals.Gerstner took over the failing, almost bankrupt, company and both re-made its startegy and culture, re-focusing it on customer needs and re-engineering it (i.e. laying off an awful lot of people). In this book, he tells the outlines of how he did it, which is indeed extremely interesting. In particular, he stresses that while a strategy is needed, implementation of it is far more important.Unfortunately, he does not go into enough detail for the reader to fully understand what he faced and how he did it. Neither the technology nor the brutal methods he had to employ were adequately addressed, at least for me. I read it carefully and did not feel I had had quite the full meal I expected. The reader also gets virtually no insight into what makes Gerstner tick, other than that he \\"wants to win\\" with passion. THe book was also entirely written by Gerstner; his style is competent, if somewhat like a business memo: good analyses are \\"actionable\\" and effective actions are \\"impactful.\\"Nonetheless, this is a very good primer on basic strategy and organizational behavior. He has lots of valuable advice to give and pinpoints many important issues. I will keep it and return to it.THere were some things that I found questionable and surprising, if also unintentionally revealing. FOr example, he made IBM both an honest broker in offering comprehensive technology-based business solutions - for the first time, its employees could recommend the hardware of competitors if they better suited the customers' needs - while another part of the company continued to strive to produce the best hardware. This flatly contradicts both what Porter advises and Gerstner himself argues elsewhere in the book regarding the self-reinforcing compatibility of the elements of a business strategy and makes me question if Gerstner really thought it all thru. In addition, he astonishingly posits that Japanese business reporters are the best in the world, when in fact - and I worked in Japan for Nikkei, a leading business news wire service - they are merely part of the PR apparatus of firms, reporting verbatim what they were told to report by companies! If that is what Gerstner expected of Western reporters, then he was naive. But then, he was a benevolent dictator and is open about his dislike and lack of trust of the press.REcommended. But if you really want a rivetting account of IBM, I would recommend Watson's autobio, Father Son & Co. There is also an excellent account of the turnaround of Xerox, using TQM, that is far more compelling a read than this book."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?

One would not suspect this from reading his book, in which he gives generous credit to the tens of thousands of people who created the company and to many others, some by name, who helped to save and resurrect it.As a former IBM executive who took early retirement twenty years ago, just as the company's bureaucracy was beginning to strangle the organization, I was fascinated to learn how that bureaucracy spread and the extremes to which it went, creating a culture thst led to decisions (if any) by committee, conspiratorial compromise, and self-protective behavior. This is not the IBM I had known. Even more interesting is the rapidity with which Louis Gerstner diagnosed the sickness of the company and the speed and persistence with which he administered tough medicine.Despite IBM's near-terminal condition Gerstner saw it correctly not only as a business enterprise but as a &quot;national treasure&quot; that was well worth the collossal efforts needed to restore it.Unlike Jack Welch's adolescent &quot;Jack: Straight from the Gut&quot;, this book focuses on the processes of leadership and management, strategic choice, and the decision process. But it speaks also to the essential importance of corporate culture, at IBM a way of life that is based on values rather than just on being first.As a recovering IBMer I salute Mr. Gerstner for his remarkable achievements and as a reader applaud him for this exceptional contribution to the business book genre.Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"If you are looking for a condensed version of IBM highlights under Gerstner's lead, this book will meet your needs. If you are interested in gaining an understanding of IBM's issues that led to the &quot;elephant&quot; stumbling, and Gerstner's solutions, you will be disappointed.&quot;Who says...&quot; is a quick read with a superficial treatment of the various issues facing IBM and a simplified view into Gerstner's techniques to turn the company around. Many different scenarios are rushed through, leaving the reader wanting to know more about how and why. The solutions offered by Gerstner and his team seem pat--surely there was more going on.Gerstner can not answer all his critics or the legion of angry ex-IBM'ers in a single book, particularly so close to his career transition. Unfortunately, this book misses the opportunity to provide the reader with anything more than a superficial insight into one man's view of IBM."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?

Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"This book is the kind that will leave you confused, if the agenda is not set right at the very beginning. This is a book about how to run a profit making business with the most important, if not the only, benchmark being increasing shareholder value.And if that is indeed the agenda, this is a most remarkable insight into the topic. Gerstner is succinct, detail-oriented & very analytical. He brings to the pages of this book a text book like quality when it comes to managing corporate efficiency, managing the brand, & like he \\"modestly\\" points out many-a-time, managing crisis. There were multiple directional changes during his tenure at IBM - & each of these constitute a lesson in management, or at least a very well argued point of view - & all of these decisions are very well covered in the book.The book has a easy chatty style - clear communication & no academic hyperbole. Certain times, Gerstner's sense of drama comes across a bit too blatantly for the kind of readership this book might have. It also reads as if Gerstner was the only one transforming IBM during his time, outside of lame credits interspersed, & the \\"I\\" factor is evident.I'm in no position to validate if IBM is a better, more stable company because of Gerstner. One of his biggest successes, I understood from reading the book, was transforming IBM from a product (or a Mainframe) company to a Services company. In doing so, Gerstner certainly did exemplify tremendous thought leadership & trend spotting capabilities - however, to believe in Gerstner's success at IBM, you'll, first & foremost, need to believe in his benchmarks for success.S!"},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"While this is a good book of an historic turnaround, there is little one can take away and apply. Between Gerstner's excessive modesty and the way he focuses more on his actions than the reasoning behind them, there is not much to learn here. Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable story."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"It is strangely ironic that, after doing his best to suppress all negative communication within IBM, it should be the reader feedback on amazon.com that alerts Gerstner to what the world at large really thinks of him. Ever since 1994 the newsreading public has been conned into a set of beliefs about IBM and Gerstner, simply through IBM's vice-like control of all media that wanted a share of IBM's ad spending. It is bizarre that he expects us to read through a critical employee e-mail on pages 81-82 of his book, when he admits that he couldn't even spare the time to reply to it himself.Gerstner was the IBM CEO with a worse revenue record than John Akers, the man he replaced. The only way Gerstner could find to grow revenue was by buying firms like Lotus. He turned what was a fantastic company to work for into a an ordinary one. He writes in the book that he transformed the company into a firm where the most able got the most rewards. In fact he converted it into a firm where the most aggressive individuals, like Gerstner, win through. He destroyed IBM's employee benefits schemes across the world, claiming they were unaffordable at the time of IBM's darkest hour. Perhaps they were at that time, but Gerstner's greatest sin was that he never returned any of the benefits to the employees when business improved, except through a silly bonus scheme that in my experience never motivated anyone. The result is that IBM has become a company that people still want to have on their CV, but those who join in mid-career almost never stay more than two years.Gerstner groped around and never really found the right idea for growing revenue. His shift to services meant that he took his eye off all the products in the IBM catalogue, and IBM architectures have become an irrelevance in a world now dominated by Windows, TCP/IP, Linux, Solaris and Oracle. He used the AS/400 as a cash cow when a very aggressive pricing scheme could have seen the system create the market that Windows NT instead built. Gerstner has said the Internet saved IBM, but frankly it did a lot more for rivals like Microsoft and Sun.There's a part of me that makes me think this book is one huge, ironic joke -- the guy only pretends to be unaware of the impact of his decisions on others. He boasts about a turnaround that never was and advocates management behaviour that no-one should accept.That would be fine if it were confined to the pages of this book. But unfortunately the impact of Gerstner is written large across the lives of many, many individuals who crossed his path, both inside and outside IBM. The blight cast over their lives means that, when they get the chance, they usually don't recommend IBM products. Gerstner just doesn't understand that.These pages on amazon ought to be required reading for anyone foolish enough to think they want a career in IBM."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"As an IBMer who joined in the mid-1990s, I enjoyed the book as a light read and an accurate account of the cultural transformation which has touched all of us insiders in some fashion or other. I found particularly entertaining a short \\"IBM lingo\\" section, with many sayings that I had assumed were part of the everyday business vocabulary.However, I would have liked more depth and detail throughout Mr. Gerstner's account. Overall the book feels a bit light in many areas, with few references to anecdotes, actual examples, and names of actual people (other than the few who are praised). As a result, the narrative does feel a bit detached and fails to grab the reader emotionally... You can't really feel the \\"passion\\" and the \\"struggle\\" that must have permeated Mr. Gerstner's day-to-day life as he was moving to transform the company.I would recommend the book, particularly since it can be easily digested over a couple of weekends and makes for an interesting and entertaining read."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?Who says an arrogant guy can't write a helpful book?There are a lot of people who don't like this book. Some don't like it, because they perceive Lewis V. Gerstner as arrogant. Some don't like it, because his tenure at IBM saw thousands of people lose their jobs. Some don't like it, because they don't think there is anything new here. I like this book.I like the book, because it is one of the most cogently and personally presented stories I've seen of a major corporate turnaround by the person who was in the CEO's job at the time. Here's a quick outline of the story.Gerstner became Chairman and CEO of IBM in April, 1993. At that time, IBM, once the icon of American management, was in big trouble. The deathwatch was on. The conventional wisdom among the pundits was that IBM needed to be broken up and sold off piece by piece to create lots of small businesses that would create income for shareholders.This was the heyday of the dot com boom. Smaller, networked computers were expected to rule the future. Big mainframe computers, the stuff that IBM sold, were supposed to be the troglodytes of American business, and heading for extinction.Gerstner came to IBM after being a McKinsey consultant and after a successful eleven-year career at American Express, and four years as Chairman and CEO of RJR Nabisco. He describes what he calls \\"the courtship\\" that brought him to IBM in the beginning of this book.The company he took over was once seen as the very model of the best in management. When I was starting out in business some thirty-five years ago, we looked to IBM as an exemplar of all that was good, effective and profitable. In 1982, Peters and Waterman featured IBM in \\"In Search of Excellence,\\" with a long list of references in the index.But by the time Gerstner took over many of the things that had made IBM great had fossilized. Many of the practices that had been touchstones had turned into radioactive rocks.Gerstner started off with three critical challenges. He needed to stop the hemorrhaging of cash and stabilized the company. He needed to learn enough about the business and the people he had walked into to make good strategic choices. And he needed to put together a strategy to turn IBM around.This book tells us about how he did all of those things. It does so candidly and that's one of the reasons I like the book.While lots of people see Gerstner as arrogant, I found him, at least in this book, to be humble. That doesn't mean that he didn't think he had a lot to offer and had made lots of good decisions. It does mean that he understood that many of his decisions didn't work out the way he thought, and some of his ideas weren't the best. Those get play, too, and that's rare in a book like this.I also appreciated the refreshing style of the book. It was not written with a ghostwriter or co-author. Gerstner did it himself. The language may not be the language that a professional writer would have chosen. But it is the language that's common to businesspeople everywhere, and that makes this a good read.The big advantage of this is that we get a real view inside the head of someone who led a successful corporate turnaround. We don't get a view that's filtered through a collaborator.Because Gerstner wrote the book, it's short on some of the details that might be here if a business historian or journalist did the writing. For my money, that's OK, because this is a real inside view.This book is for you if you want a lucid discussion of a difficult turnaround process by the CEO who did the CEO's job. It is all of that and a good read besides."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"The title of this book says it all: elephants don't naturally dance, it takes years of cruel training to make them do it, and in the end, there aren't many customers for the show.IBM's revenue record in Appendix C of this book also says it all: Gerstner has the worse revenue growth record of any IBM CEO, and that is despite the the Internet boom, despite the ERP boom, and despite the acquisition of such big players as Sequent, Lotus and Tivoli. Some turnaround, mate!More than once in this book Gerstner cites the pleas of others: \\"You owe it to America to take this job.\\" It's hard to see what he has done for America during his nine-year tenure... Where once there were many readers who wanted to learn about SNA, CICS, RPG/400 and other IBM inventions, today there seem to be no IBM technologies that a sufficient number of people are interested in to propel a manual even in to the bottom of the amazon bestseller list.For the story of Gerstner's tenure at IBM is really the story of IBM's hollowing out, of an extraordinary sell-off of IBM's assets to the short-term benefit of shareholders, of whom Gerstner was one of the biggest. As one of the IBM UK CEOs during Gerstner's reign, Barrie Morgans, said of Gerstner's skill at cutting costs and inability to boost sales: \\"Well, anybody can slash and burn.\\" Gerstner says on page 87 that the dismissal of the EMEA head, Hans-Olaf Henkel, was for subverting his memos to employees. It wasn't: Gerstner got rid of Henkel because Henkel dared to tell Gerstner that one of his strategies wouldn't work.. There is no reference here to the classic case, Churchhouse v IBM, which was heard in a US court.Gerstner also dismisses, in a page or two, the needs of employees in terms of benefits and pensioners. He simply says they were unaffordable; and yet he has no difficulty in negotiating an extraordinary compensation package for himself. And of course, as one of IBM's biggest shareholders, the more he could screw down the employees' packages, the more he himself benefitted. Never in IBM history had their been such a huge disparity between the compensation of the CEO and that of the lowest worker.The truth is that Gerstner sees himself as an elite -- ever the McKinsey consultant (and by the way, there were McKinsey consultants crawling over IBM throughout the 1990s, yet he fails to give them much credit in the book)..."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Who was the best manager of the latter part of the 20th century? Jack Welch lost about $200 billion for his shareholders from 1995 until he retired, while Louis Gerstner turned around and undoubtedly saved IBM. Today IBM's market cap exceeds GE's and the company did not need a federal government bailout to survive the financial meltdown of 2007/2008, the way GE did. Of these two Gerstner seems to me to be a true managerial success, as opposed to a media fed phenomenon.IBM shareholder have been rewarded while GE shareholders have seen a steady decline in the value of their shares. In this book Gerstner lays out his thinking and strategy and the actions he took upon being named CEO at IBM in the early 1990s. Even though he had little expertise in computer technology, he had the customer perspective as well as decades of managerial experience and training. The result is a book that is clear and understandable without the bravado and acronyms. This is a refreshing description of a major turnaround by the man who led it.For experienced managers this is a great read."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"My university suggested to all students that they read this book. I agree very much with their focus on why students should learn how to manage and lead. IBM was once a has been corporation in the early 1990s until Lou Gerstner showed them how to be nimble and respond to customer needs. IBM lost its focus because it did not focus its energies on exploiting the innovations of its labs. They were losing money faster than at anytime in the past. Only Gerstner showed how they could focus their energies on creating value in the marketplace. Gerstner's sage advice and guidance helped IBM survive this struggle to become profitable again. IBM is such a huge technological company that one wonders how Gerstner turned around this company. His leadership saved IBM. One wonders if he could save a company like GM or Chrysler now.This is a great book to read on leadership and common sense. You don't have to be a genius to be a leader. What you need is the ability to focus on your organization's strengths and weaknesses. Improve your weaknesses and exploit your strengths."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?

A universe most of us cannot hope to get personal insight into. If the world of the CEO or top-level IBM management is a topic that interests you will enjoy reading through this book. However do not expect a page-turner thriller or much depth in the description of the day-to-day management.The individual chapters are well written however they do not mesh strongly enough, resulting in a feeling that the parts are better then the whole."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?

However, I've found some noteworty quotation for my thesis \\"Image of a Manager\\" when I was working on in in the university. Also, the author writes how he dealt with journalists, and I've found it interesting.The book not presents a case study of a company innovation but describes the history of IBM in nineties. For example, the author explains in detail why OS/2 was cancelled and why did they buy Lotus and didn't buy other companies.It's very exciting to read how the CEO has diagnosed the problems of the company and which solutions did he find.I would also recommend \\"Leading the Revolution\\" by Gary Hamel. It is a very serious examination on how companies innovate and why should they do it, with lots of remarkable examples. Gary Hamel uses plain friendly language.The books of Chris Argyris about organizational learning are also about innovation. Although the language style is \\"academic\\", the books are interesting and somewhat unique."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"For those of us who survived King Louis XVI's entire reign as IBM CEO, the image of our unbeloved monarch as some sort of brilliant savior is painfully laughable. It's true that Gerstner instituted a few much-needed reforms during his first couple of years: do-nothing employees (\\"retired on the job\\") could no longer coast their way along. The number of habitual slackers was small, however, and they were pushed out the door quickly. Those of us who remained were promised great things for our hard work and loyalty.So what we did we get as our reward? In 1999, in the midst of a booming stock market when IBM was rolling in money, Gerstner gutted our pension plan. His forcible conversion to a cash-balance plan would have cost many older employees half of their pensions. Luckily, the uproar was so great that Big Lou soon relented and magnanimously allowed employees over 40 to keep what they had been promised for decades. Those under 40 were out of luck: by most estimates, they lost \\"only\\" a quarter to a third of their pensions. A previously unthinkable IBM employees' union was formed in response to this atrocity.(Gerstner does not even bother to discuss the pension issue in his book. On July 31, 2003, a federal judge ruled that IBM's alterations to its pension plan illegally discriminated against older workers.)More back-stabbing was to follow. Retired employees who were promised free medical coverage for life are now required to pay a big chunk of their pension for health insurance -- and this in the face of only one tiny cost-of-living adjustment in a decade.It was around the time of the pension massacre that the last vestiges of trust and open communication between employees and executives disappeared. \\"Respect for the individual\\" had been replaced by \\"Respect for the size of Lou's bank account.\\" The annual opinion survey was gone -- in pre-Gerstner days, it had been taken quite seriously -- and open discussion of difficulties and complaints had all but evaporated. As late as 1997, we received a candid memo from our division president apologizing for the horrendous problems associated with Lotus Notes (another of Lou's unadmitted disasters). By the end of the 1990s, the best we could expect were bland management-speak memos whose content was about as perceptive and inspiring as Marie Antoinette's comments on peasants.Instead of candor and respect, we were offered Gerstneresque pearls such as the worthless \\"Win - Execute - Team\\" garbage that even our line management found hard to discuss without laughter. (\\"What's the latest name for our annual list of accomplishments? Personal Business Commitments? No, that was last year. Oh right, now it's called WET. Whatever.\\" Muffled guffaws.)In short, Louis V. Gerstner's \\"turnaround\\" changed IBM from one of the best companies on the planet into Animal Farm.\\"All animals are equal but ... oh, why bother. Just hand over any remaining benefits we forgot to take away.\\""},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"One caveat: Lots of these reviews are really reviews of &quot;do I like Lou Gerstner?&quot; and not the ideas he offers in his book. My review is about the book and whether its arguments are useful to business people. On that basis alone, I rate it highly.I thought his chapters on lessons learned are quite good, especially where he distinguishes between vision and strategy. In my opinion, he offers a lot of great insight on this in a small amount of text.I couldn't get a clear picture of whether people were treated with dignity in the downsizings. On one hand, I've heard some pretty cold stuff outside of Lou's book. On the other hand, I worked at IBM in the late '80s as an intern and the culture was DEEPLY complacent and isolated from the real world. I suspect that the reality is somewhere in-between but the &quot;numbers guys&quot; argue one extreme while the people who paid the price argue just as forcefully the opposite extreme.I also think his chapters on being willing to challenge the conventional wisdom were valuable. I remember when Gerstner went to IBM and the conventional wisdom really WAS that Gerstner should become a high-tech hipster who could talk client/server acronyms, should 'harvest' the 390 business, and break the company into a bunch of 'baby blues.' I think it underestimates his (and clearly IBM's) accomplishments to not acknowledge it took serious decision clarity and courage to go against that conventional wisdom at the time -- especially given the financial pressures on the firm.So the bottom line is I think the book offers good insight for how to think clearly about your business, what your franchise really is, what your opportunities really are, and how to make clear decisions based on trusting a clear thought process that filters out lots of background noise."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Gerstner's book is one of the most self-congratulatory and disingenuous insider accounts of all time. Arguably, IBM was down and nearly out in 1994. Moreover, much of his analysis of the pre-Gerstner era is closer to the truth than old-timers might be willing to admit. Fat, sassy, arrogant, ingrown, puffed up, and unprepared to meet the challenge of an industry undergoing monumental change--and competition. But the human toll--i.e., the bodycount--of Gerstner's actions is never really acknowledged. Ask any of the tens of thousands of loyal IBMers who were summarily kicked out of their offices, especially those who were nearing retirement or had many years of seniority--and you will hear a different story. Some would tell you how IBM then hired them back at half the wages and no job security. Not quite Chainsaw Dunlop, but for many--close. A companion book that undertakes extensive interviews of the victims of this &quot;turnaround&quot; would nicely complement this official view from the top by the man who has the most lose from a nuanced analysis of this period. So too would a work that examined the lines that IBM sloughed off--e.g, the printer line to Lexmark--that managed to regain corporate esprit and turn a pretty profit from IBM castoffs. In a word, there's less here than meets the eye!"},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?

Has no one read the Wall Street Journal? When I see a balanced story on what happened at IBM during the times of Gerstner, then I'll believe that someone did their homework, and wasn't out to ride the coat tails of another rich person. If you want another glamour story read this, if you want the truth, dig deeper."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"This is the story of IBM's miraculous turnaround in Lou's own words. I use \\"Lou's own words\\" with intent here, as there was no ghost writer or co-author. The story of the revival of an American icon is written from the viewpoint of the man picked to do it himself.The book is organized into 4 sections: Getting Hold, Strategy, Culture, Lessons Learned and Observations. (ok, so that's 5 sections)Getting Hold covers Gerstner's initial immersion into the new environment, and his analysis of the problems. He also covers his famous comment that \\"the last thing IBM needs is vision\\" and explains his view in the need for tactics and execution. This flies in the face of what one might expect from a former consultant, and is consistent with other recent books such as \\"Execution\\" by Charan and Bossidy.Strategy covers how Gerstner came to the belief that IBM should not be broken up. This was in contrast to the spinoff frenzy of the times, and came from his view as a former customer that the market needed someone to pull all the technology pieces together, and that was IBM's only competitive advantage. The strategy is covered in business terms accessible to people outside the industry.Perhaps the biggest \\"Aha\\" in the book is the story of Gerstner battling the legendary IBM culture. This is covered in the Culture section, along with his stories of how he tried to insure that his changes are permanent. The importance of this culture change is highlighted in Gerstner's pride that his successor is a blue bleeding IBM life. (Ultimately Lou admits that even after 10 years he was still an outsider)The lessons learned and observations sections are less a narrative of the IBM turnaround, and more lessons on turnarounds in general, and the computing industry. For students of management, this will hold the most value.There were two downsides of the book. First is coming to grips with some of the inconsistencies in the methods used to turn around IBM. For a while, Gerstner rails against processes, instead challenging people to focus on customer needs. While reading it, one wonders how a complex organization can integrated many businesses without good processes. Later on Gerstner extols the virtues of his re-engineering project, especially along several key processes vital for turning around IBM. Makes sense, but contradicts his earlier writing.The other downside is answering why IBM needed an outsider to change it. Gerstner points out several times that IBM was a great company that just appeared stuck in some bad behaviors. Current management wisdom holds that insiders are better turnaround artists than outsiders. Why is this the exception that proves the rule? Is modesty the answer? (It is generally left to the reader to assume that a customer's viewpoint was needed)I would not let these detract from what was otherwise an interesting (and overdue) story of one of today's great turnarounds. The material comes straight from the source (as compared to the story of Ghosn's turnaround of Nissan) and from an individual of much higher personal integrity than Sunbeam's Al Dunlap."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"At the outset, it is important to understand that this volume is not an autobiography; rather, in response to apparently substantial curiosity, Gerstner offers his explanation of how he and his associates achieved what he calls \\"IBM's historic turnaround.\\" In process, he also explains how and why he became CEO, what his initial assumptions about the company were, to what extent they proved wrong (and why), and finally, what he had learned by the time he resigned as CEO after guiding IBM from April 1993 until March 2002. Having carefully observed Gerstner during the infrequent interviews to which he reluctantly agreed, the book seems to have been written by him without assistance except stenographic. The style and tone as well as the observations are clearly his. This is important. More often than not, a book bearing the name of a CEO as its author has been rigorously edited and thoroughly sanitized by one or more \\"manuscript doctors\\" before publication. Not so with this one.Its title was perhaps suggested by that of a book written by Rosabeth Moss Kanter (When Giants Learn to Dance, 1989) and implies that it may be unlikely but is nonetheless possible for an organization as large and as cumbersome as IBM once was to become \\"quick on its feet\\" again. Soon after becoming CEO, Gerstner realized that IBM's culture -- not its core strategies -- prevented it from being able to \\"dance.\\" As Gerstner observes, \\"[IBM's] decades-long run of uninterrupted success ties in with the other closely related, and vitally important, aspect of IBM's recent history. This is about its corporate culture -- specifically, the kind of culture that arises in an environment without intense competitive pressure or threats.\\" By the time Gerstner had become CEO, the company and its people had lost touch with external realities. It was widely believed that what was happening in the marketplace was essentially irrelevant to the success of the company. \\"IBM's dominant position had created a self-contained, self-sustaining world for the company. IBM had ridden one horse, and ridden it well. But that horse could carry it only so far before it broke down.This was the corporate culture which Gerstner encountered as he assumed his duties, a culture the product of two predominant forces: the runaway success of the System/360, and, the impact of the antitrust suit filed against IBM by the United States Department of Justice on January 31, 1969, the final day of the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. \\"For thirteen years IBM lived under the specter of a federally mandated breakup.\\"It would be a mistake to assume that most of the credit for what was accomplished at IBM during Gerstner's tenure as CEO should be given to him. He dedicated this book to \\"the thousands of IBMers who never gave up on their company, their colleagues, and themselves. They are the real heroes of the reinvention of IBM.\\" This book explains how that was accomplished, a transformation whose objective was to re-establish \\"the high-performance cultured that animated IBM under both Watsons.\\"Having relinquished his duties as CEO to Sam Palmisano, Gerstner suggests that his successor has an opportunity to make connections to IBM's past which Gerstner had not. \\"His challenge will be to make them without going backward; to know that the centrifugal forces that drove IBm to be inward-looking and self-absorbed still lie powerful in the company. Continuing to drive change while building on the best (and [in italics] only the best) of the past is the ultimate description of the job of Chief Executive Officer, International Business Machines Corporation.\\" It is probably too early to take full measure of Gerstner's performance in that position. However, now having his own account of those critically important years in IBM's history, we can at least appreciate the nature and extent of what he and his associates experienced...and what together they eventually accomplished.Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Kevin Maney's The Maverick and the Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr. and the Making of IBM as well as Thomas Watson, Jr. and Peter Petre's Father, Son & Co: My Life at IBM and Beyond."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?

Regardless, my copy is full of marks that I'm now trying to distill into lessons that I will use to assist me in my leadership challenges.One of the most salient points addressed by Mr. Gerstner is that of belonging. Can someone ever be an insider at a company like IBM? Can someone ever be an insider at a company like mine (less than 200 employees)?

One would never suspect this from reading his book, in which the author gives generous credit to the many thousands of people who created the IBM Corporation and to many others, by name, who helped to save and resurrect it.As a former IBM executive who took early retirement twenty years ago, just as the company's bureaucracy was starting to strangle the organization, I was fascinated to learn how that bureaucracy spread and the extremes to which it went, creating a culture thatled to committee decisions, tacit compromise, and actions taken to protect oneself. Even more interesting is the rapidity with which Louis Gerstner disgnosed the sickness of the company and administered tough medicine.Despite IBM's condition, Gerstner saw it correctly not only as a business enterprise but as a &quot;national treasure&quot; well worth restoring.Unlike Jack Welch's adolescent &quot;Jack: Straight From the Gut&quot;, this book focuses on the processes of leadership and management, the elements of strategic choice, and the decision process. But it speaks also to the issue of corporate culture, at IBM a culture based on values rather than just on being first.As a recovering IBMer I salute Mr. Gerstner for his achievements,and as a reader I applaud him for this exceptional contribution to the business book genre."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"This is by far one of the best business books I have read in a very long time. I had been waiting for this book for some time and picked it up the day it came in. One reason was that I really wanted to know about the IBM turnaround. Second was that I wanted to know more about the slightly elusive Mr. Gerstner about whom media never has too much to write, unlike some other CEOs who anyway never tire of talking about themselves.In simple words, this book is outstanding on both counts. Very well written, has the right amount of depth, provides excellent view of what happened at IBM and also the rationale behind Mr. Gerstners actions. There are good amounts of humour and emotional stuff also.I would recommend this book to all. And congratulations to Mr. Gerstner for having a dream career and then polishing it off with a superbly written book about his crowning glory."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?

When Louis Gerstner asked his mainframe team to drop prices and drop them hard, he was barely 45 days into the company - and the finance folks gulped hard.The new CEO was certainly not taking the easy way out. What would follow would be documented in history as one of the greatest turnarounds in the technology business. In his autobiography this brilliant man, son of a milk truck driver shows us how his company rose from the verge of extinction to the pinnacle of the industry."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?

Louis Gerstner Jr. takes you inside his historic turnaround at IBM to show that culture can be changed. From not offering the high placed salaries to a culture where not everyone's job is secure were all remarkable to the folks at IBM. You really get an inside look at the company during his tenure and this book is invaluable if you are trying to study the computer industry."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?

Check it out."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"This is an excellent book giving a birds eye view on how a large, successful company can deteriorate to a level that is destroying the company and yet insiders are virtually oblivious to the actual impact their actions are playing in that demise. How an outsider is sometimes needed to help them see the way out. I think Mr. Gerstners skills as a consultant and especially his experience as a significant IBM customer were significant to the turnaround at IBM and gives clear examples how a person does not have to be an expert at a specific business to lead it to higher ground.I really appreciated the strategic planning and reasoning provided by the writer as to the direction IBM took on mergers and acquisitions and the reason most of the proposals were best left alone. Growth for the sake of growth is not advisable if it is not strategic to the core of the company's goals.This is a good, easy read and relatively captivating book. It does get a little lengthy, and the many letters at the end of the book are only interesting to get a better view inside Mr. Gerstner. Actually, I found them enlightening, but not always portraying the message he actually intended, at least not as strong as he thought he made it."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Being an IBM employee at that time and having lived though the first 6 months of Gertsner's reign, I see that Lou has chronicled quite accurately the events during the remaking of the New IBM and rationally explaining some of the decisions that were made at the time. Its amazing how much bitterness still remains from those bloodletting days as shown in the previous reviews. All in all though, despite the pains from the early days and the constant critiscms from both inside and outside of IBM, Lou has done a really good job as CEO and this book simply explains what was happening at the time and why some decisions were made the way they were made. I give credit to where credit is due and I recommend this book to all former and current IBMers."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"As a 35 year IBMer, I survived the Cookie Monster years. I found this book very shallow and self-serving. It may have been written to justify to the author, in his own mind, why he destroyed what was once the best corporation in the world. He glosses over the 100,000 people he laid off and never even addressed the rape of the pension plan. Forutnately, I didn't buy this book, it was a gift so no more of my money went into his pocket."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"As I recall, the title originates from the time that IBM wanted to market its Personal Computer. As the goal was to do that in a minimum amount of time and effort, a very unlike IBM approach was followed: operating software was obtained from a whizkid, who copied existing code and modified it; hardware components, except for the solid keyboard, where ordered from outside manufacturers. All IBM did was assembling it.One IBM executive at the time said that eliphants can't dance, as he did not believe this approach would be feasible. At the introduction the PC was demonstrated to him with a dancing elephant on the green monitor screen.Since then IBM gradually lost grip on the market ending to almost a disaster in the beginning of the 90's, when Gerstner was hired to save the company. And he did save it. Not by breaking it down into components, but keeping it together and promoting the immense power of having all expertise in one company, that in his view should literally fight a war against competition to survive.The best article describing Gerstner's view on the tasks he had to fulfil for IBM were in Times Magazine, of which I found no reflection in his book, unfortunately. Perhaps, he'd better hired a ghost writer, afterall."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"I was very surprised that Amazon.com printed reviews in which the reviewers panned the book and criticized Lou's \\"saving\\" of IBM. I sent in a similar review to Barnes and Noble and they never included it, only including positive reviews (trying to sell books, don't want any negative comments).My comments were (I borrowed them from an IBM manager who summarized my thoughts better than I could):In the last five years, Gerstner has reaped a profit of [$$$] million in the sale of awarded stock options. These stock options were awarded while he held the joint positions of IBM CEO and chairman. During that period, IBM spent [$$$] billion buying back its own stock to drive the price up so that executives could cash out at handsome profits.This is money that could have been spent on developing new products, attracting new talent and honoring promises made to employees and retirees.Where did all that money come from?Not from profit growth, which remained flat at about 2 percent per year when you strip out the retirees' pension fund surplus \\"vapor profits.\\"It came from selling off large chunks of the company and its assets, laying off tens of thousands of employees and slashing pension and health care benefits for employees and retirees. In 2002 alone, IBM has quietly cut 15,000 jobs. Health benefits, which were promised \\"free for life,\\" now cost retirees asubstantial amount of their pensions. Only one minuscule cost-of-living increase has been awarded pension recipients in the past 11 years.The greed doesn't stop there. Now, Lou had not only been retained as chairman of the board, he has been awarded a 10-year consulting contract, with fully paid expenses at his previous salary of $2 million a year. These expenses have been conservatively estimated to be $100,000 annually.Save IBM? More like turning it into just another money grubbing corporation while lining his pockets. I would love to see a rebuttal book. God help us all if Lou's management methods become benchmarks for future corporate leaders."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Legendary CEO Louis V. Gerstner Jr. pulled off the turnaround of the century by bringing IBM back from near bankruptcy. He completely remade IBM, a monumental task considering its size, its hallowed traditions and mission, its strong corporate culture, and the remarkable challenges it faced in a rapidly evolving marketplace. He details the steps he took to resurrect IBM and restore its legendary leadership position, and he explains why he chose a bold, risky path to strengthen and unify the iconic company when astute observers believed it had become an irrelevant corporate relic. Gerstner says that even though he wasn't an author, he decided not to use a ghostwriter. Be glad he stuck with his own voice. getAbstract finds that he has written a superior business book: analytical, well organized, focused and methodical - a work of masterful storytelling in straight-shooter prose. Current and aspiring CEOs can learn from Gerstner's war stories and from his visionary leadership. This may be an ironic twist, considering Gerstner's famous quote that IBM didn't need vision - it needed superior strategizing and marketplace performance. As it turns out, he supplied all that and vision, too."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"I was crawling through this book and then the good stuff finally arrived. The last third of the book was worth the price of admission in some great observations and especially leadership ideas. I am not really into the business history of technology but Gerstner came through with some leadership nuggets worth remembering. So, it's a fast read if you just skim the first parts of the book and focus on the last."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Not only can Lou Gerstner run a business, he also writes a credible, well-crafted account of what he did. Despite many ex-IBM reviewers who despise him and a certain amount of ego that has to show through in a book like this, it feels like Lou had the analytic skills, strategic vision and ability to execute that made him the right guy at the right time for a very tough job.That said, he lost some credibility with me in his chapter on &quot;The System&quot;. Lou shows his distaste for government regulation then proposes an income tax revision that would tax away short term profits, a classic example of suggesting the system be micro managed with narrowly based regulation at a time when simplification and true reform are vital. And in case you didn't pick up his contempt for investment bankers earlier, this is the chapter where he really lets them have it. Ironically just after the book came out he signed on as the part-time Chairman of the Carlyle Group.Which leads to the strongest impression the book left on me: Lou's true success will be measured by history that still has to be written. Mr. Gerstner will now sit on top of a company that lives off of a military-industrial behemoth that's bigger than ever forty plus years after Ike warned us of it. If he can do big things to make that system work for the greater good, he'll be a hero of the 21st Century. If, however, he is just renting out his Rolodex, &quot;Elephants&quot; could turn out to be another on the long list entitled, &quot;buy the book, short the author.&quot;"},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Very early in his reign at IBM, Gerstner gave an interview to Fortune magazine, which subsequently wrote an unflattering profile of the man and the company. Unable to believe that the publication had revealed any of the truth about him, Gerstner was livid. Shortly afterwards, IBM stopped all advertising in Fortune. It was an expensive loss for the magazine, particularly as IBM was relaunching itself with the costly 'Solutions for a Small Planet' campaign. We'll never know whether the two events were linked, but the magazine industry certainly took on board the message that if you publish an uncomplimentary article on IBM, you'll lose a major advertising customer.In this book, Gerstner portrays himself as a private figure, reluctant now to make speeches, answer analyst questions, or do interviews. He hopes that his written account will be the definitive version of his life at IBM. It's hard to find any other: as soon as he arrived at IBM, he forbade all other executives from writing about their IBM careers. (Shortly before that, IBMers such as Jacques Maisonrouge and 'Buck' Rodgers had published their stories.)Gerstner admits in the book that he's into amassing personal wealth -- and with wealth comes status, something he craves even more. I don't think he cares much about society or about employees. The fact that he spent a number of years at the head of a cigarette firm (obsessed with market share, by the way) indicates that he had few qualms about the impact of his firm's products on the customer or society. Set against that, the foundations of his recently acquired 'passion' for education seem insecure. But then the english Queen gave him a knighthood for that.This book is a reasonably frank account by a man largely insensitive to the blight he cast on thousands of lives. My guess is that whether you buy this book or not will make no odds to him -- his personal fortune is too massive to notice -- but if you're influential, he'll care very much what you think and say about him."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Lou Gerstner has written an interesting first person study of how organizations can become plagued by inertia, and fall out of step with their industry. As an outsider, Gertsner was immediately able to spot troubling cultural behavior and ask questions about IBM's products, strategy, and way of conducting business that insiders did not. Some of the most interesting material deals with trying to change both strategy and behaviors once he recognized that they were leading IBM towards potential ruin.The turnaround at IBM has been quite a success story, and Gerstner definitely deserves his share of the credit. In the information technology business, becoming set in your ways can be the a kiss of death, and he explains in an easily readable style how he helped wake up big blue, while others would have preferred to fly it into the ground rather than change.Still, I wondered if as an outsider, he 'missed something' regarding the cultural at IBM. Clearly tying results to compensation, and removing power and status as key elements of the rewards system created a more market and profit focused company. But while 'Built to Last' outlines the importance of loyalty and continuity in first class companies, this trait seems to be looked down upon in the tech sector (not just at the pre-Gerstner IBM, but also more recently at HP and PeopleSoft.)In this regard, I enjoyed Andy Grove's book \\"Only the Paranoid Survive\\" a bit more, as he discusses fostering a winning culture at Intel that has kept them on top for quite a while, despite competing in an industry that requires constant innovation. You get the feeling that Gerstner was more of a Mr. Fixit...focused on the short-term turn-around. It would have been interesting to hear him talk more about the long-term strategies for IBM to remain competitive, and particularly how to use IBM's size as an asset rather than liability."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"&quot;Who Says Elephants Can't Dance&quot; is the history of Louis Gerstner, Jr.'s tenure at IBM. Mr. Gerstner joined IBM at a critical time when sales were slumping and the behemoth of a company was laying people off almost every quarter. What they needed was someone who could turn the company around and take it to new heights. What they had was a complex bureaucracy that allowed little change and tended to support the continued decline of the company. Of course we all know now that Mr. Gerstner was able to change IBM and produce a viable thriving company able to compete in the world markets once again. This is the story of what happened from Louis Gerstner's own hand.Mr. Gerstner provides insight into his viewpoint of what was happening in the company and his own fears and concerns from before the day he was named CEO until his retirement in 2002. If you want to know what was happening at the top and what he was thinking as he went along, you will want to read this book. If you read and liked Lee Iococca's book on his turnaround of Chrysler you will find this book similar and also very interesting in its own right. A study in tough management and changing direction with a company that has its own momentum, &quot;Who Says Elephants Can't Dance&quot; is a recommended read."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?

Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"I feel the high rating of this book is because most (in the know) who have had their fill of Gerstner could not justify buying it. Only an egotist would dare to look back at what occurred during that 10 year period, and try to paint them self as a genius.Gerstner failed to take credit for decimating the birthplace of IBM, Endicott NY, which already had an economy that was in decline. In the process of doing this, he dumps money that could have help revive Endicott, into Albany NY. I guess when the tax incentives run out it is time to move on, and as long as the technology stayed in NY, politicians who benefited from the Albany buildup could not get too upset (Yes George, I mean you).&quot;The dotcoms are dottoast&quot;, a quote from king louie V. This is after the tech bubble burst. Lost in the shuffle is the fact that months before the bubble burst millions were spent positioning the behemoth to be a dotcom generator using packaged hardware and software. If lou was so gifted, why did he wait until the end of the tech expansion to decide that becoming a dotcom generator was a good idea?How about inflated stock buybacks. Is that the stuff geniuses are made of, or can anyone do it?How about the body count (i.e. layoffs). Is that the stuff geniuses are made of, or can anyone do it?&quot;In the end, when Lou bids farewell to the new IBM, he admits that his heart has become a &quot;true Blue&quot;.&quot; A quote from a previous post. However, this does not explain why sir lou dumped his stock upon leaving IBM. Is that something that someone who is considered &quot;true&quot; to a company would do? I am sure there are many out there, but the only company head I know who is true to their company is Bill Gates, who for the most part only sells stock so he can donate money to charitable organizations. Old lou is true blue because the compensation package he received ensures he never has to spend a cent off his own money.In summary, the book is nothing but an egotist's attempt to paint a rosy picture for those who are unaware of the destruction he caused. In the end, in spite of the actions of sir lou, the recovery in the economy saved IBM."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?

Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"I asked a friend for business book recommendations and this was one of them. Even though it doesn't go into painstaking detail, Lou Gerstner gives you a pretty good idea what the function and role of a CEO is.It gives you a broad overview of how he managed to change IBM's culture and strategy and the rationale for doing so. Some of the company restructuring he discusses are: changing and implementing strategy, image and brand revival, strengthening customer relationships, the buying and selling of key business segments, how to change a company's culture, operational changes and managing top level executives.From reading the 1-star reviews on Amazon it is my understanding that he is unpopular with some former IBMers because he laid off a good chunk of its employees which he only gives terse recognition towards the beginning of the book. And when he does mention it he uses the clever euphemism \\"right-sizing\\" possibly as a defense mechanism to absolve himself of guilt from initiating mass layoffs. But as painful as they may be, layoffs are needed for struggling companies otherwise the entire company will be wiped-out.So if you're looking for an introductory overview of a CEO's duties and responsibilities I would recommend this book.

Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Gerstner's book about saving one of America's most important companies (IBM) from bankruptcy is interesting and a real page turner. IBM knew what was wrong after the PC became popular and mainframe computers lost much of their appeal, and had file drawers full of strategy documents on how to fix the situation, many of which would have worked, but IBM's top executives just could not change the company. Gerstner's insight was that IBM was its own worst enemy. Discovering what the single critical factor was in changing IBM and how Gerstner fixed it is worth many times the price of this book. However, two of Gerstner's conclusions are also worth reading: (1) He succeeded because of education, hard work, and self-help; and IBM succeeded not because of veniality, but because it found out what its customers and potential customers wanted and needed and supplied those needs and wants at a price the customers could afford. Life is fair and the world makes sense after all."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?

This book is a great example of how this process can be done right."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"As a departed employee of many years, the book provided little to capture my attention except to learn that Lou did at least have some grasp of the gridlock and culture problems resulting from chronic political infighting in the management ranks. There was no sudden clarity for why his apparent reign of terror was good for IBM, its customers, employees or the communities. Developing a good understanding of the situation inside of the company, but without a clue of how to compete in the industry, he develops a plan to keep IBM solvent. Indeed, IBM was a place where the brown spots in the lawns were painted green prior to a visit from the CEO. How much can a CEO actually know in a place like that? Lou neglects to discuss that his plan was to sell the seed corn, slash, burn and reap whatever was left of intrinsic value for personal gain. Basically, his plan to save the company was to 1) Surround himself with loyal friends. 2) Fire anyone that could get in his way. 3) Buy everyone else out with stock options and the resulting fear of loss 4) Sell every asset possible to generate cash. (including trees from un-used land) 5) Shut down every business that lost money. 6) Lay off everyone possible that contributed to pension liabilities. 7) Raid the remaining pension fund and use that cash to prop the stock price. 8) Make stock price the primary objective for everyone. 10) Ride the dot-com bubble to the top and bail out. 11) Write a book to justify his actions so he could sleep at night. Nowhere in the book does he mention anything about the rank and file, the thousands of families that lost their homes, ability to send kids to college, and lifetimes to prepare for retirement. Little is mentioned of any effort to develop new businesses, or describe technological initiatives, or the creation of anything. Nowhere does he describe the untold wealth he accumulated through his vast stock options. There are almost no stories about encounters with anyone interesting except a couple of backhanded swipes to the likes of Bill Gates. There are virtually no facts or numbers to back him up other than some very selective charts in an appendix. If you are looking for a book to tell you how to save a company, this is not it. If you are looking for book to learn how to be a great leader, this is not it. If you are looking for a book to learn how fouled up a big company can get, and how to leverage that for personal gain well, you will get that, but you have to read between the lines to put those pieces together."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?

Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"My first job after college was with IBM - during the boom of the S/360 computer introduction. These were glorious times with IBM. I left IBM eventually (for reasons not negative to IBM) but have always had a special fondness for the company. Even though IBM's internally focused management style ultimately got them into trouble, it spawned a workplace that treated the individual with the utmost respect which all of those who once worked for IBM could not help but appreciate.This book was a simply written and accurate depiction that covered the latter years of T.J Watson Jr.'s era through to today and the viability that the entrenched 1960's IBM culture had in the 1990's. The story is a facinating one and worth reading since I believe it is a 20th century story unique unto itself.For any of you who are IBM history buffs, two other books that I found very interesting fill in some of the detail around the 1970 and 1980 time period of IBM when Microsoft and Intel were taking market share. They both lay the groundwork for what Gerstner describes in his book:1. Big Blue, the Unmaking of IBM2. Hard Drive, Bill Gates and the Making of the Microsoft EmpireClearly Gerstner could not have seen every turnaround action he initiated through to conclusion. Many of these will take years. But I for one wish IBM the very best in the future and thank Lou for taking on this mission."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"In order to appreciate the essence of Gerstner, I would recommend you first read chapter #12 ('A brief history of IBM'). It's actually much more about the IT industry, or at least Gerstner's understanding of it. The man admits more than once that he came to IBM knowing nothing about IT, but that he should pen a chapter so littered with errors when leaving IBM is truly lamentable. For example, contrary to what he writes, IBM aimed the PC at businesses, not 'hobbyists and students', right form the outset. Contrary to what he writes, IBM was not a 'one-product company' in 1984: highly profitable products like the System/34, the Selectric typewriter and the Displaywriter had been around for years; even the IBM PC had been around for three years.It confirms what many in the industry suspected: that Gerstner never understood IBM's product lines. That's the main reason why he gave so few interviews -- it was virtually impossible to find a journalist who knew less about IBM's products than he did. If it was to be an open-ended interview, by the time the journalist got to the third question in any line of inquiry, Gerstner would be embarrassed and humiliated. He could do the occasional Comdex keynote speech, but there you don't have to take any questions, and anyway your speechwriters draft the text for you.Anyone wondering why the immensely successful AS/400 line fared so poorly under Gerstner will be none the wiser. He mentions it just once in the book, and then it is just in passing, in a list of products in an appendix.Gerstner complains in this book about other 'outspoken' CEOs like Gates, Ballmer and Ellison, but frankly he could never dare to take them on in open debate, because his understanding of any of the technical issues was so poor. In this book, he says that every decent CEO must be intimately acquainted with the finances of his or her company, but I cannot believe that a decent CEO should be so distant from the company's own products. Maybe if Gerstner hadn't spent so much time on public education and non-executive directorships in unrelated companies, he would have had more time to understand the product issues that drive strategy in the IT industry.So what does a bully do when he arrives at a company dominated by products and technology architectures? Answer: the only way he could begin to level the playing field -- i.e. to reduce the daily embarrassment -- between himself and the existing IBM directors was to shift the focus away from products. That's why Dennie Welsh's plan to massively expand IBM's services empire became so attractive. And it's why the whole e-business thing became so attractive to Gerstner in the mid-1990s. But IBM benefitted little from its e-business mindshare; by then IBM just didn't have the products, and so the main beneficiaries of the Internet boom were Sun and Microsoft.Gerstner admits in this book that, under his direction, IBM now plays the IT markets on a portfolio basis, quickly getting in and out of businesses as the hoped-for profits come and go. But, in the face of Microsoft, this approach is a disaster for any company with long-term aspirations. Microsoft is known for its tenacity, for trying again and again with new generations of products until it dominates markets -- witness the desktop market, the office suite market and the handheld markets. Currently Microsoft is playing the ERP market as a 10-year game. IBM now gives up on a market after two years; Microsoft almost never gives up. Which is the more successful? Indeed there are some who say that the installation of Gerstner was a Microsoft plot to destroy IBM from within -- to get IBM to ditch OS/2 and all its other proprietary architectures, under the &quot;open systems&quot; banner, in order to hand over the highly lucrative server market to the company that realised that to create value, you have to offer differentiated, proprietary products protected by patents. We'll never know how many Microsoft shares Gerstner held; certainly he dumped much of his IBM stock over the years.This book proves what we already knew: that Gerstner is neither an entrepreneur nor a technocrat. He is a destroyer, not a builder. When your company is in trouble, you need someone like Gerstner for 2-3 years to take the really tough decisions about which businesses and assets to sell off. But it is too much to expect such a person to continue at the helm when rebuilding and rapid growth is needed. Gerstner stayed at IBM about three years too long -- his dismal revenue record in Appendix C shows this."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Lou Gerstner has succeeded in writing a book which both provides valuable insights into the computer industry and the situation and success of IBM, as well as providing a roadmap for leaders seeking to effect strategic change in any industry. He reveals that IBM was close to running out of cash in 1993 before he stepped in and kicked out the investment bankers (later pilloried as greedy suppliers of the \\"hooch for all of the wild speculative periods in our economic history\\") who were preparing to sell of IBM, a national treasure, in pieces.The book is easy to read, non-technical, and laced with interesting anecdotes.Turning around IBM was one of the greatest business achievements of our time. I have worked much of my career in companies that competed against IBM and have known many ex-IBMers. All continue to have great respect for the people and the organization. There is no question that IBM had, and has, some of the best people in the world. Yet, they became unable to execute appropriate strategies quickly, losing much of their market share in the process.Lou Gerstner rejuvenated the company, a task which is rarely permanently successful in the high technology world. Today, IBM still sells mainframes (much less expensive now, but an extension of the basic architecture introduced in 1964). And, that technology is still at the center of the IT organizations of many of our largest companies. Introduced later, but now long gone, are the Digital VAX, the Intel 8080, the Zilog Z80 and various computer architectures from the likes of Prime, Wang, Data General, etc. Most have been replaced by Unix or Windows.We have Lou Gerstner to thank for saving IBM. As the book describes, he did it by focusing on the customer, eliminating useless bureaucratic processes, and, as a non-engineer, understanding the business implications of technology change better than most within IBM. But, it was execution, focus on cash flow and profits over revenues, and constant attention to detail in strategic planning and monitoring, together with communications and leadership which saved the day for IBM.The title is interesting. Elizabeth Moss Kanter, a Harvard Business School Professor, wrote Teaching Elephants to Dance in 1989. Gerstner refers to some of her other works late in the book, but not this one, which appears to have provided the inspiration for the title of his book."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Gerstner accurately describes what IBM was like back then. Employees believed they had a right to play around and still get paid. They were owed a lifetime job. Managers were frightened to death of actually disciplining anyone. Personnel dept would make your life miserable. Plus you would become known as someone who can't manage effectively. Fire someone?, forget it. First thing I learned when I made manager was never fire anybody. Just wait till you can unload them on someone else.IBM socialism meant that the sales offices constantly played around with quotas. So you never got really hurt, and you never really made big money. So why put out the effort? You weren't going to get fired.The [...] labs could care less what the market needed. They would play around with stuff until they had perfected it that last 1%. The fact that it would come out 6 months late and 20% overpriced never bothered them. Sales reps didn't sell what made a profit, they sold what had the most sales points attached.I don't think this is a great book but it is interesting and easy to read. And it is absolutely true that IBM needed someone to shake it violently by the collar to make it pay attention to the crisis. All the other reviwers whining about the changes remind me of all the people I knew at IBM who were in denial....\\"if we just wait a little longer... everything will be all right\\". Like it or not someone had to radically change the Company we all loved.Even though I lucked out and took the first buyout, I wish I still worked there. There is something about being an IBMer."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"The subtitle of this book is \\"Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround.\\" A more appropriate subtitle might have been, \\"Inside Lou Gerstner's Mind.\\" If you are looking for the intrigue and drama of IBM's near death and resurrection, this book is not it.It is a pretty good read, though. The first three parts are very interesting. They detail what Gerstner found at IBM and what he saw as the good worth keeping and the bad that needed tossing. Perhaps the funniest part of the book is on page 197 of the hardback that includes a glossary of IBM terms. In fact, there are many points of the book where one can imagine Gerstner with a perplexed look thinking, \\"Now, what in the #%&* did he just say?\\"The fourth part of the book really drags and doesn't offer any real vision of the future. Gerstner's talent is execution, not vision unlike, say, Bill Gates.I read \\"The Maverick and His Machine: Thomas Watson, Sr., and the Making of IBM\\" before reading this book. I could see how some of the culture that Mr. Watson created in founding IBM had become more important that the business when Mr. Gerstner arrived. I recommend the books as a one-two punch.Overall, this is a good book, not too self-congratulatory nor too technical and analytical."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Gerstner is arrogant but with good reason. He knew what to do and did it, however unpopular it was. He was brought in to save this company (and protect its shareholders) from the foibles of the career IBMers who, without malice, were destroying what the Watsons had created. He wasn't there to protect jobs or careers. Gerstner rightly saw that IBM should not be a welfare program for \\"loyal\\" employees; it had to be a productive and profitable enterprise and he did what was necessary. Good for him. Genius is always hard to pin down but I have no doubt that this man is a genius and \\"Elephants\\" gives great insight into his thinking and actions. (But it also makes clear that, as Shakespeare might say of Lou, \\"The milk of human kindness does not flow through his veins.)"},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"REVIEW: This book falls into the standard popular management/business book category for the mass market similar to the book published about a year earlier by another retiring prominent CEO of a large multinational company, &quot;Jack: Straight from the Gut&quot;. However, there are significant differences between the two and the main differences are reflected in the titles. As the titles suggest, &quot;Jack&quot; is more of an autobiography told in a very opinionated manner whereas Gerstner's book is more about the company during Gerstner's years and how (in broad terms) the company transitioned to a more flexible, entrepreneurial organization.The book is organized into five parts: (1) Gerstner's beginnings at IBM, (2) Strategy, (3) Culture, (4) Lessons Learned, and (5) Observations. The first four parts are mostly about IBM and the transformation whereas the last section is mostly about Gerstner's views on industry, society, journalists, etc. I highly enjoyed sections 1-4 but felt section 5 didn't really fit the book purpose and it seemed almost as though the editor/publisher convinced him to add the section in order to make the book the standard size. The problem with section 5 is that Gerstner's states clearly that he believes the book should be about IBM and the turnaround, but section 5 is a half hearted attempt to give some personal musings about miscellanious things that at best seem like good political opinions and at worst sound like whinings.However, excepting section 5, I got more out of this book more than Welch's. Gerstner clearly tries to lead the reader to greater understanding of the IBM situation, the thinking behind the decisions that were made, and the resulting turnaround. He does this in a style that doesn't suggest his answers are universal ones. He recognizes that imparting better understanding rather than the right answers is the appropriate goal for helping others to achieve better results in complex environments. This book probably doesn't deserve a permanant place on your bookshelf (i.e. it is unlikely to be a classic), but if your looking for better understanding of the IBM turnaround or of large business in general, this is a good book to read. If your looking for a better understanding of an individual CEO read Welch's book.STRENGTHS: Written in the standard style of popular business books so it has fairly short chapters and is easy to read. Doesn't try to espouse too much theory or universal answers. Does a good job at explaining why certain decisions were made and certain strategies selected. Doesn't get bogged down in stock prices and financial data.WEAKNESSES: Section 5, Gerstner's observations I thought was off target and weaker than the remainder of the book. Little insight into Gerstner himself (but that wasn't the book's intention). Some sections were a bit too brief and could've used additional detail."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"I got what I was looking for in this book - Mr. Gerstner's personal view on the challenges he met at IBM and what he did to protect its new life from what he called IBM's Bolsheviks. He is very forward about the fact this is from his view point. He even wondered up front if anyone would want to read about his day at the office! In particular, the section on culture should be required reading in any graduate level class. His practical and experienced view supports what the theorists have been telling us for some time - culture is the driving force to the organization. As a book, it's a short read since a significant portion of it are the appendixes. While his prose comes across as personable, his own description of himself does make him come across as someone who may have been a very cool cookie having to take the hard stand. What's most interesting is the history he reveals of a company which became arrogant and distant from its customers - that \\"history\\" is being played out right now by Microsoft. When you read about how IBM managed its pricing with its contribution to poor sales prior to Gerstner's arrival, you can't help but wonder if Bill Gates is paying attention since he's doing close to the same thing with his new licensing policies. Yes, we repeat history if it's not studied, and for a direct, to the point account of near death experience IBM had, this is a good read. I gave it one star less than five because towards the end (the last 40 pages or so) it began to get a bit repetitive with themes he already had in the earlier part."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"During the 1990's every computer company did well. I believe that Gerstner did a good thing when he expanded into the Global Services Unit. But I would not go as far as saying that he &quot;saved&quot; IBM corp from going bankrupt! He failed to mention how selfish and cruel he is in his book. He forgot to talk about the jet that he took as a going away gift from IBM corp upon retirement...In addition, he took an apartment in Manhatten, a large bonus, stock options just to mention a few. While he took from the corporation others had major salary cuts and layoffs. People have committed suicide because they lost their jobs. I didn't see any of that in his book about saving a company...at what cost!! He is the most hated and most selfish CEO. IBM employees all over the world cringe at his &quot;good business&quot; practices. I would recommend that you read this book at the bookstore. Don't buy it."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Before I start my review I'd just like to say I purchased and read this book before reading any of the other reviews, and this is my first time hearing about how Louis Gerstner was the \\"near downfall\\" of IBM. Most of the reviews of this book talk about Gerstner's public image and how he ruined the IBM culture, all of which I am not familiar with. I'll be reviewing primarily what was in the book.I picked up the book after hearing about it from my managers manager, who commented on the management strategies in it. I generally don't read a lot of non-fiction, but thought it would be interesting to read about the world from a CEO's viewpoint. I wasn't disappointed.Who Says Elephants Can't Dance gave me a great insight into what it would be like to be a high level executive at a huge company - their motiviations, thought process, and some strategies they might use. Several basic strategies were outlined which seemed general enough to apply in other situations, and they all made sense given the description of IBMs situation at the time. Most important (in my opinion) was the justification given for the strategies taken by Mr. Gerstner - most of the actions he took followed his basic strategies, and where he diverged from them he explains why.While it definitely delivered what it had promised (explaining how Mr. Gerstner was able to make a large, slow company into a large, fast one), it did have some failings:- It was not well laid out as a reference (if, for example you wanted to look up a particular strategy and how it was applied).- It was written in a style which led me to imagine an aging man telling stories about his \\"good old days\\". This did keep the book interesting, but clearly downplayed the negative decisions and negative results, which I would have found interesting.Other than the above two points, this book was an excellent read. It has definitely interested me in business strategy, decision making and management, and I would recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"IBM should thank its lucky stars that Louis Gerstner, Jr. was there to save the day. His strategic and complex scheme to save the country was utter genius. In his book, &quot;Who Says Elephants Can't Dance&quot;, Gerstner explains how he took IBM by the throat and shook its economical and technological foundations until a dramatic metamorphosis occurred. I liked the fact that Gerstner went solo to write this book because that helped me to understand what he was thinking when he made his different choices. Everything from reintegrating the IBM management team to unveiling IBM's e-business idea was so precise in a book that lacks length (being under 300 pages long). This book will inspire anyone with the hopes of being management material. It's definitely worthy of a five-star rating."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"This book is very easy to read and keeps the reader's attention throughout. I felt that the author got into just enough detail to make his points without dragging down the pace of the book. Being able to see inside the \\"IBM machine\\" to understand how it functioned and how it changed was very fascinating to me. Getting thousands of people to change the way they think about their jobs, about IBM's business, and about the culture of the company just seems like an incredibly daunting task, yet he walks the reader through just how he did it, while reminding us all that it's only impossible if you believe it is impossible (an excellent life lesson).While reading the book I found myself asking if I would have made the same decisions that Gerstner did. In many cases the answer was yes (Monday morning quarterbacking is great isn't it?), but there were many decisions that he had to make that took a lot of guts, and in some cases they were the wrong decisions. He freely admits that not all of his ideas worked, but it was better to try, fail, learn and move on, than never to try at all.Throughout the book Gerstner gives credit to many people that were instrumental in the turnaround. I respect a person who doesn't assume all of the glory. I can see why he was able to get thousands of people to believe in and follow his ideas. He comes across as a very charismatic individual. Easily one of the top ten people you would love to meet at a party.In the appendix of the book the author includes copies of employee communications so that the reader can gain a better understanding of the situation at the time. Some of these are letters to employees; some are announcements, while others are e-mails to Gerstner himself from employees. I found this to be an excellent addition to the book, providing additional insight into his and IBM's world.ConclusionThis was a very good book and highly recommended for anyone in management. I believe it to be an excellent case study in what happens when companies become complacent, and an equally valuable case study in how to turn a company around. I believe it has some very instructive advice while at the same time reminding the reader that every situation is different, and that sometimes you have to go with your gut feel.This book gives the reader the unique opportunity to get inside the mind of one of the great, and highly successful businessmen of our time, during a time when he was attempting to tackle perhaps his greatest life challenge. I found the book very informative and insightful, and will most likely find myself reading it again.RatingI gave this book a rating of four stars out of five. While I found the content fascinating, the author's style could have been better. I found some sections to be a little too brief and needing a bit more elaboration. The flow could have been a bit smoother also. All in all, I would still definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"I have not and will not buy this book. Gerstner's approach was pure abuse, such as the way some animal trainers get wild animals to perform. Gerstner was able to rid IBM of company loyalty, sacrifice investment in future products for immediate profitability, and bloat the salaries of a select few while making &quot;the most important resource&quot; totaly expendable.

Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"I worked for IBM in Israel for 8 years, 1984 until 1992. The full employment policy was used as an excuse for lower salaries, as we were guaranteed employment as long as we wanted it. When I confronted HR with the fact that I am being sold an insurance policy that IBM can't possibly maintain in a competitive market I was branded a troublemaker and all my chances of promotion were eliminated. Managers were the people that made the least number of mistakes, 'we are IBM, we can't make any mistakes' was the leading concept. All this culture was there for Lou Gerstner to change. My friends at IBM tell me that he had done a tremendous job at that, and this book is a great description of what he did and how he did it.For those with internal IBM knowledge it is a hilarious reminder of the old IBM, for those without, it is an invaluable lesson on business."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?

This is a strict business book with internal memos and charts at the end so it can lend itself to being a bit boring in some parts. However, when the authir describes how he was able to navicate thru the huge complexity of all the different divisions, then this book becomes a valuable reference for any business leader who needs to go thru the same process."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Louis V. Gerstner, Jr.'s WHO SAYS ELEPHANTS CAN'T DANCE? is Gerstner's account of how he managed the turnaround of ailing computer mainframe giant IBM during his years as CEO (1993-2002). The book is at its best when Gerstner gives his personal account of his first experiences with Big Blue. For me, though, the details of the IBM revival are less captivating, and my interest began to flag about halfway through the book.I picked up WHO SAYS ELEPHANTS CAN'T DANCE? for leadership and management training purposes. The section in which he talks about corporate culture--in particular, the chapter \\"Leading by Principles\\" --includes what I think are valuable insights into what aspects of IBM's culture were self-defeating, and what principles Gerstner introduced to help turn this moribund culture around. These eight principles, listed on pp. 201-202, are worth reviewing. Like many management principles, they are not particularly earth-shattering, but I have found that organizations that can adhere to such principles as \\"We never lose sight of our strategic vision\\" (#5), and \\"We think and act with a sense of urgency\\" (#6) are more than likely going to be successful--and be, moreover, places that attract and retain good employees.It's true that Gerstner is self-aggrandizing at times, for example, in his description of his philanthropic efforts. I'm willing, though, to tolerate a little chest-beating from people who are devoting their personal resources to the greater good. (As an aside, I think he underestimates the good that corporate money can do for charitable efforts--he favors rather the donation of a company's expertise to the community--but this is a minor point.)Gerstner's book isn't one to be devoured, I think. But it is worthwhile reading in parts, in particular, those sections in which he shares his experience of and knowledge about managing people. If you are interested in learning how to lead an organization to greatness, you should definitely check this book out."},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"Folks familiar with the theory of Black Holes might know that once a Star outgrows a certain mass, it has a tendency to collapse under its own gravity and become a black hole. This is the kind of state where IBM was in 1993. IBM had outgrown under its own success and was about to dis-integrate and collapse and thereby leave a huge black hole in the world of Information Technology. This book is all about how Lou V Gerstner single handedly saved IBM from its near collapse.In this book, Lou Gerstner has done an nice job of providing rare insights into the issues(and their causes) that were ailing IBM in pre-1993 era. And how he systematically & methodically addressed those during his nine years at IBM from 1993(when he became CEO of IBM) to 2002 (when he retired from IBM).Lou Gerstner's narration about his first day as IBM CEO who was left knocking on the doors of IBM is telling of the IBM culture at that time. In 1993, when Lou Gerstner took IBM's reins, IBM had become a collection of small, small fiefdoms where every head of the Business Unit was selfishly guarding his own interest and dreaming of becoming a CEO by going IPO someday. IBM mainframe business was failing. The world seemed to be moving towards Client Server architecture. Instead of being customer focused, IBM was becoming internally focused. IBM stock was plummeting. Stock holders were getting impatient. All in all, there was chaos within the company.Against this background and against the common wisdom/expectations, Lou Gerstner sticked to his guns and decided on keeping IBM together. He meticulously regrouped IBM by providing one single leadership at the top. Magically reversed the core IBM mainframe business by cutting prices and becoming customer focused. Synergized the IBM messaging division by providing single message to all the world. Intelligently put his bet on Services, Software and eBusiness. Realigned the employee incentive system to encourage the culture that promotes customer oriented actions. All of which paid off tremendously. If Stock Market is any barometer, the IBM stock rose from sub $10 to $140 under the leadership of Lou V Gerstner.This all may seem trivial but considering the disappearance of big companies like AT&T;, the turnaround of company with IBM's size and stature just seems amazing!This book is really, really good. If at all, the only complaint I have is that it does not talk about any of Lou's failures. The book not only provides good business lessons, it also provides good personal lessons. Specially Lou's passion for winning is infectious.Overall an excellent, excellent read ...-Sachin"},{"Title":"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?

I think that is the hardest thing a CEO can achieve. His vision, his attention to details but still seeing the big picture amazed me. No wonder they picked him as the great saver of the IBM legend.The book is long and sometimes repeats itself, without going into details.The part I enjoyed the most was his e-mails. How encouraging was he after 9/11, he mentioned employee names and all the things they did both to help and also to get their business going. He sent e-mails to his 300.000 employees.

You can customize the learnings in this book to suit you if you lead a team of six men or if you lead an organization of six hundred thousand. Typically books like these touch on three aspects of corporate life: Information, Knowledge and Wisdom. A Manager who understands the functionality of business can write a book that informs.

Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround","review":"This is a fascinating account, written by the man who orchestrated it, of the historic turn around of IBM. In 1993, IBM was heading to extinction; mired in the tradition and culture of its own success, it was unable to respond to the pace and behaviors of the new economy. Through relentless determination to return IBM to profitability, Gerstner sold what many would consider significant assets and developed ideas that were considered risky by the established wisdom.A significant section of the book concerns the work done to change the culture of IBM. While this turnaround was the most significant to the success of the venture, it was also the most difficult to accomplish. He turned the popular wisdom on its ear by exposing that \\"vision is not the same as \\"strategy. It's very easy to develop visions. It's the same thing as Babe Ruth pointing to the fences\\". Customer focus ruled the day, with quick responses to their needs. Leadership was brilliant in understanding that Service would become a vital part of the industry and became the niche that IBM was perfectly suited to inhabit.\\"Who says elephants can't dance?\\" is a fast paced read, hard to put down and written in the style of a novel. It holds the readers interest with unfolding developments and exciting outcomes. I would recommend this book for people who are interested in the new network economy and the companies that rule the day. Also for anyone in a leadership position, this book has invaluable support for making the hard decisions."},{"Title":"Submarines of the Tsarist Navy: A Pictorial History","review":"This book is exactly what it says it is - a pictorial history. It consists of pictures, drawings, accompanying comments and really not much more. After about 2-3 pages of introductory text it goes right into showing you the photos you will not find anywhere, but in this book or russian navy archives. There are photos of every type of submarine in the tsarist army shown, in fact I think there is one photo for every submarine built for the tsarist navy. In addition for every type of a submarine, a submarine's drawing showing its layout is included. Every type of a submarine is briefly described including technical specs, submarines built and their end. Overall it's a must have for people interested in submarine history as well as Russian navy of that period. I would recommend buying another book along with this, which will tell you in detail about operations and detailed history of the submarines pictured.

While one is reading dozens of books and they are all the same, this one brings some original contribution to divination with the Tarot . I really liked this book, and I would recommend to anyone - providing you are buying it with a particular purpose in mind.

As more babies are developing head asymmetry (plagiocephaly) due to back sleeping, this book gives good pointers on identifying and addressing these asymmetries early. As the author notes, head asymmetries are not just a cosmetic issue -- they're associated with jaw pain and migranes into adulthood. It's much better to use the techniques she details on a newborn then have to resort to other methods like tummy sleeping and cranial helmets later in the first year. -- From someone who's been there and wished I had this info and awareness when my daughter was born."},{"Title":"Baby beautiful: A handbook of baby head shaping","review":"When my darling baby boy, Joneseykin Luther III, was born with a visibly conical head, my wife Henrietta and I contemplated flushing him.

That's why they called him Shoeless Joe. Some say he was the greatest baseball player ever. Even the mighty Babe Ruth copied his swing. But what most people don't know is just how Shoeless Joe became such a great hitter...&quot; So begins Phil Bildner's engaging tale about Joe Jackson's infamous bat, Betsy. It was a hitting slump that sent Joe to bat smith, Charlie Ferguson. He wanted a special bat that &quot;pitchers are going to honor and respect&quot; and he knew Ol' Charlie was the man to make it. After several trials and errors, Betsy came to life, 36 inches long, and 48 ounces, she was made out of hickory from the strong, north side of the tree, and stained black with tobacco juice to &quot;make her dark and scary-looking.&quot; And with the help of Betsy at the plate, Shoeless Joe Jackson batted .408 his rookie year. &quot;And to this day, no rookie has ever had a finer year than Shoeless Joe.&quot; Shoeless Joe &amp; Black Betsy is more fable than biography, and Mr Bildner takes a lot of liberties with the facts. But his text is entertaining, and filled with humor and lots of back woods colloquialisms that make this picture book perfect for reading aloud. C. F. Payne's marvelously expressive and detailed illustrations are captivating, and add just the right touch of drama to bring the story to life. With a comprehensive Afterword and &quot;baseball card&quot; full of facts, figures, and statistics to complete the story, Shoeless Joe &amp; Black Betsy is a fine debut that is sure to whet the appetite of baseball fans 5-10, and send them out looking for more."},{"Title":"Shoeless Joe and Black Betsy","review":"\\"Shoeless Joe & Black Betsy\\" sets us in the Carolinas, where Shoeless Joe, before he makes his record-setting Rookie year, talks to the best bat maker in the state to make him a bat to get out of his horrid slump. Through much trial and error, Joe finds the perfect bat. The plot was very clear, but I had to say this is one of the best books I've seen in review for my Teaching Reading course.The slang use is very realistic and open, and the way it repeated itself drew the children into the story. The illustrations are beautiful to the eye and fit well into the \\"back woods\\" feel of the story, mostly set in the Bat Maker's shack.The book takes more then a few liberties with the truth - but they make the story more entertaining. The authors explain where they stretched the facts in a two-page story explanation, which includes Joe's involvement in the Black Sox scandal, and followed by another beautiful full-page drawing by C. F. Payne and a full career statistics.I recommend this book - a student with an interest in baseball will eat this up. Students who like different stories, or who like when they are read to in an odd accent will want more. I hope there will be, with so many great baseball stories out there."},{"Title":"Shoeless Joe and Black Betsy","review":"I bought this book for my grandchildren so my husband could share it with our grand chrildren when they talk about baseball..........."},{"Title":"Shoeless Joe and Black Betsy","review":"While this is a beautifully illustrated and well written book, the liberties the author took with the story of Joe Jackson are a disservice to young readers and listeners.

There is so much that can be recounted in a book about this unique character that I found myself truly regretting the liberty that was taken with a bit of history. The story says that Joe wanted his bat to weigh 48 ounces, the same as the number of states. The author confesses in the afterword that there were only 46 states at the time Joe began playing in the minors, 1908. That one alteration of fact taints an otherwise beautifully told story. One must then question other information presented in the book. Pity. The deviation from the truth adds nothing to the story and causes me to question the book's inclusion in a library collection for young readers.

The book presents a very interesting and insightful view into the life of a northern French medieval community (certain seigneury of St. Aliquis). This work is 418 pages in length and consists of twenty-four chapters. The book is centered around the time of A. D. 1220. Although depicting French customs, one could assume that many were also indicative of England and Germany.Topics such as hospitality, women's lives, clothing, cooking, falconry and hunting, literature, education and much more are covered in great detail. This is one of the first texts I used when teaching an introductory course to medieval history. I have found the work clearly written and one of the best books ever written on medieval daily life.The Preface states, \\"Northern France was par excellence the homeland of Feudalism and hardly less so of Chivalry, while by general consent the years around 1220 mark one of the great turning epochs of the Middle Ages. We are at the time of the development of French kingship under Philip Augustus, of the climax and the beginning of the waning of the crusading spirit, of the highest development of Gothic architecture, of the full blossoming of the popular Romance literature, and of the beginning of the entirely dissimilar, but even more important, Friar movement.\\"The work was re-printed in 1990 by Biblo & Tannen Booksellers & Publishers.

Professor Davis had a way of discussing the day-to-day life in historic times in a way that was both comprehensible and interesting.There are many books that purport to discuss the daily life of other civilizations, but they are often so dry and academic that they are not even a trifle entertaining. Davis has shown that it is possible to write amusingly while pouring a great deal of information into the reader's mind.The book is about the fictional Barony of St. Aliquis--Latin for \\"Saint Anybody\\"--in the Duchy of Quelqueparte--French for \\"Anywhere\\"--and the politics, wars, religion, marriages, and other aspects of life in what is arguably the cultural flower of Medieval France.I highly recommend this book for readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Life on a mediaeval barony: A picture of a typical feudal community in the thirteenth century","review":"I got this book as part of my mother's used book collection, but never read it.

I used it to put together a book of my own (giving credit to Prof. Davis,) with bits and pieces of info on life in those times. I even made it in a style of books back then, made and illuminated by the monks, with rubber stamps here and there, and pictures, and gold on the edges. It will serve as part of the entertainment, read in between the madrigal singing and the jugglers.I felt that since Prof. Davis was an expert and also writing in a different age from the present that it was more authentic than some of some self-professed 'experts' who get their info from who-knows-where, and go spouting off about this and that being this or that way. He even gave references for his info sources. It helped me put things I had heard or seen in the context of true or not.I like History of just about anywhere and anytime--it is of interest to me as to how other people lived.

After one disasterous Christmas, the children decide they want an actual, maternal mother - a real mother - so they trap their mother in a sauna where they hold her hostage for months, take away her booze and cigarettes, and make her wear flowery feminine clothes. Throughout the book, the author tricks you into feeling indignant, and satisfied that this horrible mother finally got hers. Then the book's ending takes you completely by surprise (I pride myself on seeing things coming - I didn't see this at all).

The mutual antipathies and clashing interests of the Americans, their difference of governments, habitudes, and manners, indicate that they will have no center of union and no common interests. A disunited people to the end of time, suspicious and distrustful of each other, they will be divided and subdivided into little communities or principalities, according to natural boundaries, by great bays of the sea, and by vast rivers, lakes, and ridges of mountains.\\"George Washington said it was yet to be known whether the American Revolution had been a blessing or a curse. No one yet knew whether Americans had replaced the stable government of the British Empire, imperfect though it might be, with something worse.John Fiske vividly reminds us of just how fragile the United States was in the years after winning its independence:* That the states regarded themselves as sovereignties that thumbed their noses at the Articles of Confederation and were hostile to each other, even to the extent of embargoing each other's trade and waging border wars to drive out encroaching settlers from other states.* That the United States was surrounded by the empires of Britain, France, and Spain, then at the height of their powers, that were opportunistic in wanting to reincorporate American territories back into their empires.* That there were local politicians driven either by anarchist ideology or selfish ambition who wanted the states to declare their independence from each other and assume the full title of sovereign nations while abandoning the trans-Appalachian territories to the foreign powers* That only by very narrow margins did the men of broader vision such as Washington, Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison --- men who understood America's unique opportunity to secure liberty by federating as a single nation --- overcome the designs of lesser men to fragment the country into petty states.John Fiske captures the anarchist spirit of those times better than anyone with the possible exception of Dale Van Every, whose book ARK OF EMPIRE I have also reviewed. Anyone who reads either of these books will come to a full appreciation of how fortunate we are to live in the \\"United\\" States.If not for the greatness of our leaders in the 1780s and 1790s, and the patient wisdom of most of our people, the War Between the States would have started immediately following the American Revolution and gone on for decades. Instead of being a strong nation we would have followed the pattern of fragmentation, revolution, anarchy, and wars between petty states that held Latin America back for so long.Lucky indeed that we made the wise choices during the infancy of our nation that preserved and prosperted the United States of America. Fiske makes it clear what a close-run process it was."},{"Title":"The Bleeding Season","review":"Do I have your attention yet? Once in awhile a book comes along that is so well written and so captivating that it leaves you simply breathless in it's wake, and 'The Bleeding Season' is just that book.Using a similar theme to Stephen King's 'The Body' and Robert R. McCammon's 'Boy's Life', one of a group of boys struggling towards adulthood and beyond, 'The Bleeding Season' is no camp follower or second contender to either of the mentioned famous stories.Told in first person by Alan Chance, one of five boys growing up in Potter's Cove, a small town on the coast of rural Massachusetts not far from New Bedford. Life was seemingly happy until their teens, when Tommy was killed by a careless driver. Only Alan, Donald, Rick, and Bernard remained, now deprived of their leader. The boys grow into men, Alan into a failed writer and menial night security job, Rick to a bouncer after a one year stint in prison, Donald into a dead end word processing job, and Bernard into a used car salesman after injuring his knee in Marine training.And then, just shy of their fortieth birthdays, Bernard commits suicide, leaving behind only a duffle bag and a strange recorded message filled with doubts and fear for the rest. Alan cannot let go of Bernard, feeling compelled to discover the deeper meaning behind Bernard's final and lonely goodbye. What he uncovers is the stuff that nightmares are made of.Alan, Donald, and Rick find out that Bernard was never who they had thought he was, and slowly begin to uncover a long trail of purely dark evil that had been festering underneath their very noses. From past to present, Bernard's ghosts and demons begin to haunt their sleep, spewing out bodies in their wakes and leaving behind a sense of utter darkness. Even when Alan looses first his job and then his wife Toni, he still cannot turn away from the secrets hidden inside their past.Greg F. Gifune's writing is real and raw, deeply poignant, excessively talented, and leaves behind naked emotion painted with words. Rarely will I read a book that can't be found for less than forty dollars and tell my listeners that it is worth the cost, but 'The Bleeding Season' definitely is. Buy it, read it, then resell it if you can. But if you are like me, the impact will be too completely brutal for you to do anything other than clutch the book to your chest as you scream out, 'Why? Why? Why?'Gifune has mastered the creeping horror and intense dread of confronting the darker side of humanity and beyond, the demons that dwell both inside and outside the human flesh, and he serves them up on a shattered platter here for our minds to devour. I cannot recommend this book highly enough, no aficionado of horror should miss it, definitely a 10 star novel. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Bleeding Season","review":"This was my first experience with Gifune and I came away from this novel with ambivalent feelings, to say the least. This is truly a work of dark fiction. His writing is exceptionally intelligent and his atmospherics can give you a creepy feeling up your spine. Yet equally, I was disappointed with other elements which I shall share later.I have seen comparisons of \\"The Bleeding Season\\" to Stephen King's \\"The Body\\" yet I find it perhaps more similar to his coming-of-age and returning to finish unfinished business portrayed in \\"It.\\" Five childhood friends (Alan, Tommy, Rick, Donald, and Bernard) form a lifelong bond growing up in the small town of Potter's Cove on the rural coast of Massachusetts, although Tommy, their spiritual leader is tragically killed when hit by a car as a teenager. Unknown to the boys at the time, this sad event sets in motion a series of events that changes them and their hopes and dreams forever and culminates when they approach their forties with the suicide of Bernard.Bernard seemingly had always been the most vulnerable of group, a notorious liar and exaggerator who was always accepted as part of the whole even though he seemed to have the least to offer. After his unexpected suicide, the three survivors receive an audio suicide/farewell note from him that is filled with philosophical accusations, painful revelations, and critical evaluations of each of them from his perspective.As hurtful as the thoughts and comments in the audiotape are, Alan, the \\"conscience\\" of the group, cannot let Bernard's spirit and memory go without delving deeper for meaning and substance behind Bernard's death. Contributing to their need to find out \\"why\\" is the fact that each of the friends experience the same macabre dreams that contain a dead Bernard and other creepy symbolism. With very little to go on but his duffle bag, a photo of an unknown woman, and their own memories, the three surviving friends, prodded by Alan, begin an investigation that quickly reveals Bernard was never who or what they thought he was.Indeed, a trail of mutilated bodies begins to turn up along with more clues and indications that their deceased friend was perhaps surrounded by a darkness and evil that none of them had ever suspected. A race against time ensues as the investigation risks friendships, marriages, and sanity as the three move ever closer to discovering the source of the evil that may or may not ultimately claim them also.My problem with \\"The Bleeding Season\\" was twofold. The pacing was ponderously slow in the first half of the book. Although I felt I knew where things were headed, it took an awful long time to get there. Secondly, while the characters were fully developed by Gifune, I found myself not caring about any of them on a deeper level--I never felt invested personally in their struggle. Even Alan was unsympathetic to me as he clumsily handled his relationship with Toni and as he stubbornly stayed on task through sometimes confusing dark philosophical musings. The only compelling factor left to me as the reader was to discover the ultimate source of the evil to solve the mystery."},{"Title":"The Bleeding Season","review":"The Bleeding Season by Greg F. Gilune is a unique horror novel about five inseparable best friends. When one of them is struck by a car and killed, things change forever between them all. As they approach their fortieth birthday, another of the friends commits suicide. There is a string of hideous murders, and the three surviving friends must quickly solve the mystery of evil incarnate before the death toll rises to claim their own lives -- or worse! Macabre reading, The Bleeding Season is one of those horror fantasy novels which are so easy to pick up and so hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Bleeding Season","review":"Childhood friends reconnect as adults to solve a disturbing mystery surrounding the suicide of one in their group. The writing and editing are tight and the work of a writer with a mature voice. This was my second story and first novel by Gifune and I was impressed with how much emotion and reader immersion he created. I was sucked into most scenes and often forgot I was reading. Yes, the mark of a great storyteller!The story itself didn't blow me away (the basic premise reminded me of multiple similar stories), but the way it was told, including the deep characterization, engaged and entertained. It easily captured my interest and skillfully swept me toward the climactic ending. A well-paced, well-written dark fiction read. 3.75 stars, rounded up. 5,902 Kindle Locations. Recommended for readers who like strong character-driven stories with an emphasis on mystery and suspense over action-packed horror."},{"Title":"The Bleeding Season","review":"I have seen many blurbs on other horror books likening the storytelling to \\"an early Stephen King\\". In most, if not all of those cases, I disagree wholeheartedly. Mr. Gifune does write like the early Stephen King. Group of childhood friends, one dies early on the other commits suicide (not a spoiler, you'd find this on the back of the book). Bernard is the friend who commits suicide. He leaves behind an audiotape in which he makes some startling statements and revelations. The remaining friends must piece together memories they had forgotten or purposely pushed way down into their subconscience to find out exactly what their friend Bernard was up to and in to. Then the creepiness ensues. The characters are so well developed you feel like you know them. The plot never lets up, yet is not rushed. It takes an extremely talented writer to actually make one feel uncomfortable or truly scared and Mr. Gifune delivers. The essence of suspense is palpable. No exaggeration-I literally had goosebumps reading one passage. \\"The Bleeding Season\\" is by far one the best books I have ever read. I hope many more readers discover Greg F. Gifune-they don't know what they've been missing!"},{"Title":"The Bleeding Season","review":"This was the first book by Greg Gifune and I thoroughly enjoyed it. In high school the five were inseparable: Tommy, the leader; Rick, the jock; Donald, the intellectual; Alan, a regular guy; and Bernard, the \\"loser.\\" Tommy, however, was killed in a tragic accident, but the remaining four stayed close. Their friendship lasted until adulthood even as each went their separate ways. Then, unexpectedly, Bernard hangs himself leaving Rick, Alan, and Donald with unanswered questions. However, Bernard provides some clues in a \\"suicide note\\" in which he astutely outlines the feelings and lives of each of his friends and suggests a darker way of life for himself. Then the bodies begin to be found and this leaves no question that Bernard is responsible. The rest of the book has the friends analyzing the past and searching out Bernard's secret existence in the present looking for hints. Bernard plans to reunite his friends in a darker reality.Gifune's writing evokes a tangible sense of dread throughout and gives the feeling that something the reader can't quite put their finger on is not right. The plot moves swiftly and the narrative is populated with odd secondary characters that I found interesting. The story is written in the first person from the point of view of Alan and even though I generally do not like first person narratives it works here. The only complaint I have is that one character's discourse on evil lasts several pages too long and is somewhat overbearing, hitting the reader with the same idea over and over. Gifune could have shortened this dialogue by a few pages and tightened it up without losing any of the desired impact. Overall, I cannot recommend this novel to horror fans enough and I will definitely seek out more of his work."},{"Title":"The Bleeding Season","review":"The Bleeding Season drew me in right away with the author's almost lyrical style of writing. Immediately I was intrigued to know, who was \`he'? And why were the deaths happening? I enjoyed getting to know the characters in this book and the author described the setting so well that I felt like I was there with the characters witnessing what was going on. This was a really great book. If you enjoy scary thrillers you will love this book. It's one of those books where you want to cover your eyes because you are so scared but you just have to keep reading. I could see this book becoming a movie!FYI, the author asked me to read and review this book and this is my honest review."},{"Title":"The Bleeding Season","review":"This was a very clever and well written book about a group of friends who are struck with tragedy and find themselves in the path of a vicious killer soon after. You get to know and connect with the main characters early on and as their situation becomes increasingly horrific, you find yourself reading in long stretches to find out what happens. The pace picks up faster and faster as the novel progresses and the powerful, nerve-wracking prose keeps up all the way through. A definite gem for fans of the horror and thriller genres."},{"Title":"The Bleeding Season","review":"I read the description and thought that I would take a chance on this one and I am very happy I did. Make sure you have plenty of time on your hands when you pick up this book because it brings you in from the very beginning and doesn't let you breath till the last page. It's really tough to put down. The writing is and development of the characters are top notch and the plot is wonderfully engaging. If you are looking for an intense story to really get into I suggest you check out this book."},{"Title":"The Bleeding Season","review":"\\"After all, Goodness is a state of grace. Evil, is a state of mind\\".The above is just one of the quotes from this book that I LOVED. This is my fourth Gifune novel/novella and it will not be my last.The story is set in a small coastal town in Massachusetts. Alan and his friends are mourning the loss of their friend Bernard who committed suicide by hanging. They are shocked and confused. Then they find the suicide 'note' left by Bernard. And so begins their journey into the dark.Mr. Gifune tells the story so well, I will leave the rest of the story and plot alone. I will say, the writing in this novel is so good, it's almost lyrical at times. I've readHereticsandThe Rain Dancers (Delirium Novella Series)(among other things) by this author and in my opinion Mr. Gifune writes really well, especially when it is regarding people who are damaged (and who isn't?). One of my favorite quotes addresses this:\\"We were all the same, it seemed to me, all of us dented and scratched and damaged, held together with pins and duct tape, the walking wounded making one last stand in the dark before giving in to the inevitable\\".With a cast of well developed characters and an engaging story, this one is highly recommended! I can't wait to read more by this author because he is quickly becoming a favorite in my book."},{"Title":"The Bleeding Season","review":"Certain writers have muscle. Chandler. Hammett. Count Greg F. Gifune among them. Tough guys in old movies always carried rye in hip flasks, and they never seemed able to take a sip without killing the bottle. THE BLEEDING SEASON is like that. One slug and the reader takes this wild ride straight till the end.The detective fiction reference is germane. THE BLEEDING SEASON may be a horror novel, but - like all of Gifune's fiction - it remains pervasively soulful, sporting an authentically gritty quality uncommon to the genre ...while also being scary as hell. Never for a moment anything other than realistic, this is the landscape of film noir, virtually subterranean. No light penetrates. There are few comforts. Sex can be cold and miserable. Marriage empty. Even friendship can inspire dread.It's not for the fainthearted.Even before the horror elements take hold, these characters lead sad lives. Buddies since high school, they've endured all the hard knocks life can throw at them. (A good thing really: think of it as preparation.) It doesn't take much to inspire people in a world with so little warmth. One act of kindness, a single show of loyalty. Of such frail elements are lifelong bonds forged.And sometimes such links bind beyond the grave.One of the friends dies in an accident that emotionally cripples them all. Or was it an accident? Years later, their lives are littered with abandoned dreams, failed relationships, ruined careers. Then one of them hangs himself in a basement. (Or does he?) In most novels, suicide would be the end of the story. The unseen presence of the dead has already isolated these friends, both from the world and from each other. And this latest blow seems like the worst thing that could happen. Then the note arrives.The chapter where the surviving friends gather to listen to the tape-recorded suicide note proves as harrowing as anything in contemporary dark literature. This message, apparently recorded in that dank basement, addresses each of them in turn. This is no litany of sorrows and excuses. There are no accusations here. Instead, the deceased offers a cold assessment of each man's character, a catalogue of lifelong failures. It's a gauntlet thrown down. Lies hurt. But truths can be inconceivably terrifying. It starts them asking questions. And they discover things they'd rather not know. Was their friend really a ritual killer? Did he strike a bargain with forces beyond their comprehension? Is he back? Was he never gone? Guilt by association may be more than a merely abstract concept. And madness doesn't strike like a bolt of lightning ... but creeps like fog, insidiously, inexorably. And the possibility of redemption, however remote, offers only the cruelest hope.Intelligence is an underrated quality, often in short supply within the genre. Not so with Gifune's work. Most thrillers make the mistake of slamming the reader with big cinematic scenes, but Gifune traffics in more adult fare. Deadly words twine through this mature novel like cigarette smoke, the erotic charge sometimes just as palpable. So often the antecedents of modern horror lie too obviously in the quaintly decorous supernatural romances of another time and place. This bleak vision remains quintessentially American, tough, merciless, and as original as sin."},{"Title":"The Bleeding Season","review":"Enough has been said about what The Bleeding Season is about. I want to make sure everyone reading this understands what a brilliant writer Greg F. Gifune is.This was my first intro to Gifune some months back, and since then I've bought every book by him that I can get my hands on. His writing is that good. And yes, you will finish this guy's books and wonder why his name isn't more well known than it is, which is one of the reasons I'm focusing this review on the author instead of getting into specifics about the premise of the book.Gifune writes smooth, elegant prose, that is often poetic at times. Not to say he doesn't write scary scenes, author Tom Piccirilli mentioned in a blurb that Gifune knows how to chill your blood, and I agree. But you'll find the writing so smooth that you'll want to go back and read over favorite parts-and that is when you know you're on to a writer whose every book you'll want to own and read.Other recommended books by Gifune are, Children of Chaos, Blood In Electric Blue, Saying Uncle, Dominion, Deep Night, and Night Work which all can be bought here on Amazon.There are a lot of great authors in the genre of dark fiction and horror who should be read by way more people than are reading them; Greg Gifune is one of them, and if you want to be a step ahead of everyone else when his name becomes huge, then do yourself a favor and start reading him now."},{"Title":"The Bleeding Season","review":"The book was pretty good. It's not fast paced and action packed. It really picks up around 60% or so and then I felt as though the last few chapters were a lot of rambling. I was thinking to myself just end already!

I'll say from the get go, it is very well written. He can write, and write well. But I found the story to be depressing. Sure I like some dark, brooding horror once in a while, but this was just too much. The story was good for what it was, interesting and intriguing, but when I finished it, I just felt drained. Like I had been put through the proverbial ringer. It explores the nature of evil in all of us, and it may make you think, but as I read it, especially as I neared the end, I just wanted it to be done so I could read something that might make me smile again.

The Tao te Ching was my choice. One of the oldest books of the human race, it is also perhaps the closest to perfection. To meditate on the meaning of the 81 chapters to open your mind. You make a mind shift by contemplating what the Tao is not. I can see where Zen owes a debt to this book, as it is almost one long koan designed to free the mind and transcend the ego.I've heard criticisms that the Tao te Ching was written as a manual for Emperors on how to rule and therefore has no relevance to modern man. Actually, if you live your life according to Kant's catagorical imperative (live as if your every action or decision might become universal law), then this is the perfect guide. To be one with the Tao is to be one with the Cosmos. A selfish or imbalanced act is impossible. This applies to an Emperor, a wandering holy man, a householder, or to you.Mr. Mitchelll's translation is the best that I've found. You sense that he has a true intuitive understanding of the text. There are \\"scholarly\\" translations that focus so much on detail that they totally miss the meaning.

Unfortunately not all of them are of meaningful or realistic spiritual substance. Most are far too copy cat, sugar coated, mere fantasy, and more about how to get what you want by demanding an angel to be your magic genie, rather than to help you spiritually grow and transform into a person of Love and Light. Without the Divine in your life (which is who the angels are working for in the first place) you will miss the beautiful experience of receiving Grace.

The brief interviews cover main points of the individuals' careers. McFarlane also provides chronological lists of films pertaining to his subjects.It is great to read the insights of film figures of the stature of Moira Shearer, the dazzling redhead who wowed moviegoers in &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; as well as an interview of director John Schlesinger, who was such a profound influence on British and world cinema with timely works such as &quot;Sunday, Bloody Sunday!&quot; and &quot;Billy Liar.&quot; The book also includes a foreword by Julie Christie, who notched a Best Actress Oscar starring in another of Schlesinger's timely sixties' social rebellion films, &quot;Darling,&quot; which also starred Dirk Bogarde and Laurence Harvey. Ken Annakin's interview relates how he became involved in film directing as a protege of Sir Carol Reed, and includes his perspectives on Walt Disney and Darryl F.

It was too difficult for me to understand then, now I fully understand every aspect of it, and I can say that it was a wonder in it's day.That day has now passed. While I recommend Amateur Telescope Making as a great read for those who are interested in a historical perspective, this book has been outdated since electricity has become widely available. Technologies and methods have advanced greatly since this book was published. We no longer need oil lamps to conduct foucault tests and the days of using emery for fine grinding has likewise passed. The computations referred to are accurate, although due to the limitations of printing in the 1930's. the book is not well organized.If you are looking to build a telescope, look at the following books:Standard Handbook for Telescope Making,The Dobsonian Telescope: A Practical Manual for Building Large Aperture Telescopes,Build Your Own TelescopeThat being said, I still consider Amateur Telescope Making to be an essential part of my telescope making library, but only for historical reference.Amateur TelescopeFrancis J.

Jackman began with the desire to understand the workings of medieval German government and found himself drawn into the eternal problems of medieval research: separating individuals of the same name, evaluating the reliability of sources whose authors themselves are only slightly known, and determining the intrinsic quality of data reported second- or third-hand. This extremely detailed test case begins with the progeny of Count Odo of Orl&eacute;ans and Ingeltrud of Paris in the 9th century and continues through Otto of Hammerstein, the last true Konradiner in the Hessian homeland. Those readers to whom this family means nothing will gain nevertheless by the author's tightly argued and rigorously documented work because (for example) the concept of explicit, inferential, and incidental data is as useful in 19th century England as in medieval Germany.

When a new German commander comes to occupy her small village bringing his daughter Eva Mueller with him even that small thing changes as the Major opens fire on the assembled villagers. Zoe is left alone. One year passes and the village priest asks Zoe to begin working for Eva as her maid and tells her she will be helping the Greek Resistance if she does. Thus begins the \\"relationship\\" between Zoe and Eva. There are not many details given, but it goes from hatered Zoe's part to love without the details to support it.I was so looking forward to reading this book as I've heard quite a bit about this author, but was unfortunately disappointed that this story really didn't start to go anywhere until about 80 pages in. Of course it doesn't help that it's set during WWII, one of my least favorite eras. I know that things were tough in German occupied territories, but c'mon how much tragedy can one girl suffer in such a short period? It doesn't seem realistic."},{"Title":"In the Blood of the Greeks","review":"In the Blood of the Greeks is quite a good story.

Join Eva and Zoe and get ready to enjoy the literary journey of a lifetime... It all begins in Larissa, Greece, in 1944. Meet Eva, the daughter of the German commander in charge of the occupying forces in the small Greek town, as she walks down the street to the village church, wrapped in her dark hooded cloak, her head down, her heart torn, her countenance deceivingly cold and aloof. Enter Zoe, a young Greek woman who has lost her family to the cruelty of war. Fearless, spirited and fierce, Zoe watches Eva with hatred in her eyes and a deep desire for revenge in her heart. It doesn't look promising, does it? However, not everything is as it appears... Eva and Zoe meet under extraordinary circumstances and have no choice but to learn to work together towards a common goal. Against all odds, Eva's quiet strength and Zoe's fiery personality blend together, and they help each other to battle their demons and deepest fears. Slowly, almost reluctantly at first, they start developing a friendship that will eventually turn into love, or, as Zoe says, into a 'heavy like'state.Mary D. Brooks is a phenomenal writer, with a unique narrative voice and a lot of talent. Her love and passion for her craft and her characters shine through on every page. In the Blood of the Greeks is certainly a character-driven novel. Eva and Zoe are solid, rounded, multi-layered characters, and they are as genuine and real as fiction characters can be.This novel, the first in the Intertwined Soul Series, is a wonderfully touching story, with a powerful plot and brilliant dialogue; a warm, heartfelt book that will fill your heart with a whole range of emotions. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll hold your breath, you'll sigh in contentment, you'll be surprised.... In the Blood of the Greeks is indeed a captivating book that will stay with you forever.Welcome on board, my fellow dedicated readers. Sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.

He was of the opinion that the greek philosophy does not give the sufficient categories to understand in depth the salvation mystery as made trough the living God. Therefore he tried to retell the whole drama of salvation, the drama of Gods encarnation, the drama of the relation between God and every single person, with the help of the theatral categories.This first volume of the five volume work &quot;Theodrama&quot; is an introduccion to understand and know the categories. Balthasar works trough the whole history of dramaturgia since the very beginning more than 2500 years ago and passes trough an amount of authors uptil the midst of the 20th century. As always Balthasar normally read all the written work of an author. He analieses their works in their usability to offer categories for the development of the &quot;Theodrama&quot;.It is important to be beware that for the theologican Balthasar is to find and develop an analogy from the categories of the dramatic world to get the possiblity to explain better the drama of God with the world. There are no identity between this categories and the drama of God.&quot;Theodramatic&quot; is maybe the most important contribution Balthasars to the theology and it is highly recommended to read the five volumes."},{"Title":"Value-Creating Growth: How to Lift Your Company to the Next Level of Performance (Jossey Bass Business and Management Series)","review":"Where are the fast growing companies of yesterday? In most cases, these companies are now slow growing companies. As the authors point out, the top growing companies in 1976 through 1981 remained as top growers only 15 percent of the time by 1991 through 1996.Where are all of the companies that never even get started growing rapidly? Most of these remain slow growers and may even slow further.With those challenging historical observations, Thomas L. Doorley III and John M. Donovan then looked at what elements were much more often present among high growing companies than slow growing ones.Here is where I have an important methodological quibble. To be sure that these elements were most important, many tests would be useful. For example, did the companies that were slow growers and became fast growers adopt these qualities? Did the companies that stopped having or using these qualities become slower growers to a greater degree or frequency than those who had the qualities or added to them? I can't be sure from reading the book, but my impression is that these important tests were not run. If they were and I missed it in the book, I apologize to the authors and you should consider this a five star book.The authors go on to assert that those companies that grow revenues faster show faster stock-price growth, happier employees, and presumably more satisfied customers. As you can imagine, life is a little more complicated than that. Your company may try to grow and fail. If it fails, stock-price growth and the other factors may be poor. So you have to also test a system like this experimentally. That work remains for the future, but three case histories seem to have provided promising results.Regardless of the long-term relationships in these areas, clearly many companies have forgotten or never learned how to grow. This book will be valuable for them. A major quibble I have is that I did not see a distinction being made in the book between internal growth and acquisition-aided growth. I suspect that the lessons could be quite different in the two cases.What I liked most about the book is that it takes an important subject, sustaining growth, and turns it into a system comprised of required elements for the growth to occur. Many leaders and companies lack an understanding of these system elements, and thus skip important areas. With the check lists here, those mistakes are less likely to occur. On the other hand, I found what was said here to be less clear and inspiring than in Built to Last. I still prefer that book to this one for isolating important elements of long-term growth, because it used paired comparisons of reasonably similar companies, and made finer distinctions in its key principles.The authors propose three cornerstones of growth: commitment, strategy, and capability. They propose 10 practices to establish and maintain these cornerstones:'1. Believe deeply that growth drive valuation creation.2. Articulate a growth vision; embed it . . . .3. Link growth performance to rewards and recognition.4. Create a Valuable Formula as a platform for long-term growth.5. Manage the Valuable Formula across the growth cycle.6. Globalize the Valuable Formula . . . .7. Leverage . . . innovation and alliances . . . .8. Identify and nurture all growth-supporting processes.9. Benchmark growth foundations . . . and aim to beat them.10. Design and implement initiatives to align foundations.'In the latter parts of the book, they have more detailed diagnostic questions to help you understand where your organization stands in these regards. Then, they show the benefits of rerunning the diagnostics after your organization has sought to overcome its initial limitations. This is a good idea, in my view.One caution for you is that the nature of success is always changing. In particular, the shift now seems to be towards those who can create new and improved business models quite frequently, and rapidly implement them. Secondly, the rate of growth in new markets is accelerating. You may grow rapidly, but lose out to a competitor who gains most of the value. In fact, recent studies suggest that as much as 80 percent of the value in an industry may be concentrated in only one company. So outperforming all the competitors will be more important in the future than this book suggests. Third, there are significant ways to grow share price, customer satisfaction, and employee happiness that this book does not address. So you'll want to look for research and books on these topics as these lessons are exposed.Actually, much of what is in this book focuses on our old nemesis, the communications stall. Organizations as they grow start giving people the wrong messages (directly and indirectly) about what they should be working on. Improving communications is essential to overcoming this tendency to fragment efforts into less and less useful ones.After you have finished reading this book, take a company you know well and consider which areas are most likely to undermine future growth. Then focus on how you can overcome those harfmful directions, and start taking action. As valuable as it is to learn the theory of what needs to be done, it is even more valuable to take timely action. Your progress will become more certain when you do."},{"Title":"Value-Creating Growth: How to Lift Your Company to the Next Level of Performance (Jossey Bass Business and Management Series)","review":"Doorley and Donovan provide unquestionable evidence that companies that make profitable growth a priority create substantial bottom-line value for shareholders. This is easily the clearest book I've read on the topic, and is supported by numerous real-life examples. Any prudent executive can only conclude that growth is indeed a competitive weapon. The authors denote the required tools, paths, and timing for growth under a variety of situations. Equally important, Doorley and Donovan also point out when growth can actually destroy value and how to avoid such situations. In my opinion, Value-Creating Growth is a must read and re-read for any serious manager - whether at the entrepreneurial or corporate executive level."},{"Title":"Value-Creating Growth: How to Lift Your Company to the Next Level of Performance (Jossey Bass Business and Management Series)","review":"Did you know that less than 2% of all public companies created 32 percent of all jobs.Tom Doorley and John Donovan are with Deloitte Consulting. The theme of this book is simple, but the &quot;how-to&quot; is hardly simplistic.The them is that &quot;high growth companies generate five to ten times the return of slow-growth companies. Such companies churn out new products at twice the &quot;normal&quot; rate. Employee satisfaction soars in high growth companies.High growth companies are an elite class. These companies are not merely competitive. They are thumping their competition.The authors provide a conceptual road map for achieving high growth status, based on analysis of a large sample of companies combined with case studies of key companies in North America, Western Europe, and Asia. They show how their ideas are being used in manufacturing, consumer products, financial services, and technology.This is a small but dense book.It only covers 163 pages. But there are lots of ideas here, and some are very practical.For example, the authors found that 60% of fast growth companies have clearly articulated commitments to growth in writing. On the other hand, only 15% of slow growers have such written commitment.Is your company following the practices of high growth companies?At the time of this writing, the United States is experiencing a sustained period of rapid expansion. A book that focuses on rapid growth suits these times to perfection. But what do rapid growth companies do during inevitable times of economic downturn?Doorley and Donovan have done their homework.Based on a longitudinal analysis plus their own consulting experience, the authors found that those companies that fought hardest to sustain their commitment to growth survived the recessions in best shaped. Some specific action steps included: substitution of relative growth during a period when absolute growth could not be achieved. They targeted growth at greater than market rates or faster than key competitors.During bad times, high growth companies protected their long term investments in R&amp;D, marketing, and employee development from the budget ax.Maryanne Peabody &amp; Laurence J.

In fact, while the focus is on growth companies, the model (Commitment, Strategy, Capability) is really a way to look at any business. The author provides a unique and effective way to define what a company actually does at any given time, how it evolves through time, and what it should be doing in the future.The book is short, readable, and useful. It's got a good mix of academic research and real-world examples. As with any business book, Doorley runs the risk of his examples falling from grace (like HP may already be doing). The \\"Valuable Formula\\" construct in some ways isn't new, but it does make an explicit link between what a customer needs and what a company does - seemingly simple, but many companies don't make that match very well. (If it were that easy, the Dow would be at 20,000.) Unlike many other business books, the \\"takeaways\\" and \\"Ten Essential Practices\\" aren't just motherhood and apple pie. Finally, the examples in the book are real, tangible, and transferable to other companies. The \\"Growth-Supporting Foundations\\" in particular seem like a unique way to benchmark against high-growth companies beyond comparing financials or the typical statistics in benchmark studies.In short, there's a lot in here, but it is unique and presented in a very crisp, effective way. At the risk of sounding cynical, the book is obviously a teaser to get consulting work for Deloitte. But that's what business books are all about."},{"Title":"Value-Creating Growth: How to Lift Your Company to the Next Level of Performance (Jossey Bass Business and Management Series)","review":"VALUE-CREATING GROWTH, &quot;How to lift your company to the Next Level of Performance&quot; by Doorley and Donovan of Deloitte &amp; Touche, offers sensible advice on how companies should grow, that is backed by solid well-documented research. The language throughout the book is crisp, terse and not difficult to follow, even for a business layman. Throughout the book, a brief &quot;Takeaway&quot; summarizes the theme of the chapter, and frequent graphs illustrate the examples discussed. The precepts the book espouses hinge on classic concepts, for example a &quot;Valuable Formula&quot; rather than trendy catch phrases, and are backed by specific examples. The book could become a &quot;guidebook for growth&quot; for companies who study the instructions and follow the strategies it oulines. I would be more than happy to recommend VALUE CREATING GROWTH as an example of how to write a business book to a writers' workshop at the Writing Center, Marymount Manhattan College, NYC, or to a business writing panel at MMC's annual Writer's Conference."},{"Title":"Value-Creating Growth: How to Lift Your Company to the Next Level of Performance (Jossey Bass Business and Management Series)","review":"As a Director of TMP Worldwide (Nasdaq TMPW)I have observed a remarkable correlation between the lessons in Value Creating Growth and the performance of our Company.

Whether that is beautiful or not, depends on the reader.

On the one hand, the book's quality is astonishing. The pages are beautiful and crisp; the quality of the black-and-white photo-transfer is beyond words.Yet the images are exceedingly uninspired and become, after a while, quite repetitive. In my opinion, the cover photograph is the best; kudos to the publishers for placing it on the dust-jacket.The men captured by Vance in these photos are indeed beautiful; almost all are fully- or semi-naked: the poses (as well as facial expressions), however, do not tend to range, and soon become tedious to look at.Nothing special or overwhelming in terms of Vance's artistic vision (some of the images are actually rather kitschy); but a nice coffee-table book nonetheless."},{"Title":"Timeless","review":"I have always been a huge fan of Mr. Vance, so I have waited for this new book anxiously...I am not disappointed...It is genius from cover to cover...the photographer captures these stunning men like no other...The earlier reviewer,was mistaken, I think, in his middling review...to call any of these images kitsch, is either misguided or just plain cruel...Mr. Vance is a master.

The Kouros of Greek origin were statues of young athletes usually placed in courtyards or public spaces to either celebrate the glory of the male physique of prominent athletes, or to engender fertility!At first glance the poses in which Vance captures his models may seem theatrical to the extreme, but given the concept of the volume - that the male physique at its peak form has been a model of excellence since time began - the poses soon capture the imagination and the possible sculptural ideas begin to leap of the page.These models are beautifully muscled and developed athletes whose forms in the natural state before the camera vie for the best in the sculptures of the great artists of the past and present. Erotic, yes. Pushed to the extremes of definition, yes. Prettified at times, yes. But it all works. Vance has a keen eye for the juxtaposition of hard flesh with soft drape and soft light and his photographs are for the most part timeless in nature. A fine exhibition, this, and one that deserves attention as much as his famous celebrity photography ventures.

Much less common is a book of nude males. David Vance is a portrait photographer of reknown and in this book he presents what might be considered a study of the male form.These are not photographs of ordinary average men, but of athletes at the peak of their form. Here are pictures that remind you of Michelangelo's David. Here is the perfect physique, molded to perfection and photographed in black and white. Careful posing, supurb lighting combined with very high quality printing (in Italy) on high grade paper creates a tone rarely found in publications.This is a supurb art book. It is far above the common erotic photographs in every way you can imagine. This is not to say that the photographs aren't erotic, they are, as is any nude picture.Seeing these pictures of perfect men, I am reminded of the complaints women have made about the pictures of nude women not being realistic. These men have bodies to which almost all of us can only aspire."},{"Title":"Timeless","review":"The male nude, as interpreted by the photographs of David Vance, is the single topic of this beautifully produced book of technically perfect photographs of incredible young men. David Vance approaches the nude male form in several ways. There are photographs that are very balanced, with a focus on the geometry of the male body. These reminded me of some of the work of Robert Mapplethorpe. These images are sculptural and emphasize the symmetry of the male body. Another theme that Vance follows is that of the athletic male body in motion. Many of the models appear to be gymnasts or dancers and their grace and movement is often captured in the photographs. The use of candid, relaxed, un-self conscious photography is not really present here and is not Vance's intention. In every photograph the beautiful young man knew he was being photographed, knew exactly when the photograph was taken, and had some conscious notion of how he was projecting toward the camera. Vance's photographic philosophy may be contrasted to that of Bruce Weber and Duane Michaels. The informal candid photograph of the model is a strength of Bruce Weber's photography for he often shoots his models when they are unaware which gives a different sense to the intention of the photograph. Weber may photograph a model dressing or undressing before the photo session actually starts. In Vance's photographic world, the models don't seem to have a past or future or private life but rather are captured in the photo session like a rare beautiful insect or flower. Duane Michaels is another photographer of the male nude with whom Vance may be compared. Michaels uses a narrative format so that the photograph tells a story and the photographs together weave a pictorial narrative. Vance does not approach the male nude with the informality of Weber or the narrative style of Michaels. He seems to focus on the structure of the male, the way in which the parts come together to form a solid almost architectural whole, to make maximum use of texture and contrasting light and dark, to convey the physicality of the male body. This sensibility relates very much to aesthetic sensibility of Greek antiquity where the beautiful young male is a frequent subject of artistic expression. The photography here is flawless and technically superb; the men are some of the most handsome men photographed nude that I have ever seen. The control and eye of the photographer are present in every photograph and none of the photographs seem to be spontaneous or accidental."},{"Title":"Timeless","review":"This book is simply amazing. These photographs by David Vance elevate the male nude to an art form far beyond the stable of male erotic photographers out there. I felt as though I was looking at paintings with each photo beautifully kissed with light and texture. The book has an acceptional printing quality to enhance the viewing.

I never realized how brutal the fighting between settlers and the natives were in this area. It seems to be much worse than with many tribes to the west which is seen in movies. It's the same story repeated throughout the ages of colonization by might. A treaty was just for buying time for the colonist."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"To me this history of before and after the 1620 stop at Plymouth including \\"King Philip's War\\" was well worth the read. As with most histories, it could be at times slow going but also was sometimes spellbindingly written, verging on a good novel. However, that is only to say that most of the time a purely academic book of this length comes off as prosaic and pedantic in exponential extremes. This work was highly readable, enlivened by personal characteristics and backgrounds of the main players. Philbrick did an excellent job of pulling together many sources and keeping a focus."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Like so many of the myths created to tell the story of the creation of our country, the tale of The Pilgrims and the first Thanksgiving has been scrubbed and polished so many times over the years that when the more literal truth is told, the effect is shocking.I will not question nor debate the author's scholarship. Nathaniel Philbrick's historiography may not measure up to the expectations of some, but he has obviously done sufficient research to draw conclusions and the story he tells is a convincing one.Just as George Washington probably did tell a lie or two over his lifetime and Abe Lincoln probably did not compose the Gettysburg Address on the back of an envelope on the train to the ceremonies, The Pilgrims and those who followed, did not blend harmoniously with the existing population. The friction with native Americans that most of us associate more closely with the opening of the western frontier, most certainly began the minute the Mayflower dropped anchor.It's hard to separate the good guys from the bad guys in this story. At any one time, each and every character appears to be capable of the most appalling acts of cruelty and violence.My perception has always been that European mores by the close of the 17th century, were much closer to those of today than to those of the Dark Ages. In traditional history, any wanton acts of savagery have always been assigned to the \\"savages\\" rather than the colonists.If Philbrick's more vivid descriptions are to be believed then beheadings, drawing & quarterings and other medieval methods, along with condemning captives to the misery of slavery were commonplace practices of the English settlers, making you question who the real \\"savages\\" were.It is apparent that all involved on both sides were savages when the occasion demanded it. All in all, the narrative provided by Philbrick tells an entralling saga of desperate people in desperate times ... unfortunately doing what desperate people often do.The picture provided by this book is not pretty, but sadly, neither is so much of the history of the human race."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"As a teacher of History here in Massachusetts I naturally gravitated toward this book. Yet, I must insist that it far exceeded my expectations. Philbrick's research has been so extensive that he has brought the players back to life. Moreover, his writing style carries one through the text as though it may be a 'beach novel.' (That observation is for those who may consider historical reads 'boring'). Mayflower is by no means a bore. Any reader that has ever been curious about our nation's early development, why we became who we are, or, if one simply loves Thanksgiving as a holiday must read this book. Perfectly researched, perfectly written, and a perfect satisfaction to all our colonial curiousities."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I've read one other book by Nathaniel Philbrick, SEA OF GLORY.When I started reading MAYFLOWER, I only remembered that other book by chance. It was good, but not extraordinary. MAYFLOWER, however, is an extraordinary feat of story-telling. When Philbrick got to the part about the Indian Wars, he so fully succeeded in engaging my imagination that I stayed up late into the night, reading. The next day, I couldn't wait to get home so that I could read more. Philbrick is an excellent writer, but more than that, it's the way he is able to slip so deftly in and out of various characters' point of view (a novelistic skill, but in Philbrick's case it is twice as amazing because he is writing non-fiction): Benjamin Church; \\"King\\" Philip, leader of the Pokanokets; captives (both English and Indian).There were so many things that fascinated me: the fact that women led tribes; the fact that the Indians moved across the landscape with such speed and organization, so that entire villages were capable of vanishing in one night; the fact that the Indians towered over the English settlers (for the most part, the English had been cobblers or tailors and were not exactly the best physical specimens); the fact that, in the years just before the arrival of the Mayflower, many Indian communities had been ravaged by smallpox, with the resulting reduction in the number of warriors, so that when the Pilgrims arrived they found the coasts empty (Great timing, Pilgrims!).Philbrick writes with the voice and imagination of a true insider. When I read in the author's bio that he resides in Nantucket, I understood why the book was so powerful: the book is about his home, about where he lives.The only complaint I have about the book is that the captions to the accompanying illustrations give away the outcome of the battles before the narrative has reached that point. For example, they show a picture of Treaty Rock, before the text has made clear that a tribe did in fact agree to switch allegiances and ally with the English settlers. My advice to future readers of this book: Don't read any of the captions until you've finished the book!"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Nathaniel Philbrick is one of the best historical authors that Ihave read. He is a top notch researcher, one of best when it comesto describing historical events. The ideas he writes are clear andlogical. The reason I chose MAYFLOWER to read was because Ienjoyed reading Philbrick's last book published this year, THELAST STAND, the history of Custer and the Little Big Horn, the bookthat must stand on the top of the long list of books on this subject. I am now reading a third book by Philbrick.MAYFLOWER is the complex history of the Pilgrims and otherswho left Holland for the New World and the fifty years that wouldfollow in New England, including that of the numerous Indian tribesin the area. This history makes the schoolboy history of Plymouthhistory look like junk!"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Like many Americans, I think, my knowledge of the early history of this country tends to jump from the Pilgrims landing on Plymouth Rock---which is, in itself, a joke!---to the American Revolution, but as Philbrick observes in his book _Mayflower_, there are about 150 years in between those two historic events, when people were living, working, struggling to survive, and dying. I was appalled to realize that first the Pilgrims, and later the Puritans with them, set out to establish colonies in the new world where they could live and worship as they pleased, free of restraint from or oppression by the king or anyone else, only to develop the same degree (or worse!) of religious and social intolerance that they supposedly fled Europe to get away from.... to the point where, after finally conquering the local Indians, they then sold said Indians into slavery!! Another illustration of history repeating itself over and over and over again. My only complaint about the book is the reader, George Guidall: I like the sound of his voice and he reads the book very well, BUT I shuddered everytime he pronounced the word \\"8th,\\" as in July 8th, 1669, because he says \\"ay-th\\" with no T sound after the 8, which to me is as annoying as the sound of fingernails being drawn across a chalkboard."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Readers seem to be missing a couple of things Philbrik discusses.---The Pilgrims of Plymouth were a sect of the larger Puritan community. Their intra-comunity relationships were not unlike those between current fundamentalist religious groups. It's difficult to be very accomodating to other groups when you alone have the one true faith. The duplicity between the various colonies was about a great as that between the various tribes.---The Indian concept of war was different from the European. Remember how the Narragansets were appalled when the Puritans killed every man, woman and child (and burned their homes and food stores)in the Pequot war? To the Indian, it was more honorable to trick your opponent and gain his possesions than it would be to simply kill him. There was revenge but it was an eye for an eye. You don't massacre a man's entire family because he killed your son.I would have valued a map of the region to better understand the relationships of distance and location. The writer references events as happening near present day whatever. That only makes sense if you know the geography of SE Massachusetts. The book is an important addition to American history. It would make a good four part documentary on PBS."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"The Mayflower, as one reviewer has described, is two stories in one book. The first story is about the Mayflower and the settlement of Plymouth Rock. The second stroy is about King Philips' War. These are not intended as two stories and they do in some ways blend into a cohesive whole. The book leaves you with a great awareness that the birthing of the USA was long hard labor and that life is so fragile at that stage. The story begins with the struggle for freedom to worship as one sees fit; then turns to the story of survival against the elements and natives of a strange land; then to a struggle with old allies and friends in what is a blow by blow account of King Philips' War that leaves one questioning how we have not seen one another as fully human all along? This seems to be one of, if not the pressing question of history. There is great sadness in this history, but also something else is here that points us toward a destiny to become fully and completely what God is calling us to be and that is fully and completely human in how we treat one another. Come and join the adventure. This book is worth the read or listen."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"In this well researched, superbly well written book, Nathaniel Philbrick who wrote the brilliant In The Heart Of The Sea, tells us about the Pilgrims, where they came from, why they came here, how they landed at Plymouth in December 1620, how they managed to survive etc; and then he goes on to tell in more historical detail than I needed about King Philip's War (1675-6) when the ground of New England ran red with the blood of colonists and Indians. But there was more to this story than history for me because it is a case study in habitat change and culture clash, so when I get through with the history part we'll talk about that.First, about the story itself. You know it: The Pilgrims were a dedicated group of religious believers who broke away from the Church of England (too lax) and , called Separatists, emigrated to Holland where they had lived for a year or so in Leiden before 102 of them (the original Pilgrims) left the port of Delfshaven in two ships - Speedwell and Mayflower - for America. But it didn't work at first. Speedwell was too small and rotten. Mayflower, 100 feet long, was a typical merchant vessel of the time and seems to me to have been a pretty good sailer, everything considered. They were forced to leave Speedwell in Plymouth and on September 6, 1620 Mayflower sailed from Plymouth with 102 men, women and children crowded into her \`tween deck - five fee high and maybe 100 feet long. Sixty-five days later after a stormy voyage but with all of her exhausted passengers still alive they sighted the coast of Cape Cod. But before any man put a foot ashore he signed the Mayflower Compact whereby they were bound \\"together into a civil body politic, for our better ordering and preservation\\" and agreed to \\"enact...such just and equal laws...from time to time...as shall be thought most meet and convenient for the general good of the colony, unto which (we) promise all due submission and obedience.\\"They had sailed for the mouth of the Hudson. But fate, storm and wind had taken them 300 miles north to a sandy spit which promised no refuge from wind or storm nor soil for sustenance, so after exploring for several weeks they settled on Plymouth harbor and came ashore to stay in the second week of December. They were starving, cold, complete strangers on an inhospitable and unknown shore in the dead of winter three thousand miles from home, completely on their own and 500 miles from the nearest English settlement. Yet nothing affected or diluted the faith they had that God would seem them safely through.No, they were not simpletons nor impractical zealots. They had a military leader (Miles Standish), guns, food and seed and they were not afraid to use any of them. They were there to establish a colony and stay the course, but it almost didn't work. They lost 50 out of 102 people to starvation and disease before spring; and had it not been for Massssoit, the leader of the local Indian tribe (Pokanoke) the colony might not have survived; but he gave them the support needed to see them through that first year; and when they really had a feast with the Indians that November (1621) it was truly a Thanksgiving, although it was not until the 1860s or so that it was so regarded and when our Thanksgiving legend began.(An aside: They not the first to explore the coast. Cod fishermen from Spain, Portugal and France had been off the coast for years and some had come ashore for brief periods - bringing with them the diseases (measles, typhus etc.) which had decimated the Indians to the point where large portions of the coast were unpopulated. Then there were the earlier explorers, too. These people were not a good advance party for the Pilgrims!)Next, about the rest of it: The rest, as they say, is history. The next year others joined them. Then Englishmen settled in what is now Boston, an area which had a much better and more natural harbor than Plymouth. In ten years the area contained maybe ten thousand settlers, my great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather William Phelps being one of them. Twenty one thousand people came shore between 1632 and 1642; and by the time of King Phillips War (1675) all of New England could be termed \\"settled\\" in the sense that settlers were within walking distance of each other along he navigable rivers and their tributary valleys throughout most of the area.The expansion came at a cost, at an environmental and human cost. The Indians were pushed out of their hunting grounds and out of their ancestral homelands, subjugated by treaty and force and disease. The forests were felled. One village of 200 homes used 75 acres of woodland per year for fuel. Beaches and tidelands were denuded of shellfish. The beaver were trapped out, game destroyed willy-nilly. This was a textbook example of environmental change, but Philbrick doesn't really hit on it.Then came war. Philip, the grandson of Massassoit, went to war and in one year there were terrible casualties through the colony. The colonies lost 8 percent of the adult male population killed. (In WWII it was 1 percent, in the Civil War it was between 4 and 5 percent.) But the Indians suffered more. Nobody knows the numbers but war and its consequent atrocities of pillage, burning, forced marches and massacres killed thousands upon thousands of men, women and children. It was a war to the death. Settlers vs. the Indians; and the settlers won - big time!Philbrick has done a good job. I got tired or reading about the war against the various tribes, how the tribes collaborated or didn't etc. etc. and, frankly, King Philip's War bored me a bit. But it was on the whole a great book.February 2008"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Philbrick has written, in my estimation, the best and most readable account of the origins and early days of Plymouth Plantation and the settlers that came over on the Mayflower. There is lots of great material here- I never realized that so many Native Americans had already died of European diseases prior to 1621 or that French and Englismen had already come ashore (and in the case of the French built a fort on Cape Cod). This tidbits and the general description of the early days of the colony are definetly the strong points of this book.After about 100 pages or so the book changes gear and deals with King Philips War. This war was an important and bloody chapter of New Endland's history and Philbrick aptly shows how wars based on dubious causes quickly denigrates into something unpredicatable and downright horrible. This section is however no where near as readable as the material that precedes it.Bottom line: wait for the paperback"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"A bit miss leading. The Mayflower the ship is done with and the voyage over within the first CD (I listened to the audio disc). Then it is on to some interesting reports about the set up of Plymouth. However by then end of the book it breaks down to various wars just this Indian tribe vs. this Indian tribe. The result gets well really boring and a bit confusing. There is good history here just not compiling reading like his past book."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Mr Philbrick's 'In The Heart Of The Sea' was a gem. 'Mayflower' is a diamond in the rough that never quite achieves the same luster. It is certainly interesting and can hold your interest but somehow it is flat. If you have an interest in the subject, or in correcting falsehoods in our glorified history then you will enjoy this book. If you were a fan of 'In The Heart Of The Sea' and are looking for the next Philbrick book to captivate you like that, then you may be disappointed. Read it, enjoy it, just dont expect to be blown out of the water."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This book has a lot of info but its all thrown together with no real main characters or storyline. Although the book is called Mayflower and starts off with the Pilgrims in England and then Holland, ready to journey to America it disappointedly does not include any info on the Mayflower voyage, other than to say it took a couple months and that it was difficult. I would love to have learned about the life of one Pilgrim in particular, but instead the author includes every Pilgrim imaginable, and every Native American, with none of them receiving true insights into their personality and lives. I've read other books about this time period so I wasn't so surprised about the true nature of the Natives and the Pilgrims' relationship. A long span of time was covered, with many, many fights between the two and many names of different tribes and chiefs (sachems) but it became meaningless to me as there was no detail or personality to most of the names mentioned. I recommend Love and Hate in Jamestown instead."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"And then I read this book. A wonderful, thorough history of the Mayflower, Plymouth Colony, it's inhabitants, and the Native Americans. I plowed through it in record time. A definite must-read if you want to know what really happened."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I read this book awhle back and found it to be an eye-opener. I am a descendant of John Howland through his daughter Desire. I was especially saddened how quickly one generation later the natives exterminated. I bet their fathers were rolling over in their graves to see their hard work to establish peace with the natives went to naught.I used this book as a reference for genealogy. I will definitely buy more of his books."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This is the first of Philbrick's books that I have read, and I must say that I enjoyed it tremendously. Philbrick has given us much more than the title implies - rather than just the story of the initial voyage of the Pilgrims from the Netherlands to the New World, he gives us the story of the Pilgrims, the Puritans, and the Native Americans - covering a 50+ year span.Philbrick starts with the Mayflower and the doomed Speedwell (the second ship that the Pilgrims intended to sail to the New World), and, in eminently readable prose, gives us details on the first winter the Pilgrims spent in the newly created Plimouth Plantation. If the book had covered just the voyage and the first year, it certainly would have lived up to expectations and the title of work; instead, Philbrick goes much further and gives us the stories of the Puritans, who colonized in Masachussets Bay, and the Native Americans, who really owned the land that these English settlers encroached upon.Philbrick continues his tale through the end of King Philip's War (1674-1675), where the descendants of the original voyagers on board the Mayflower claimed New England as theirs and started the process of relegating the Native Americans to specific areas (the process that we would later call \\"resettling the Indians onto reservations\\").At the tail end of the story of King Philip's War, Philbrick brings the original Mayflower passengers and their descendants back into the fold. Unfortunately, he strays a little too much from the original settlement when providing us with the story of the war, which is why I give the book just four stars instead of five. I truly expected the book to focus exclusively on the voyage and the people that were passengers on that maiden voyage, along with new arrivals into the Plymouth Colony rather than the direction that Philbrick chose to take.Regardless of the fact that he seemed to stray from the original topic somewhat, I really enjoyed the book and would heartily recommend it to anyone that is interested in early North American History."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Mayflower is written in an easy-to-understand style. The story of the Atlantic crossing was great. The first encounter politics was fascinating. As the author extended the first encounter through the generations the story lost its compelling nature.Though the storytelling of the \\"later generations\\" did not grab me, the information was good. Being a West Coast guy, I never knew this story. But I couldn't figure out why the story was extended to the point it was or why it didn't go farther.The author displays a fabulous narrative style for parts of the first generation. If nothing else, the narrative from the beginning up to the first \\"Thanksgiving\\" was very satisfying."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Mayflower by Nathaniel Philbrick is the story of the Pilgrims of the Mayflower and their descendants and their relations with the Native Americans up through King Philip's War. Philbrick's research is excellent, and he does a terrific job of not assigning blame to either the Pilgrims or the Native Americans entirely. He does his best to destroy some myths that have developed about both sides (Thanksgiving was more like a party than has recently been made out), and describes the main players as real people. Squanto comes across as a manipulative, underhanded man; Miles Standish as brutish and overbearing. Both seem accurate, and that is Philbrick's point. All of these were real people with flaws, not just cardboard stereotypes to be pulled out of the history books once a year. The astonishing obstacles that the Pilgrims had to overcome to live in this new world for which they were completely unprepared gave me new respect for them. And the destruction that the Native Americans faced because of sickness and greed on the part of the Pilgrims moved me as well. Both groups were a strong people who destroyed each other because of misunderstandings and greed. The only real hero who emerges from Mayflower is Benjamin Church, a man who tried to get each side to see the other, but ultimately even he failed in his attempts. This is a history book that should be read in every high school classroom to give a better understanding of our country's foundation: the good and the bad."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I loved this book because it gives a glimpse into the past but let no one be deceived for as Napoleon was said to have said, 'History is but a story of agreed upon myths\\". Nate does a good job of researching random data about the history surrounding the Mayflower Pilgrims and he documents it well and he weaves a good yarn infused with real detail. My problem is with his slant. He buys into the typical ivy league dogma that perpetuates the myth of the noble savage. The Indians were beautiful nature loving peoples. If they would have had cars back then, these Indians would have had \\"Coexist\\" bumper stickers on their Prius's.I take the larger view myself. These Indians were co-equal with all other human beings. They killed, tortured, and warred with other indians and yes they committed atrocities like all other humans who have gone to war to advance their well being. The white Europeans who decimated them did this to each other back in Europe. The only difference here is that the white Europeans who annihilated them where better at annihilation. Ivy league scholars like to refer to this as evolution but although they embrace evolution as theory they don't like it when they see it. I prefer to call it as I see it, sin, or put in more palatable terms 'missing the mark'.It would have been nice if these Pilgrims would have made nice but that is so hard for humans to do, including Indians.America has been blessed because of the ideology it was founded on but along the way we did hurt a lot of peoples as we are wont to do even within our own clans/families. This will continue but thankfully there will be an end and the answer is you know where.......but I can't say it or you would explode with indignation."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I'm still reading this book, but I'm finding it hard to put down.

Weather dictated their anchorage.

It brings the reader from their struggle getting to Plymouth up until the early 18th century. However, the book lacks information on the day to day lives of the Pilgrims. Another issue is the fact that there are so many Native American Tribes that the reader gets confused as to who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. Also, the book tend to lacks some feeling. But overall it's a pretty good read"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"An unbelievable amount of research and a ton of talent have made Philbrick's book an eye-opening account of the real story of the bloody and brutal founding of New England. It's not the story we were taught in school. One feels great sympathy and sadness for the Indians as the Puritans self-righteously displace them. The book is a giant accomplishment."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I enjoyed reading Nat Philbrick's Mayflower. It brought the \\"Pilgrim Fathers\\" (and Mothers) to life. The hardships were incredible for those folks right from the moment that they embarked on the Mayflower - it is amazing that any survived. What gave them an edge was there high sense of community and responsiblity to each other. The sons and grandsons of the Pilgrims seem to forget that fact and as well as treating the Natives as real neighbors. One wonders what would happened if 90% of the Native population didn't die from disease prior to the Pilgrims landing - would they have assimulated or perished? Miles Standish doesn't fair to well in this book - he comes across as the original American militarist with the same level of subtlety that we find in DC today. Ben Church comes out as the hero of the King Phillips War. Ben had the good judgement to see the Natives as people and allies and the tactical planning skills to cause the English to succeed. There are lessons in the Mayflower story that are applicable today - the understanding of alien cultures and the ability coexist - and Philbrick does his best to bring them to the surface."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"As I read this book, I became startled when I noticed the key Pilgrims started dying off around page 150 or so. Brewster, Bradford, Standish... all wiped out to make room for King Phillip... who is really the star of this story. The title of this book gets little coverage compared to the war that came fifty years or so later. It's a great history, and the author knows his stuff, but the book only briefly covers the subject that I at least hoped to read about. I'm also annoyed at the constant comparisons the author makes to claim it was one of the deadliest wars in American history based on the percentage of casualties. If he's so concerned with bringing that event into view, he should have started with naming the book with a more appropriate title."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Many people who pick up a copy of \\"Mayflower\\" may have been influenced by Nathaniel Philbrick early book \\"In the Heart of the Sea\\", a wildly enjoyable tale of New England fisherman lost in the Pacific. The tale was simple, intriguing and well written. In fact it won the National Book Award. It won because \\"...Heart...\\" was one of those rare history books that's written for readers not historians. Philbrick wanted to tell a story not show off how much research he did, which was quite a lot by the way. The result was a page turner as slick as Stephen King. However, with \\"Mayflower\\" Philbrick gets caught in a bog of massive facts and the resulting book knows neither if it is a true life thriller or a historical thesis.The problems start with the title, \\"Mayflower\\". Half the book has nothing to do with the Mayflower, the famous ship which brought our Pilgrim forefathers to these shores from Europe. The beginning of the book does go into great detail of their trip and does a nice job of letting the air out of the myth that has built up around these early settlers. You may not have know that the Pilgrims were actually residences of Holland before they're famous voyage or that two ships were originally commissioned for that historic trip (the second one may have even been sabotaged by the Dutch). The first part of this book reads not unlike that first crossing, relatively well but choppy. There were lots of families on the boat and it often feels like we're getting to know them all. It doesn't get any easier when they land and start getting acquainted with the many tribes scattered along what will soon become New England. The first Thanksgiving comes and goes and a surprising revelation about the famous Squanto turns him into the infamous Squanto. Before we know what happens, the book shift and soon turns into a historical look at King Phillips War, one of the first major settler/Indian conflicts on the new shores. We are now examining the motives of the children and grandchildren of that first Thanksgiving. Philbrick is trying to show how cooperation, peace, and trust can turn about face in the course of a generation. He needs you to understand that first Thanksgiving so that you can see just how devastating the King Philip War was. Of course he is right, a good historian might have gone even further and discussed the Pequot War of 1637 in greater detail or to explain the role of the French more. That's the problem with history, it just keeps going and everything in the end is connected, but a good writer looking to tell a story might have simplified. He or she might have stopped with the first half of the book after Squanto's fall. Or they might have written about the second half of the book solely from the view point of Captain Benjamin Church, who Philbrick relies on heavily himself. In other words focus on either the first Pilgrims or the first major war, to do both seems too much.The book never manages to find an identity. Is it a history book? Is seems to light on conclusions for that. The facts are there but they mean little in the long run. Philbrick needs a better theory than \\"generations take for granted what there parents and grandparents worked for\\". If that's his claim than my cranky Grandmother beat him to it years ago. Is it a historic narrative? Probably more so, but it's trying to accomplish too much in too few pages. The book should prove invaluable to any high school student studying early colonial times, but for serious scholars it's little more than a synopsis of \\"History of Plymouth Plantation\\" and Benjamin Church's memoir, granted two hard books to get a hold of. However, for the average reader with a leaning towards history, read \\"Longitude\\" by Dava Sobel.History Book: 4 starsEntertaining Book: 2 starsAverage: 3 stars."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This book really gives an in depth review of the sense of what the Mayflower and Pilgrim invasion of Maerica was all about: land to establish a religious theocracy. The is the violent pole of our history of genocide and \\"manifest destiny. This is where the right wing of American History gets its impetus. The other wing is more humane: the benign treatment and early alliance with some of the American Indian tribes. This represents the Liberal wing of American history which expresses itsself in seeking the welfare and community of all. Both impetus have been with America since these early days. The darkness of genocide, war and slavery versus the light of peaceful trade and cultural interchange.The most touching scene for me was the story of the Mayflower colonist scraping the tongue of the Indian leader, hand feeding him and saving his life. This is what America could have been, but the end result of the King Philip War was violence, slavery and the prominence of the worst of Puritan dictatorship. The legacy of Cromwell triumphed."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This novel was very well written and interesting. There was a lot of new information that I did not know about the Pilgrim/American Indian relations. From this book, you can see how hard life was in the colonies in the beginning as well as how basic survival needs will make men do what they have to, even if there actions are contrary to their religious beliefs. I picked up the novel because I am interested in the subject matter. While putting together the family tree, I found ancestors that came over (not on the Mayflower) but on a similiar vessel a few years after the Mayflower landed. My ancestors helped to establish Connecticut and so this book painted a view of what the colonists went through as well as how the American Indians reacted to the colonists."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I knew what Pilgrims were - they guys in the funny outfits with big buckles.

Chilling and magnificent."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"a different historical novel, well researched and presented with clarity.i have given it to my friends to read"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Like every good schoolboy in the 20th century, I learned the inspiring story of our Pilgrim ancestors who ventured across dangerous seas to win religious freedom and independence in the New World. I can even remember dressing up as Miles Standish in kindergarten just before Thanksgiving, complete with a funny paper hat and big cardboard buckles on my shoes: \\"Oh, kind Squanto, thank you for giving us corn. Have some squash...\\"Now that I've read Nathaniel Philbrick's shocking and well-researched history of the Plymouth colony, I wonder if my kindergarten teacher is spinning in her grave. Please note: Philbrick isn't a left-wing iconoclast who's trying to discredit everything American. And he certainly isn't a pseudo-Calvinist hero worshipper trying to resurrect our \\"glorious founding fathers.\\"Instead, the author provides a comprehensive, blow-by-blow narrative of the first two generations of Plymouth Pilgrims in the context of their era. He expertly chronicles their idealism and tremendous courage without shying away from the greed, violence and in-fighting that marred the colony's first 60 years of existence.Along the way, we learn that the Pilgrims' relationship with local Indian tribes was far more complex -- and far more bloody -- than anything we learned in grade school. For example, the Pilgrims cheerfully displayed the severed heads of Indian enemies on the outer walls their settlement, often for years at a time. Torture, murder, theft, kidnapping and underhanded land grabs were relatively common acts. After years of increasing tension between settlers and Indians, the region erupted in a deadly war with horrific brutality on both sides.Philbrick is careful to point out that life in the 17th century was nasty and hard even back in Mother England. (Think Oliver Cromwell or the Tower of London.) He also demonstrates that Native American culture in the region was highly competitive, with nearly constant power struggles between tribal leaders. Squanto himself was something of a Machiavellian schemer.The only real shortcoming of \\"Mayflower\\" is Philbrick's cursory handling of religious matters. He doesn't really explain the core of Pilgrim beliefs and how they influenced their actions. That being said, this is one terrific popular history that is well worth the cover price. Read it before your next piece of pumpkin pie!"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Philbrick seems to have had a point of view and a conclusion before he began the book. This is the only explanation I have for him selecting an unreliable biography of Richard Church, one of the Eurpean characters and a would-be military leader and counter-hero to William Bradford to fill out his themes in 'Mayflower.'.Philbrick is out to find a core to the myths surrounding the early Puritan settlers and he is out to show, or at least hint, how the early settlers [with these two men as their thematic representatives] offer a forecast to an evolving national sense that eventually became America, even America as we experience it today.So we have an author using history, some of it quite unreliable, to show where we all have come from.History cannot be written that way; the variables of any one 20-40 year period are too many to serve a few ideological interests. Despite the fact the the level of writing is quite good, the logic and methodogy smacks of a 'C' student searching from revelance in the absense of facts.Somehow the core of what we are as a country was settled at Plymouth Rock and King Philip's War. Somehow the millions of immigrants who later came from Britian, Continental Europe, South America, the Middle East and Asia with their own religious and political constructs don't figure in defining what we are as a country.Seems altogether too facile to me.Frank O'Brien"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"There are two fundemental problems with this book. The first sticking point - deserving one of my rated stars - is that a book titled, \\"Mayflower\\" should be just about that. However historically accurate the author needs to be (105 pages of acknowledgements, notes, and bibliographies,) this reader needed to imagine, feel, smell, and experience the events leading up to and including the arrival of our ancestors upon that poor excuse for a rock in Plymouth Harbor. I was not looking for an affirmation of what I already knew, I had the family tree to do that for me. I was looking for the Pilgrim's expectations, motivations, and overall humanity - or lack thereof throughout their great experiment. I was looking for \\"Mayflower, a Story of Courage and Community\\" and it had to be contained in more pages than the 105 pages mentioned previously. The second sticking point - deserving the second star - was the two-thirds of the book that was not Mayflower at all, but \\"After the Mayflower, the War Years\\". It seems to me that Mr. Philbrick may have had too few new thoughts about the ship and its occupants and too many new thoughts about a war several years after the fact. Somehow, Mr. Philbrick thought that he could cram all of his knowledge about two subjects into one superb book. Pity the fact that the more he crammed, the less suberb the book became. 2006 must have been a lean year for books at The New York Times. How else could this be among the 10 best?"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"We love our national myths, don't we? Is there an American today whose elementary school experience failed to include the idyllic picture of black-and-white-robed Pilgrims, peaked black hats primly perched on the men's heads, sitting at a long table carefully covered with a white linen tablecloth, brimming with the Thanksgiving feast, and with a few loin-clothed Indians in the background to give the whole scene the proper local color? National unity apparently requires that the people of a country share certain common beliefs and memories, and \\"the first Thanksgiving\\" is certainly one of ours. There are undoubtedly sound psychological principles to explain these national myths, which include landing at Plymouth Rock and George Washington's never telling a lie, chopping down a cherry tree, and tossing a coin across the Delaware River, as well as Benjamin Franklin's famous kite-flying experiment. Holding these near-sacred scenes in our collective minds certainly does no harm-so long as we recognize them as myth and are astute enough to understand as well the real history of such purported events.Philbrick's book MAYFLOWER gives us a crystal clear look at the real history and the actual events surrounding the arrival of the Pilgrims, and somewhat later the Puritans, Protestant extremists as they were, in the New World. It was an arrival marked by death, depression, suicide, and murder. The idea of a new colony founded and governed solely upon religious principles died even before the first Pilgrim waded ashore through icy water to a mud flat (Plymouth Rock not being in the vicinity); in addition to the Separatists, i.e., Pilgrims separated from the Church of England, the Mayflower carried quite a few others, the Strangers, who were not of the same persuasion and whose presence demanded a civil, not a religious, compact if any sort of governmental control and order were to be maintained. Even the act of marriage, frequently described as \\"holy\\" matrimony, was to be from the very beginning a civil affair in America. After all, the Bible makes no mention of clergy performing marriages, and the Pilgrim interpretation remains today in the licensing of marriages by the state, not by the church.During their first Christmas in America, what were the Pilgrims doing to observe the \\"birth of the Christ\\"? Since the day did not fall on the Sabbath, the Pilgrims were about their normal labors, for, again, the Bible makes no reference to Christmas so the Pilgrims did not observe it, although the Anglicans among them insisted on having the day off for revelry, which the Separatist governor abruptly curtailed. Praying was okay but forget the revelry.Such facts as these come forth with fascinating detail in Philbrick's writing, but more revealing yet are the Pilgrims' rocky relationships with the Native Americans of New England, several of whom already spoke some English through previous encounters with fishermen and explorers. While we may have been brought up by elementary school teachers who taught (and probably believed) that the Pilgrims were God-fearing Christians, somehow we missed the facts that, on occasion, our forefathers saw fit to launch unprovoked, \\"preemptive\\" strikes against the Indians, did not hesitate to slit the throats of Indian leaders while they sat at table enticed by food offered by their \\"hosts,\\" and well earned their Indian name of \\"cutthroat.\\"Much of Philbrick's historical account of the1620's through the 1670's is devoted to King Phillip's War, a name I recalled from public school days but the significance of which had thoroughly escaped me. It was a war that, probably like many wars, did not need to happen. Ironically, Phillip was the son of Massasoit, the Pokanoket leader, or sachem, whose allegiance with the Pilgrims may have saved the colony from starvation in its first year. One incident during this brief but deadly war is particularly disturbing. There is a short story, \\"Farewell to Manzanar\\" by Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston, that details the unprovoked incarceration of loyal American citizens of Japanese extraction during World War II simply because they looked like the enemy. It seems as though this sort of fear-based condemnation of one's neighbors has a long precedent in this country, for similar actions took place during King Phillip's War in 1675 and 1676. A goodly number of New England's native inhabitants had embraced the English god and had even created their own settlements where they were communally named the Praying Indians. Firm supporters of the English they may have been, but neither their allegiance nor their religion could save them from exile and imprisonment during the war, all because they looked like the enemy.There's at least one more American myth that needs mentioning, that the Pilgrims' invasion of the new World was somehow connected to the idea of \\"religious freedom.\\" The only religious freedom that these people were concerned with was their own. Here's an extract from Philbrick's book: \\"... John Lyford, a minister sent over by the Merchant Adventurers, was cast out of the settlement for secretly meeting with disgruntled settlers who wished to worship as they had back in England. One of Lyford's supporters, John Oldham, was forced to run through a gauntlet of musket-wielding Pilgrims who beat him with the butt ends of their weapons.\\"The truth, it seems, is often more shocking than the laundered myths to which we expose our school children. I suspect that everything in Philbrick's book has been published before in various books and manuscripts, but never have I found a source that ties it all together as Philbrick does. His writing is as fascinating and captivating as any novel, and the historical accuracy of it enhances its appeal. Reading MAYFLOWER is the most painless way imaginable to learn real 17rh century American history. I wholeheartedly recommend the book to every history teacher and to every public school graduate who would like to balance American myth with American reality."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This book gives a good and down to earth view of the issue of early English settlers. Somewhat disconcerting when it is relized that all the folks at that time bought and sold the Indians, stole their food and then nearly wiped them out.The fact that New England had been visited many times before and hordes of fishing ships worked the cod banks for nearly a hundred years before the first permanent settlement was an enlightening thing for me.

It was both completely enlightening and thrilling!Best book of the year for us-"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I was disappointed in Mayflower by Nathaniel Philbrick. The writing and exposition are tedious and uninspired. I found it rather a slog getting through. It seemed he was writing in the style of most tepid history--and then this happened, and then that happened, etc. etc. Furthermore, most of the events described have little more historical merit or glory than gang fights on the streets of LA and are about as brutal. Indeed, I came away from reading this book depressed by the almost unremitting brutality of the Europeans and the Indians and the apparent crudity and greediness of their lives. None of the characters in this historical account emerged as great and admirable individuals.Philbrick attempts toward the very end of Mayflower to express some of the greater significance of the events he so tediously and in such detail has recounted, but his effort is feeble and unconvincing. Contrary to what other readers and reviewers found, I did not find that Philbrick was able to breath any life into this story or give it any real significance. I learned a few new facts especially about the background of the Pilgrims and early colonial Indian wars, more than a few actually--too many; most of which I will soon forget. I do not recommend this book.On the other hand Philbrick's Sea of Glory is a wonderful book and story. See my amazon review. Sea of Glory is an exciting book well worth reading.

The author goes on and on about this in the manner of one of today's manufactured political scandals. Sure, a new civilization is born, but some corn was stolen! Stolen, I tell you!At one point Philbrick childishly snickers at the \\"irony\\" of the religious Pilgrims having to depend on a couple of Indians named \\"Satan\\". (Apparently, Squanto means \\"Satan\\" or something.) Get it? This is pretty heady stuff, fellas. Prospective readers should prepare themselves for lots of this kind of astute analysis.I could go on, but what's the point? Indians good; Pilgrims bad. Remember? The book reads like a poorly edited propaganda film, chock full of holes and leaps of logic that make absolutely no sense. (The Pilgrims thwart a plot by the Indians to wipe out the colony only to lament the negative impact the thwarting -- not the plot! -- had on trade!)I'm not sure what historians-in-waiting are being taught in school these days, but we may have to wait for the next generation to get back to real history and away from this wishful childish claptrap."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Well researched.

Likewise it has been documented that the first Thanksgiving did not take place with the Pilgrims; it took place around 1607 along the James River (then called Fluvanna River) in what became the Colony of Virginia. The site for that first Thanksgiving is believed to be on the property of what is known as the Berkeley Plantation in Charles City County, Virginia, just up river from the Jamestowne Settlement.

Newell, a Penobscot Indian and former chairman of the Anthropology department at the University of Connecticut, says that the first official Thanksgiving Day celebrated the massacre of 700 Indian men, women and children during one of their religious ceremonies. \\"Thanksgiving Day\\" was first proclaimed by the Governor of the then Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1637 to commemorate the massacre of 700 men, women and children who were celebrating their annual Green Corn Dance...Thanksgiving Day to them, \\"in their own house\\", Newell stated.\\"Gathered in this place of meeting, they were attacked by mercenaries and English and Dutch. The Indians were ordered from the building and as they came forth were shot down, The rest were burned alive in the building-----The very next day the governor declared a Thanksgiving Day.....For the next 100 years, every Thanksgiving Day ordained by a Governor was in honor of the bloody victory, thanking God that the battle had been won.\\"In June 1637 John Underhill slaughtered a Pequot village in just the manner described above. Narranganset Indians were used as the mercenaries. Governor John Endicott of the Massachusetts Bay Colony proclaimed the pequot war. A pequot chief of sachem named sassacus warred against the Dutch in 1633 over the death of his father. The Pequot made no distinction between the Dutch and the English. The Underhill massacre was witnessed and documented by William Branford and an engraving was made illustrating the massacre.The Jamestown Colony may be the source for the tradition of Indians under the leadership of Powhaton joining with early settlers for a dinner and helping those settlers through the winter. There were no pilgrims or puritans at Jamestown, however. The present Thanksgiving may therefore be a mixture of the tradition of the Jamestown dinner and the commemoration of the Pequot massacre."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"If Mayflower is as thorough and enjoyable as his last two, readers are in for an extremely good read.

The greatest thing about this work is that almost everyone in America is at least familiar with the story that this incredible author masterfully expounds. \\"Mayflower\\" successfully fills in any gaps in the American holiday story.Starting from the very beginning with nothing more than a thought of escape from religious hardships, Philbrick follows our celebrated pilgrims all the way through the end of King Philip's War, and then some. \\"Mayflower\\" successfully leaves the reader well satisfied that they have been made privy to any information available today regarding the Plymouth Colony, its creation, and its impact on early life in the new world.

Much of what we've learned from poetry, idealistic imagery, and elementary school texts is not so much wrong, as simple and shallow.Philbrick tells the more complicated, and therefore more accurate story of the English settlers and the native Americans--their connection and their conflict. For many, \\"Mayflower\\" will be like reading early American history for the first time. In particular, most would not pass a test with the simple question, \\"What was King Philip's War?\\"Though Philbrick avoids some of the political correct commentary that flood other recent books on this era, he does at time over opine with a slight slant toward giving the native Americans the benefit of the doubt and the WASPs the harsher analysis, especially regarding their religious practices. Still, this does not overwhelm the historical analysis, and some of it is necessary in order to demolish the simplistic imagery that has come to surround the Pilgrims.Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of \\"Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction,\\" \\"Soul Physicians,\\" and \\"Spiritual Friends.\\""},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Despite the main title, the Atlantic voyage of the Pilgrims occupies only a few pages of the book. The main focus of the work is divided between the story of the Plymouth Colony's development from 1620 to about 1630 (with particular emphasis on colonist-Indian relations) and a history of \\"King Philip's War\\" of 1675-76, with a quick survey of the years between to link the two main sections. A considerable transformation had occurred in New England between the early years of the Plymouth Colony, when the English colonists were only a tiny minority in a land with a large Indian population (although, that population was not so large as it had been only a few years before, a devastating epidemic -- perhaps bubonic plague introduced by European fishers -- had virtually depopulated much of eastern coastal New England just before the Pilgrims arrived). By 1675 the English colonists (their numbers swelled by the \\"Great Migration\\" of Puritans in the late 1630s and 1640s) outnumbered the Natives by perhaps two to one. King Philip's War -- proportionately, perhaps the bloodiest war in American History -- then further reduced Indian strength to maybe fifteen percent of the total population, and firmly established a pattern of white-Indian relationships that continue on for the next two centuries.If Philbrick has a hero in his tale, it is Benjamin Church, a captain in Plymouth's military forces during King Philip's War. Church, who disapproved of enslaving Indians and who frequently counseled moderation, led the way in adopting \\"Indian tactics\\" in fighting the war and in integrating \\"friendly\\" Indians into the units he commanded, key elements in bringing the war to a successful conclusion. (Interestingly, Philbrick points out that Church, a Plymouth carpenter who opted to establish a homestead in what amounted to the wilderness,was something of a prototype for a classic American literary figure, the frontiersman.And if there is a villain in the piece, then that must be Captain Miles Standish of Pilgrim fame, whose hair-trigger temper and brutal methods did much to poison early relations with the surrounding Indians.Philbrick depicts \\"King Philip\\" (the name had been bestowed on the Indian sachem by the Pilgrims as an honor) as neither the evil mastermind of New England myth, nor as the heroic leader of Indian resistance against the European invaders (the modern myth). Rather, Philip by Philbrick's view was a somewhat bumbling ineffectual creature, capable of kindness as well as blind greed. If Philbrick is right, Philip laid the verbal groundwork for \\"his\\" war in an effort to maintain leadership over his young warriors but, in the final analysis, circumstance and rhetoric forced his hand when Philip would rather have avoided war.Philbrick places considerably emphasis on the biracial nature of 17th century New England, perhaps a reflection of a modern focus on \\"multiculturalism\\". If there ever had been any realistic chance of a long-term society balancing European and Native American cultures, King Philip's War probably ended the feasibility of such a direction and instead pointed the way to the Cherokee Trail of Tears and the Little Big Horn."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"The next third grade Patron who asks the Stern Librarian for facts about Thanksgiving and the Pilgrims is going to get an earful. The wonderful thing about Mayflower is the way it demythologizes the familiar story of the Pilgrims and the Indians. But the real story is so rich and so full of contemporary parallels that it is amazing to me that it has not taken greater hold. No one writes about Cape Cod or the sea as well as Nathaniel Philbrick. The early scenes about the Mayflower's voyage, the landing at Provincetown, the near foundering as the Pilgrims' attempted to reach their charter lands near the Hudson, and the compromise change of course to Plymouth, with its inferior harbor, reminded me of In the Heart of the Sea. For example, Philbrick discusses the journey of the replica ship Mayflower II to give a sort of eyewitness feel to his description of the original ship's voyage. But the bulk of the book is about the Pilgrims' (and later the Puritans') changing relationship with the Native American settlers, and the shift over half a century from mutual dependency to war. Philbrick is best here at describing this forgotten war whose outcome, while inevitable, feels tragic and ironically futile in this telling.

I expected a traditional chronological history when I picked up the book and I was pleasantly surprised to discover the addition of considerable economic and social aspects of history as well as military and religious. I also appreciate the level of objectivity the author was able to achieve, noting human strengths and foibles by both pilgrims and indians and never falling into a simplistic view of conquerors and victims.A minor quibble with the publisher--the picture and maps are small and fuzzy--in some cases they are barely legible and you have to find other sources to follow the location references."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This was my first foray into Philbrick's writing and, I must say, I am quite impressed with Mayflower's breadth of scope, objectivity, and an engaging writing style that is not \\"academic,\\" but an engrossing read virtually impossible to put down (I actually read half of the book in one sitting).Philbrick pulls no punches, plays no favorites, and challenges our traditional assumptions about our pilgrim forefathers. He also presents an absorbing portrait of the Indians and the various tribes that came into contact with the new arrivals from England in this true story that Philbrick skillfully unfolds like a well-written novel. Through Philbrick's eyes, we see the hunger, the despair, the disease, and death the the pilgrims faced repeatedly. And the images we have grown accustomed to with Pilgrims and Indians sitting together for the first Thanksgiving was anything but the traditional feast we celebrate every November.All the primary players in this drama are here: the diplomatic James Bradford, the ruthless Miles Standish, et al, but also here is the relatively unknown story of the intelligent but duplicitous Squanto, an Indian guide who attempted to establish relations between Plymouth and the Pokanokets while trying to outwit his rivals and paid the ultimate price.Philbrick casts the pilgrims in a new light. A pious people? Yes, but decidedly pragmatic in terms of their survival and not above actual theft and, what Phibrick called the pilgrims' \\"brutal agenda\\" of intimidation to survive.All in all, Philbrick takes a the reader on \\"you are there\\" account of the mythic voyage of the Mayflower that began in peril and ultimately ended in war."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"We Americans know little of our own history, and that's a shame. The early history of this country is a feast for the curious, a fascinating story of hardship, survival, faith, foolishness, compassion and cruelty.Philbrick's \\"Mayflower\\" is a pretty addition to the current crop of superbly written historical narratives about the early history of European America. Before I picked up his book, I knew almost nothing about the Pilgrims and Puritans, nor did I care. The tedius high school and college studies foisted on us in the literature and history of early New England were enough to turn anyone away from the subject. Philbrick, however, changed all that for me. His lively style and intimate familiarity with - and love of -- the history of the region immediately won me over. And, the portraits he draws of individuals whose names we all know, Miles Standish, Governor Bradford, and others are startling, if not deep.For example, Captain Standish, we learn, was so short his rapier had to be reduced by five inches so it wouldn't scrape the ground. The good Pilgrims called him \\"Captain Shrimp,\\" but never to his face. His temper and boldness were famous; he could respond murderously if sufficiently pushed. In one memorable incident, he lured a pair of Indians to dinner who had threatened him the day before. Both Indians were much bigger than the Captain. As one took his seat, Standish snatched the Indian's knife, which hung on a cord round his neck, and stabbed him to death. Standish's compatriots finished the other. Violent and brutal was life in the Old East.If there is a constant thread to this history, as Philbrick tells it, it is violence and death. The first winter left only 50 pilgrims alive from the original 102 who traveled on the Mayflower. The ship itself wintered over with the Pilgrims and half its crew died. Nor were the Indians spared. By the time of the Pilgrims' landing, disease had already nearly annihilated the local Native Americans. Some 80 percent of the indigenous population of Plymouth and its environs were dead of one European-induced plague or another. Whole villages had been abandoned. With no one left to bury the dead, corpses were left to rot where they fell. Bleached bones littered the ground.The Pilgrims were firm in their faith, but even they could be tempted. As starvation treatened and harsh conditions persisted, ethics became situational, even from the very beginning. The good Pilgrims prayed when they landed, but shortly afterward they stole a cache of seed corn from the Indians and apparently never paid for it, nor did they apologize. They were forgiven, however, and befriended by natives. The famous story we learn as children of the Indians showing the Pilgrims how to plant corn, using fish as fertilizer, turns out to be true.While violence occurred, there was also charity. Massasoit, sachem (chief) of the plague-decimated Pokanoket tribe, was to prove not only friendly but vital to the Pilgrims. He sold them vast tracks of land, preserved the peace, and formed a strong personal bond with a prominent pilgrim, Edward Winslow. Word had come to Winslow that the sachem was dying (or dead). Winslow trudged the 15 miles to Massasoit's village to find the sachem deathly ill, probably with typhus. Winslow was no doctor (Lucky for Massasoit. Had Winslow been a doctor, the sachem might have never have survived the techniques and cures of 17th century medicine.), but he was kind enough to embrace the fallen Indian, scrape his mouth and tongue clear of the brown muck that typhus creates, and ladle English fruit preserves into him. Within hours, Massasoit began to recover. He begged Winslow to take the cure to the other sick members of his tribe. Winslow, loath to touch another under such conditions, it being \\"much offensive to me, not being accustomed with such poisonous savors,\\" nevertheless did as the sachem asked. These acts of kindness endeared the English to Massasoit. The sachem even renamed his sons Alexander and Philip, English names to honor his allies.While Massasoit lived, peace endured. A half century passed without the stain of bloodshed over Pilgrim-Indian disputes in territory that Massasoit ruled. History is a meandering stream, however, that often flows in unanticipated directions. While Massasoit and Winslow were friends and allies, their sons were not. Josiah Winslow, one of Edward's sons, became Governor of Plymouth. Philip, son of Massasoit, as sachem, became the nemesis of the colonists, the leader of a native war against the English that would be fought brutally by all parties, see the destruction of several English towns and villages, and eventually destroy the Pokanokets and other once friendly natives.The New England of King Philip's War was much different than that of 1620. A half-century of peace brought tens of thousands of Puritans and others from England. The natural fecundity of people who had 7 or 8 children also added to the population. Towns were everywhere. That first miserable winter, with Pilgrims hungry and shivering in shelters of mud and waddle, could never have foretold the New England of 1670. By 1670, the Massachusetts Bay colony had been founded, as were Connecticut, New Haven, the rogue religious sanctuary of Rhode Island and other settlements. By the time of King Philip's war, the colonies had even united under a loose confederation.The good men and women of Plymouth, while devoted Christians, were hardly perfect. They eagerly hanged Quakers merely for being Quakers (at least for a time), and their prosecution of King Philip's war proceeded in a way that would grind against modern sensibilities. Heads were lopped off and posted on the town palisade. \\"Traitors\\" - at least those accused and convicted of treason - were hanged, drawn and quartered. These things were brutal but we should not feel especially superior. In modern times we've foresworn hand-to-hand killing for antiseptic measures that can kill tens of thousands from the air. We coolly dismiss such slaughter as \\"collateral damage,\\" but it is slaughter nevertheless, and on a scale that might have horrified the people of 1670.One would not normally describe a book of history as a \\"page turner,\\" but this one certainly was. I devoured it in a few days. Oh, and if you're interested in the myths that have so obscured our knowledge of the Pilgrims, Philbrick's Afterward, called \\"Conscience\\" explains the origins and debunks many of the things we've been taught. None of this detracts from the Pilgrims, however, who emerge as tough, brave, resourceful and industrious. Their passion for religion eludes me, but their accomplishments are astounding. The book is gem.

The book does not stop there. It details the trials and tribulations of these colonists who befriend and then turn against the Native Americans. Much of the book deals with the little known French and Indian War as well as the impact it had on the formation of the New England Colonies. The author not only covers the topic, but shows both the positive interaction of the Puritans with the Native Americans as well as the typical European abuse of the same people. Philbrick takes a decidedly dry topic and breathes life into it with entertaining points rarely discussed outside of upper academia.

Instead, it is a history of the Pilgrims, from England to Holland to New England, up until King Phillip's war. The narrative of the initial events leading to the voyage of the boat and the start of Plymouth colony are fairly well detailed in the book. Then the next 50 years are quickly passed, and the narrative switches to that of the war against the Indians (King Phillips war). The war narrative is more difficult to follow, jumping from a number of different events, happening at different times in different places. Attention seems to be paid to players where more information is known (with Benjamin Church getting a lot of positive coverage).This book would have perhaps been best split in to two separate tomes. The initial book could cover the Pilgrims and their voyage to the new world, with a the second one focusing on the early \\"war on terror\\" against the native Americans.

The second half of this book outlined the wars with Indians and was hard for this reader to handle. I think it makes me believe that war is always a condition of man. Especially when higher spirtual ideas are set aside. Even the Indians were in war with other Indians before the english got here.

I can't wait to read his next book."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Since this particular period in American history has never been of special interest to me, I ordered \\"Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War\\" with the notion that I could probably force myself to plod through it. Imagine my complete surprise when I found that putting this book down to attend to necessary matters (such as eating and sleeping) was really hard to do. For a book on history, this is one of the most readable books I've come across in quite a while. This is a fascinating story of some of the first Europeans to settle in what became the northeast states of this land mass now known as the United States.One of the most satisfying elements of this book is the lack of bias demonstrated by the author. Mr. Philbrick was equally tough on the Puritans and Indians in most cases, but did not attempt to moralize or pass judgment on either group. It was also interesting to me (and a rather unique experience) to run across the names of five of my ancestors: Hugh Cole, Thomas Savage, John Pynchon and (Amy Wyllys, his wife) as well as John's father, William Pynchon. The only other time I've run across the mention of an ancestor in a book is...uh, well, not exactly someone whose name is real high on the list of honorable persons. Nuff said!There is much to be learned from this book about the early European settlement of Massachusetts and Connecticut, especially if you have been out of school for a few decades. The characters in \\"Mayflower\\" come alive in ways that are unusual in what is essentially a book of historical facts. You will find nothing stodgy and boring in this book, and I recommend it even for people like myself, who believe that too much that is found in books of history is of necessity something one has to force feed children. Nathaniel Philbrick is an exceptional historian and writer. I'll be purchasing more of his books."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Another great book by Nathaniel Philbrick. I read his In The Heart of the Sea...5 stars...see my review.Mayflower reads very well with lots of action. Its 462 pages plus some B/W pictures of some of the people,maps, equipment and places told about in this book. There is a huge amount of notes and a great bibliography where readers can get more information. The actual reading of the book is 361 pages. It reads fast. I read it in a little over 2 days. This is a great book..just look at the almost 200 five star ratings on Amazon!In high school history I had a one day lesson, a little about the Mayflower, the Pilgrims and Puritans and some of the New England Indian tribes of the early to mid 1600s. Just a speck of history.Nathaniel Philbrick goes much, much deeper into the Mayflower and the different Pilgrims and Puritans and many more Indian tribes and the Mayflower Compact. We see the Pilgrims trying to get religious freedom in the new world, yet not being open to other religions. We see the differences in the Puritan, Pilgrims and Quakers and how they really did not get along very well due to differences in religion and how each were governed. We see the different crops planted by the native Americans. lobstering, catching of game, and fishing to survive. Also the role of using Herring fish as fertilizer is shown. The Governors of Plymouth and the military commanders are shown.Also the King Philip war is shown and the eventual killing of the menacing \\"Indian King\\" King Philip. Also the great deeds of Benjamin Church in the Indian wars who was a believer of allowing the use of friendly Indians to help fight against the warrior attacking Indian tribes rather than Captain Samuel Mosley who believed the only good Indian was a dead Indian. We see the many massacres of both whites and Indians.Also how the Indians actually did save the starving original Pilgrims with their corn, game, fish and lobster as the crops the pilgrims had planted did not do well in the new world, as it was very late in the year and cold. The Pilgrims would of starved to death. We see the huge death toll from disease and little food of the original Pilgrims and the massive percentage of New England colony people killed and Indians killed in the Indian Wars.( over 8% and up to 80% respectfully) A much greater percent of the population killed than the Civil War or any of the wars the US later had.I won't ruin the book with more description. Just say there is much, much more. There is probably tid bits of information you never heard about or information with a differnt slant than taught in school.A fantastically well researched book, rich in description and action. Mayflower 5 stars and recommended. I liked Nathaniel Philbrick's In The Heart of the Sea and Mayflower so much I bought his books... Sea of Glory and the Last Stand and will review."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I bought this in the large print edition for my 88 year old mother.

Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I love restoration history, but I have not read much historical history about America. I wanted to read this book because Charity was doing a homeschool lesson on the pilgrims and the Mayflower. She even made a Mayflower boat out of cardboard and made customs for the kids. Since it seemed everyone else was learning all about this period of history, I wanted to contribute as well. I was not sure what to expect out of this book. I knew it was popular, but how interesting can history by sometimes. Everyone as sat in those boring history classes with one fact after another. This book was amazing. As I was reading it, the more I was getting into the story. On a side note, during thanksgiving, I got to be that annoying guy that has all the useless facts about sometime. It really made me enjoy thanksgiving more and feel good to participate in the families education. The book is better than fiction. The story of the characters might shock you, and probably by the end of the title, you will want to visit the area where the events took place. I certainly do. The author had a good understanding of the times, and he wrote the book so well that it was not just facts but a flowing narrative. I enjoyed this book so much that I probably will read more titles a long these lines."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"\\"Mayflower\\" - Nathaniel PhilbrickThe following comments are for the unabridged CD audio book version of \\"Mayflower \\" by Nathaniel Philbrick. George Guidall reads the book. This is a Penguin Audio edition.This listener found the narrator, George Guidall, an admirable speaker whose lucid pronunciation and reasonable pacing a pleasure to listen too.This audio book consist 11 compact disks with a total playtime of approximately 12 and a half hours. The disks are secured in two standard fan fold multi CD holders. These two inserts slide into the external packaging box. The CD holders do not have identifications on the spine listing the CD numbers. I mention this minor point because a numbering feature is very useful when you're looking for the next CD to be played.For several years I did a significant amount of business travel. I filled those hours listening to numerous non-fiction audio books most of them in the history-biography category. Many were ok, some good and a very few compelling listening. \\" Mayflower \\" falls into the latter category. There are several reasons for this personal judgment. I found the subject matter very interesting to say the least. In addition the author has a brilliant knack for bringing to life historical events and personalities. Another factor, admittedly a personal one, is that I have lived near and visited many of the locations in Massachusetts detailed in this book.This book could of been titled \\"King Philip's War' since the narrative mostly concerns that sad and tragic event. This is not to say that the author shortchanges the reader concerning the Mayflower voyage and Plymouth Colony but the war is the climatic event in the book. That war is considered to be one of the bloodiest and costliest wars in the history of North America. More than half of New England's ninety towns were assaulted by Native American warriors and native losses are estimated to be 15% of the total population.I would highly recommed this book to anyone with an interest in the colonial period and Native American issues during thos years. The author quotes extensively from several eyewitness accounts which complements the story.I have a couple of comments related to this audio book. Whenever possible I recommed the unabridged version of an audio book if it is available. I am always concerned when a book is abridged - just what was left out in order to make it \\"fit\\" a specifed length. My edition of \\"Mayflower\\" was unabridged thankfully. My complaint about this audio book has to do with the chapter editing on the disks. The editors added chaper edit pauses corrosponding to thr length of time it took the narrator to read a chapter from the book. This made it difficult for me to find my location on a CD. Some editors add a pause on the disk every 3 minuets which makes finding your start point considerably easier. So now you know."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Nathaniel Philbrick has not disappointed again (this is a third book by him that I read, others are: \\"Sea of Glory\\" and \\"In the Heart of the Sea\\"). What a great writer, my favorite along with Hampton Sides (\\"Ghost Soldiers\\"). True history is always better than the fiction (no matter how good the fiction is), particularly when presented by such writers. I have been always interested in early relations between white migrants/settlers and North America's Natives. \\"Mayflower\\" is a story of New England - arrival of first Pilgrims and Puritans, establishment of united colonies of Massachusetts, Connecticut and Plymouth in XVII century. As usual.. these relations were very complex and tragic in many instances: nastiness, hatred, treachery, sufferings, slavery dirty business, very little cooperation and understanding, cruelty, war and massacres..nothing that we would not expect from humans. We simply cannot exist in peace, period. Two important people emerge from this historical period: King Phillip (not very ingenious and tragic Native sachem) and controversial in many aspects Benjamin Church - first who embraced the wilderness warfare, prototype of Davy Crockett, Daniel Boone and Kid Carson.\\"Mayflower\\", as well as \\"The Last Stand\\" by Philbrick + \\"Blood and Thunder\\" by Hampton Sides create the very powerful trilogy about the above mentioned subject of relations. These books are quite objective (IMO, though I know that not all will agree) and fantastic reading."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Mayflower is a very well written history book that impartially revisits the first ~50 years of the Plymouth Colony. Philbrick starts sharing with us the origins of the Pilgrims, how they came to the new continent, their settlement, their first years, and eventually how the partnership they had with the natives unravel into what's known as King Philip's War. It humanizes that piece of history, showing how both the pilgrims and the indians were -no surprise!- just humans, with contradictions and paradoxes.I strongly recommend this book for anyone with interest in the origins of the US, or just plainly looking for an entertaining history book.I would also recommend to read this book with an e-reader. It's very easy to get lost with the many names of people and places, and a device with a good search feature would be very helpful.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This story starts out with the 'saints' - those who believe they have been chosen by God, and want to keep themselves pure from common temptations for that purpose. Philbrick tells of their faith with respect and clarity, and at the same time tells of how the stresses of survival caused them to actually live that faith out. This book answers the important question \\"How does what people believe and what they experience affect their actions?\\" This book revealed the true depth of piety in the Pilgrims and the messy combination of faith with frail people that is life.This is a great narrative, and yet with the historical research to present people \\"as they are, not as we wish that they were\\" - George Washington. I appreciated Philbrick filling in parts of the story I'd never heard - what was it like in England under King James - why did the Pilgrims leave Holland - how were the Pilgrims different from the settlers in Jamestown?Like watching \\"Titanic\\", you know the ending, but you wonder who is going to survive, and how. I was surprised how many Indians lived around Plymouth - somehow I had a vision of the diseases wiping out 90% of the population. (Philbrick points out how King Phillip's War and loss of land eventually did reduce the Indian population by 60-80%) The revelation of the scheming nature of Squanto, and the beligerent nature of John Standish were eye-opening.Philbrick shows that what saved the Pilgrims was making a covenant and actually living up to it with Massasoit. They literally saved each others lives. There were many massacres on both sides later, but the fact that Massasoit and the Pilgrims protected each other was a glorious moment in history. Unfortunately, as much larger numbers of Puritans (those who left England for America after the Pilgrims showed New England was habitable) arrived, they, and the Pilgrims felt that they did not need the Indians anymore. They then began a competition to see who could get the most from the other, and tried to exterminate the strangers.King Phillip's War was new to me. Also, I was surprised how many Indians became 'Praying Indians', and horrified at how badly they were treated by the settlers. Philbrick shows the danger of turning an economic conflict into a racial conflict. Benjamin Church's (grandson of a Mayflower passenger) ability to trust, work with, learn from and even admire the 'heathen' Indians was a hopeful ending to the book. Philbrick's overall theme is that for humanity to grow and survive all the peoples must take the best from each others cultures and not act out of fear."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This is an easy flowing narrative that focuses on the relationship between the English settlers and the Native American populations in 17th century New England. Despite the book's title, the story being told merely starts with the Pilgrims of the Mayflower; who they were, where they came from and their efforts to reach the New World. It also covers the first decade of the Plymouth colony in detail, and demonstrates why it was political self-interest and not just naive altruism that motivated Massasoit to help these interlopers.The story then leaps ahead rather abruptly from about 1630 and the beginnings of the Great Migration, to the onset of the conflict known as King Philip's War in 1675. As the author points out several times, this war not only devastated the native population, but also inflicted the highest percentage of population loss on those of European decent as any war this country has ever had. It is painted as a struggle for survival on both sides, with the elimination of the English colonies as a possible, albeit unlikely, outcome.Contrary to some other reviewers, I did not detect any particular bias in this author's depictions. Both Native and English have their courageous heroes and craven opportunists, and there are cases of duplicity and manipulation cited across both peoples. Although the result is not a clear account of Good Guys versus Bad Guys, it does end up being fundamentally \\"human\\", and therefore believable.This edition also contains numerous maps and photos of locations and artifacts. There are also extensive postscript sections of index, notes and acknowledgements that amount to about 40% of the total length. I would have personally preferred more detail of the years between 1630 and 1670. The author's intent, however, is not a chronology of the development of the English settlements, but a telling of the \\"Greek Tragedy\\" (his expression) of the relationship between two cultures."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"The story of the Pilgrims is well known to all Americans; or is it? Nathaniel Philbrick uses the familiar story of the Pilgrims, the tiny ship \\"Mayflower,\\" Plymouth Rock, the first Thanksgiving, Miles Standish, and the like as the touchstone to recreate this time and place in elegant prowse. In so doing Philbrick breathes new life into a history wrapped in mystery and nostalgia, narrating in lucid prowse the group's first generation experiences from departure in England to difficult settling in New England to trials and war with Native Americans. \\"Mayflower\\" explores what Philbrick calls \\"a restorative myth of national origins\\" and the delta between that myth and the reality of the past. He recreates the history of the Plymouth Colony masterfully and brings to life a remarkable time and place. He draws in deft style the characters of William Bradford, Miles Standish, Massasoit, and others in this wonderful study.In drawing this portrait of Plymouth Colony, Philbrick is not so much acting as a mythbuster as an elaborator of a remarkable past. He gives credit to the major actors and the stunning feats of the era. At the same time his portrait is much more nuanced than most popular conceptions. The result, in contrast to New England mythmakers such as Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, is a powerful story of struggle, war, positive and negative race relations, violence, religious commitment and identity, and economic opportunity. By far the strongest part of the book for me was Philbrick's discussion of the causes, conduct, and outcome of King Philip's War in 1675-1676. Encroached on from all sides by English settlers, Native American chiefton Metacom-- known to the English as \\"King Philip\\"--responded with violence. In the end this war proved one of the bloodiest wars ever conducted in America as approximately 1 in 65 whites and 1 in 20 natives died in the year-long struggle. Philbrick's narration of this sad and epic war is both stunning and disturbing. Stunning because of the depth of his research and the power of his writing; disturbing because of the destructive forces unleashed in this conflict.Overall, \\"Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War\\" is an outstanding work of history in early America. Its accessible writing style will ensure it a prominent place on the shelves at the front of the local Borders and Barnes and Noble bookstores and a high sales rate on Amazon.com. It's sophisticated and nuanced analysis will ensure it a place among more scholarly works. Everyone will benefit from reading it."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"NOTE: DON'T BUY THE KINDLE VERSION UNLESS YOU WANT TO GO W/OUT THE MAPS.Other people have commented far more cogently than I can concerning the content of this book. As a corrective for the middle-school history version of the Plymouth colony I found it an informative and entertaining invitation to investigate other histories of the Pilgrims. I'd definitely recommend the print version of the book.The digital version, however leaves much to be desired, primarily because the publisher seems to have taken no care to insure that the digital reproductions of the maps were legible. I own the second version of the Kindle, which has the capacity to magnify illustrations--and they still weren't legible. I know that illustrations are hardly the Kindle's strong suit, but the maps, as far as I can tell, were simple line drawings. Nobody seems to have checked to see if they actually displayed properly. Instead everything was allowed to remain a faint illegible gray--magnification didn't help. That they could have potentially been a great addition to the narrative was made frustratingly clear each time I advanced from an illustration to a page of text--the illustration would briefly flash in stunningly vivid contrast, then vanish as the next page of text appeared. The same thing would happen when shifting between the default scale and the magnified version. Neither worked properly. Poor job all around."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"An earlier review here on Amazon remarks on the two tales here. First, the amazing arrival of the Pilgrims and their early days here. Second, the fallout of the next hundred and fifty years, as Europeans expand their toehold in New England, triggering war with Native American tribes.The Pilgrim story is fascinating. We learn of the dogmatic differences between two groups on the Mayflower, and how they resolve and manage these differences as they adapt to life in a new hemisphere. The penning of the Mayflower Compact, off the shores of outer Cape Cod, is stunning and Philbrick properly brings forward the historical importance of this agreement to the American experiment. It is the very genesis of separation of Church and State. We meet the individual leaders of the Plymouth Colony and learn how different personalities shape the colony. Who the heroes are and who the anti-heroes are. Readers learn that disease, not battle, literally decimated the indigenous population.The second half of the book delves into the the deteriorating relationship of both the Plymouth and Massachusetts Colonies with the many Native American tribes, many of which had been longterm, if not staunch, allies. We learn not all tribes are the same. In this second tale, we swing from Massasoit to his son Philip who leads the revolt.Too much detail and too many tribes do bog down the reading in this section. Philbrick seemingly takes us down every traversed path in and around Narragansett Bay during a single year. I concur with the earlier reviewer who suggests a schematic may have been helpful in depicting tribes, regions, and such.Nonetheless, a terrific read that sheds light on an unheralded century between the first arrival and the Revolution."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I'm currently reading this book for the third time. I love it. The author is fair and leaves the opinions to the reader. The facts aren't particularly generous to the early English settlers or, to the natives of the region. They each had their motives. That being said, my personal feelings of pride in my heritage were not diminished one bit.I may have a unique perspective since I am a proven descendent of both William Bradford and William Brewster. I thought that this might taint my objectivity. So, I purchased another book (In The Heart of The Sea) by the same author. I have read that one twice so far. I never do that.I am a huge fan of both the author and this book. I highly recommend it! And, I'm eagerly awaiting the next adventure."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Mayflower by Nathaniel Philbrick is about the Plymouth Colony. The book is divided into four parts thatare \\"Discovery,\\" \\"Accommodation,\\" \\"Community,\\" and \\"War.\\" The four parts revolve mostly around confrontation with the Indians. The author's thesis is \\"It is a story that is at once fundamental and obscure, and it begins with a ship on a wide and blustery sea.\\" The book explores who the Pilgrims really were. The book also demonstrates how the Pilgrim's story does not end with the first Thanksgiving, because peace did not last between them and the Indians. This book gives an improved analysis of the Pilgrims and Indians affairs (xvii).This book examines the arrival of the Pilgrims through King Phillip's War. When the Pilgrims arrived, they met the Wampanoag Indians. The Wampanoags' leader was Massasoit. The Pilgrims and the Wampanoags lived in peace with another under the leadership of William Bradford and Massasoit. The Wampanoags played an important role in the Pilgrims' survival, which even brought the first Thanksgiving. They both had conflicts with one another, but they were usually solved in a peaceful way. One of the main problems faced was when the Pilgrims met Squanto. Squanto helped sell land and also tried to persuade people to come to New England. When Squanto played the English against the Pokanokets, he almost lost his life but Bradford, who decided to put his settlement at risk instead of turning over his valuable translator, protected him. It also demonstrates how the Pilgrims and Indians both influenced one another's culture. In the mid 17th century the Pilgrims adopted the use of Indian currency. The Indians adopted the musket as their main hunting weapon instead of using their bow and arrow. Benjamin Church became a hero when he was a carpenter turned Indian fighter. Church won several important victories including the Great Swamp fight. King Philip's War ended with the Pilgrims forcing the Indians out of New England by selling them into slavery. The book explains the Pilgrims' relationship with the Indians.Mayflower is a well-written book. It uses a combination of primary and secondary sources. Primary sources are important because they add first hand accounts that provide direct evidence of the Plymouth Colony. The primary documents the author uses are written documents. William Bradford wrote some of the primary sources used in this book. The secondary sources provide expertise. An example of a secondary source used to add expertise is \\"historian George Bodge insisted that the Great Swamp Fight was one if the most glorious victories ever achieved in our history, as displaying heroism, both in stubborn patience and dashing intrepidity, never excelled in American warfare.\\" Mayflower is a well-written book because it uses primary and secondary sources properly (279).Philbrick's approaches are clear and effective. His descriptions are well detailed and make the reader feel as if he or she is there. For example, \\"In mid ocean, a fierce wave had exploded against the old ship's topsides, straining a structural timber until it had cracked like a chicken bone\\" gives an in-depth description of the difficulties that the Pilgrims had to deal with on their voyage to the new world. He also gives a good description of the weapons the Pilgrims used by giving a good description on the matchlock, which had no sight and used a stand to hold it in place while it was fired in a direction. His concluding paragraph of each chapter sets up the next chapter. He concludes The Trial chapter by saying, \\"Thanks to the murder trial of Tobias and the others, Armageddon had arrived\\", which will set up the next chapter, Kindling the Flame. The author is also good at explaining possibilities of having something. He demonstrates that by saying, \\"If the Pilgrims did possess Smith's map of New England, they failed to make good use of it,\\" which gives an idea that the Pilgrims tried to explore rivers on territory that the map depicted as having no rivers. The author's approaches are effective because he is very descriptive and ends each chapter properly (4, 225, & 59).This book is good at explaining people's actions. The author is good at demonstrating people's motives for performing a certain action. For example, \\"several captured sailors were put to trial and condemned to death, but with the outbreak of war, they were granted a reprieve as long as they were willing to fight the Indians under Moseley.\\" The motive of having a larger force to fight a bigger threat was more important. Philbrick also gives the positives of performing certain actions relative to the Pilgrims' world that today's beliefs would oppose. He demonstrates it by saying \\"Selling Indian captives served two functions: it provided income to help pay for the war, and it removed a dangerous and disruptive people from the colony-not to mention the fact that it made the rebels' lands available for later settlement by the English.\\" This book is effective because it explains the actions of the Pilgrims because they determine the course of our history (239 & 253).The book is different from other books in its genre because of the approach it takes. Mayflower is an example of classic history. It is from a historian's perspective instead of an archaeologist's perspective. The book is also concerned with causation instead of culture. Another book that was written about Plymouth Colony was The Time of their Lives by James Deetz and Patricia Scott Deetz. This is a book written from an archaeologist's perspective because it deals with culture and also uses artifacts as primary resources. The Deetzs' book has its chapters organized by culture instead of chorological order. For example, some of the chapters that are organized by theme are the social world, housing, criminal offensives, and others. Mayflower organizes its chapters differently because it starts with the journey and makes it way through important events by occurrence. Both Mayflower and The Time of their Lives portray Squanto as causing conflict on both sides, but in a different way. The Time of their Lives tells directly that Squanto cause conflict on both sides while Mayflower tells Squanto's actions through a series of events. This book differs from other books in its genre because of its perspective.Nathaniel Philbrick has the credentials to write this book because of his education and accomplishments. Nathaniel Philbrick is a freelance writer. He has a master's degree in American Literature from Duke University. He has written other books that have won awards. His notable title is In the Heart of the Sea and Sea of Glory: The Epic South Seas Expedition. Most of the books he has written are about the sea. Nathaniel Philbrick's education and book awards give him the proper credentials to write this book.In conclusion, Mayflower is a book that must be read. It provides a better understanding of the Plymouth Colony. The emphasis on cause and effect is important because it provides a better understanding of the Plymouth Colony. This book evaluates decisions made by the Pilgrims on their belief system and then reevaluates them with today's belief system. Philbrick's book is also very descriptive with well-written ideas and enough evidence to back up his reason. The book also covers a long time period in a very descriptive way by evaluating the events that shaped the Plymouth Colony. Overall this book is a good book that students should read to have a better understanding of the Plymouth Colony."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This is quite an amazing book that appears to be well researched. I felt the wealth of information written on the earliest MA settlers expanded my knowledge base immensely. I was puzzled, however, why the title was \\"Mayflower\\". I would suggest that \\"Plymouth\\" would be more suitable as the text covers approximately 80 years of Pilgirm and Puritan settlement that went far beyond the trip across the Atlantic.In the course of this rather long book, there are sections in which I was lost or even dazed. The information, including the names of places and characters, came so quickly that the text became confusing, especially during King Phillip's War. It was questioned whether all the detail was needed to get the point across. As one of my pet peeves, maps in books help me orient to the action.I have heard others complain that the author did not work to develop characters. I did not find that a problem. In fact, by plainly presenting the existing knowledge about the characters, the reader can draw personal conclusions. If that were done by the author, there would be the temptation to fictionalize or romanticize the subject matter.I have visted the part of MA in which the tale occurred. That fact, however, does not make me an expert on the subject. Therefore, I want to reserve judgement on the Pilgrims as I do not know much about daily life and thought of that century. It did, however, appear that the whole group was rather naive, stupid, intolerant, narrow minded, and fanatical. It appeared to be a wonder that any survived. I question if our local Congregational Church was aware of those characteristics when they named their youth group the Pilgrim Fellowship.The treatment of the multiple human factions appeared to be handled quite well. The native Americans were not treated as \\"noble savages\\" but as people of a different culture who could be crafty but loyal, brutal but helpful. Clearly, they were overtaken by English innovations and products. The English were also not presented as heroes but as people who did their best with very limited knowledge and experience.I especially enjoyed the \\"Epilogue\\" and recommend that it be read before as well as after the book as it presents, to me, the purpose for engaging in this work. Clearly, fundamentalists of every type and in every age become cultish and intolerant, proposing their own egocentric opinion as objective truth. As of late, American foreign policy tends to repeat some of the same naive errors of the Pilgrims by subscribing to insular and narrow thinking. I am afraid we have not learned much about communicating and negotiating with people vastly different from ourselves in the last 350 years. We still steal their seed corn and wonder why they get upset."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Follows the book and helped my son with his required summer reading assignment.

I decided then to just get on-line and have one shipped to his mom, along with The Mayflower Papers.She was thrilled and is planning to get her book club to read it once they finish their current book."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This book was particularly appealing to me because I am from Massachusetts. As a boy, I went on many school field trips to Plimoth Plantation and Plymouth Rock. I am familiar with the various towns with English names like Weymouth, Duxbury and Kingston. In addition, towns with Indian names like Narragansett, Cotuit, Massasoit and Squantum are familiar to me. You can't travel very far in Southeastern Massachusetts without finding a restaurant or hotel named after Bradford, Standish or Alden. In the 60's and 70's, before political correctness became fashionable the Massachusetts Turnpike logo was a Pilgrim Hat (the kind with the buckle above the brim) with an arrow through it. Now the logo is just a hat, the arrow is long gone. The whole concept of Pilgrims and Indians in Massachusetts has become very quaint and commercial. Philbrick took my simplistic childhood image of the Pilgrims and the First Thanksgiving and smashed it into a million pieces. Wow!"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"the book was still a captivating piece of literature. I read this directly after reading In the Heart of the Sea by Philbrick, and was expecting the same type of story. That was not the case however. The title is a bit misleading in that one thinks they are going to be reading (or at least I did) a story of the journey. The subtitle should have cued me in. The book is about the struggle between the settlers and the natives more so than it is about the voyage to the new world. All that being said, I still loved the book. I gave the book four stars because I wish there was more about the actual voyage, and I think the title is a little misleading. All in all though, it is a superb piece of literature."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This has been done many times before, books about the Mayflower, Plymouth Colony and the war with the English. But credit the author for bringing in a fresh prespective on it, making it cool for this deacade's new generation. My ancestors are the pilgrims who landed on the Mayflower so for me this is a nostalgia trip. This is like Catholic. This book was a bestseller and finalist for book of the year."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I was afraid that this would a piece of ancestor-bashing revisionist history trash -- I was, happily, wrong.

I learned so much that I never knew and that we weren't taught in school about the relationship between the Pilgrims and Indians."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I have recently read Philbrick's book, LAST STAND, and found his telling of Custer's last campaign so entertaining and informative that I decided to order MAYFLOWER. It was a good decision.Philbrick does an excellent job of letting the reader see the details of the Plymouth Colony's landing, settling and expanding into New England from the viewpoint of both the Pilgrims and the Indians. I was hoping for a little more about the grubby details of building a settlement at the edge of a wilderness. While MAYFLOWER has some of that, it is mostly about the ever changing dealings and relationships between the Pilgrims and the Puritans on the one hand and the Indians on the other from first contact through the King Phillip's War.There is no white-wash in this book, Philbrick gives you the good, the bad and the ugly about both sides, without being judgmental, leaving it to the reader to make his or her own judgement about the conduct of the parties.The reader will come away much better informed about the tenuious beginnings of the European migration to the New England coast and well entertained in the process."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This ia a very well written story of the Mayflower and the first 50 years of the Plymouth Colony. Easy to read, and hard to put down. Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I could not put it down. I wish more books about history were written as interestingly as Nathaniel Philbrick wrote this book."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I purchased this non-fiction title soon after reading the author's In the Heart of the Sea. I found his research and presentation of little known history to be enlightening and educational. The topic of this work, while more mainstream, is nevertheless mired in myth and misinformation. The details of early New England colonization, Native American relations and conflict are not commonly known. In that respect, I found this work to be well worth the time.The history is roughly evenly divided between the struggles faced by the early Pilgrims and Puritans and the conflict which ensued, culminating in King Philip's War, named after the relatively minor local sachem that sparked the rebellion. Not surprisingly, the author paints the Native American tribes as sympathetic figures, and in many cases rightly so. However, it is likely easy for him to do so in his heated study, well sated by a good meal, safe and secure in his person and possessions. The early American settlers were not so lucky.It is a common misconception to view the local inhabitants as a homogenous, cohesive unit, when in fact they were split between dozens of tribes, some friendly, others not so much. As the story reveals, many Native Americans switched their loyalties repeatedly, making trust a major issue. It is beyond dispute that the American settlers and their subsequent generations badly mistreated the Native Americans, however it is nave to suggest that, given greater understanding and empathy, the two sides might have peacefully coexisted. The clash of cultures, lifestyles and beliefs, coupled with the increasing flood of new immigrants made the ultimate result inevitable.All in all, a good accurate history lesson on a topic, though familiar in the broadest sense, not so much as it relates to the details. And as we all know, the Devil is in the details."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Philbrick's \\"Mayflower\\" does much to exorcise the hoarfrost mythos of \\"The Pilgrims.\\" The true origins of the Mayflower cult lies not so much in the actual \\"crash-landing at Plymouth Rock,\\" as in the political need to develop a \\"Forefathers' Day\\" to justify breaking from the Imperial Sire in London. The Mayflower Compact between God and His Chosen People in the wilderness was to be the true genesis of an American Republic, consecrated on its own soil.In revising the ancient mythologies, however, Philbrick seems to be weaving into new ones: the most interesting for me, specifically, the contentious notion (p. 165) that capitalism saved the struggling little colony from \\"failed socialism\\" and set it on the path to true American prosperity. Several reviewers seem committed to this interpretation of Plymouth's success, but it's actually contradicted by the body of the book, to wit:The private plots were assigned to the individual households, but ownership was retained in the corporate body. There was usufruct, but no individual proprietorship, no \\"real estate market\\" of true capitalism, and no idle class living off of hired labor. While the families could keep their produce and provide their own \\"social welfare,\\" William Bradford's account shows what an uphill battle it was, with the entire family having to pitch in to make the new system go. Dragging the little ones into the fields shows the exploitation of child labor for private profit has deep roots indeed. This was the true beginning of capitalism in Plymouth, and how long the wives \\"went willingly into the field,\\" along with their double duty in the house, is left to conjecture. One also suspects the turn toward individuation was provoked as much by the dissension between Saints and Strangers, the latter not part of the Compact and chafing at its collective restrictions.But even this did not save Plymouth Plantation. The dynamic merchants and traders of Massachussetts Bay gave it the taste of the \\"real power of capitalism\\" by absorbing it lock, stock, and covenant. (I can't resist the German analogy.) The burgeoning expansion of Puritan commerce led directly to wars of genocide and conquest against the surrounding native people - Thanksgiving was now a matter of blessing swords than the fruits of plowshares. \\"By doing their best to destroy the Native people who had welcomed and sustained their forefathers,\\" Philbrick truly writes on p. 346, \\"New Englanders had destroyed their forefathers' way of life.\\" The year of unification of M.B. with Plymouth in 1692 also marked the first North American witch hunt. Perhaps here, and not at the ragged shards of Plymouth Rock, is found the true genesis of the American Republic."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"You've no doubt heard the old chestnut: \\"The Pilgrim Fathers fell on their knees and then fell on the aborigines.\\" As Philbrick's absorbing history of the relationship between the Plymouth Colony and the Native Americans from 1620 to 1676 demonstrates, the truth was considerably more complicated than that. Taking advantage of new documentation of Native American life in New England, Philbrick treats the colonists and the natives with admirable even-handedness, avoiding falling into either the \\"traditional triumphalist narrative\\" or the politically correct modern version. The story he tells is one of a slowly-developing tragedy, in which the reasonably cordial entente between the Mayflower Pilgrims and the Indians fell to pieces upon the accession of the following generation. Greed for land and Native American rivalries proved to be the kindling for King Philip's War, a regional conflict which ranks among America's bloodiest on a per-capita basis. It has been argued that the devastation and chaos let loose by this struggle and other low-profile, high-intensity colonial wars of the time persuaded Great Britain to assume much tighter control over its American colonies, leading to \\"the end of American independence,\\" at least for a century or so. After reading about the human and environmental costs of King Philip's War, I can certainly see the logic in this line of thinking.MAYFLOWER is apparently becoming a popular choice for assigned readings in high-school history classes. I welcome this, because I honestly don't think that Philbrick has any agenda to peddle. It was gratifying to read a description of \\"The First Thanksgiving\\" that, while clearing up some of the misconceptions as to the exact nature of the affair, isn't afraid to point out that a number of the well-worn cliches about this event do, in fact, have a basis in reality. The first generation of Pilgrims, despite occasional missteps, did keep the peace with the natives for several decades and maintained reasonably good relations with local tribes. As often happens, however, those who came after them profited from the earlier generation's labors without absorbing enough of its wisdom."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Probably the best book ever written regarding the Pilgrims and their impact on 17th century Plymouth and Massachusetts Colonies. Riveting account of the story we thought we all knew. Book is exhaustively researched for facts dating to the Pilgrims beginnings, their early ideas and why they were motivated to embark on such a dangerous life-changing journey. Philbrick explains in detail the Pilgrims (and \\"Strangers\\") early encounters with Native Americans and how these encounters led to King Philip's War. A war that most American know very little about. This book is difficult to put down. Very well written and fascinating portrayal of these amazing risk-taker's lives and how their early decisions helped shape American's manifest destiny later. Philbrick hits a home run with this fascinating very readable account. Wow."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"\\"Mayflower\\" is the story, not just of a ship and the Pilgrims who sailed on it, but of a Pilgrim people, those who followed them, the Natives with whom they met and interacted and the process they initiated that would mold America for centuries to come.Author Nathaniel Philbrick tells the story of The Pilgrims and the \\"Strangers\\" who traveled with them to the New World, the Pilgrims in search of religious freedom and the \\"Strangers\\", the non-Pilgrim passengers of the Mayflower, who came looking for merely a new world in which to live. The life they found was cruel, brutish and short. Most of the immigrants, both the initial and subsequent waves, died in a relatively short time. Their salvation was cooperation with Indians who befriended them, taught them how to cope in their new environment and used them for their own purposes. Far from the noble natives of legend, those who allied with the English, who populated the original Plimouth Plantation that grew into the Massachusetts Bay Colony, looked on their interaction as an alliance intended to give them advantages over competing Indian tribes. Eventually the English-Indian intercourse would create a society not quite English and not quite Indian, but a Middle Ground in which each culture would blend into something unique to that place and time.Much of \\"Mayflower\\" is devoted to an exposition of King Phillip's War, an Colonial-Indian war of 1675-1678 in which the English were drawn into Native warfare by entangling alliances which forced them to aid the tribes whom they had befriended. Although little known today, Philbrick points out that, in terms of percentage of the population killed and property destroyed, it was much more devastating to the European-American states that would inhabit America than any subsequent war.In focusing on the first fifty years of English settlement in North America, this book points out how our nation started on a course of interaction with native cultures that would persist as we conquered the West and may still be with us today. From Massachusetts Bay forward, Euro and Native Americans would use each other for their own purposes, for good and ill. The story of the Pilgrims and Massachusetts Bay would play out whenever advanced cultures would meet less advanced ones, whether in America, The Philippines, Vietnam and, perhaps, even in Afghanistan.Although the names and the story line are hard to follow because we are so unfamiliar with them, this is an important book to read and understand because it shows how the tree of American history was bent as a twig and grew along the same angle. Whether you are a student of early New England colonial history or American history in general, \\"Mayflower\\" fills an important niche in the American Saga."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I greatly enjoyed Mayflower. The story of the original Pilgrims is fascinating, but the story of the next generations, and their war with the Indian leader, King Phillip, was a revelation. I followed this book with some supplemental reading that I would also like to recommend (both free to Kindle users):Narrative of the Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson--Rowlandson's story of her survival after her home and family are attacked by Indians, and her months of captivity. This story is one of the subplots of Philbrick's history, so it was very interesting to read this \\"first American best seller\\" in Rowlandson's own words.Bradford's History of 'Plimoth Plantation' From the Original Manuscript. With a Report of the Proceedings Incident to the Return of the Manuscript to Massachusetts. Bradford was the first leader of the Plymoth colony. I didn't read much Bradford's diary itself, but I did read all of the introductory material consisting of letters and political speeches celebrating the re-patriation (in the1890's) of this once \\"lost\\" work many years after it was found in England (1850's)."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This book is very informative about a time in history that we take for granted.We know so little about a period that formed our country.

Fascinating research and insight into personalities and the roles of leaders and followers."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect from 'Mayflower'. It had been rated as one of the best books of the year by a number of book sellers, but sometimes reading an historical novel can be quite dry and boring- who knew it could be this interesting!To begin with, I am certain so much of what is written in this book is unknown to most people. The story of the Pilgrims has become so commonplace and hackneyed that I don't think many of us even realize what the Pilgrims were really trying to accomplish by immigrating to North America. This book puts to rest any misconceptions, romantic notions or misperceptions about this group of people called the Pilgrims. It attests to the brutal nature of the world during that time and the sometimes-horrible things a people must do to survive. The fact that any of the Pilgrims actually lived through their first few winters on this continent is truly amazing and speaks to their strong stock.'Mayflower' begins by documenting the decisions faced by these people in England to start their lives over again in a totally different \\"world\\". Freedom of religion was their most overriding reason for wanting to begin anew. They needed a place to live and worship free from persecution. The horrific voyage and their landing on the North American shore are all laid out very vividly, and there are side stories and anecdotes about the people and their families, making it possible to have a real connection to the story. In writing about the Native American tribes in the area surrounding Plymouth Colony, it is obvious Nathaniel Philbrick has done his homework. He speaks in excruciating detail about these tribes, their leaders and particularly about their wartime strategies and nomadic ways. In addition, the relationship between the Pilgrims and the natives was so adversarial, it belies the tradition we know of the \\"Thanksgiving Meal\\". I also think most people do not realize that the Pilgrims abused their relationship with the natives and took advantage of them. It certainly shocked me, and I found myself thinking they were bloody thugs, not the cute little stovepipe hat/golden buckle wearing saints they are often depicted as. 'Mayflower' is not glamorous or enchanting, nor is it a homey and heartwarming story, it's a gritty, harrowing, bloody, real-world view of a group of people who had a hand in developing a country known as the United States of America."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"A story of the untold trials and tribulations of the Pilgrims - so much better than fiction. This wasn't a peaceful settlement. Philbrick brings the story and charaters alive - like his other books."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Well written, well researched. So much that went on then looks like today. Only names, places and weapons are different. This is a good honest look at our beginning. I highly recommend it for those who have an interest in history without distortion. Good book!!"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"For the historically challenged (like me), Philbrick's story of those who voyaged on the Mayflower, where, when, why and how, is surprisingly reader-friendly. The brave men and women who settled in or near Plymouth Colony from the early 1600's until the end of the 14-month long King Phillip's War, which ended in 1676, and survived, defied the odds. During the war, \\"Plymouth Colony lost 8 percent of its men\\" and \\"the Native American population of southern New England had sustained a loss of somewhere between 60 and 80 percent.\\" Related facts confirm the settlers' high death rate; in, \\"Jamestown, founded in 1607...[d]uring the first year, 70 of 108 settlers had died...the following winter...440 of 500 settlers were buried in just six months...,\\" additionally, for three years beginning in 1619, \\"the Virginia Company would send close to 3,600 settlers...3,000 would die.\\" Fallacies dispelled include the idealized picture in many of our minds of the Pilgrims' first Thanksgiving. We see a long table (many probably sat on the ground); neatly placed utensils (they \\"ate with their fingers and their knives\\"); and special foods like pumpkin pie, cranberry sauce (they grew neither crop) and turkey (true, but additionally, ducks, and deer). Another, the supposed arrival of the Pilgrims at that famous hunk of rock in Plymouth (I've seen it), which was set in motion in 1741 through the words of \\"ninety-five-year-old Thomas Faunce,\\" who \\"proclaimed that he had been told by his father, who had arrived in Plymouth in 1623, that the boulder was where the Pilgrims first landed.\\" King Philip, one of the instigators of the war which bears his name, was actually an Indian sachem (chief). For many years (I was surprised to learn) Native Americans and English settlers lived relatively harmoniously. Additionally, although faced with many hardships, the passengers of the Mayflower were an amazingly hearty bunch. It was estimated in 2002 that \\"there were approximately 35 million descendants of Mayflower passengers in the United States.\\" The story of the major events affecting the English settlers and Native Americans from the early 1600's to the end of King Phillip's War, facts about the leaders of each, their actions both in support of and in opposition to each other, as well as the details of their skirmishes, make this a great reader-friendly source of information about those who settled in or near Plymouth Colony."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"As a kid I heard all the great and wonderful Mayflower stories - as I grew up and began to realize, in bits and pieces, that there was much more to the great epic story of the Mayflower occupants and the Native Americans. But, all I did get were bits and pieces from various history teachers and my own spotty research. This book puts it all together and gives the reader a \\"view from the balcony,\\" a perspective that brings that piece of American history into a realistic tone. If you like to get lots of detail and also like to have all the references to look up later, this is the book for you. A great book for the airport, as you wait for that delayed flight."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"The Mayflower provides an interesting look at one of the most interesting times in American History. While the discussion of the overseas voyage and early colonization is interesting the second half of the book is where the real action lies. The description of King Philips war and Indian relations is fascinating and shows an excellent template for the future of American history. Philbrick even handily deals with all of the actors involved and provides a very interesting viewpoint for further reading. If you know nothing about this time period as I did when I read this it is an excellent book to start with."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Nathanial Philbrick's \\"Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War\\" is a gift. The years of dedicated research to the subject must have been exhausting. Philbrick has not re-written the history of the Mayflower and early American New England, but cut a huge corrective thwath of reality directly through the middle of it. In every chapter, I was amazed at how much detail Philbrick had been able to uncover about events that took place 330 to 380 years ago. Like so many others who read this book, what I did not know about the subject amazed me.This book is one of those that leave you believing that you can trust it. Its a resetting of the press so that if the world lost every important document written about the Mayflower and the colony at Plymouth, the lessons and events could be found securely resting where Mr. Philbrick set them down again."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Nathaniel Philbrick (like David McCullough and Stephen Ambrose) writes history beautifully, making it a pleasure to read.

There are many lessons to be learned for the contemporary world, and many eyes will be opened by this thorough and forthright account. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This book is a stunning example of historical research and a gripping story of the early decades of settlement in New England and the daily lives and struggles of both the native population and the white pilgrims. Sensational!"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"It sounds a lot like current events. A group of refugees, fleeing from their homeland in a leaking boat, arrive in America. They are initially welcomed by the local population (Native Americans in this case), overcome various adversities, and end up in conflict with the original residents as they compete for available resources. People complaining about immigrants should read some of their own history.I bought this book to read about some of my ancestors (William Bradford, Richard Warren, John Howland, and possibly others) who were on the Mayflower. The book provides an interesting and detailed account, from their original problems in Europe to the end of King Philip's War when they killed or enslaved the Native Americans whom they displaced.I was already familiar with the general details, but the author provides a well written account of events."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"A real page turner--how does a religious group band with a group of entrepreneurs and enter a world they have very little information on? Think Star Trek on steroids--only this story really happened!This isn't the usual historical story--the drama of being near starvation, depending on a Native that turns out to be playing you like a fiddle, getting flak from the people back in England is gripping. I kept asking, what would I do in this situation?Philbrick's writing and research blows away many of our myths about the Pilgrims and the Natives. For instance, Europeans sent a weapon of mass destruction (disease to which Natives had no immunity) just prior to the Pilgrim's arrival. Entire villages were wiped out. Squanto, who helps the Pilgrims, plays upon this fear with the Natives.When survival is at stake, what happens to our best intentions? While some here that have said the Pilgrims had a failed experiment in socialism (collective farming), the Natives used collective farming successfully. Also, the Pilgrims did not learn how to fish, in spite of an abundance of this food source. Was it their prevailing cultures that prevented both Natives and Pilgrims from seeing better solutions? The Pilgrims especially had numerous blind spots. But how does one recognize blind spots, when there's very few whom you can trust that know the territory? As the newcomers, could they have done more to build trust among the Natives?Philbrick invites the reader to imagine different outcomes if the players had made different decisions--which makes the story even more compelling.What is utterly amazing is that this story happened at all, given the obstacles everyone was trying to overcome. I came away with enormous respect for a number of characters, even though I disagreed with their actions, I understood what was driving them.If you have limited time, read the first half of the book, describing the first generation settlers. You won't think of Thanksgiving the same way again!"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Many of the reviews (the 1-, 2- and 3-star reviews in particular) criticize the author for (a) poor choice of book title, (b) shoddy history, (c) boring prose. The mixed reviews on this prevented me from purchasing Mayflower for quite some time, until curiosity got the better of me.While little can be said about whether a book is boring or not (to each his own), I'd advise those lamenting the book's title to start reading labels - it was very clear on the back cover (you didn't even need to crack the book) what this story was about. Similarly, to those self-proclaimed historians - get out of the pop-history aisle and start buying textbooks. Nowhere does Philbrick claim to be a professional historian; he is a writer and journalist, and having recently finished Mayflower I feel that his 2007 Pulitzer nomination was well-deserved... Mayflower is a crackin' good read.In the prologue Philbrick makes it clear that he uses not only standard sources for his story, but also oral history & traditions from the Native Americans of the region in an attempt to tell a balanced story of the first settlers in Plymouth, their struggles, their successes and failures, and the ultimate unravelling of what had been delicately created through the bias and shortsightedness of subsequent generations culminating in \\"King Phillip's War\\". This bias and shortsightedness can be claimed by both sides, although Philbrick levels a larger portion at the English/Pilgrims/Puritans - choose your label - and, for my money, he backs it up nicely. What makes Puritan culpability more believable is that we see the same mistakes being made today by arguably better educated and more world-wise governments.Mayflower isn't all roses. I would like to have seen Philbrick spend a little more time on some of the better known aspects of the Pilgrim national myth - the time in England and Holland, the first Thanksgiving, etc. - but the story doesn't suffer for it. In fact, I would have welcomed another 50 pages, or so, in such a well-written book.All said, I found Mayflower to be a great read - exposing time-honored myths in a believable way that does not diminish the accomplishments of the passengers of that ship one iota. Removing the romantic patina that's built up over the years allows us to appreciate the story more - warts and all.Maybe we can even learn something from this..."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Mayflower, a historical novel by Nathaniel Philbrick, documents a time of American history that is often hidden behind myth, legend and political correctness.Mayflower first tells the story of the earliest Pilgrims to come to the New World and then lays out the history of the English-Indian wars fought by the Pilgrims' descendants. Philbrick's description of the early Americans is as compelling as it is accurate - fairly portraying the early settlers and their quest for survival and then for settlement.I appreciated Mayflower for its evenhanded portrayal of the early Pilgrims and the Native Americans they befriended. In a day of increasing political correctness, most Americans tend to one of two extremes when thinking about the Pilgrims. Some mythologize and glorify the Pilgrims and their motives. Others demonize them for disrupting the \\"peaceful\\" life of the American Indians.The truth lies somewhere between these two extremes. Philbrick does not shy away from the religiosity of the early settlers. Neither does he shy away from the deceptive craftiness of some of the later Indians. He criticizes the actions of Pilgrims and Indians alike, weaving into his narrative fascinating stories of unity, betrayal, and community.Most American history focuses on the 1700's and the quest for American independence. Mayflower goes back even further, telling the story of the American forefathers' ancestors and the early American settlements. What is perhaps most fascinating about Philbrick's account is how the debates over religion and national identity in the U.S. today were already present on the Mayflower. From the beginning, the Pilgrims included religious and non-religious in their midst - and the debate over what kind of society should emerge was just as controversial then as now.Pick up Mayflower. Read the story of courage, community, and war. Learn about the earliest Americans. Trust me - you won't be able to put the book down."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Philbrick has done a wonderful job here of telling the story of Plymouth colony in such great detail, truly bringing to life these men (and some women) from nearly 400 years ago.The book covers the planning stages of the Mayflower voyage and goes through King Philip's War. Most of the book focuses on the first year and the war, and the details and storytelling are amazing. And Philbrick does a great job of describing the erosion of the relationship between the colonists and the Indians, even as he goes through the years between 1622 and 1675 rather quickly.The book is entitled \\"Mayflower,\\" but the latter part of the book significantly broadens the scope, as it delves into details from throughout Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. Most of that information is relevant to the story, but at times it seemed that, late in the book, Plymouth was just a part of the story instead of the focus.That's just nitpicking what was certainly a fabulous book. I was truly amazed at how in-depth that story could be told and I believe it is a book that would appeal to more than just the history buff.

Mayflower is a thoroughly enjoyable and illuminating history of Plymouth Colony. Knowing very little about pre-Indepenence American history wasn't an issue, the book is generally very easy to follow.

The negative reviews given to this book do not portray the truth. Philbrick neither \\"scalps\\" the Pilgrims, nor has a bias in favor of the Native Americans. All throughout the book, he has a very balanced and insightful approach to what happened some 390 years ago. He has a God given gift to tell a superb story and the details of the accounts he is giving just shows the amount of hard work he has put in this book. Philbrick should be applauded for his work and everyone interested in how this great nation started MUST read this book, leaving THEIR biases aside.

But their lives went from bad to worse and stayed that way for a very long time. I thought Plimoth was a long established settlement only to read that it lasted for approximately six years and then all were gone either to the wilderness or in search of new land that they could own as their own. Their is no Plymouth Rock except in the eyes of the tourist community. In fact it was supposidly lost for decades only to be miraculously rediscovered. Rocks don't disappear of the Plymouth magnitude. And over 39 million people today can chart their decendacy back to the original Mayflower survivors. All 53 of them as a matter of fact.The desperation of the native Americans and the total dependency the Mayflower travelers had with the indians was a wonderful yet tragic story in the end as I write today. Also, the History Channel DVD on the Voyage of the Mayflower is a must see for all. Read the book first, then view the DVD. And its author, Nathaniel Philbrick has written with such authenticity, compassion and brilliance. I recommend you read each and every book that Philbrick has ever penned. Remember the Mayflower at your next Thanksgiving celebration. Because nowhere in recorded history is a Thanksgiving Day celebration ever enjoyed by the pilgrims or the indians. In fact Thanksgiving Day was invented in 1949 probably by the grocery and the turkey growers association. And if you get a chance, invite an indian over to celebrate with you. Be a real Pilgrim!"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Historical account of the Mayflower pilgrims, their immediate descendents and their double-edged interactions with the Native Americans over 3 generations. There is no villain in the account-just an accumulation of human frailty in the face of survival and division."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This is a very well researched history of the Plymouth settlements and the tragic years of hardship those early people endured. It is a bit difficult to become immursed in this material as it deals with such a long ingnored and almost forgotten historage. That indeed, makes it worth reading just to bring things up to date and kill certain notions like there really was supposed to be a Plymouth Rock.The book has an exceptional way of dissecting certain settlements in New England with the early tribes that inhabibted them, and thus, presents a consistant history spanning nearly 100 years since the Pilgrims landed. Miles Standish, amongst others are revealed, including an excellent chapter telling of the very first Thanksgiving. This is exexmplary historical writing, entertaining and very worthwhile. However, should the reader wish to discover this author's truly greatest talents, please read his spellbinding \\"In the Heart Of The Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex\\" This is the greatest true sea adventure ever written and not to be missed by seaworthy fans."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Like a fast-paced thriller, Nathaniel Philbrick tells the engrossing story of the Mayflower's voyage from Holland to Cape Cod, and the years that followed. Filled with misery, danger, and terror, much of his book is devoted to the first year that the English Pilgrims spent in inhospitable Plymouth. With treachery on both sides, the Pilgrim's interactions with Native Americans are captured with realism. His accounts of day-by-day history are extracted from letters written by those who were there. The result is a historical book that reads like a good fiction page-turner.Imagine landing on a foreign shore with little food and no one there to meet you -- and with no supermarket, pharmacy or LL Bean to turn to. Cold, wet, and frightened, the spirits of the weak, which accounted for almost half, gave up the ghost and died in the first year. Those who survived were reinforced by others who arrived from England. Together, the growing horde of settlers swindled or purchased land from the Indians at cheap prices. They pushed the Native Americans westward until the Indians fought back in what is known as the War of King Philip.Mayflower is an interesting historical story of the colonization of northeastern United States. It is an easy reading five star book which recommended itself as a great story and good history."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I love to read books that fill out my understanding of a word or concept from history that has become an entity unto itself. Philbrick's \\"Mayflower\\" is exactly that kind of book.Starting with the charming, quaint and inherently shallow idea most Americans have of the Mayflower and the Pilgrims, Philbrick expands the story and tells it as a historian. You come to know the good aspects of the Pilgrims -- the first generation enjoyed decades of good relations with the Native Americans; the misconstrued -- the Pilgrims weren't so much proponents of religious freedom as they were militants about their way of practicing religion; and the bad -- the second generation of Pilgrims go into an incredibly bloody conflict with Native Americans of the region.Likewise, Philbricks turns a pretty bright light on the realities of Native American culture of the seventeenth century. While a lot of what we perceive turns out to be true, some of our notions don't hold up so well. While the Native Americans had less holistic wars than the Europeans, they had plenty of inter-tribal conflicts before contact with Europe. The Native Americans also come off as pretty willing and well-informed participants in land sales to the Europeans as well. Further, tribal leaders often look manipulative and conniving. All in all, they come off looking as human as any of us would without any help from the Europeans.Well written and eye-opening. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"As a non-American, this book was a very welcome addition to my understanding of the place the voyage of the Mayflower and the Pilgrim Fathers play in American history.The story of the the Pilgrim settlement of New England, and the accompanying dispossession of the Indians, does not make for comfortable reading. It serves though as a reminder that reality is always more complicated than popular belief.Philbrick writes well: he provides enough detail to satisfy those of us who want some factual basis behind analysis without losing those of us who are not academic historians.I recommend this book highly, especially to those of us who seek more knowledge about early English settlement of North America.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Finally, the Pilgrims get their day. Nathaniel Philbrick's new history Mayflower redeems the Pilgrims from the two fictions that have obscured their history. No longer are the Pilgrims just the iconic celebrators of the first Thanksgiving, nor are they the genocide-committing killers of Native Americans. Instead, Philbrick tells the more complex story that begins with the arrival of the Separatists at Provincetown on Cape Cod (yes, Plymouth was their second stop) and ends with King Philip's War and Plymouth Colony's absorption into the Massachusetts Bay Colony.For fifty years, the Pilgrims and the American Indians lived in relative peace thanks to two leaders, Pilgrim governor William Bradford and Pokanoket sachem Massasoit. Establishing a treaty of mutual defense and peace, Bradford and Massasoit find a way to overcome their distrust and help their own people through trade and solidarity. Though the machinations of Squanto and the violence Miles Standish brought the Pilgrims and the Indians came close to war but Bradford and Massasoit held their followers in check.When Massasoit's son Philip becomes sachem of his people after the death of his older brother Alexander, whose death Philip blames on the Pilgrims, war can only be held at bay for so long. In the summer of 1675, Philip loses control of events and his warriors, and the imbroglio that bares his name begins. Fourteen months later, Philip would be dead and the relationship between colonists and Indians that Bradford and Massasoit worked so diligently to maintain was destroyed forever.Mayflower has everything a popular history should, scholarly research, the liberal use of primary source quotations, and superb story telling. Philbrick's makes a page-turner out of what lesser writers and scholars would turn into a soporific tale no one wants to read. Instead, Mayflower continues to sit atop the New York Times' bestseller list. By focusing on the stories that participants like Benjamin Church and Mary Rowlandson left behind, as well as native oral tradition, Philbrick makes history something more than the stuff of tweed-coated academics.Most important of all, there is no agenda here but to tell the honest truth of history. Every New Englander, every American should read this book to celebrate what was and what could have been and to mourn the same."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"The reviews that say the title is misleading are correct. This book chronicles the Pilgrims from England to Holland and then to America on the Mayflower. The longer portion of the book, however, chronicles the new colony through King Phillip's War - which embroiled the children and grandchildren of the Mayflower's passengers.The misnomer does not take away from the book. It is a terrific history of the Pilgrims and especially the unique relationship the earliest New Englanders had with the Indians.Best of all, it is an even-handed description of that relationship and the particiapants. I strongly disagree with those who said that Mr. Philbrick had an agenda. He was hyper-critical of both Puritans and Indians, especially King Phillip himself, who allowed King Phillip's War to occur. He added some terrific insights of the long-range implications of that war as well. Mr. Philbrick called a spade a spade - there were good men and incompetent egomaniacs on both sides, white and Indian. Anyone who read his derisive descriptions of King Phillip's propensity to cut and run in everry battle could not say he favored the Indians to the English.Best about this book are the unique perspectives. I thought I knew quite a bit about Plymouth. However, due to Mr. Philbrick's different ways of looking at the colony, he divulged much that is not commonly known. In the first part of the book, where he tracks the emigration from Europe, he gives good insight into the people on the Mayflower, both Pilgrim and \\"stranger\\". He continues with a good look at their views on the colony including religion, their role in their new society and the economics of the community. He then, for the larger remainder of the book, looks at the Plymouth colonists through their relationship with the native Indians. After reading this book, it is easy to see that although King Phillip's War was one of America's least known wars, it had a tremendous far-reaching effects on America. The ratio of casualties to total population alone is staggering, but Mr. Philbrick shows the long range effects through more than mere statistics.This is by no means a politically correct book. It is even-handed and enlightening. Best of all, it is a very readable history of Plymouth and southern New England's earliest years."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Some day I will learn that I don't like popular narrative histories. Mayflower is no exception. But it is not all my fault.First off, I am to blame for having expectations. I thought Mayflower would be an easy reading general history of the Pilgrims and the foundation of the Plymouth Colony. It was, for about 1/3 of the book. It was so general that I don't think I learned anything. Little attention is paid to the how's and why's of the Pilgrims departure from England. It is explained that they didn't like the formal Church of England so they left. Okay, that's a bit to broad for me. Little detail is provided about who the individuals were- only a few people get any attention. Once the colony is established all military activity is attributed to Miles Standish. Little biographical information is given about him and no primary sources are quoted so I can only assume his motives are the author's conjecture.The narrative itself focuses mostly on the Indians who are portrayed in greater detail but in a confusing manner. The final 1/3 of the book focuses on King Philip's War- fought 50+ years after the founding of Plymouth. The section/chapter transitions seem like they were written by an editor not the author as they contain rather clich&eacute; \`cliffhanger' foreshadowings. So on this score it had little to do with my expectations and more to do with the style- which I did not like.As to the books broadness the author speaks of military technology in the colony as having moved passed that of Europe. Specifically he talks about various types of muskets: the flintlock, snaplock and matchlock varieties. But at no point does he explain what those are, how they differ, or why one is better suited to Indian fighter vs. fighting a European style army. This kind of thing is typical throughout the book. The author tell us one paragraph of the great abundance of fish, whales, birds, deer, shellfish etc. in the area of Plymouth and in the next paragraph tells us how the Pilgrims are starving. He does little to explain how or why they were unable to take advantage of the natural resources or why they came so unprepared.This book would have been better named \\"Plymouth\\" as it tries to be a general history of that colony. However in that regard it is not a good history, even a general one. Mayflower spends far more time talking about the machinations and motivations of the various Indian tribes. Even for a popular history it is surprisingly light on detail. I have not read Mr. Philbrick's other works but Mayflower does little to recommend them."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"First and foremost, I thoroughly enjoyed reading Philbrick's book Mayflower. I planned to read 10-20 pages each night, but ended up reading 20-50 pages each night and was always tempted to read more. It covered a lot of information and made history interesting and readable. I put it on par with Price's Love & Hate In Jamestown in that respect.I would have given this book 5 stars except for 3 issues.1) The name and cover gave me a feeling that the author would cover more depth in regards to the actual voyage rather than founding of Plymouth than the history that follows over the next 150 years. I was, and still am, interested in a more detailed book about the preparations, expectations, and the actual voyage. There was some nice details and facts, and plenty of information that I had never heard but I still wanted more. Once I accepted that this book was covering much more time and less details, I enjoyed it immensely.2) I liked that the author included many tribes and a lot of characters (both English and Native). I have a nice list of people I'd like to read more about at a later time. However, there were times I would get confused as who was involved in a particular paragraph (causing me to reread them). A list of the tribes, sachems, key indians, and key english persons along with a brief description/location/association would have been a huge reference for me.3) The number of pages is deceptive. Over 100 of the final pages are Notes, Bibliography, and Index. That is 100 out of the 462 total pages. Some notes are interesting, but they read like a mix of bibliography and notes the author thought about including (which is much different than the main book reads). I read the 50 pages of notes, but was much less interested than reading the main book.A simplistic breakdown goes about like this:200 pages about Early History of Plymouth150 pages for King Philip's War100 pages for Notes, Bibliography, IndexI should reiterate that I enjoyed reading this book. If you are interested in more detail about Plymouth (including the darker sides of our own history) than the shallow learnings we gained in school, then I would strongly recommend this book and it's apparent that many others found it's content worthwhile."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Nethaniel Philbrick's narrative is an enjoyable, easily readable slice of our history that is far too often over-looked. Most of us remember dressing up as Pilgrams in our grade school Thanksgiving plays in which Native Americans and Pilgrams were depicted in a utopian spirit of cooperation. As the author rightly points out, we have the tendency in our study of American history to simply fast foraward to the Revolutionary period, missing out on this exciting period of courage, faith, discovery and yes, also of treachery and anhilation.Mr. Philbrick masterfully tells us of the Pilgrims and their excrutiating voyage, the famous landing, and then the establishment of Plymouth Colony. He describes their epic struggles, the long and bitter New England winters, and the tremendous faith that helped them through their tribulations. But Mr. Philbrook also tells the story of the Native Americans of this same region - how they helped the Pilrims survive those horrific early winters, and then ultimately how they were pushed into war with their new neighbors.For the most part, the author take a very balanced approach in his narrative. All points of view are even-handedly examined, both from the Pilgrim and Native points of view. Neither side is demonized, nor are they anointed as saintly benefactors. The book includes the period of King Philip's War, which obviously is a pre-curser to the French and Indian War and ultimately with repurcusions all the way to the American Revolution.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"When we think of the Pilgrims, it's Thanksgiving that comes to mind --- placid people with big buckles on their shoes, dining once a year with two or three Indians. Nathaniel Philbrick's new book shows the Pilgrims to have been anything but placid. He tells us what the Mayflower passengers experienced, and then shows how the next generation coped with the world they had created. This easily could have been two books; but taken together, the two generations show how quickly our national character developed.The Pilgrims were religious fanatics, fleeing the persecution of the Anglicans, squashed into a boat with non-believers and forced to get along. Their single-mindedness worked against them as they made their preparations. For instance, they were so sure of God's goodwill that they didn't even bother to bring a map. They had no idea that winter in New England is much, much colder than in Europe, and saw no danger in arriving in November with no food. Cape Cod, where Plymouth Rock is located, is one of the most fertile fishing grounds in the world, yet none of the Pilgrims knew how to fish and starvation was a real concern. Half of the Pilgrims died the first year and the rest depended on the local tribes, in particular the Pokanokets under the sachem Massasoit, who showed them how to live.Unfortunately, the Pilgrims' gratitude was short-lived and the next generation was unable to maintain cordial relations with the tribes, who had problems of their own. They were far from a unified group; the Pilgrims arrived in a land already in the throes of dissent. Worse yet, small pox had decimated the tribes; it was not unusual for the Pilgrims to stumble over settlements where everyone had died.The tribes had to find a way to live with drastically reduced numbers, and the Pilgrims had to find a way to make money in order to satisfy the impatient investors who had financed their voyage. They resorted to any means necessary, including enslavement, to get the tribes' land and their greed resulted in King Philip's War, named for a son of Massasoit, the sachem who welcomed the Mayflower's passengers. King Philip's War lasted only 14 months, but by the end, a third of the Europeans' early towns had been burned to the ground and 5,000 people had been killed. There were only 70,000 people in all of New England, Europeans and Native Americans combined, making King Philip's War twice as deadly as the American Civil War.A visit to Cape Cod today reveals very little hint of the gory battles that transpired. MAYFLOWER reminds Americans of our rocky early history and how easily the national development we take for granted could have gone another way.--- Reviewed by Colleen Quinn (CQuinn9368@yahoo.com)"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"First, specific to the kindle version is that the maps are essentially unreadable. This is disappointing for somebody not familiar with the region around Plymouth and Northeast. Also, it would have been nice to get a map overview of the various Indian tribes featured in the book.This book is a nice history of the Pilgrim's early settlement and King Philips War, while the story of the Mayflower itself is only a small portion of the book. The narrative seems a bit too detailed on what the historical figures are thinking, that they smirked during a particular moment, how the scampered across a particluar creek, etc. Where does the author get this information? It probably would have seemed a bit more credibile had Philbrick mentioned sources in the body, and mention where events or emotions are inferred, rather than tell the story and provide a long list of sources at the end. You find yourself thinking \\"how could he possibly have known that Benjamin Church was thinking that at the time?\\".There is also a subtle anti-Pilgrim, anti-religion bias. While Pilgrims who were captured by Indians and forced to work are referred to as \\"captives\\", Philbrick describes Indians in the reverse situation \\"slaves\\". He details the inhumanity of Pilgrim war methods, executions, and torture, while glossing over equivalent Indian atrocities. Using the term \\"bigot\\" and \\"racist\\" in some instances to describe Pilgrims and Puritans, but not Indians, seems odd given King Philip's goal of a pan-Indian war against the English to eliminate them from the continent. A focus on the Pilgrim land grab is prevalent in the book, while inter-tribe politics where Indians used Pilgrim alliances as tools to gain advantages over other tribes deserves a bit more attention. All players were angling for some advantage, as to be expected when you're in constant danger of starvation and annihalation. I suppose it's easier to vilify the Pilgrims and Puritans given the eventual outcome, but the result could easily have been Pilgrim extermination but for a few key decisions. Overall you get the feeling that he's trying too hard not to impress the reader with the Pilgrim's accomplishments.Maybe I'm disappointed in the book because I recently finished Chernow's Washington biography, which is simply one of the best I've read. At the end I recommend Mayflower for somebody interested in these events, just because there few other contemporary histories on this topic available. It would just be nice to get a more detached perspective."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"It was my first time reading Mr. Philbrick's book, and I was captivated by his writing style but mostly of learning the \\"real\\" history of Mayflower and our founding fathers.

As for King Philip's War, Jill Lepore wrote a great book about this in 1998 called \\"The Name of War: King Philip's War and the Origins of American Identity.\\" I for one was disappointed in Philbrick's book.

It shows how the second generation lacked the wisdom and depth of the first generation and how they brought on a foolish and wasteful war with the Indians in what is known as King Philip's War. It was destructive, particularly to the Indians of the area. It presents a true picture of the struggles, successes, and mistakes made by, perhaps, over zealous, but well meaning people of faith. I also study English & Irish history and the same mistakes were made by Puritans in both of those countries. Much can be learned & applied today to what these histories teach us about tolerance while still standing strong in one's beliefs and maintaining the integrity of those beliefs.

This book does several things: first of all it's interesting with good portrayals of the people, second, it integrates all the various viewpoints, narrow sections of the story into one continuous whole, and third, it presents a linear, and logical development of settlement, including the various Indian tribe conflicts. What an accomplishment!I would recommend this book especially to all New Englanders and also to those who tend to paint history in simplistic \\"good guys\\" and \\"bad guys\\" stories.

His re-telling of the Pilgrim's crossing - where I felt I was on the Mayflower - to the fear and concern of the first few weeks and months in the new world were gripping.

This was simply a terrific read, a fascinating glimpse into the events and people serving as the first bricks in our nation's foundation.Beyond the fairytale images of \\"The First Thanksgiving\\", most basic American history skips from the Mayflower's 1620 landing in Plymouth the American Revolution, glossing over the rich and brawling century-and-a-half spanning these two events. Philbrick zeroes in on the first half-century, stripping away the myth and homily typically associated with the Pilgrims and laying bare a fascinating tale of courage and deceit, of trusts forged and broken, of politics, religion, brutality, and war. All the familiar figures are there - William Bradford, Miles Standish, Pokanoket Indian chief Massoit, Squanto, and Edward Winslow, but Philbrick focuses on less celebrated figures like Benjamin Church and Massoit's son Phillip, who while hardy household names today leave behind legacies that helped shape what would become a century later the United States of America.This is a story ripe with opportunity for politically correct revisionism, but the author walks a balanced line, alternately praising and condemning the deeds and players of both the English and the Native Americans. We learn, for example, that near-starvation in the first two years had as much to do with the Pilgrim's failed experiment in socialism as it did with harsh winters and poor soil. This led Bradford to adopt a policy allowing each family to grow and hunt not for the \\"commonwealth\\", but for themselves. Thanks to Bradford's newly discovered spirit of capitalism, the colony is soon producing a surplus of food. There may be a perverse humor in the irony of contemporary images of God-fearing Pilgrims in tall hats and buckled shoes when matched with the reality of a people who would draw and quarter their enemies and display their heads on pikes. But this is no less naive than euphemistic views of New England's \\"peaceful and noble Indians\\", who in fact warred with rival tribes for centuries before the arrival of the Europeans, and showed no lack of talent or imagination for treachery, torture, and manipulation.In short, \\"Mayflower\\" is that rare historical chronicle that reads with the all intrigue and energy of well-written novel, and important expose of an overlooked period of our history with lessons as relevant today as they were three centuries ago. Well done, Mr. Philbrick."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"At 480 pages, Nathaniel Philbrick's Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War is in many ways a complete history of the Plymouth Colony. What a read though, and the pages flew by.....Mayflower is well written. Philbrick does a masterful job at breathing life into characters who have, over time, almost become larger than life. As a child who was familiar with the Plymouth story, Chief Massasoit, William Bradford, and Miles Standish seemed hero like; characters who were super human. Philbrick does a great job of making them human, and believable.Philbrick also manages to clearly tell the most often misunderstood part of the story, that of the Wampanoag tribes precarious situation when the settlers arrived. There was a first thanksgiving, and for over half a century the two cultures lived in peace. Then the world for both peoples exploded with a huge loss of life on both sides as the result. This sickening failure is held center stage in Mayflower. Philbricks wonderful descriptions of the early countryside is as realistic as anything else. I suspect that historians may find fault here and there throughout the novel, but for this reader, Mayflower is a terrific story about early America and the loss of so much promise.I put down In the Heart of the Sea to quickly read Mayflower. As with other readers I am now a hooked fan of Mr. Philbrick and cannot wait for the next book. I predict Mayflower will be a run-a-way literary and commercial success."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I enjoyed Sea of Glory by Nathaniel Philbrick, so picked up his latest, Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community and War. Mayflower is actually two books in one. The first part details the story of the Pilgrims and their establishing Plymouth Colony. The second part deals with an Indian war since named King Philip's War. Unfortunately, I enjoyed the first section much more than the second.Philbrick's account of the Pilgrims is a fascinating tale, and I'm not sure how much is new to me and how much I've just forgotten. The author starts with the Pilgrims in England and chronicles their beliefs, their escape to Holland, their grueling voyage, the establishment of Plymouth Colony and their befriending of the Pokanoket Indians and especially, their leader Massasoit. The first year was especially perilous and over 50% of the settlers died within the first six months. Some of the original colonists were not religious men (Strangers as opposed to Saints). But they quickly realized that they all had to work together to survive. One of the most remarkable achievements by the Pilgrims was the drafting of the Mayflower Compact. Before they even landed in the New World, these men recognized the need to set up a civil government in which all must agree to obey laws set up by their elected officials. Today, the Mayflower Compact is a \\"document that ranks with the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution as a seminal American text.\\" The Pilgrims are also to be admired for their ability to adapt and they were willing to try almost anything to survive. In this way, they \\"proved to be more receptive to the new ways of the New World than nearly any English settlers before or since.\\"The second half the Mayflower focuses on King Philip's War and the circumstances that led to this fight 55 years after the Mayflower landing. The Indians quickly \\"regarded expensive Western goods as an essential part of their lives.\\" At first, they traded beaver furs for these goods, until the beavers became almost extinct. Then the Indians started selling off their land. Eventually, tribes didn't have enough land to sustain their numbers. On the other hand, the English were land hungry. After a half century of \\"tenuous peace, both sides had begun to envision a future that did not include the other.\\" One facet of the war that I found interesting was the reluctance of soldiers from Plymouth and the Massachusetts Bay Colony to accept help from friendly Indians. It wasn't until they saw how successful Connecticut troops were (who engaged their friendly natives) that they finally began accepting assistance from them. This helped change the course of the war. The Indians taught them a different style of fighting (as opposed to the English method which was unsuited to New England's swamps and waterways).One aspect of Mayflower that I found particularly confusing was the dozens of Indian tribes, sub-groups of tribes, and their leaders. Philbrick mentions dozens of groups including Narragansetts, Massachusetts, Pocassets, Mohegans, Wampanogs, Pokanokets, Nipmucks, Pequots, and Nantuckets (to name just a few). He does provide a map of the tribal territories, but only for the four or five major tribes. A list of all the tribes and their sachems would have been most helpful--especially in the section about King Philip's War.Still, Mayflower has much good information and also gives lots of interesting trivia about the original colony and those people who settled there. They were a brave lot, indeed."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Superbly crafted and even fast-paced much of the way, Philbrick has turned in a great nonfiction narrative, tying together pure history with delicate, artful commentary and engaging storytelling.The first 150 or so pages bring you from Leiden to Plymouth and recount the first years of the Plymouth settlement. Philbrick's account of the story behind the pilgrimage - including a regretably brief examination of the Leiden expatriate community - are enlightening, crisp and for many I suspect, new.He leans a little too heavily on indian fighter Benjamin Church and the events surrounding King Philip's War in the second half of the book, and the narrative lags. Not only because it seems that in the martial history Philbrick finds himself, certainly not over his head, but, out of his element; but also because the war years begin to feel like a story further separated from the Mayflower/Plymouth one than Philbrick supposes or intends to show.Philbrick's research and recount are impeccable and are taken in large part from his work with the native oral history of the time. This approach informs a new understanding of the motivations and explanations for the events that transpired beginning in the early seventeenth century and continued into almost the early nineteenth.The English conquest of the New World was not only a triumph of technology, but was indeed the ascendancy of an economic system, as global capitalism and its realities and rigors began to exert themselves in an onslaught that continues through this very day. Philbrick at times seems to ignore the fact himself (he never explicitly makes the connection to the indian slave trade that he returns to on a few occasions), but his story puts the organic and momentous nature of the capital economy - and its effect on starting and controlling the events of the story - on full display.I think also that there is a glimpse of Philbrick's next work as he evinces a writer's proclivity to see elements of one motif in examining another. He repeatedly returns to the transmogrification of certain of the Pilgrim elite into a new type of uniquely American character: the frontiersman. Expect him to leave New England's briny coast for western climes soon.Overall, this is a worthwhile read, or was, even for a New Englander steeped in pre-colonial history. It is made all the more so by the enjoyment - in parts - of some of the finest nonfiction writing of anyone at work in America today."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"From an early age, I have been fascinated with American history. It has been exceedingly difficult for me, therefore, to understand why history seems to be the worst taught subject in primary-secondary schools. Social studies tend to have the poorest passing rates of the core subjects in standardized exams. Some scientific and lesser surveys find college students and many teachers unable to identify the most significant events in this nation's life. Little wonder, then that manipulative politicians so easily mislead the public into viewing current events using artificial facts and fallacious cause-effects.Nathaniel Philbrick's new history on the colony established by the Mayflower survivors is an excellent example of how history should be presented. I believe the problems with the teaching of history are the phony legends and the mindless emphasis on dates/names that students are force fed. Less important are the why's, what-ifs and consequences for the choices made by people and governments. Those are the questions that this Mayflower book seeks to address.While I may have read much about American history, I was totally unfamiliar with characters such as Benjamin Church and the Indian leader, Massasoit. Also new to me was the depth, cause and destruction of King Philip's war between the settlers and Native Americans.Church's story was particularly fascinating since he sounds so much like a character from a John Ford-John Wayne western movie. Church was the original \\"Hondo\\" who sought to know the natives and enlist their aid instead of destroying them. But, he fought with a strategic and spirited manner that won him numerous victories and respect from the colonists and Indians. It is too bad that so often true life characters seem harder to believe existed than their fictional counterparts.I wonder if we stopped teaching social studies as a means to pass a standardized test and more as a means to develop critical thinking skills, then students would have more of an appetite for the subject and hungry students would demand more on their plate than rote memorization. This would, though, mean losing our elementary need for legends of chopped cherry trees, sainted ancestors, and guiltless aboriginals. I think it is worth the effort."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This history of the Plymouth Colony is a fascinating work. It is clear from the narrative and his notes at the end of the book that Nathaniel Philbrick took the time to perform careful and thorough research of every available European and Native American source, and walked the ground to see for himself where many of the events he narrates occurred.\\"Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community and War\\" is a refreshing re-examination of the well-trodden ground of the Separatists' history as a schismatic Calvanist sect in England and Holland, and the establishment of their colony in the New World. The author then carries the narrative into less familiar territory as he explores the complex and ever-evolving relationship between the colonists and their Indian neighbors up through the aftermath of King Philip's War in the 1670's - which, if you consider the percentages of native and colonial population impacted, was the bloodiest war ever fought on American soil.The story is told with a fresh set of eyes. These people had their own unique flaws and strengths, and - despite Victorian interpretations to the contrary - didn't walk on water: Sometimes with faith, inspiration, and courage; sometimes with (to modern eyes) stunningly bad judgement, incompetence, and bigotry; they made it to the shores of Plymouth Bay and established a colony that was able to survive and even thrive. In being willing to learn-from and co-exist-with their Indian neighbors, they formed the seed for a new country: a land no longer dominated by Native Americans, but also creating a culture that was not purely European either.This book is ultimately a tragedy: what really makes it an outstanding piece of writing is that Philbrick brings to life how, for all the promise and success the colony had due to its willingness to accept the natives (in some ways) and learn from them, there were fundamental currents and societal conflicts that were never overcome. These eventually led to war, where the children of Massasoit's people and the Pilgrims clashed in an incredibly bloody, genocidal conflict that ultimately destroyed both groups' strength and pre-emininence in the region: almost entirely wiping-out the Wampanoag people, and reducing the Plymouth colony to a shadow of its former self, from which it never fully recovered.In the end, this book uniquely illustrates and celebrates how very human the Mayflower colonists, their Indian neighbors, and their descendants, were. It is a well written and well researched text: very readable, very informative, doesn't shy away from unpleasant facts, and works hard at providing a balanced narrative encompassing both the English colonists' and Native inhabitants' points of view.Anyone seeking to learn about the rich texture and complexities of life in Massachusetts in the 1600's, and the impact that these colonists and their neighbors still have on us today, is well advised to read this book."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I picked up this book with great anticipation, as it tells not only of the initial years of the founding of Plymouth but also of the following decades and King Philip's War.However, I feel a lot of detail was lost, given the scope of the book. Almost no mention of the daily life in Plymouth. Almost no discussion on how religion was involved in Plymouth's governance (and religion was the primary factor for the migration). Almost no discussion of the social structure of the Indian cultures. Also, no attempt is made to put the actions of the both sides in historical context. The author does not explain why both sides felt that their actions were justified, given the culture of the times.Such discussions would have been helpful because every time (not just occasionally) the author delves into a good juicy slice of history, it is marred by the author's personal (and modern) interpretation of the events. Moreover, the author's disgressions into opinion are not offered to help the reader interpret the facts or understand the context of the events. They are simply offered as the modern-day \\"truth,\\" of the morality of the Pilgrims. To make matters worse, the opinions are not balanced, they are almost exclusively anti-Pilgrim.However, because the author leaves out discussions of the Pilgrims' daily life, governance and religion, Indian social structure, and the cultures and viewpoints of the time, the reader is given no context in which to try to understand why the author has concluded that the Pilgrims are the only ones worthy of criticism. Without such context, the reader is left to conclude that the author's comments reflect some embarassment or an attempt to apologize for reporting what actually happened.If you can ignore the commentary, the books is otherwise a good read. It does a good job of linking two events (the founding of Plymouth and King Philip's War), which are normally treated as separate episodes in history, into one continous, evolving story. However, it would have been a better read if the author had simply stuck to the story insteading of telling the reader how to feel about it."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Nathaniel Philbrick's exhaustive history of the first 57 years of the Plymouth colony and its relationship with the Indians. (Happily, throughout the book, Philbrick makes life easier for the the reader by disdaining politically correct terms like \\"Native Americans.\\") In its turn, Philbrick's history can also be exhausting. It is so filled with detail, much of it just slightly - and thus irritatingly - extraneous, that at times reading it is something of a battle. But the journey is worth it.Philbrick takes no sides. He does not lionize the Indians; he doesn't demonize the colonists. The result, hopefully, is something near the truth. A history of a half-century which saw the original colonists essentially being saved by the Indians, who had their own political reasons for doing so, to a headstreong, ambitious Indian chief starting an unnecessary war, but a war that was welcomed by the land hungry colonists.As Philbrick puts it, \\" . . . by choosing to pursue economic prosperity at the expense of the Indians, the English put at risk everything their mothers and fathers had striven so heroically to create.\\"In all, it's an interesting story, one which is regretably not taught accurately in our schools. The Pilgrims are not necessarily the prim and proper prigs they are painted as and the Indians are far from the noble beings exploited by cruel colonists. A tad wordy, in my opinion, but overall an excellent addition to the American library.Jerry"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This book is fascinating. It deals with a subject most Americans know a little--but not much--about. We have a rather idealistic view of the Pilgrims. We know they came seeking religious freedom, founded Massachusetts, planted corn, met Squanto, had a nice Thanksgiving, and lived happily.The reality is much different, to be sure, and very interesting.They did indeed, come looking for religious freedom. And they suffered far more than most realize. So did the Indians. This book deal with both--and the eventual collapse of the initial tentative relations between the two groups.The Pilgrim/Indian balancing act was never all that good. Both sides struggled and worked for advantage. Both groups manipulated each other, and , in the end, both sides were unable to hold things together. I came away with the impression that it was doomed to failure from the start. And it probably was.Some of the characters in the story are different from the myths we learned. Squato was a manipulator. The Pilgrims themselves were not above creating a blood bath from time to time. Its amazing the good relations lasted as long as they did.It is interesting to note that the Indians did not have an easy time of it. They were devestated by disease. They, too, suffered from hunger, and struggled to survive. They taught the Pilgrims to plant corn, but their own food supply was never guaranteed. Life was grim, and death was alwas tugging at their elbows.This is quite a book. Its even-handed, fair, and objective. Its also eye-opening and fascinating. I enjoyed it greatly.The author tells a remarkable story, and remembering it will not be difficult."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"After a recent trip to Plymouth with the family (also heartily recommended), most of the tour guides & workers suggested this as a very good first read about the history of the Plymouth Colony. They were absolutely right (thanks guys). This is a very well written book that covers the main history of the Plymouth Colony from the establishment of the first successful colony through King Philip's War. Nathaniel Philbrick's main point is how the relationships with the natives changed from one of mutual dependence to outright open warfare between competing cultures. While telling the big story, he tells a lot of small stories along the way that make this a wonderful book. The details didn't interfere with the flow of the larger story.The writing is excellent. The history is fascinating. It's a must read for anyone interested in the Pilgrims, King Philip's War, early American History or Massachusetts history."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I had been a fan of Philbrick's for quite some time, after reading and completely enjoying _In the Heart of the Sea.In Philbrick's new book _Mayflower_, I was expecting a repeat of \\"Heart of the Sea.\\" I quickly bought the book based on the author and the title, but I should have flipped through it first.There are three reasons why:1. The title of this book is misleading: the title should be _A History of King Phillip's war or _An Early History of Plymouth and the Native Americans.There are 461 pages in the book, but only 104 pertain to events surrounding the Mayflower. The rest of the book focuses on events that take place long after the Mayflower passengers have passed on.2. This book is heavily peppered with the author's \\"modern\\" political opinions.Let me summarize: Evil European settlers treacherously used, abused, enslaved, maimed, and killed Native American men, women and children; all the while, the Native Americans were innocent and loving, aside from the occasional, reactionary misstep.If I wanted to inhale the stench of such opinions I would have went to various blogs or flipped on cable news.I picked up the book hoping for it to be a sweet escape into history, such as reading _His Excellency_ or _John Adams. But I was wrong.It is exceedingly easy to look to any point in the past and offer criticism, since now we get the pleasure to enjoy near perfect information about such past events. Anyone can be a Monday Morning Quarterback, as the author of this book displays.In addition, as the book also shows, it is even easier to morally chastise people from a different era who have different levels of education, different experiences, and different socially accepted values than what is ethically popular today--hundreds of years later.3. Almost from the beginning of the book it seemed that the author had an intention to portray the English settlers' religion in a negative tone. Throughout the book when the author was discussing the settlers' religion, I sensed the author had a smirk on his face while writing. Then toward the end of the book, the author made the comment that the settlers would have descended into a cult if it weren't for the interaction with the Native Americans.Maybe I did have different expectations, such as reading a book about the Mayflower (not just a few chapters), such as not being subjected to the author's political opinions, and such as reading about the settlers' religion from a professional historical point of view. However, I gained these expectations from Philbrick after reading _In the Heart of the Sea_, which is a fantastic book."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"An interesting account of the events before and after the Mayflower landing. Events focused on many people and continued through several generations. The span of time put the story in perspective well, but you almost need notes to keep track of the main characters. In the end, you were left with an interesting perspective on the formation of our national character."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Nathaniel Philbrick's MAYFLOWER: A STORY OF COMMUNITY, COURAGE AND WAR is essentially a retelling of the story of the settlement on Plymouth Colony in 1620 and the history of that colony though the end of what became known as \\"King Phillips War.\\" That conflict, which stretched throughout New England, came close to snuffing out the presence of English settlement in that part of North America. Despite our knowledge of how it all came out, Philbrick manages to create many moments of drama leaving the reader not wanting to put the book down as he recounts many of the individual narratives that make up the dramatic history of 17th century Plymouth and its surroundings.Early on, Philbrick tackles \\"two conflicting preconceptions.\\" The first is that the Pilgrims \\"symbolize all that is good about America\\". Its counter is that \\"evil Europeans annihilated the innocent Native Americans.\\" His research led him to a much richer, more interesting story: \\"real-life Indians and English of the seventeenth century were too smart, too generous, too greedy, too brave--in short, too human--to behave so predictably.\\" In short, there are heroes and villains among both the English and the Native Americans they encounter. This may upset some readers who prefer their preconceptions unblemished, but for the rest of us it makes for a much more interesting story and rings truer to our own experience in everyday life that courage, decency and wisdom are not traits endemic to one group or utterly lacking in another.Generally, the group Philbrick refers to as the \\"Leideners\\" or those separatist English who had left England and moved to Holland because they could not, in good conscience, remain in the Church of England (a legal requirement at the time) come off well. They were extreme in their religious beliefs, and would later deny others the freedom to practice their religion that compelled them to sail to America in the first place. Still, they were dedicated to their God, incredibly brave and determined to establish a place for themselves where they could live the way they thought proper. For the most part, their dealings with the Native Americans they encountered were judicious and wise, and the Thanksgiving story we've come to know is, surprisingly, mostly correct if incomplete.Philbrick's telling leaves a little to be desired when explaining precisely how the Native Americans came to find themselves in the desperate position they were in when Phillip decided to war against the English. In fact, it sounds as though they were desperate to keep purchasing English goods but unwilling to engage in the sorts of work necessary to earn them. Finding that their agricultural way of life no longer sustainable they chose to sell their capital (land), leaving them in an even worse position. Philbrick lays this out but can't quite bring himself to say that it was the Natives changing in some ways (longing for English goods) but not others (a willingness to adapt to the changing economy) that forced their hand. He also fails to go into any detail as to how the English governed themselves, mentioning their ultimate decisions but skimping on the decision making processes.Philbrick's judgment of Englishmen and Natives is balanced and he carefully analyzes the judgments and misjudgments that led to a war no one wanted or expected that proved so catastrophic for the region and all of its peoples. Readers will likely see parallels to the War on Terror in many aspects of how the English initially fought but then came to adapt when their traditional methods proved unsatisfactory. In sum, MAYFLOWER stands as a very good introduction to the story of the English settling of New England and the first period of the New England colonies' history."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Excellent book. History the way it should be taught. Balanced, objective, but not superficial. Brought out some amazing stories I had never heard before, and introduced me to one of my new favorite figures in American history: Benjamin Church. It's definitely not the story I learned in school, but it's also not an anti-Pilgrim, extreme revisionist piece either. It's good scholarship, enthralling action sequences, and a thoughtful approach to a complex set of people and events. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Someone approaching this book may be in for a surprise if he or she is looking for a sentimental story about a band of righteous, courageous Pilgrims enduring hardships and bravely soldiering through to establish the seeds of what is now the greatest country on Earth. What they'll find is a very big and balanced picture of years of missteps, struggles, community, and eventually war with Native American tribes. Nathaniel Philbrick spares no details, no matter how savage or brutal, in giving us a portrait of an extreme, almost cultish group of misfits who believed in their personal chosen, almost elitish relationship to God. Rebelling against the established church in England and Holland, they managed to get funded to make the big move into the unknown, with half their fellow travelers not religious at all. Even though the Pilgrims accidentally trespassed and stole from Native tribesmen, they found a way to accommodate and humble themselves to these tribes so that they could survive. Yet, within fifty years, another generation of Puritans saw wealth and plenty in New England and brooked no impediments to their greed, including those very people who helped their forefathers stay alive. War, death, torture, executions, and hardships followed for all.It's a fantastic story that demythologizes much of what is popularly known about the Pilgrims. Well written, well researched, I strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in this period of our history."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"My husband bought this book while we \\"westerners\\" were in Massachusetts on an American History trip with our 16-year-old granddaughter.

It is entertaining, informative, well researched, and balanced. It's a tremendous history book.The detailing of the voyage in the book is among the best I've ever read. He begins the story in Europe and explains how the trip was organized, financed, and the reasons behind it. He does a masterful job of relating to the reader how difficult and dangerous it was making this trip. Philbrick also does a wonderful job of illuminating how difficult the first decades of the colony were. We learn about the famous and familiar characters from grade school plays, but we also get a full picture of less famous, but just as important, characters as well.Philbrick does a wonderful job of simply telling us the facts. The Pilgrims aren't saints nor are they devils. Neither are the native population. They simply are what they were in this well written history.\\"Mayflower\\" is a well researched, well written, entertaining read. I recommend it very highly, and I think all Americans should read it. I believe it's as close as we'll ever get to the truth about the early New England colonists.

I knew little of the pilgrims adventures (or misadventures) and King Phillip's War. Essentially, they were a group of fanatics who settled a new land and within 50 years exterminated and displaced the native inhabitants. As a student of history, I enjoyed learning about this period and dispelling all the myths around Thanksgiving. It is well written and kept my interest until the very end. Most interesting fact: 10% of Americans or 32 million people can trace their lineage to the Plymouth Coloney. The CD version is easy to listen to and broken up into manageable sections perfect for short car trips to and from work. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Because of reenactments of that first Thanksgiving in public schools from the first grade through middle school, this leaves us with an unrealistic view of those early years. It is like a fairy tale compared to the facts. Although I had read other books on the early settlement years, including a book that told about later times when following colonists raided the food cache of a tribe of Indians, causing them to die of starvation and starting hostilities with this tribe. Those colonists only knew about the cache because the Indians had been sharing their food.Although I could understand this religious group moving on to find freedom to worship (although this freedom was not allowed by them to others), the number of deaths and the conditions of living on the ocean voyage coming over was appalling. I never realized that before and although I knew that the Pilgrims would not have survived those first two years without the help of the local Indians, it was an eye opener to me how they, with the usual attitude of the English that all lands they settled became theirs, the Pilgrims, through taking advantage of the Indians, caused hostility with their rescurers, creating sorrow and hardship for both groups.I truly loved this book and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn the truth of those first years of settlement for our Pilgrim colonists."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"A very worthwhile read despite their being plenty of information already about the founding fathers and the Puritans.

The book is riveting and very well researched, and a real pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Nathaniel Philbrick's \\"Mayflower\\" is another tour de force for this accomplished author. Characters rather muddily outlined in school history books come here to vivid life. Philbrick's account of the Pilgrims' Dutch period, their arduous (and possibly sabotaged?) voyage, their settlement at Plymouth, and the trials and triumphs of following years, is wonderfully written in engaging, accessible style.Among the delights of the book for me were the many quotations, especially from William Bradford. Like Philbrick, many of the Pilgrims wrote with expressive nuance, detailing thoughts, feelings, and facts with an ease and clarity rivaling the best contemporary writers.A surprising fact uncovered in the book is that approximately 10% of present-day Americans are descendants of that hardy, devout, prolific band of Pilgrims.I picked up \\"Mayflower\\" expecting a fairly rigorous non-fiction read, but instead I found a riveting, richly satisfying story better than any summer beach novel. Five stars plus!"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Lately, I have been finding myself drawn to books that explores Pre-Colonial and Colonial history since it seems to be not as well-researched as say, The Civil War or any other historical periods in our collective memory. This book fit the bill especially since there's a rumor that one of my ancestors came over on the Mayflower. And for once, it wasn't dry or boring to read (a lot of history books tend to be like that ...). I enjoyed reading every single page of this book.Philbrick writes of how the Pilgrims (a difference from the Puritans that came later on after they did) escaped England to flee religious persecutions. They resided in Holland for awhile and they decided to go to America when things got too intense in Holland. He detailed the ship's crossing (makes me glad for airplanes to travel on for overseas journeys!). It was a brutal crossing for a group of people who lived in such close quarters. Arriving to see land, they had difficulty finding good land and what I found interesting was that Plymouth was not a Garden of Eden ~~ full of wild animals and lush fertile lands on which to farm ~~ but a rocky place that's good for only fishing and not even that. (Another myth debunked.)Then it talks about their first years of survival and their relationships with the Native Americans. It detailed the relationships between the Native Americans and the Pilgrims ~~ showing how rough times were back then. The Native Americans had just survived the plague, which had killed more than half of their population, and the Pilgrims were fighting to stay alive. It detailed their agreements and how they managed to keep the peace among themselves for over 40 years. Then it detailed great information about the King Philip War ~~ which, to be honest with you, I don't remember ever hearing about. That was very fascinating in itself.If you're a history buff ~~ don't hesitate to pick this book up. It's well-written, thoughtful and very interesting. History comes alive in these pages! If you're a beginning history buff or need to read something for history class ~~ again, don't hesitate to pick this book up. It's written in such a way to keep your interest ~~ it makes history fun. It's high time we have a book on Pre-Colonial times ~~ hopefully, there will be more to follow!12-17-06"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This exceptionally well written popular history includes a great deal of coverage of the technology of 17th century sailing and a good deal more coverage of the cultural conflict between the English intruders and the Native Americans, flaring to the vicious bloodletting of King Phillip's War.I gave the book only four stars because I thought the absolutely necessary coverage of Puritain theology and 17th century politics was scanty in the extreme. We needed to know more about what motivated Puritains to leave Europe for the New World."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"The \\"classic\\" tale of American history has the Pilgrims coming to Plymouth in 1620, living cooperatively with the local Indians and having a big Thanksgiving feast with them. Then not much happened until the Revolution a century-and-a-half later. There is also a counter-legend which has the Pilgrims exploiting the Indians and taking part in a large scale destruction of the Indian culture. The truth, however, lies somewhere in between these two ideas, as Nathaniel Philbrick describes in Mayflower.Despite the title, this book actually deals with much more than the original Mayflower Pilgrims. The book does open at around the same scene as is familiar from our childhood textbooks, with a group of Puritans fleeing the oppression of Jacobean England to the more tolerant land of Holland. Some, however, would decide to move on from there to the New World, in particular, the area of Massachusetts. These people would be known as the Pilgrims.It would be a harrowing journey to Plymouth and a rough first year that would see half the Pilgrims die. Their encounters with the local Indians were mixed but tended to be on the favorable side. The Indians were far from united, with some friendly and some hostile, depending on both tribes and individuals. One boon to the Pilgrims was Squanto, an Indian who had lived in England for a while and was a good translator; unfortunately, Squanto also had his devious side and ambitions to be a big player in the Indian world. As it was, the principal leader that the Pilgrims dealt with was Massasoit, with whom they had friendly relations.Although there was generally amicability between the Pilgrims and the Indians (with some definitely violent exceptions), by the 1670s, the old generation was gone and, with more English settlers, the competition for resources led to greater conflicts, finally resulting in King Philip's War, named after Massasoit's son who was one of the Indian leaders. In terms of percentage of population killed, this was one of the devastating wars ever, even outdoing the Civil War.On the middle ground that Philbrick occupies, there is plenty of blame to go around. Both sides had their greedy and violent elements, and both sides had their good aspects too. But the guilt is not equal: Philbrick definitely faults the Pilgrims more, if for no other reason than because they were the ones trying to take the land away.Philbrick's narrative is readable and informative. It focuses primarily on two people: William Bradford (one of the original Pilgrims) and Benjamin Church (one of the main figures in King Philip's War), but others have big roles too, including Squanto, Massasoit, Philip and Miles Standish. In addition to ably discussing this history, Philbrick provides a good overview of how future generations would view the Pilgrims and the legends that would evolve over time. This is a good book that dispels the myths and counter-myths of the first Thanksgiving and the Pilgrims in general."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"The title is a bit deceptive because this narrative offers little in the story of the actual Mayflower or the passage it's Pilgrims took upon it. It is really a history of six decades from 1620 to 1676. The pivotal event being the \\"King Phillip's War\\" where the descendents of the Mayflower forgot the generosity of the Native Americans and turned against them causing what Philbrick terms the most Bloody war in our nations history (okay, yes we were not yet a nation, I know). I found the book a bit disjointed as if two books were joined into one volume. The fist is about the Mayflower settlers and especially Miles Standish, the violent little corporal of his time and then the second is the interesting story of Benjamin Church, Indian fighter, diplomat, patriot and forgotten hero of the King Phillip's War. (And who knew that King Philip was a Native American who was one of first to try and unit the tribes against the English. Or that most Native American were killed off in great number by the Plaque even before the Pilgrims landed. Also interesting to note that the Pilgrims fast became a tolerant and pragmatic group because it was the only way to adapt or die.) All this is very interesting and compelling history with emphasis on history, but not until we meet Benjamin Church do we get a compelling story and narrative which I think has been the reason both Philbirck's previous books topped the bestseller list, one winning the National Book award. I recommend this volume with some minor reservations."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I couldn't get into this book because it was very different from what I thought it would be. I expected \\"Mayflower\\" to be a detailed account of why the pilgrims decided to journey to America, and also a vivid description of what life aboard the Mayflower was actually like. The book did cover those things, but only for a few short pages. Most of the book is devoted to the history of Plymouth Colony and King Philip's War. Author Nataniel Philbrick does an excellent job of shooting down the myths many people believe about what the pilgrim settlement was actually like, but I was much more interested in reading about the actual Mayflower journey and was disappointed that so little information about that event was included in this 400+ page book. \\"Mayflower\\" should be called \\"King Philip's War\\" so readers know what they're getting into."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This book took me a long time to read. It's so well researched that there is information to absorb on every page. I was fascinated. The story of the Pilgrims described by the author goes far beyond what I ever imagined and certainly gave me a really thorough understanding about the truth of the voyage and settlement that most Americans think of as the beginning of our country. The year 1620 was a long time ago. It was another world from what we know today. And it certainly did take a lot of courage for the small group of Pilgrims who set off to an unknown world. They had their faith to sustain them, of course. And a trust in what they were doing. Because they were having such a hard time in England, they had set up their settlement in Holland where there was more religious tolerance at the time. But they saw that their children were becoming Dutch and they wanted to go someplace where they could still be English.After a difficult voyage they arrived in the Cape Cod area of America and later moved a bit more inland. At that time, the Indians had just gone through a period of awful disease, later believed to be viral hepatitis which they caught from French sailors. More than 90 percent of the native population succumbed to this disease and the Pilgrims found areas where crops had been cultivated that had been abandoned. They stole some corn from a gravesite because they were so hungry and later had to deal with the Indians about this. But at first there was a truce of sorts and the Indians did help out the people.I hesitate to use the term \\"the Indians\\" though. There were a lot of tribes, and some were historic enemies of each other. And so there were constant clashes and treaties as these tribes fought each other and changed alliances with the Pilgrims. Most of the Pilgrims did not survive that first winter, but later more settlers came from England and the colony grew. So did the warfare with the Indians. Eventually, there was an extremely bloody war. Both sides were guilty of atrocities. Both sides felt they were right. The rest, as they say, is history.While I read the book I felt I was right there, in the 17th century, a fly on the wall watching the various groups destroy each other. The author made me understand the challenges for each of these groups, but I must say I felt most sorry for the Indians, who eventually lost the war and whose way of life was destroyed forever.\\"Mayflower\\" is non-fiction all the way. It did NOT read like a novel. That is its strength as well as its weakness I can only absorb a limited number of facts before I tend to get sleepy. I think the book belongs on history shelves and will stand the test of time as a fine historical document. I recommend it as fresh way to view America's beginnings. I'm glad I read it. But it is not for everyone."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"It was interesting to learn how the Pilgrims filled the population vacuum created by previous diseases of lesser lifeform. I came away from the book thinking that the European settlers represented just another wave of disease to the indigenous species. On recent travels to New England, I couldn't help thinking that the cancer had seriously metastasized and it is difficult to envision an evolutionary path out of the mess. It is not difficult to imagine a future population vacuum once again created by some wave of disease leaving bleached bones scattered about as similarly witnessed by the Pilgrims when they arrived. The book could have used a better analysis of the psychology of the early settlers. Leiden sounded good.

Reviewing this book in May, I found the season of flowers ironic enough, but in light of the racist attitudes of the Pilgrims (and in present-day America as it fights an illegal war in Iraq) spring flowers do not seem appropriate to such self-righteous bigotry. I deeply thank Philbrick for exposing the racist roots of our country, which can still be found in many Americans today in the frightful \\"immigration\\" battle being waged.I also see that the neo-cons and social-conservatives so prevalent in the Bush administration actually do have their true roots in the self-righteous Pilgrims and Puritans, but not in the thoughtful Jeffersons, Washingtons and Hamiltons of revolutionary days. No, today's neo-cons kill first and ask questions later, just like these horrid Pilgrims.The mistakes in Iraq, the illegal attack, the Bush lies to start the war are very like the beginnings of King Phillip's War so many years ago. The Pilgrims were eager for land and prejudiced against the Indians. Bush-Cheney were eager for oil, and started the \\"holy war\\" against Iraq. While Philbrick does not draw these parallels, they are so easy to see.Years later, the spinmeisters have softened the genocide practiced by The Pilgrims. Today, the Bush spinmeisters use the media to tell the big lie about our \\"patriotic\\" Iraq War.

Yet, Mr. Philbrick's narrative brings the reader close-up to the struggles these brave people faced, not only when they crossed the North Atlantic, but the problems they faced when they came ashore.As an American History Teacher, this is probably the best book on the subject I have read. A terrific read!"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Overall it's a good reading. I knew of course the basic story, but I learnt many new details - I have now much more sense about who these people actually were, their personal story, like this of Bradford who was the governer. I also have the insight from \\"the other side\\" - the natives view of the events, who were the persons there and what their feeling were. The book proceeds to the story of King Philip war on 1675-6 which is also a part of history about which I previously new only the basic facts and now I got some more details.Problem is that sometimes there were too many details about specific fights that got somewhat tiresome and on the other hand I would have likes to read more about the feeling of the ordinary people there, not only about the heros - like Benjamin Church - but also about the day to dat life in these small towns in such times. I feel that I got plenty of courage and war and less of a community."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"The book separated fact from fiction, and read more like a novel than an historically researched account.

And, of course, I was not alone in my addiction to that wonderful recount of an extraordinary survival of a crew.When notified that Philbrick was soon to offer another history--this one titled \\"Mayflower\\", I licked my lips and pre-ordered. When it came last May, I soon realized that the title had ill-prepared me for the contents within. I was expecting a recount of an amazing voyage across \\"the Pond\\" by a dedicated and determined group of Puritans. I was expecting the trials of sea-travel and the fragility of faith under stress. And the opening sentence--\\"For sixty-five days, the Mayflower had blundered through storms and headwinds, her bottom a shaggy pelt of seaweed and barnacles, her leaky decks spewing salt water onto her passengers' devoted heads.\\"--satisfied my expectation...in part.The book spends very little time on the voyage of the Mayflower and that is what I wanted to see; what I wanted to read. But aside from disappointed expectations, \\"Mayflower\\" is worthy of being read. Just get beyond the expectation that your gonna get Puritan version of \\"In the Heart of the Sea.\\" It is a far cry from that... Regardless, pick it up and learn about diplomacy, and the lack of it; about surviving hunger, and war. Learn about a community that began a nation. And email Mr. Philbrick and tell him that you learned a lot and then suggest that he writes a book specifically concerned with the voyage of the Mayflower.SAH"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Nathaniel Philbrick gives the reader an in-depth history of Plymouth Colony.

If you are interested in the History of New England Indian tribes this book is for you."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Among Americans' most cherished myths is that of the _Mayflower_, a story always centered on The First Thanksgiving. That celebration was, indeed, held in Plymouth in 1621; that is historical fact. And the Indians did participate, enjoying the festivities with the newcomers; even this part of the story has its sting, since relations with the people who were on the land before the settlers came changed quickly and permanently for the worse. But the image of a Thanksgiving table, around which Pilgrims and Indians sat awaiting their turkey (and perhaps cranberry sauce) is a comfortable and comforting Victorian image, and very far from the reality. It isn't the only myth that Nathaniel Philbrick has tackled in _Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War_ (Viking). A fascinating revision of the Pilgrim arrival and its aftermath, Philbrick's book is a useful look at events that led to the formation of a new nation, and to national enthusiasms and prejudices. Importantly, it includes King Philip's War, which is an American conflict usually forgotten in the history race to get from Plymouth to Philadelphia in 1776.The Pilgrims were what we would now think of as a religious cult. The intolerance that had led them to remove their communities from the larger society, and then to set sail for a new land, did not end when they had found the new land, but fueled a zealotry against the Indians. They were originally approached by Massasoit, the chief of the Pokanokets. Massasoit had held powwows with his fellows to determine what to do about the problem of Englishmen, and had formed a policy of allying his tribe with them. The Pokanokets were vulnerable to other Indian neighbors because of their population losses, and the Pilgrims were woefully unprepared to make a go of life on the Indian lands. The alliance started by Massasoit and the governor of Plymouth Plantation, William Bradford, was productive and lasted over fifty years, although there were countless misunderstandings and violations, many of them brutal. After Massasoit's death, his son King Philip (that was the English name for him, showing that they could only understand Indian leadership in English terms) had to endure the consequences of increasing belligerence of the settlers and loss of tribal lands. Indian raids became more frequent and murderous. The English assumed that this was a racial struggle rather than a political one, and so it became. Philbrick has calculated percentages of settlers killed, and finds them at 8% of the men, far higher than any subsequent American war; the Indian losses by battle, sickness, starvation, enslavement, or fleeing the area were something like 70%. The victory, had it gone to the Indians, could have ended English settlement of the area; as it was, it caused enormous financial losses to the English, whose per capita income did not return to pre-war levels for a century, and left them with no 'friend Indians' to buffer them from their enemies. Philbrick says that Bradford and Massasoit had learned that 'for peace and for survival, others must be accommodated.' It is a simple lesson, but it was quickly forgotten by those that followed them on both sides, and remains a lesson still worth knowing.The nasty King Philip's War has been largely forgotten, while we remember those Pilgrims and Indians at Thanksgiving. Their first one was less a religious festival than a secular celebration of the harvest, an ancient British custom that involved eating, drinking, and games. They probably had no furniture outside to rest in, but sat or stood around their fires as game and stews cooked. It was the way the natives held celebrations; it did not get enshrined into a celebration by the American government for another 250 years. The other wonderful myth punctured here is that of Plymouth Rock, the cherished rock where those beloved Pilgrims stepped off their fabled vessel. This rock, enshrined now in history on site for all tourists to see, was tearfully pointed out in 1741 by a 95-year-old invalid, who said that his father (who had arrived in Plymouth three years after the _Mayflower_) had told him that this, this was the very boulder on which the Pilgrims had landed. Well, it's a good story, and so are all those stories, like Longfellow's 'The Courtship of Miles Standish.' Philbrick's story, a gripping one of thoughtful revisionism, has them all beat."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Most of this information was totally new to me, and was very interesting. I enjoyed the book. The first half was easier to get through, but the second half was very important to understanding what really happened. Great book."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Philbrick has shown in previous books that he can provide accurate details from the past, mix in intriguing anecdotal material, then give it all a present-day relevance. Although not as gripping as \\"In the Heart of the Sea,\\" this book provides fascinating glimpses into the mindsets of those who established the country we now call home.Following the path of the Separatists/Pilgrims, the book moves from England to Holland and eventually to American shores. Philbrick chronicles the political, spiritual, and personal conflicts involved on board the Mayflower. By the time the travelers reach New England, potential trouble is brewing--which is only exacerbated by the mix of Native Indian power struggles. I was struck anew by the courage and perseverance of those who came before us. More than half died in that first year here.Interesting tidbits can be found throughout the book, regarding the effectiveness of the bow and arrow against English muskets, the Pilgrims' inability to tap into rich fishing grounds, and that original \\"Thanksgiving\\" feast. We also see how land deals and greed, not to mention religious arrogance, led to injustice against those who already existed on these shores. At times, Philbrick tends to gloss over the Indians' violence while magnifying that of the Pilgrims. To a fault, he seems intent on connecting the Pilgrims' intolerant ways to our current leaders' foreign policies. This is the book's greatest strength, raising thought-provoking points. It's also its weakness, diminishing certain details for the sake of the argument. Nevertheless, the questions do remain: Have we learned from our past? Or are we merely running along the same ruts established during our country's birth? \\"Mayflower\\" is more than just a fascinating account of history; it's a challenge to reconsider the way we approach the days ahead."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"A large precent of the book deals with Indian wars.

There seemed to be a sharp tonal/content shift once the narrative, less than halfway through the book as I recall, left Plymouth and fast-forwarded to Philip's War. Then the text became a rather dry \\"this happened, then that happened, and this person came on the scene, who was the nephew of this person and father of these six people\\" sort of thing.Too many events, people, tribes, locations coming out of the woodwork, constantly, with no character development of a given person or smaller group of people that you could \\"get to know\\" and care to follow, or building of scenes in such a way that engaged you.\\"The Last Stand\\" by Philbrick, meanwhile, was very good & I highly recommend it!

And, I don't really know why. I did learn a lot about a period of history of which I knew little, and I developed a real respect for the Pilgirms, et. al, who sufferred to found the country. And, as usual there were the usual number of atrocities against the Indians. However, they were a pretty tough bunch also. I stopped reading with about a hundred pages left becuase I found it was kind of like plowing ground. Maybe there were too many characters, too many battles that sounded pretty much the same, or too many Indian names I could not keep straight. Maybe it was the author's writing which was a bit too journalistic. I did think the author went on a bit about just how important Kng Phillip's War was when in most instances the warring groups numbered in the tens, not thousands. Anyway, I did not find this to be an enjoyable read at all."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I thought this book was great.

In school we are taught the pilgrims could do not wrong and it is refreshing to get a honest depiction of them. The accounts of the Indian Wars are fascinating.The book really gives you the understanding of how fragile the first Pilgrims were in their new land. I think every American should read this book to get a firm grasp of how, basically, it all started. Yes Jamestown was here before the pilgrims but the importance of Plymouth Colony cannot be overlooked.

Herrmann, an award winning actor, does an excellent job of reading the text; I had no problem understanding any of it while driving, and the story seemed to go by quickly.Author Philbrick has done a very good job of bringing new life to an old story. He brings in research that few of us have read before, and seems to have drawn extensively from the writings of Col. Benjamin Church (1639-1718). Thus Church emerges as a hero in the story, a man with a conscience who disapproved of the excessive cruelties visited upon the Indians by the English. He decries the sale of a thousand Indians into slavery, yet he was a key player in a war that virtually exterminated them from most of New England. It's an ugly but fascinating story of cultures in conflict.The book is well-suited for an audio version, although it's not a story that's suitable for young children because the butchery that both sides inflicted upon their enemies is bloody and cruel.A drawback of the audio version is that it lacks maps, but the narrative is understandable without them."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Wow, these are not the pilgrims that we learned about in third grade.

Though I admired the original settlers for the most part for the courage it took to leave the Netherlands to go to an unknown land to try to make a home for themselves in order to practice their religion and lead their lives as they saw fit, the way their sons and grandsons treated the native Americans afterwards was absolutely horrendous. And of course, simply a sign of what was to come...since Europeans/Caucasians continued to treat Native American Indians with great indignity and basically genocide. (And no, I'm not Native American). I remember being in grade school and teachers holding up Miles Standish as someone we were supposed to admire. And this book makes him to be a typical 'small man bully.'This book was an incredible history. Well written, detailed, quick to read, definitely not boring or textbook-like, the type of book that was hard to put down. I came away with so much information about the beginning of our nation that explained a lot of missing or just plain wrong concepts that I have had since grade school. I guess history is a little bit like science which I teach at a college level. The more that time goes on, the more research we do into it, the more we find out about it. However, those people who write textbooks and those who choose textbooks for our schools too often have a 'political or religious' agenda for choosing their textbooks as seen down in Texas concerning evolution and creationism...and that too often impacts the access to the information that children are going to get about both their history and their science. So it is important that extra books like this one are available not just in the library but in the classroom itself for students to pick up and read for extra credit to build on what is available in the textbook."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This is not the sugar-coated story they teach in elementary school in the US. Mayflower is a thorough historical account, being both easy to read and engaging at the same time.

This book presented a wealth of information about the Pilgrims, Puritans (I never drew a distinction between the two), and the various Indian tribal cultures -- describing the way they lived, what they ate, how they went to battle, and the outside impacts they dealt with such as the weather and disease.

That's too bad.I enjoy reading history when it's well-written. How the individual colonies started, grew, competed, suppoted each other (or not) was cool to read. Ditto how the various Native American tribes received the newcomers. Had a few of the tribes not joined the Europeans in plotting against their brethren, the country might look very different today. Native Americans captured, exported to the Caribbean and sold into slavery to fund the colonial development - that was news to me.

But it never really occured to me that, other than the basic holiday tale, I had not studied anything else about this crucial time in US (pre)history. Enter Philbrick, author of the gripping In the Heart of the Sea, and his ability to turn historic events into page-turners. This book was a real education for me, giving me the Pilgrims' background, information about their voyage and general struggles to survive, and details about their complicated relationships with the Natives they met and eventually dispossessed. I knew virtually nothing about King Philip's war. I honestly had no idea that it only took one generation for the relatively peaceful coexistence of European and Native to unravel into horrible violence.

It covers every detail of the first 50 years and how the next generation spawned a spoiled set of settlers with new attitudes which inevitably led to King Philips war.Being a history buff, I had a pretty good understanding of this story to begin with, but this book completely puts it all together. It is written in a manner that is easy to assimilate and emphathize with the events. This allows me to remember names, places and important dates when discussing the events of our pilgrim ancestors. It doesn't glamourize anything and quotes directly from historic journals and maps.Anyone interested in early American history needs to read this book. After reading this book, I have a completely different perspective on Thanksgiving, the pilgrims and our ancestors. An interesting fact I recieved from this book is that one of ten people are descended from those 102 pilgrims. I happen to know my ancestors include 3 of them, most notably John Alden, who was my 9th great grandfather.If you REALLY want to know what life was like, what was the relationships like with the Indians, how they cooperated with other colonies and how religion played into to things, read this book!!!Well written.

This was one which did indeed captivate my interest. I found it educational and very readable. I had just read 'Shogun'(a well-researched novel) about Japan during the same time period, so I was primed for a book about the 1600's in a different part of the world. As someone else said, the final third of the book was about King Philip's War, so you have to enjoy reading about wars, as I do. However, I don't enjoy legendary descriptions, but instead those which appear to simulate reality, although I realize everyone's reality is somewhat different from everyone else's. I felt that the author took great pains to make descriptions as close to reality as possible. I was bowled over by the amount of research he did. Here's an excerpt of something I found interesting: \\"A Puritan believed it was necessary to venture back to the absolute beginning of Christianity...Hymns were also judged to be a corruption of God's word..instead sang scrupulously translated psalms (from the Bible)....Puritans refused to kneel while taking communion, since there was no evidence the apostles had done so during the Last Supper....\\" I found the book to be filled with pearls like this."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"With graceful prose and intensive research, \\"Mayflower\\" provides the story of the Pilgrims' and then the Puritans' colonization of New England. The achievements of those pioneers set in motion the American experiment that continues to this day -- in all its glory and shame.The author does a wonderful job of evoking so many things that are hard for us to imagine today. Life in an ultra-strict religion that feared God at every step. European and Indian communities in which huge percentages of the population died of disease and malnutrition. Sailing into the unknown. Contact with a native people whose lives for millenia have moved on a totally different path. The hardships of daily life. And the violence that erupted about 50 years after the Pilgrims first landed.The tale is too good to put down. I zipped through the book in a few days, despite its depth and complexity. I learned so many things -- differentiating between Pilgrims and Puritans, why certain places in New England became major towns, how violence became part of the expansion of America, etc. And I got a feel for what it was like to sail on a small ship across the ocean, to land with minimal food at the start of winter, and to take those first tentative steps into the wilderness and to reach out to the people who were there.The highest praise I can give a book is that it makes me want to know more about the subjects that it covers. After \\"Mayflower,\\" I'll be reading more about the pre-Colonial era in America, though I doubt anything will be quite as stirring."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"There are a lot of blank spots in my knowledge of early American history, and Philbrick's book clears up one of them: the period between around 1620, when the Pilgrims settled in New England, and 1670, at the end of King Philip's War, by which time they'd decimated New England's population of Native Americans. (Or at least what was left of them following the first decimation, by disease earlier settlers had brought with them. If you want to know more about that earlier stuff, check out1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus. Actually, check that book out regardless - it's amazing.)\\"Mayflower\\" reads fairly smoothly, but at times it feels a bit like the dreaded list of names and places. Very well-researched, though; worth a read if you're interested in the time period."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I enjoyed this look back at the history of the Pilgrims and their subsequent generations. All the factors going into the founding of that fragile community and their willingness to compromise with the native Americans. More realistic look at how the Indians tried to cope with these invaders. Quite interesting, besides being a moral lesson for here and now."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the story of the Pilgrims and the English beginnings in our country. It is very readable and gives lots of information about the reasons and organization of the trip to America, events of the crossing in the Mayflower, landing on the cold shores of Massachusetts, and the first year here. I have always been interested in the story of the Pilgrims and have visited Plimoth Plantation and the Mayflower II, but I gained a much more realistic view of the people and events. We tend to idealize the people but this book shows them as real people with strengths, flaws, and temperments. I enjoyed this book and felt like I was there. It reads like a historical fiction."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"reads like a novel, but it is a collection of recorded accounts by members of the Mayflower, their descendents, and observations from people from the period that lets you into the Pilgrims world. It is not for those who wish to keep tradition and obscure the facts: these were very hardy individuals whom wanted to establish a Christian society free from the encumberance of an existing church while doing anything it took to survive in the wilderness; even if it means stealing the Native's corn or preemptively attacking them when you thought they might attack. Needless to say such actions would ultimately bring these groups to conflict, but amazingly it took a full 56 years to do so! This book is for those who want to know who the Pilgrims were, and how they differed from the Puritans, or the various Native tribes, or from the Dutch or the French."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"The myth of the Pilgrim forefathers has been reconstructed to include less mythical aspects and divulge the honest and human attributes of the lives of the first fathers of the nation. Nathaniel Philbrick's Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War culminates primarily around the documents of two of the most valuable members of the Plymouth Colony: William Bradford and Benjamin Church. What is produced is a gripping retelling of the American creation story, in a more accurate light. The common, mythical way Pilgrims have been viewed is as wholesome family groups, making immediate peace with the Indians, as well as with each other and having a pure form of Protestantism as the ruling factor in their lives. Philbrick seems to say that there is a much more compelling and candid story behind the founding of New England than a fifteen pound turkey and cranberry sauce.Philbrick recognizes in his prologue that the myths of the Pilgrims and the harmonious first Thanksgiving are by today's standards taken \\"with a grain of salt.\\" In other words, most of Philbrick's American audience is aware of the fact that there is a darker and more realistic side to the Pilgrim myth; however nothing further that the mere awareness really exists is popular American culture. Mayflower sets out to flesh out that awareness with an enthralling and genuine tale of our first American fathers. Therefore, the key purpose of Mayflower is not to debunk the already dying myth of the Pilgrims, but to give the first settlers and their first Indian contacts the truth they deserve.Nathaniel Philbrick was born, raised and educated, for the most part in New England, with the exception of obtaining his Master's in American Literature from Duke University in North Carolina. Though not a trained historian, Philbrick has a true penchant for the art of sailing and has put all of his efforts towards maritime history. Working as a freelance journalist for several maritime publications and doubling as a stay-at-home dad for his two children, Philbrick was able to try his had at many different writing styles. It was not until his family moved to Nantucket in 1986 that he formally began producing historical works. The subject matter of his first book, Away Off Shore: Nantucket Island and Its People, proves how influential a change of location was. It was this transition to popular historical writing that allowed him to write several more historical maritime accounts. His 2000 book, In the Heart of the Sea, won the National Book Award for nonfiction and in 2003 Sea of Glory won the Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt Naval History Prize and the Albion-Monroe Award from the National Maritime Historical Society.Philbrick reconstructs this epic that spans nearly a century through the use of primary source documents written by the Pilgrims, themselves, as well as a vast array of secondary scholarship on the subject. Philbrick all but prohibits multidiscipline primary sources, such as archaeology and relies almost solely on documents. This is intended in no way to downplay Philbrick's extensive use of written sources. Whether they are primary or secondary sources, Philbrick did his research. After reading the novel and glancing at the notes, one can imagine countless evenings spent examining and cross-examining thousands of documents, trying to accurately paint a picture for his reader using written words.In contrast to Philbrick's heavy reliance on documents, the highly acclaimed The Times of Their Lives: Life, Love and Death in Plymouth Colony written by the late James Deetz and his wife Patricia Scott Deetz in 2001 deals with the same subject matter and time period as Mayflower, however it is done in a very different way. James Deetz was a trained and well experienced archaeologist who spent the majority of his life collecting artifacts dealing with the Plymouth Colony and its Pilgrims. Patricia Scott Deetz is a South African historical anthropologist, versed in the British colonial society, albeit from the perspective of another continent. The central theme of the Deetz's book is historical accuracy. In order to produce The Times of Their Lives, the authors gathered research from every possible discipline and then merely organized and commented on their findings. This method made for an extremely authentic resource for Plymouth history.The only drawback, the void that Philbrick seems to fill, is the fact that presenting such large amounts of data can tend to be an organizational nightmare and can be chronologically confusing for the audience. Philbrick's work is told as a story, rather than a historical and educational source. Judging from his educational background (degrees in English and Literature) and his former works, Philbrick is a popular historian. Mayflower would more likely be classified as a non-fiction novel than a historical text. Not intended as a jab, but as a success in making accurate history so accessible to laymen, without an advanced degree in the subject matter. While $29.95 is somewhat pricey, perhaps when a paperback issue of the book is released, the retail cost will decrease. The Times of Their Lives read as a companion to Mayflower would make for an excellent and comprehensive account of the Pilgrims of New England.Although Mayflower is ideal for popular history, gives an excellent general description of colonial Plymouth and is accessible to any layman, a question arises is it too accessible to laymen and not nearly functional to scholars of history, most specifically colonial history. While Philbrick has an extensive annotated bibliography, there is a lack of in text references. There is no way for a person using Philbrick's work as a source for scholarship to accurately connect any of what Philbrick states in the body of the text to this notes or bibliography. In this sense, what the author truly succeeds at is taking several first hand accounts, documents and a multitude of secondary sources and sums them up in this story.Due to his thorough examination of documents, the conclusions that Philbrick draws in this work are highly plausible and allow the reader to be engaged at every facet of the story. Philbrick has succeeded in shifting the view of the experience of colonial America from those events romanticized in order to help the reader see the importance of the honest and human attributes of the lives of the American founding fathers.Teresa PangleOctober 2006"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This book is excellent. It has to be the most comprehensive book on the Pilgrams ever written in recent history. This guy goes beyond the initial romantic conceptions surrounding Thanksgiving. His story goes about 50 years beyond the first settlers touched down at Plymouth. He does go into detail about the harshness the first settlers had to endure. The author also gives respect to the religious convections of those first settlers. Nowadays a lot of people want to explain that away in the name of political correctness. He goes beyond that to discuss other motivations like economics, which drives us all then as it does now.The story doesn't end with the first Thanksgiving. This was around 150 years before the Patriots at Lexington and Concord. The author dives into the story of King Phillips war of 1675-1676. I would dare to say maybe there is only a handfull of books on that subject. It is almost a forgotten period of time in American History. The war read almost like something from today. Isolated towns suffer from terrorists or Indians attacking. A story which would be repeated often over the next 300 years.This war was very bloody. In the war of WWII the US suffered a casualty rate of 1% of the male populuation. In the civil war that rate was between 4 and 5 percent. In the King Phillips war the English rate was 8%. The Indian casualty rate was between 60-80 percent. I am afraid the tale of King Phillips war told in the book is the tale of clashing cultures and overwhelming economic forces. That tale is just as revelant then as now. It definitely has lessons for us today, but I am afraid we don't have the stomach to take it."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Although I am a student of American history, Philbrick's Mayflower revealed a tremendous gap in my knowledge of the true story of the Pilgrims and the 50 years after their landing in America. A well-written, highly detailed account, Philbrick brings to life many characters known to us as well as a number of lesser known folks who figured prominently in the events of this period. An excellent read for anyone interested in our country's history."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I am not a historian, though with books like this coming out, I am becoming very interested in history. The book covers much more than the Mayflower. Having done research on topics of my own, I know how a person's studies can take him in a direction he might not have anticipated when he began. I suspect this was the case with Philbrick. You get into the subject and then follow your interest, finding your own set of points and lines to draw on the topic. The \\"War\\" section deals with the next generation of settlers and the next generation of Indians. The thing that interested me the most was all of the information about the various Indian tribes in New England. One could see things from both perspectives, the settlers and the Indians. Both did good things and horrible things. It was especially interesting to me how the \\"politics\\" of the Indian sachems played a role in why the English were successful as settlers and were not simply wiped out early on. During King Philip's War, the references to the account of Mary Rowlandson -- an English minister's wife who was captured and enslaved by the Indians and finally released for a ransom -- added a particluar personal touch to the story. Overall, Philbrick did a great job, though there was some of his personal perspective and opinion in the book. Actually this should be 4 and 1/2 stars, but I don't know if Amazon allows me to rate in half stars."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Having lived in New England most of my life, as have my ancestors, I thought I knew it all when it came to the landing of the Pilgrims. After reading this, I now have an even greater appreciation of the story.I suppose I had never fully understood the relationship between the native Indians and the Pilgrims/Puritans in Massachusetts. This book has set the record straight on the good, the bad, and the downright ugly things that had been done during this timeframe. Some despicable characters, and some noteworthy ones as well.To think of what might have been accomplished had attitudes been different then, but that is not to be. Despite this, the story will certainly redefine how you think of how our Pilgrim fathers \\"made it\\" here in America, and established themselves in the face of formidable odds. Characters such as Benjamin Church, the Winslows, the Bradfords, Joseph and Massasoit make this story all the more enjoyable.Would have liked to have seen the footnotes more closely associated with the particular references. Also would have like to have heard about the ordinary rank and file of the Mayflower who may not have been as important as Winslow, Bradford or Standish, and how they contributed.A great summer read...would like to see more in this vein."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Back to where it all began. Absorbing!There is not much I can add to what has already been said, but this is a totally captivating look at how this country was founded so long ago.First of all, the treacherous voyage by the 1620 Pilgrims across the Atlantic to Massachusetts was incredible in itself!Then with William Bradford, Miles Standish and others making a life for themselves in such a dreary, bleak and god-forsaken landscape while at the same time setting the stages for community, our future Declaration of Independence and U. S. Constitution, and acquainting themselves with their Native American neighbors, took amounts of courage, determination and stamina that nowadays is next to unimaginable.Collisions of cultures, misunderstandings between the groups involved, setting precedences for future generations on conquest, this book has it all.In depth character studies of Chief Massasoit, Sqaunto, other Indian tribes and personalities, along with the many Pilgrims' offspring such as Benjamin Church, give this book color, grit and substance.Culminating with the bloody and unwarranted King Philip's War, Philbrick leaves no stone unturned.Required reading for all U.

It's a fine series of connections, since it's really about the settlers of Plymouth and their originally strong relationship with the local natives degenerating into a brutal war between members of the subsequent generation: the children, if you will.Philbrick brings to life the struggle between men and sea in the ordeal of the crossing, a foul-weather, undernourished, and ill-provisioned affair resulting in the mis-aimed landing near present-day Plymouth. The Seperatists left England more than a decade previously to worship in relative freedom in Holland, but even there they didn't fit in and wouldn't be allowed the opportunity to prosper, so they took the risk of a completely new start in a new land without understanding the perils, but with the faith in God that things would work out.They did, but not for the reasons they had originally thought. The alliances formed were political and military and used by the Wampanoag leader Massasoit to bolster his own tenuous position among the chiefs of the various tribes. He gained exclusive trading rights and a treaty of mutual protection, something of a first among Europeans and natives.This agreement worked remarkably well for a generation, but population pressures, over-hunting the land, and sell-offs of Wampanoag lands came to a head with Massasoit's son, Philip, who had decided enough was enough. The Christian conversions were undermining the Indians way of life, he believed and he took a stand which resulted in a long and bloody war between the English and the Indians.This part of the book didn't work as well for me, because there was a lot of repitition. Maybe I'd already read too much about King Philips War and none of this account seemed like much more than a reprint, but for someone approaching the subject new, it's a very detailed account of the known scholarship.All in all, a very good history book with finely crafted prose and a worthy addition to any library.- CV Rick"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Unlike most histories I read, which can be a bit dry, Mayflower is an enthralling read. My book club chose it for our monthly selection, and I waited until the last minute to pick it up because I just knew that it would be a book that I would have to struggle to read. Well, I picked it up at 3:00 the day before our meeting, and the next time I looked at the clock, it was 300 pages later and almost 7:00. The kids were hungry and unbathed, the house was a disaster, but I sat oblivious on the sofa devouring this wonderful tome. Now, I find myself recommending Mayflower to anyone who will listen.I will now be on the prowl for more of Philbrick's books because if any of them are half as good as Mayflower, I'm a new devotee."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"King Philip's War challenged the Mayflower colonists in 1676. Philip was the son of Massasoit, Wampanoag leader. A third of the New England towns were burned or abandoned. The Pilgrims became convinced God wanted them in the New World, braving starvation, death, Indian attacks. The Separatists believed in spiritual discipline. The intended destination of the Mayflower was the mouth of the Hudson. The Mayflower Compact was devised prior to landing. The Pilgrims were experienced exiles and they were willing to learn the new ways of the New World. Pilgrim Rock had already been cleared by the Indians. Seven houses were built the first year and four buildings for common use.Massasoit regarded Squanto as conniving, but he needed his services as a translator. Diplomatic relations were established between the Pilgrims and Massasoit. A later show of force by the Pilgrims caused more of the sachems, Indian leaders, to sign treaties of loyalty to King James. Thanksgiving came into use as a celebration in the nineteenth century. At the first one there were ducks, deer, and wild turkeys. Later, though, Pilgrim leaders Standish and Bradford received warnings that the Massachusetts and Narragansett Indians were plotting to kill the leaders and overpower the settlement. Squanto was supposed to be involved in the perfidious dealings. He was trying to undermine Massasoit.The Pilgrims were farmers, not fishermen. The environment at Cape Cod had an abundance of fish. The settlement had a difficult time feeding additional inhabitants it acquired twice through arriving ships. They learned from fishermen that 347 English colonists had been massacred at Jamestown. By winter 1623 Plymouth had exceptional discipline. Unfortunately Miles Standish made a raid on the Indians. The Indian ecology of Cape Cod was changed. In 1625 John Robinson, minister of the Pilgrims, died in Leiden. After two years of using communal plots and nearly starving, the issuance of private plots solved the food crisis. Bradford never had a talent for commercial matters. There was continuous trouble with the merchants back in London.Distinctions between the Pilgrims and the Puritans were inconsequential. Both groups were Separatists. Magistrates from both colonies clamped down on dissent. The Pequot War of 1637 was used by Uncas of the Mohegans, in supporting the Puritans, to become the most powerful tribe in Connecticut. The United Colonies of 1643, consisting of Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut, and New Haven, became a model for the North American Confederacy of 1774.In 1675 Josiah Winslow was advised that Philip was on the verge of war. Rhetoric and posturing drove the parties into opposition. Indians committed acts of provocation. At their garrison Pilgrim soldiers were reinforced with troops from Massachusetts Bay. Privateers under the command of Samuel Moseley were more effective in fighting the Indians than forces practicing traditional European warfare with matchlocks and pikes. Benjamin Church surmised correctly that Philip had vacated his village to gain a better position. Massachusetts forces avoided an encounter with Philip by building a fort and turning against the peaceful Narragansett tribe, (waging preventive war).The conflict became racial, all Indians came to be regarded as foes. By July 1675 the hysteria of war had overtaken new England. Praying Indians, (Indians loyal to the colonists), were held on Deer Island, a concentration camp on an island near Boston. Mary Rowlandson, a minister's wife, wrote a best-selling book about her captivity. Kind acts on her behalf were committed by Philip, but she didn't excuse his role in the war. Benjamin Church deplored enslaving Indians at Dartmouth. (Some people saw slavery as a means of paying for the war.) March 1676 was dreadful. The tide turned in April when the sachem of the Narragansetts, Canonchet, was captured near the Blackstone River with the help of the Praying Indians. Negotiations with the English began at the foot of the Wachusett Mountain, an area north of present day Worcester, because the Indians were winning but were at the same time facing starvation. Rowlandson was released to her great joy, the place of her release being known as Redemption Rock. The friendly Indians were released from Deer Island. Church made an agreement with the Sakonnets that was confirmed by Governor Winslow. Meeting near modern day New Bedford the tribe had a war dance to fight for the English. Philip was killed in an ambush by Church's men. Between 1689 and 1704 Church led five different expeditions against the French and Indians in Maine.The tales and myths relating to the Pilgrims as embodied in the literature of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries are set forth in the epilogue to this wonderful history."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Recently I received \\"Mayflower\\" as a birthday gift from my mother-in-law. Although I read lots of books about history and politics this is probably not a book I would have bought myself. Shame on me. In \\"Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community and War\\" author Nathaniel Philbrick has done a splendid job of clarifying just what happening in New England in the years 1620 to 1676. For sure it is a much more interesting and complicated story than I had ever imagined. From the very first chapter I found \\"Mayflower\\" to be compelling reading.The first part of \\"Mayflower\\" focuses on the voyage itself. Personally I never knew that the Pilgrims had embarked on this journey not from England, but from the city of Leidon in the Netherlands. Nor had I ever heard of the Speedwell, a vessel the Pilgrims had purchased for the express purpose of helping them to relocate to the New World. You will learn why Speedwell was forced to abort its voyage just off the coast of Plymouth, England and how it came to be that the group travelled to the New World aboard the Mayflower.After the long and arduous journey across the Atlantic the Pilgrims endured unimaginable hardships during the first few years on these shores. A large number would perish from disease and starvation during the early days of Plimoth colony. All the while the group would struggle to establish relationships with a number of different native American tribes in the New England area. For me, these complicated and ever changing relationships are really the heart and soul of \\"Mayflower\\". You will come to understand why certain tribes gravitated to and were very supportive of the English while others would prove to be extremely hostile. What's more you will discover why a great many of these alliances were extremely fragile and subject to change. To fully understand what was happening you have to become acquainted with the key players. Philbrick introduces us to important people like William Bradford, Edward Winslow and Benjamin Church as well as key Native American leaders like Massasoit and his son Philip. And if you have never heard of King Philips War you will come to understand why this 14 month battle between the English and Native Americans would prove to be so decisive. The inclusion of a number of large and well-marked maps throughout the book assist the reader in coming to a clear understanding of just what was happening in New England at any given time.When my mother-in-law presented me with \\"Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community and War\\" for my birthday she mentioned that a local newspaper recommended this book as \\"great summer reading\\". I would have to concur. I simply could not put \\"Mayflower\\" down. This is a well written book that deserves your attention. You will learn an awful lot! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"The book takes us through with the cold and damp two-month 1620 voyage of the 102 Pilgrim and Stranger passengers on the Mayflower to Plymouth in the New World. Their story does not end with the First Thanksgiving, but continues on for 55 years, descending into King Philip's War between the colonists and natives. A third of the hundred of so towns in New England were burned and abandoned, and by the end of the war about 5,000 were dead - 75% being natives. In terms of percentage killed, the war was more than twice as bloody as the American Civil War.\\"Mayflower\\" opens with the Pilgrims having already left England (1608) and settled in the more tolerant Holland. Nonetheless, there were occasional incidents of violence, Holland's expiring treat with Spain (fear that the town would be besieged again), and their children were becoming \\"Dutch.\\"With the exception of Jamestown (1607) all other attempts by the English to settle North America had failed. And Jamestown was hardly a great success - 70 of the 108 died the first year, and the following winter brought 440 deaths of 500 settlers. Between 1619 and 1622, 3,000 of 3,600 settlers sent there died.The Pilgrims left Holland on the Speedwell, went first to England to join up with another like-minded group, as well as a separate group of \\"Strangers\\" that were taking the Mayflower. Unfortunately the Speedwell proved leaky (possibly encouraged by a captain who did not want to cross the Atlantic) and had to turn back with the Mayflower. After regrouping, the original group from Holland was only half the total. The \\"good news\\" is that the Pilgrims agreed that whomever was placed in charge would do so based on civil, not religious, leadership - otherwise the groups may not have worked well enough together in Plymouth to have survived.Passenger quarters aboard the 100 foot Mayflower were crowded (about 75 feet long and 20 feet across at the widest), dark, and dripping wet. They were accompanied by 20-30 sailors, a captain, two pilots, a surgeon, and a cooper. The plan was to land at the mouth of the Hudson in early summer - however, delays, storms, and treacherous coastal waters resulted in landing at Plymouth (but not Plymouth Rock) instead.Seven houses (19 families) were built the first year, along with four building for common use; during that time death reduced their numbers by half.The Indians the Pilgrims would later meet had been devastated by diseases brought by earlier Europeans, and their attitudes towards Europeans further poisoned by various instances of treachery - murders, and kidnappings for slavery and exhibit. After almost five months of fear and occasional fleeting brushes, the Pilgrims established diplomatic relations with a local native leader, aided by two Indians who spoke English. All accounts credit the Indians with being responsible for the colony surviving their first winter.Two weeks later the Mayflower returned to England, requiring less than half the time of the original crossing, went to France for a cargo of salt, and returned to England where its captain died. The Mayflower then sat, rotted, and was probably broken up for scrap in 1624.Jealousy among various tribes and their leaders, slights, the steady influx of more settlers, more disease and poverty eventually led to a devastating war between the Indians and settlers. At the end, more than 75% of the Indians were killed, and many of those remaining were shipped to the Caribbean as slaves. Thus ends the \\"Mayflower,\\" one of the first chapters in American history."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"My sister recommended this book.

Bay colony 1630 and Lexington/Concord in 1775. I knew vaguely about King Philip's War and occasional Indian raids on outlying farmsteads, but this new book by Nathaniel Philbrick really fills in the gaps and is a fascinating treatise on what happens when invaders settle in a foreign land.I had not appreciated how decimated the Indians were when the Pilgrims arrived in 1620, which made it a necessity for Massasoit and the Pilgrims to get along with each other. Philbrick writes a wonderfully detailed story of how this relationship evolved over 50 years and how the next generation forgot all that had been learned and killed each other off. The losses on both sides were truly staggering. I am amazed that this story has waited so long for the telling in a most readable and well documented epic book."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"When most of us think of the Pilgrims we hearken back to our days in grammar school for their story - religious freedom, funny hats, an overseas trip on a very small ship, the first Thanksgiving, Squanto and Miles Standish - which in and of itself is all true. The complete Pilgrims' tale is of course much more complex and is told here in an excellent book.The Pilgrims were a separatist group - their goal to return to religious basics - who believed that The Church of England was out of control. Reading the writing on the proverbial wall and understanding they were not welcome in their homeland; the Pilgrims packed their bags and bibles and made their way to Holland. When the option to settle in the New World became a reality, their religious leader, John Robinson, viewed this as an opportunity to begin with a religious clean slate; their sponsors saw a money making proposition and the British government saw an opportunity to compete with France and Spain for a foothold in North America. Such began the trials and adventures of the Pilgrims and where Philbrick picks up their story.The Pilgrims were somewhat nave and taken advantage of even before they boarded the Mayflower, money and valuable time lost before their trip was made. After 65 days on the Atlantic, battling the elements and the sea, they made landfall far north of their destination - Provincetown Bay instead of the mouth of the Hudson River. After nearly losing it all in an attempt to travel down the US coast and in sight of land, the Pilgrims decided Massachusetts wasn't such a bad place after all, the Mayflower Compact was signed and they made their way ashore on November 11th, 1620.This just the beginning of the Pilgrims' story - the next 55+ years are chronicled here - and it's a hell of a read. Literally fighting for their survival, the Pilgrims built a colony from scratch, fighting disease, starvation and the weather. They encountered a political situation amongst the Native American tribes that rivals what they left behind in Europe. (For instance Squanto was not simply the altruistic savior we've come to believe and Massasoit, another sachem or Indian Chief, was much more instrumental in the survival of the Plymouth Colony.)With their survival and subsequent success, the Pilgrims were soon followed by not only fellow religious freedom seekers but those looking to make a financial profit. The culmination of this initial influx of Europeans was the tragic and bloody 14 month clash now known as King Philip's War. (Philip being the son of Massasoit.) This war was not the simple \\"white man versus red man\\" conflict one may think and acquaints us with not just Philip, but men such as Benjamin Church - a courageous soldier who realized annihilating the native population was not the \\"solution\\".This book doesn't so much as rewrite history as clarify it. Not all of it is pretty, but it is fascinating. Mayflower is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Every generation will have its own interpretation of these events and I feel that Philbrick sums up well our generation's viewpoint of the significance of the Mayflower settlement, small pox, King Phillips war, etc. The writing is excellent, and it almost reads like a novel. I grew up in RI, near King Philips seat, and heard stories about him my whole life from my father, an armchair historian. Yet never have I felt so transported to that time and place than when I read this book. I was also a history major in college and don't think I ever read a book covering this period so well. You can see Philbrick has really researched using many primary sources, which is not entirely new, but his take on them has a refreshing modern slant. I did detect some PC interpretations, but on the whole felt he was fair and unbiased. Highly recommend to folks living in the area, brings history to life."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Every November \\"First Thanksgiving\\" experts come out of the wood work; articles appear in newspapers and magazines. Even segments on the evening news will appear retelling the national myth surrounding \\"THE FIRST THANKSGIVING\\". What if, for once, instead of hearing \\"the story we know\\" we could hear \\"the story we need to know\\"?Nathaniel Philbrick vividly brings to life the experience of the immigrant Mayflower passengers as well as the native Americans. It is, he says, \\"a story of courage, community and war\\", but it is also a story of peace and people working together across significant divides. It is a story that spans decades although, as Philbrick points out, for many modern-day Americans American history begins with the Mayflower and moves immediately on to the American Revolution. The years in between are perhaps the most telling however, and comprise the story \\"we need to hear.\\"The immigrants that arrived on the Mayflower in 1620 were not all pilgrims, and those who were arrived in a much different state than their original plans had called for. In the beginning this group of outlaw religious zealots (as they would have been looked upon by most English citizens) formed a single church in Holland (where they had fled to avoid arrest in England). In Holland they realized that while they wanted to be free from the religious laws in England, they still wanted to raise their children as English. The only solution seemed to be to move the congregation to an English colony. While a majority of the congregation voted for this plan, by the time it was implemented less than a quarter of them would actually go, choosing instead to remain in Leiden, Holland. To fill the ships (there were two!) they were forced to allow \\"strangers\\" chosen by the company backing their voyage to accompany them. One of the ships sank and the final passenger list that set sail on the Mayflower was close to 50% pilgrims, 50% strangers.The pilgrims had been able to keep pretty much to themselves in Holland, but they were forced to work closely with the strangers to create their new community. For the pilgrims this was as difficult a step as many envision getting along with the native Americans would have been. They rose to the occasion however and created the Mayflower Compact as a civil authority both the pilgrims and strangers could agree to.Another surprising aspect of the true tale of the Mayflower immigrants is that although they made many mistakes in their first year of relations with the natives, they did forge working relationships and engaged in the political process of the natives themselves. Because Massasoit, the chief sachem of the Pokanokets, had saved their lives the Pilgrims remained politically allied with him and over the next 50 years helped defend his tribe against other tribes numerous times! This is particularly amazing because the Mayflower was not the first ship, or Europeans, the Pokanokets had encountered and the earlier encounters (plural!) left a wake of fear, slavery and well earned distrust.The First Thanksgiving was a gathering of about 150 souls, Pokanokets, pilgrims and strangers. The Pokanokets outnumbered the immigrants nearly 2 to 1. It greatly resembled an English Harvest festival and not at all what the pilgrims would have called a \\"thanksgiving celebration\\" but it was a testimony to the partnership between the two cultures. It would be nice if the story could end on that happy note, but the story did not end then and did ultimately lead to war. This war was called King Philips War and percentage wise was even bloodier than the Civil War. This too is part of the story we need to know.Philbrick's Mayflower is an engaging history and ably utilizes primary documents left by the pilgrims and first generation of settlers while at the same time making the story accessible to 21st century minds. Mayflower is perfect reading material for your Thanksgiving holiday, but if you have a long drive ahead of you, you may want to consider getting the abridged version on cd. Happy Thanksgiving!"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Historian Philbrick's well-researched, well-written account retells the story of the Pilgrims sailing the Mayflower, starting in England, proceeding to Holland, and eventually arriving in today's Massachusetts for what I can only imagine to be the flu and cold season from hell. There's already an English colony in Virginia, a Dutch colony in New Amsterdam, but this is the first English settlement in what would be called the New England area, though it's hardly virgin soil. The land has been colonized and farmed by Native Americans, who have recently suffered a devasting loss of population due to disease, brought by European Traders. Despite this population loss, the Pilgrim settlement is vastly outnumbered and appears to be granted a gracious reprieve from massacre during its first years. Philbrick continues with the story we never learned or celebrated in grade school. 55 years after settling in Plymouth, the British settlers precarious truce with the Native American population collapses, and King Philip's War, a major conflict with ugly episodes follows. The British settlers seem to be on the losing side until they adopt the native population's military style and things turn around for them."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"A number of myths have been spun surrounding the pilgrims who landed on Plymouth Rock ranging from freedom loving dissidents who sought only to worship God as they saw fit to genocidal pioneers propelled by malice to destroy Eden. Of course, since these myths are constructed by people living now with scant regard for facts and are simply engines to express their own political points of view, they are so much rubbish and nonsense.In truth, the pilgrims were probably the most tiresome neighbors you could imagine.They were the sort of people who would run out on Christmas day and confiscate the ball their neighbors were using to play a game called stumps on the grounds God was worried about this. Imagine the reaction of the Native Americans when these bores showed up uninvited and unannounced droning on and on about what rotten people the pilgrims had to put up with. The fact that blows came to gunfire and murder is not surprising.Even the neighboring puritans found the pilgrims to be self-righteous and narrow-minded which is really saying something.In Nathanial Philbrick's Mayflower, the author delves into both the history of the pilgrim's landing in New England and the subsequent fifty years which culminated in the intense and bloody King Philip's War, the first of the major Indian wars in which the English colonists hung onto their homes by the skin of their teeth.However, if the pilgrims weren't so convinced of their own exceptionalism, they would never have embarked on the Mayflower to begin with nor would they have persevered in the new world. For instance, their rock solid certainty that God was on their side allowed them to sail with only half the rations they thought they needed to get through the first year on the Massachusetts coast. They were right but squeaked through anyway. It also allowed them to keep their humor up, but in ways that are unfamiliar to modern ears. For instance, when a sailor with the reputation for swearing constantly suddenly died, the pilgrims took grim satisfaction in the view that everything was as it should be.Sadly, Philbrick's excellent book stumbles slightly at this point when he goes out of his way to make mountains out of mole hills when it comes to the first contacts between the pilgrims and the Indians on Cape Cod. Philbrick makes much out of how the pilgrims stole a store of buried corn soon after landing but later concedes that without this seed corn, the pilgrims would never have survived their second year. This act, Philbrick seems to claim, is the original sin of the colonists in their new Eden.If Philbrick thinks that people who are confronting starvation won't snatch some unguarded food in whatever form, he hasn't been paying attention to his own books. In his account of the whaling ship Essex, he goes into great detail about how the sailors were forced to revert to cannibalism while adrift in the South Pacific and how this was understandable, all things considered. Why he acts as if he is shocked by the pilgrims is disingenuous to say the least.Nevertheless, Philbrick does manage to shoot down the myth that the pilgrims and puritans simply stole the land from the Indians. Or even that the unscrupulous colonists bamboozled the nave Indians into selling their birthright for a pile of trade beads and a tomahawk. Instead, noting that the graves of Indians began to fill with European manufactured goods soon after the arrival of the colonists, he points out that the land transactions suited both sides. The Indians had no other source of European goods and the colonists had no other source of land. Both sides placed equal value on the possessions of the other, and a standard business transaction ensued. Philbrick provides firm evidence the Native Americans were well aware of the meaning of the contracts they signed over the years and willingly embarked on them. In fact so aware of them, some of the Native Americans weren't above double dealing.For instance, King Philip, the leader of the Pokanoket tribe, very deliberately sold every acre his tribe owned in order to raise money to buy flintlock muskets and ammunition. With these weapons, he planned to slaughter the colonists and take back his lands by force. Sadly for him, the war didn't end quite as he planned given that his head wound up stuck on a stake in Plymouth, the pilgrim stronghold.But it was, as I have mentioned, a close run thing. By the end of the King Philip war, the colonists had lost nearly 8% of the men in New England and western Massachusetts was depopulated. By comparison, the bloodiest war in American history, the Civil War, cost the country between 4% and 5% of the male population. The Second World War took slightly less than 1% of the men.The book is an excellent history for anyone who is interested in the real story of the founding of New England."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Nathaniel Philbrick has done an incredible job of telling the story of the traditional birth of America. He has done a ton of research in order to give this book its appropriate charm and interest. The book begins with the pilgrims' way of life in England and Holland including their difficulties trying to get to a world where they can worship God the way that He wants them to. When they arrive, they encounter extreme hardship and troubles with eventual positive ties with the natives that kept them alive through their horrible first years...only to be ruined in the following decades by both parties grandchildren's greed and arrogance leading to King Philip's War.The way Philbrick has put this book together gives the reader a vivid picture of what is must have been like during those rocky years. I highly suggest this book to those who want to learn about the the difficult crossing of the Mayflower, the Pilgrims' ultimate mission, and the way King Philip's War almost lead to an America that never was."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"As a New Englander, I thought I knew the whole story of the Mayflower. As it turns out there is much more to the fantastic story of those first years on this land. Philbrick really brings to life some of the main individuals responsible for the coming together of the Pilgrims and Indians. Some of these same people are also responsible for the end of the realationship. If you're curious to find out more than what we were taught in school, please pick up this book. Names such as Massasoit, Church, Standish, King Philip, and Bradford to name a few will have new meaning to you. I've already moved on to another one of Philbrick's books, I enjoyed his writing so much. Trust me, you won't be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Knowing I am a history buff, my professor son gave me this book as a gift.

It is a real \\"Keeper.\\" I also bought it for Christmas gifts. It's one of the most interesting books I've read in quite a while. It will make you appreciate America (and the courage of the early settlers) more than ever. My thanks to Nathanlel Philbrick for writing this book."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"As the Pilgrims recede in time, our sense of them ossifies into a series of Norman Rockwell tableaux. Enjoying a bounteous Thanksgiving feast in their Plymouth redoubt. Learning how to plant corn from the wise and generous Squanto. Living a pious, industrious life in a land of peace and abundance. In this brisk, well-told history of seventeenth century New England, Nathaniel Philbrick pulls the first fifty years of the Plymouth colony into sharper focus, and dispels many cherished myths in the process.The Thanksgiving holiday that Americans celebrate in November was started by Abraham Lincoln in 1863 as a distraction from the Civil War. The Pilgrims did have a celebratory feast in September or early October 1621, but the many Indian guests in attendance gave it more of a pagan than Christian feel. Squanto turns out to have been a Henry Kissinger-like diplomat, cunning and duplicitous, taking every opportunity to manipulate the colony's delicate balance of power for his tribe's advantage. The land was abundant, but only if you had the tradecraft to exploit it. Plymouth barely survived its infancy because so many of the first settlers starved, froze or fell prey to influenza or the flux. In the early years, the gun was as important as the Good Word. Governor Bradford organized the colony along military lines under Miles Standish. Before long, Standish marched north and massacred several unsuspecting Indians of the Massachusetts tribe at a coastal site in present-day Weymouth, launching America's long, shameful history of aboriginal genocide.But it was diplomacy rather than military prowess that enabled the colony to get past its shaky start. The early settlers under Governor Bradford forged and worked hard to maintain an alliance with the sachem Massoit, who gave them advice and protection from other tribes. Despite some misunderstandings (and the depredations of the bloodthirsty Standish), the Indians and Pilgrims generally managed to coexist during the colony's first fifty years. The two cultures traded, socialized, and adopted each other's technology. Amity ended with the eruption of King Phillip's War in 1675.The casualties were enormous. Between the men lost in battle, the women and children slaughtered, and the Indians sold into slavery, the New England tribes lost half their population in two years. Plymouth Colony lost eight percent of its men (America lost 1% of its adult male population in World War II). The Pilgrims didn't defeat the Indians through superior strategy or fighting skill: they had better supply chains. They simply chased the Indians around New England in a fairly feckless way until Phillip and the other Indians ran out of food and ammunition. The economy of the Plymouth colony took almost a century to get back to where it was before the war.Everybody lost, and the historical question is why this bloody and wasteful hostility had to happen. Part of it, as always, was a failure of empathy and diplomacy. Governor Winslow was tone deaf to the Indian's anguish over losing land they needed for hunting and planting to the encroaching colonists. In some sense, though, the answer is as basic as physics. Two bodies can't occupy the same space at the same time. The first fifty years of Plymouth colony offered hope that the two cultures would find ways to coexist on the continent. King Phillip's war shattered that optimism forever.Philbrick displays fine insight into the physical and psychological hardships faced by the early settlers, and he ably delineates the complex relationships and rivalries among New England's Indian tribes. What's clear from his story is that right from the start of the American experience, there existed that strange brew of piety, violence and opportunism that continues to define us."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I picked this up on the recommendation of a friend and was not disappointed. The number one reason why is best summed up by a quote near the end of the book: \\"In the American popular imagination, the nation's history began with the Pilgrims and then leapfrogged more than 150 years to Lexington and Concord and the Revolution.\\" (my apologies to another review, Dakota, I think, who said the same thing before I did - but Dakota was right). I just didn't know much about that period of American history and once I started reading this book I wondered at my own ignorance. How didn't I know how American grew from a single precarious colony or two to a proto-nation capable of winning a war against the greatest empire on earth? Where was I in American history classes? Or did my classes gloss over this period?My guess is this period WAS glossed over a little bit, because it is not a pretty history. An amazing story of trust and diplomacy in the first 20-30 years after the landing of the Mayflower (including some shrewd politicking) is followed by a hardening and callousness that is appalling to me. What happened, very briefly, is that the original colonists from the Mayflower found a way to live with the local populations (Native Americans) DESPITE the differences and fears. They actively worked to learn to trust one another. And the survival of the Plymouth colony was almost entirely due to one Indian Sachem deciding to give us a chance.Now that sachem, Massasoit, did not save the pilgrims solely out of unadulterated altruism, but nonetheless we should clearly remember that the pilgrims survived because he took risks to save us. And the pilgrims of that first generation DID remember that debt and honored it. 50 years later, however, the situation was reversed, and the Pilgrims were now in a position of power and the sad truth, told well by Philbrick, is that we quite purposefully chose to abandon our allies, took advantage of them, and drove them to war.The callousness, and lack of wisdom and foresight, of that second generation of colonists led directly to what became known as King Phillip's War. According to Philbrick, King Phillp's War was the bloodiest and costliest in our Nation's history. He cites some amazing statistics showing that it took DECADES for America to get back to the standard of living enjoyed before the war. There are some other episodes hard to read: our ancestors chose to send Native American women and children into slavery, chose to let them die of starvation and disease, and basically allowed cruel and terrible things to happen.Philbrick does not simply descend into \\"America-bashing\\" however. His retelling and commentary are balanced. He gives equal time to Indian atrocities and poor decision-making by Indian leaders. He makes it clear that although it seems crazy to us, many on both sides simply wanted war. However, the overriding theme is still clear: we (our ancestors) chose to destroy another people because it benefited us and was easy to do. We ignored our debt to them and ignored the morally right path in exchange for economic gain and allowing ourselves to satisfy our prejudices and basest emotions.All-in-all, a great book; well-written, well-researched, and intellectually honest.I said in my title that it was a cautionary tale and it is. There are obvious parallels to our \\"little adventure\\" in Iraq. We are in Iraq, and our young men and women as well as innocent Iraqi's, are being killed and hurt because our leaders took the easy paths. And we let them. We let ourselves get fired up with false patriotism and false indignation and got ourselves led to war for flimsy (or non-existent) reasons. Once again, we took the easy way out. Mayflower shows clearly the paradox I see in America: that we are an amazing, wonderful nation; built on nobel ideals, protected with the blood of true patriots, and peopled by great men and women who work hard, sacrifice, and make the world a better place. But we are also a nation that shuts our minds and hearts to other cultures, get murderously angry over tiny insults, and are willing to be lied to by our leaders and go to war rather than think hard about difficult problems. Mayflower is a timely reminder of both the promise and greatness of America and the darknesses in the American heart.From a technical perspective, the writing is excellent, the narrative compellling. The pages flow by easily. I'm not knowledgeable enough to comment on its authenticity, but it certainly seems very well-researched.There were a few things that annoyed me: the maps are good, but are not placed well - they seem to greatly preceed or follow the sections they are needed for. There are great end notes, but (it's a personal thing) I would find them more useful as footnotes. The narrative is a tiny bit choppy - the \\"story\\" switches characters and episodes a little more than I would like. Finally, to steal from Dakota again, the book could really use a reference that summarized and grouped all the players; there are a lot of tribes and leaders and towns to keep track of.I heartily recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"The story of the Pilgrims is a familiar one. Struggling for religious freedom, a small group of Puritans left their homes and traveled to the New World where they hoped to build a new life. Arriving in New England, they were saved from hunger and the cold of winter by friendly Native Americans. They celebrated by starting the tradition of Thanksgiving. Actually, that isn't quite the way it happened. First, less than half the passengers of the Mayflower were Puritans. And it wasn't really religious freedom they were struggling for but rather the ability to force everyone to follow their religion. Ultimately, the Pilgrims did make friends with the Native Americans but it was not an easy change for them to accept the \\"heathen\\" and not all tribes in the area were friendly.But this book is not simply about those first few years in the New World. Just one generation after the arrival of the Pilgrims, just 100 years before Lexington and Concord, the bloodiest war in the history of North America was fought. King Philip's War saw the slaughter of 15% of the Native Americans in New England with many more sent off to the Caribbean into slavery. The Pilgrim population was also decimated (one in ten white men died) leaving the Pilgrims poorer and less able to defend themselves ultimately forcing them to ask for a Royal Governor to protect them.This book is the story of how the children of the Pilgrims ignored the lessons learned by their parents and turned against the Native Americans who had saved the Pilgrims from starvation and how by doing so, they ultimately ruined themselves. Philbrick tells the story clearly and looks at events from the side of the settlers as well as the Native peoples. The narrative takes us through the period of peace, acceptance, and accommodation between the original Pilgrims and the Native Americans to a period where the Pilgrims looked upon the Native Americans as their inferiors. Native Americans sell their land to buy guns in order to make war. The children of the Pilgrims arrest and sell into slavery Native Americans on the slightest provocation or evidence. And both sides are drawn into the inevitable war that no one really wanted. Philbrick makes the story fascinating by bringing to life many of the characters on both sides. Whether it is 1620 when the Pilgrims are just landing or 1675 when the war breaks out, Philbrick makes the story highly readable by making the story about the lives of real people.The book is not without flaws. The pictures are of mostly poor quality and unless you are familiar with the geography of New England it is difficult to follow the movement of the various peoples during the war. However, Philbrick does a nice job of showing how the events of the 17th century were critical in creating the United States that we know today. Overall, this was a very good book that is well worth being on your reading list."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"The title is a trifle misleading. The book covers the Mayflower Pilgrims of 1620, but the bulk of the book is about the Indian wars of 1675-1690 when an Indian revolt throughout New England killed thousands of white settlers, and ended up decimating the Indians of that area. It told me a lot of things that I had not known about and put Plymouth in perspective with the rest of New England. This is well worth reading, despite the title. I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Most of us know about the Pilgrims from our history and civics classes. Or at least we have the Thanksgiving imagery--oven-roasted turkeys, linen tablecloths, silverware, Indians, stern-looking white men with buckles on their hats, stuffing, mashed potatoes, and cranberry sauce.Well, that's about it, then.No, just kidding. In reality, the second English permanent settlement, consisting of Puritan Separationists, was lucky to have survived the first winter of 1620.And the main benefit derived from the Indians was the Indians' forbearance from annihilating the Pilgrims.Sometime in the fall of 1621, the Pilgrims did prosper sufficiently to feast on ducks, wild turkey, fish and grains made into pottages (stews). The first what we call Thanksgiving was overwhelmingly an Indian affair as more than 100 Pokanokets (twice the population of the Pilgrims) arrived at the settlement with five freshly killed deer.Everyone stood or squatted around outdoor cooking fires eating with their fingers and knives--forks did not arrive until the 1670s. (Check out this stylish clip art presumably designed to convey Turkey Day history to the Britney Spears set.)The voyage of slightly more than 100 people on the single ship required two arduous months, and winter was coming harsh and early. After wandering around the Cape Cod peninsula for a while, the settlers decided on Plymouth (named for the town they departed from in England) as their new home.Smartly, both the Pilgrims and the Indian tribe who lived closest to the Plymouth settlement, the Pokanoket, determined peace and cooperation would be best. The Pilgrims were running out of living people. The Pokanoket and chief Massosoit planned to forge an alliance with the English against other tribes.Philbrick writes another descriptive history that reads like a novel. He won an award for his previous work, In the Heart of the Sea, a story of Nantucket and the ill-fated journey of the whaling ship Essex. The period he covers in Mayflower is roughly 1620 through 1680, through the King Philip War that began in 1675--King Philip was an Indian leader.I appreciate learning the background and the unvarnished truth of the most prolific of the all-American \\"starter kit.\\" According to Philbrick, it is estimated that 35 million Americans (in 2002)are descendants of the Mayflower passengers....For my complete review of this book and for other book and moviereviews, please visit my site [...]Brian WrightCopyright 2007"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This is an interesting and fascinating book for any one interested in the real, historical, Mayflower story."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Outstanding piece of work that makes history read like a novel leading the reader to a new and deeper understanding and appreciation of the Pilgrims, the Puritans, and those who settled this country...It wasn't easy and they almost didn't make it, but therein lies the story, and, to a great extent, the greatness of this country.This work humanizes the Pilgrims and gives them flesh and blood and makes them human--not pictures on a felt board.

Author Nathaniel Philbrick does students of American history a great service by providing depth and character to the stick figures that American culture has made of the Pilgrims and the native tribes of Massachusetts.As with his earlier works, \\"Heart of the Sea\\" and \\"Sea of Glory\\" Philbrick digs deep, managing to uncover and share enough details to sate the serious reader without boring the causal one.\\"Mayflower's\\" greatest contribution is to give the native tribes and their key figures their due. Literally for centuries Indians have played the role of foils to the white man in history books and popular culture usually portrayed as either woefully ignorant, cruelly viscous or both. Philbrick does the simple service of writing of them and their actions as if flesh and blood equals to the newcomers from Europe. Consequently the story of the Pilgrim's early struggles, their eventual success and of course their battles with the natives can now be seen with a proper perspective.(No Philbrick does not sentimentalize the natives, this, as any good history should be, is a warts and all account of everyone.)From any perspective the survival of the early settlers from Europe is a remarkable one. The battles against disease alone could have done away with them all. Further they had to figure out the vagaries of New England's climate and soil while fending off starvation and exposure. The fact that anyone made it through the first few winters seems pure fiction.Moreover the settlers wrestled with power struggles, personality clashes and differing philosophies that were aggravated by strident religious beliefs. Yet common purposes and steady leaders prevailed.What an existence with death visiting so regularly, violence prevalent and strange exotic cultures living in such close proximity. And what a job Philbrick does of telling it!This is a story rich with characters, some familiar such as, Squanto (turns out he was quite the conniver) and Miles Standish and other less well known like the servant miraculously pulled from the Atlantic on the voyage over who went on to sire ten children and have 88 grandchildren!\\"Mayflower\\" takes us from the years preceding the famous journey of 1620 through the colonies' struggles to survive, the arrival of still more and more Europeans and the devastating clashes with the natives, which culminated with King' Philip's War.Philbrick, ever the myth-buster, is a consummate researcher and presents the story in such a matter of fact manner as to leave any of his own biases a complete mystery. That I don't find him the most colorful and entertaining writer is a mere trifle it is not the sort of thing that will decrease the average reader's enjoyment of this important book.Lastly I can't overstate how great it is that this book is replete with maps -- lots of them.

The story is not black and white. People of white descent will not find comfort in the facts Philbrick brings forth, but neither will people of Indian descent. The Indians turned on each other when they should have joined against the \\"invaders,\\" and the whites lived up to modern PC stereotypes of white culture--dangerously shortsighted and self-centered. Philbrick has the historical documents to back up his claims, even if his claims hit a little too close to home for some people. So if you want a detailed picture of what it took for the Pilgrims to survive in the \\"new world,\\" and the cost to the Indians, this is the book for you. And if you don't like what Philbrick has to say, then that says more about you than about the book."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I never give reviews but if you are interested enough to look at a review of this book you need to read it."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Turkey and dressing shared by Pilgrims and Indians is the basic tale that school kids get out of the Mayflower story. But fifty-five years of trial and tribulation on the part of both Puritans and native peoples is the dramatic reality detailed in this epic by Nathaniel Philbrick.An engrossing story, both herioc and tragic, Mayflower is a great companion read with Savage Kingdom by Benjamin Woolley which narrates the establishment of the Jamestown settlement that predates The Mayflower landing by three years."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"The history presented by Nathaniel Philbrick is very interesting and gives a person a more personable view of the Mayflower families and times (as well as of the Indians in New England).

This is an exceptional treatment...very engaging and clear. The number of Indian tribes, the various Pilgrims, Puritans, etc. can be a real mess to understand. And of course, there is usually a biased or pointed perspective you have to deal with. Philbrick has genuine regard for the good on both the English side and the various Indian sides and heartfelt disdain for the vicious and stupid acts on both sides that caused this war and ultimately turned it into a 14 month blood bath throughout New England. Makes me want to do some real research here in my New Hampshire home town."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Every American teen should read this book.

As stated by many, MAYFLOWER should've been titled KING PHILIP'S WAR or PLYMOUTH, and mostly concerns the Indian Wars of the mid/late 17th century.

This was a much more enhanced version than the one I learned in elementary school. Getting in the boat, leaving your family which sometimes included your children and not knowing what you were facing when you got to the \\"new\\" world must have taken great courage. And I have a new respect for what the native American indians went through when \\"we\\" arrived. Step back in time and learn what true courage means."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I read this author's other book \\"Into the Sea\\" and found it an incredible page turner. Wanting more of the same, I was drawn to \\"Mayflower\\" thinking it would be a day-by-day chronicle of life aboard the ship. Much to my surprise, the Mayflower lands by page 70 and is barely mentioned again. What follows is a detailed and engrossing story of survival in the new land which holds your interest for quite a while. But once the Plymouth colony is established, the book becomes very sprawling and a lot harder to follow. Instead of staying with a small cast of characters, you're bouncing up and down the coast. If you're looking for the \\"story of courage\\" advertised in the subhead of the book, you might be a little let down after 200 pages or so...."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Most of what I knew about my Hopkin's lineage I learned from family lore and Mayflower Society information. Nathaniel Philbrick brings the world of the Mayflower survivors to life in his incredible work, MAYFLOWER. It is a fair and balanced look at the conflicting interests of the \\"English,\\" and the native people whose cultures clashed from the moment the pilgrims set foot on shore. Stephen Hopkins and his associates held on with a very thin thread from the moment they landed in their new world. I am grateful to Philbrick for giving me the vivid color and intimacy of that world.It is important for our national history to understand the desperation and racism, religious bigotry and cultural polarization that set the native and pilgrim worlds against each other. The truth is that if not for the grace and understanding of native culture, their personal understanding and compassion, my family history may have been written as a disaster in Plymouth colony."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"The pilgrims were not saints and neither were the indians. Both were doing what they needed to do to insure their survival. This story tells us in a very well written and entertaining way, why the Mayflower had people trying to stop its voyage, why the people on it sailed to begin with, and what they did when they arrived here. Other reviews cover about everything I planned to, except most neglect to point out that this book carries the reader through the end of King Philip's (an indian) War.This is an excellent book that entertains as well as enlightens. Good history and good reading."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This work is divided into four sections: Discovery, Accommodation, Community, and War. It successfully relates the religious context, voyage, landing, colonial establishment, neighboring colonies (Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut), and - most important - native context and relations 1620-76.If you want a narrow account of the ship, passengers, and voyage this is not for you (though you could do much worse). If you want a readable history that profiles principals (Bradford, Standish, Winslow, Church, et. al.), Plymouth's establishment, and colonial action through King Philip's War this is your book.Philbrick's lucid text compares favorably with his previous work (\`In the Heart of the Sea,' \`Sea of Glory'). Questions are raised in a wide context (what did natives think of colonists,what were their relations with other native nations and other colonies)? What role did religion play (\`Praying Indians,' preemption vs faithful accommodation)? How did interrelated colonial governance develop?Read this and decide for yourself.Also recommended: \`The Name of War' Jill Lepore (King Philip's War 1675-6), \`In the Devil's Snare' Mary Beth Norton (The Salem Witch Trials; 1691), \`Captors and Captives' Haefeli & Sweeney (The Deerfield Raid 1704)."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Overall, the book is worth reading. However, one does not have to read too far to notice the bias, subtle, at first, that Philbrick continually harbors against the English colonists. This anti-European bias continues throughout, ever-increasing until the end.There were, of course, many fascinating historical points that Philbrick recounted, including that European diseases had devastated New England natives in the period from about 1616 to 1619; these diseases were likely brought over by European fishing vessels that plied the coastal waters in vast numbers long before the arrival of the Mayflower in 1620. Although unsaid, my take is that violent annihilation would have been the eventual fate of the colonists had this not first occurred.If any revised edition of the book is issued in the future, perhaps Philbrick might rethink his unoriginal complaint concerning insufficient payment for native lands. All compensation was entirely pocketed by selfish tribal sachems (chiefs) at the expense of the tribal communities that completely relied on those lands for subsistence. More could have been paid, but paying more would have only further enriched greedy rulers recklessly selling off the heritage and livelihood of their subjects. Regardless of the price paid, the general population saw none of it."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Really enjoyed the fictional perspective on the happenings around the Mayflower times.

It was nice to find this approachable, easy to read yet in depth look at the Mayflower and one of the first settlements in the US."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This was just a joy to read. Early New England is one of my favorite topics and this book had the best narrative about the first years of the pilgrims and the bitter conflict 50 years later. Philbrick takes a lot of things into account when writing this book so you get to hear a little bit of everything while also hearing a concise story. Its also well researched and non bias for the most part (since history book can really be 100% unbias). The Pilgrims of the first generation were portrayed in generally a good light but with references to their flaws which made them human. Massasoit similarity is also mentioned from the Indians perspective as a traitor, the first mention of him in this light I have ever read but it is a good analogy.If you want a good narrative history of the first 50 or so years of the pilgrims and Plymouth colony this book is for you. The only complaints are that the book focuses too much on Plymouth sometimes making the other New England colonies as background players but, the same happens with the other Indians of New England. The book focuses on Plymouth colony and the pokanoket tribe. There is nothing wrong with this though. It in fact helps ground the story from becoming too far reaching."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Loved this book and learned a great deal about the beginnings of our country.

Should be required reading in our high schools."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I am a Nathaniel Philbrick fan, both in his subject choices and style of storytelling. I would rate \\"In the Heart of the Sea\\" slightly better than the \\"Mayflower\\" but just slightly.If you pick up this book thinking that he is writing another seafarer's story as in the Heart of the Sea, you will be disappointed. The title is misleading. Philbrick takes the Pilgrim voyage of the Mayflower as his starting point but leads you far beyond as he recounts the history of Plymouth Colony. He devotes a lot of attention to describing the symbiotic and antagonistic relationships between the native Americans and the Pilgrims. That is, of course, at the heart of understanding the first Thanksgiving, the settlements, the displacement of Indians, King Phillip's ill fated war with the colonists and the first 70 years of colonization.There are 7 maps included by the author, without which it would be a little difficult to follow the story replete with native American location names and geographic descriptions. There are also images of some of the primary historical figures cited in the book. In historical narratives that span generations, the extra effort and expense by publishers to include visual references dispels unnecessary confusion and is appreciated by readers.You will not find exhaustive treatment of historical figures such as Miles Standish or Governor William Bradford. Philbrick weaves them into his panoramic view so that you get an accurate context and an idea of the interplay between individuals, ideas, personalities and world views in the colonization of the New World and the reaction of various Indian leaders and their clans.I found extra value in the identification of historical places of moment that exist in the area today, offering avenues of additional web research and interesting places to visit. Thanks Nathaniel for mentioning those things as you go along.This is our story of how we came to be Americans. Understanding it accurately and not romantically strengthens who we are and does not diminish the heroic nature of the struggle or denigrate any involved.

As a native of Natick, and one who learned (believe it or not) little of the history of 17th century Massachusetts (more than likely my fault as much as the education system), I was rivited by the personalities of those who founded Plymouth, the very complex relationships between the native peoples with the Pilgrims, and sadness of the events of the King Philip's War. The shorter historical summaries I have read of 17th century MA have too often tried to put the attitudes of Pilgrims and Indians into a neat box."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This writer brings one face to face with the realities endured by the Mayflower party and dispels myths and misconceptions in a most gripping and fascinating work."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Fellow Brunonian Nathaniel Philbrick's popular history of the Plymouth Colony, \\"Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War\\", is yet another spellbinding tale of nonfiction by the author of \\"In the Heart of the Sea\\", for which it should earn recognition from the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize. This is the best work of popular American history I have read since David McCullough's \\"1776\\", and like McCullough's book, it is both an instant literary and historical classic; one which casts aside the popular American mythology of the founding of the Plymouth Colony in favor of a more gripping, historically accurate, account of the colony's founding and its early history. Much to his credit Philbrick offers a thoughtful, quite balanced, overview of the Pilgrims and their Indian neighbors, especially the Pokanokets, with whom they would have an uneasy, yet mutually beneficial, alliance with the tribe and its sachem (chief) Massasoit for over fifty years until Philip, Massasoit's son, started the bloody conflict barely remembered today as King Philip's War. Philbrick's riveting account steers clear of historical revisionism, by offering a complex history of the Pilgrims and their American Indian neighbors. He also blames two individuals, Josiah Winslow, Governor of the Plymouth Colony, and Philip, for starting an unnecessary bloody conflict which killed thousands and severely crippled New England's economy for nearly a century. But \\"Mayflower\\" is not just a riveting history devoted solely to these individuals; it is instead, a gripping saga revolving primarily around the careers of William Bradford, Plymouth Colony's long-time governor, and author of \\"Of Plymouth Plantation\\", his riveting account of the colony's founding, and Benjamin Church, the tenacious frontiersman and Indian fighter, who would use both his excellent knowledge of American Indian culture and his friendship with local tribes to win the final battles of King Philip's War.Philbrick argues persuasively that Pokanoket and Pilgrim leaders realized the desirability of having strong ties between their communities. For Massasoit and his Pokanokets, alliance with the Pilgrims gave them a technical edge over their traditional rivals, Narraganssetts, who regarded the Pokanoket sachem as an impoverished vassal ruling over a tribe recently decimated by European diseases. Philbrick suggests that Massasoit was strongly motivated by Squanto's own ill-fated - and ultimately fatal - attempt in gaining power as the region's most important sachem, relying on Machiavellian diplomacy On the other hand, the Pilgrims thought that their alliance would ensure peace between themselves and the largest, most important, tribe of local Algonquin-speaking American Indians. Despite such misconceptions, not only did their alliance flourish, but it allowed New England eventually to become a bicultural community with closely intertwined relationships between American Indian and English communities by the eve of King Philip's War, more than fifty years after the founding of the Plymouth Colony.So why did New England become the locale for one of the bloodiest wars ever fought in North America, King Philip's War? One major reason may have been Philip's hostility towards Josiah Winslow, blaming Winslow for causing the untimely death of his older brother Alexander, in July, 1762, shortly after arresting Alexander for refusing to appear in court. Yet another reason was the sale of Indian lands to the English colonists, rapidly shrinking the Pokanokets' territory. But maybe the most important reason was the lack of trust between both peoples, in stark contrast to the amicable relationship that had developed between Massassoit and the founders of the Plymouth Colony, most notably his lifelong friendship with Edward Winslow, a splendid diplomat acting in the interests of both peoples (He was also the father of Josiah Winslow, who lacked his father's keen, warm-hearted interest in the Pokanokets and other local American Indian tribes.). Tragically, it was this lack of trust between the English colonists and many of the local tribes, including those who had converted to Christianity, which hastened the start of the unnecessary, bloody conflict remembered as King Philip's War. By ending \\"Mayflower\\" with the saga of King Philip's War, Philbrick has offered us a tantalizing glimpse of a potential American future that had peaceful co-existence between American Indian and European communities; a cautionary tale which may be useful to us in the wake of contemporary issues related to immigration and waging war against a nebulous Islamofascist foe."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"My American history education starts with the landing of the Pilgrims and then jumps to the Revolution, leaving a dark gap between. MAYFLOWER shines a light on the first fifty-five years of that little-known period with a focus on King Philip's War, which caused more casualties as a percentage of the population than any war in our history. Essentially, Mr. Philbrick tells the story of how the English got a foothold in a strange land, overcoming starvation, disease, bitter winters and hostile Indians. The Indian side of the story is told with empathy but objectivity. MAYFLOWER removes the layers of myths about this period that have conviently covered over and prettied up what was, in reality, a harsh and unromantic time. Neither side can stand without guilt; both the English and natives were guilty of hideous atrocities. Pushed aside, the natives sought to eliminate the Pilgrims with hatchet and musket and reclaim lands taken from them. The English responded brutally, seeing an opportunity to grab even more land. The result of King Philip's War, of course, was the the removal of natives from their land by killing them or selling them into slavery. It was a brutal time that makes how America treats its enemies today look like kindergarten play."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"From the perspective of someone who was born and grew into adulthood in Southeastern Massachusetts and who has lived in Duxbury (where Myles Standish, John Alden and others moved after the Plymouth Bay Colony began to fill),Philbrick's work is an eye-opening dose of reality that provides a long overdue counterpoint to the idealized stories that were provided in grammar school and told and retold in the local press. As a side benefit, the book provides ample fodder with which to skewer those self-righteous members of the Mayflower Society when they deserve it."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This book is a very rewarding well written history on a topic I thought I knew more than enough about. I was surprised by how much I learned, some minor details other signifigant historical events which are left out of most history textbooks. Modern Americans seem to equate the Puritan settlers of this era as foreign to modern America. In reading Mayflower you reattach the humanity that links pre-revolutionary America to modern America."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"When the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth they founded a religious settlement that succeeded against the odds and lived in peace with the Native Americans for decades. This was a remarkable achievement for the 1700s. William Bradford was largely responsible for leading the settlement during this time and maintaining good relations with the Indians through his relationship with Massasoit and Squanto. In this book, the author briefly tells the story of the Pilgrims' travels to the New World and their early settlement under Bradford's leadership. Unfortunately only about 1/3 of the book deals with this part of the story. The other two thirds deals with the tragedy of King Philip's War between the Native Americans and settlers which occurred over 50 years after the founding of Plymouth and which lasted 14 months. Of course, the outcome of the war shaped New England for many years to come and set the standard for English-Indian relations. Viewed from our modern politically correct perspective, the English were at fault and the Indians were the victims. However, to someone living at that time and place the perspective would be much different. I thought the book was well-written, informative and interesting. In criticism, the book was overly focused on the bad done by the Pilgrims, did not give them credit for the good, and excused everything done by the Native Americans. The history is really more complex than that. Overall a good book, if somewhat unbalanced."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Would have preferred more maps, a Summary timeline of key events and Summary of all key individuals, especially relationships of all the Indian tribes and geographical locations.

Naturally, I expected the MAYFLOWER book to be about the voyage of the pilgrims and all that they experienced crossing the ocean to a new world.However, that is not necessarily the case.Yes, the book covers the Mayflower voyage, but all references to the Mayflower end by page 100, and the rest of the book (200 pages) is devoted to the Puritan's war with the Indians, referred to as \\"King Philip's War.\\"Does this mean the book is terrible? No, not at all. The book is extremely interesting, and I found myself completely fascinated by the story of the Pilgrims THAT I DIDN'T KNOW.One of my favorite quotes from MAYFLOWER is found in its conclusion: \\"In the American popular imagination, the nation's history began with the Pilgrims and then leapfrogged more than 150 years to Lexington and Concord and the Revolution.\\"For me, that is so true. I visited Massachusetts this summer for the first time, hoping to see all the well-known historical sites, places like Bunker's Hill in Boston, Plymouth Rock, and (yes) Lexington and Concord. Not once did I consider the Indians of the region or any of the history outside of the spot where the Mayflower landed or where the first shot of the Revolution was fired. After reading this book, I want to go back to Massachusetts and revisit the places I've been, now looking at it from the perspective of Puritans and Indians engaged in a terrible battle for survival.Some of the positives about this book:1. The prose is easy to read and follow.2. It covers the history/culture of both Puritans and Native Americans in the New England region from about 1620-1680.3. It includes nice maps and photos for reference.Some of the negatives:1. About 100 pages are devoted to notes.2. There are so many characters/Indian tribes that it can get confusing. And, unfortunately, the 100 pages of notes don't include a glossary listing these people and why they are important.3. The book is not really about the Mayflower voyage itself, but rather about the results of Pilgrims and others like them coming to the new world.Anyway, I still enjoyed this book and will be recommending it to others to read, especially teenagers studying American history. If King Philip's War was covered at all in my high school history texts, it must have been a brief reference, because I didn't know anything about it until I read this book."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Okay, I moved to Plymouth 3 years ago and well I got tired of not knowing what really happened. Of course, trying to find out has been very difficult. I was so happy to see this book, maybe a bit naive, but I thought it would clear things up for me. And it did! I felt it gave a balanced approach and a much more believable account of what really happened. The romantic Thanksgiving story is so worn out. Human nature, being what it is, also does not account for the story that all the White people wanted was Native annihilation. The documentation of the research Philbrick did was impressive and comforting too. In an effort to fact check, I went to Plimoth Plantation and talked with the Native Americans about their feelings about the book. I was told that Philbrick only accepted written accounts for his research. Is that really true? Without having a written language, the only way the Native American's could pass along their information was through oral history. If Philbrick did not accept this history than it makes this story very one-sided. While I agree, oral history would make his job more difficult, he would have a responsibility to let us, the readers, know that he did not accept oral history. He does mention this very briefly and vaguely on page 360-361, which in my opinion is buried. When I went to the gift shop to look at the books they recommended, suspicioulsy missing was this very book. Just know if you purchase this book, some vital Native information may be missing. Check out the blogs at Plimoth Plantation and ask the Native American Representatives yourself.The title of this book is wrong and yes, misleading. I didn't realize the book would cover 80 years of history. While initially disappointed, in the end I very much appreciated it. This book explains clearly what is confusing to so many. How did they even survive? How did this historically anti-social group become friendly with the Natives. The details revealed in the book not only explain how these things happen but make a great deal of sense. Philbrick suggests that Massassoit may have believed the Pilgrims has the ability to unleash the plague at-will. As so many of his tribe had recently been desimated by the plague it makes sense that he would have treaded a bit lighly around the Pilgrims. It also makes sense to me that with reduced warriors and with other Native enemies at his door-step that Massassoit would partner with the Pilgrims. That they made a mutually supportive arrangement is not a surprise. But what happens next is more telling about American's and our history. In a story repeated throughout every generation and every people's is the saga about not learning from the previous generation. The Pilgrims spawn forgot about religion and embraced property. Greed, not a new tale, is repeated on a grand scale. With the loss of great leadership and an inability to band together, the Natives have difficulty fighting back. Philbrick also talks about the Natives own attraction to English ways, baubles, and conveniences. This rings true to me and while Natives might not like it, allows for some of the future confusion. The author seems balanced to me. I especially appreciated Philbrick's note on how, when white people were at war around the world, their documented atrocities were more brutal than the \\"savages\\" in the new world. He also talks about the relationships that some of the Natives made with the Pilgrims that caused them to support the Pilgrims instead of the Natives. It is very believable that conflicts were not strickly race related. The coverage of all of these years, gave me a much more thorough appreciation for what happened here in Plymouth.As mentioned by other readers, the account in the story about Church is very unbelievable and reads more like a comic book hero. At the Plantation, they told me a lot of Philbrick's information about Church was written by Church's son and not the man himself. I do not know if this is true or not, but it would account for Church's superhero stories. In fact, as I was reading, I very much enjoyed those very stories. I couldn't believe Hollywood hadn't rolled out many movies, as so many of Church's accounts could produce multiple blockbuster action films that I would LOVE to see. Maybe not true, but definetly entertaining! The story about being pinned down and outnumbered by Natives, Church survives by sending his men, two at a time, by canoe out to a waiting shalloop. He then forgets his belongings, so makes a return trip, retrieves this things and escapes back to the boat. Indiana Jones anyone? Did I mention he had no ammunition? Or that no one was hurt? This was supposedly under constant fire from the Natives. It is hard to believe.Yes, lots of characters sometimes hard to follow. Yes, very little info on the trip over. Great info on why they came in the first place. However, even with more questions, I do love this book. It has led me to read other first account books and continue my search for what really happened. If you read this book and take it as 100% factual, I think it is a 3. If you read this book for great insight, mostly accurate, and it leads you to other research, I give it a 5. In fact, I am going to read it again!"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This look at New England from the Pilgrim settlement to King Philip's War is a triumph. Philbrick informs, he entertains, he tickles your funnybone, and he tugs at your hearstrings. He respects the truth as it is, not as either blinkered patriots or censorious leftists would like it to be. And he seeks to make history useful, to find lessons in it for our world today, a most unfashionable practice among historians today.Philbrick starts out with a new interpretation of the Pilgrims' motives for coming to the New World. It wasn't religious freedom, which they already had in Leyden and which they vigorously denied to all dissenters. Nor was it the desire to enforce religious conformity, although they certainly did that. The Pilgrims' motive was nationalism, a desire to keep their congregation from becoming Dutch and preserve their Englishness, in the only available place claimed by the English crown but beyond the reach of the English church: America.The story of the voyage and the initial Pilgrim settlement is well told, although it told very little that was new to me. The real treasure of the first half of the book was its intricate analysis of the internal politics of the Indians, as well as the Pilgrims' relationship with them. Philbrick promptly tosses out both the old cliche of harmonious Indian-Pilgrim fellowship and the new cliche of bloodthirsy Pilgrim aggression. The reality was an extremely tense diplomatic dance between the Pilgrims and the deeply divided Indians, in which the Pilgrims' sincere desire for peace with one Indian faction inevitably risked conflict with another. On both sides, fear and mistrust toward the newly met strangers competed against eagerness for the economic and political advantages of befriending them. The wonder is not that the early Pilgrims occasionally got into violent squabbles with their Indian neighbors, but that they so often avoided bloodshed. Philbrick credits Pilgrim leader William Bradford and the Pokanoket sachem Massasoit for this laboriously crafted peace.The second half of the book, about King Philip's War, is still better. Philbrick provides a fair and objective view of the war's origins, with plenty of fault on both sides. The Indians' economic troubles were very much of their own making, in their eagerness to sell their own land to buy the English goods they loved so much. Philbrick doesn't hesitate to point out that the Puritans' claim that every foot of land they owned in America was fairly bought and paid for was very largely true. At the same time, but for the high-handed and flagrantly unjust behavior of Governor Josiah Winslow toward sachem Alexander, King Philip and other Indians, the war could well have been avoided. And the war certainly would not have been nearly so bloody had it not been for the New Englanders' thoughtless and bigoted decision to attack the neutral Narragansetts.Philbrick's treatment of the war itself is a revelation. In the first place, it is clearly misnamed. King Philip plays a cowardly and inglorious role throughout the narrative. And Philbrick shatters a myth I had long been led to accept, that the Great Swamp Fight was the deciding battle of the war. Far from ending the fighting, the attack on the Narragansetts spread and intensified the conflict. What emerges clearer than anything else about the war is that the New Englanders won not because of superior striking power, but because of superior staying power: their trade links with Britain and Virginia, and their own economic base, enabled them to keep up the fight long past the point that the Indians had been reduced to starvation. Poignantly, by the end of the war Indians returned even from successful raids with gloom because they had failed to capture significant supplies.Philbrick concludes with a thorough review of how the Pilgrims' legend grew and evolved through later generations, carefully showing how the Pilgrims' modern image developed from the ancient reality.Penguin's old reliable George Guidall delivers the text cleanly and mellifluously, without ever tripping over the tongue-twisting Indian names.The book is not perfect; Philbrick's grasp of the context of 17th century warfare is a bit weak, and his unabashed admiration for Benjamin Church causes him sometimes to overlook plain facts - Church helped win the war not only by allying with some Indians but also by killing others. But a few minor flaws certainly don't undermine the tremendous value of the book."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Amazing how some of the 1-star reviews can only see this book through their \\"pre-judiced\\" - remember that the word means \\"already-judged\\" eyes. Where do they see \\"all Indians good, all Pilgrims bad?\\" Did they read the same book?I find it a detailed and straightforward account of the complex and sometimes bloody growth of the settlements on the eastern seaboard. The author does not make many comments: the facts speak for themselves. And contrary to some reviewers' assumptions, he is not delivering a moral assessment on modern America and its origins. He is simply narrating history.Some people are just so keen to take offense at anything that - even by implication - suggests that America is not the most wonderful nation, with a shining-pure history from day one. There are great things in that history, but also some nasty blemishes, as in most countries' history, and some of them occurred in these early days. It does no-one any service to pretend otherwise.Philbrick points out that Standish was a bloodthirsty little weasel, inviting opponents to dine and negotiate and stabbing them there, and Winslow was capable of appalling atrocities like the burning of the Narragansetts' fort with more than three thousand men, women and children inside. At the same time he acknowledges the fortitude of many of the settlers in the face of appalling obstacles, and he places most of the blame for the disastrous war of 1675-76 on \\"King Philip.\\"Good job."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Philbrick has done nearly an impossible task for today's popular history reader. He has written an excellent story that avoids the pitfalls of historical revisionism in the American academy and presents the story of the Plymouth colony in its context, while at least considering why this particular colony became the American family myth, in a sense, the Romulus and Remus story of the American republic, nearly 400 years later.While the title is Mayflower, only a fraction of the book's nearly 500 pages deal with the actual voyage by the Puritan Separatists, originally from the north of England and their new found, \\"Stranger\\" friends aboard the world's most famous cargo ship. Philbrick has done some original research into the life and culture of the Pilgrim Separatists in their native villages near Scrooby, England. The book can be divided into two halves: the background, departure and settlement of the original Pilgrim Separatists and then he fast forwards a generation to the 1670's in New England and the terrible native vs. English and native \`friends' struggle known as King Phillip's War. Philbrick's thesis is that while the Pilgrim Separatists are unique in American and even world history for their devotion and plan for resettlement of their break away Reformed Protestant Christian sect into North America, it was the contact and intermingling with the native American tribes that kept the new settlers from breaking up further and insulating themselves into even more narrower Reformed, religious communities.Philbrick does an excellent job of explaining just how difficult and nearly insurmountable the original settlement into Plymouth colony was and the immediate necessity of establishing alliances with one native tribe over another. The tension of creating that famous \`city on the hill', the safe Christian English community with a frontier, cross-cultural interaction with groups like the Massoait and coastal New England tribes is really what is best presented in this book. The first \\"Thanksgiving\\", really a harvest festival, with the local tribe that the Pigrim Separatists had formed the most successful alliance, is presented without a hint of the mythology that later surrounded them in the mid-1800's. And, great pains are taken to show Pilgrims as a people living constantly in coram deo, in the presence of God.Rather than telling the chronological story of the growing Plymouth colony, the 1670's 18 month King Phillip's War with part of the local tribe that originally befriended the Pilgrim's, is contrasted with the first contact in the 1620's as a way to show how past small relational actions taken early on, later exploded in deadly enemies and some alliances. The hero that Phibrick chooses to highlight, Pilgrim grandchild, Benjamin Church, essentially a militia special forces officer, embodied how the small colony related to each other and the native tribes, in trust, war and part understanding.Church's development from Indian hunter, to reconciling agent, acts as a personfication of Philbrick's thesis of his book.The Epilogue and prologue are useful for entering and ushering out the reader into the drastically different world of the 17th century. The book has very useful maps, illustrations and does a great job of showing how the Pilgrim story has been reinterpreted over the centuries, and how the myths and realities of the Pilgrim story are often stronger than is realised today."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"In 1620 a group of English Puritans sailed on the ship Mayflower from Holland where they had taken refuge from religious persecution by the Anglican Church. Sailing with them were a number of \\"Strangers,\\" or non-Puritans, who hoped to establish a colony in the New World. They founded the Plymouth Colony, Massachusetts in an area that was neither their intended destination nor an ideal location, but had some advantages (the Native populations had recently been greatly reduced by disease which worked in their favor). And although they faced many hardships, and relations with the Natives were sometimes difficult, they managed for nearly 60 years to grow and prosper and maintained a mostly beneficial relationship. But nearly 60 years later a devastating war errupted between the various groups, claiming a high percentage of casualties on both sides.The book is interesting but nearly half of it is consumed by the brutal and depressing details of King Phillip's War. I would have preferred more focus on the Pilgrims: who they were, their voyage, trials, failings and shortcomings. The book seeks to tell a \\"balanced\\" view of the story, and it mostly does a decent job. And unless you truly believed that the Pilgrims arrived to a warm reception by the Indians who shared turkey, mashed potatoes, and stuffing with them, you won't be disappointed. Yes, they did share a feast the following year with the Indians (although not at tidy tables with white tablecloths), but overall I wouldn't say the book is upsetting any \\"myths\\" unless in regard to some of the individuals involved. Characters like Miles Standish and Josiah Winslow (son of Edward Winslow) are portrayed in turn as arrogant fools who enjoyed exercising their authority, while Phillip (son of Massasoit) appears almost cowardly and bumbling. I enjoyed learning of the relationship between William Bradford and Massasoit (and his reasons for aligning himself with the English), as well as the duplicity and scheming of Squanto. The one character who comes out shining is Benjamin Church, who is portrayed as a 'Daniel Boone' of the 1600s. It's these somewhat extreme characterizations that occasionally made me question how objective and fair the book really is. There are a lot of very helpful maps, though."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I found this book to be an interesting read, but it did not contain much of the data I expected to find. I assumed there would be more emphasis regarding how the Pilgrims wound up sailing to America on the Mayflower and what life was like aboard ship and later in the colony. Much of this book is really dedicated to the history of King Philip's War, which is interesting in its own right but which leads me to believe that this book has a misleading title."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This book is a fairly fast-paced tale of the coming of the Pilgrims, or Puritan-Separatists, to Plymouth, Mass in 1620, their early struggle for mere survival, and most significantly their relationship with the Indians of the New England area over the next fifty-six years which took a tragic turn into the brutal and bloody King Philip's War nearly decimating the Indians. The book reads almost like historical fiction focusing on key personalities such as William Bradford and Benjamin Church and their imagined conversations with other characters including Indians. Students of history interested in the details of political, social, economic, and religious structures and practice will be disappointed in this book, as such details are only minimally sprinkled into the narrative.The book begins in Holland where the Pilgrims had to take refuge from James I for their Separatist views, that is, their rejection of the formalities of the Anglican Church. But they came to the realization that a fresh start in an untainted land as America appeared to them was necessary for attaining their religious principles. As the author describes those first few months after leaving Holland, it is almost inconceivable that the Pilgrims survived an Atlantic crossing in November and a winter in makeshift housing with an extreme shortage of food. Actually half succumbed in that first winter. It was fortuitous for the Pilgrims that the Indian population had been drastically reduced in previous years due to the introduction of European diseases in that an incentive was provided for cooperation rather than eliminating the invaders.A massive migration to New England began with the ascension of Charles I to the throne of England, which after several decades had a significant impact on the environment in New England in terms of deforestation and the huge reduction in wildlife. The impact of these developments fell mostly on the Indians because of their dependence on wildlife for survival and trade with the English. The Indians were forced to sell their lands, which simply exacerbated the problem. Eventually a resolution of that situation was inevitable. While King Philip, an Indian chieftain, gets much of the blame for starting the war, in actuality neither the English nor the Indians were equipped to address the situation and matters simply escalated. Fully one-third of the book is devoted to King Philip's War, detailing mostly movements, battles, and man's inhumanity to man.Provided maps do help in following the war, yet the proliferation of names of locales, Indians, and Englishmen starts to become a bit much. Maybe a timeline would have helped. Some have called the book myth-busting. One rather suspects that most of the material is simply unknown by most, so despite any shortcomings of the book, it is both interesting and educational. It is also evenhanded. However, the author does not attempt to minimize the cruelty of those times."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This is the fun way to learn history. Read a book that you can't put down. It reads like a novel but at the end you don't feel empty, because you have gained an understanding of how this country got started.I had no idea it was so harsh and bloody. Talk about the war on terror today -- back then they were in a fearful struggle for survival, many times on daily basis. I suspect our war on terror would seem relatively peaceful to the Pilgrims (but their hearts may well not be at peace with our relative secularism). This book will put our current problems in perspective for you and you will enjoy the process."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Well this book just woke me up a bit. I could not believe how little I knew about our own beginnings on this continent, and I thought that I had a comfortable grasp. Sure, I have watched the Discovery and History Channel shows, as has everyone else, but this book dove through all of the foggy layers that time provides to present a clear picture of what most likely happened. I really appreciated that the author chose not to pick sides. Modern historians often seem to pick sides and it drives me crazy. I think that our past is not necessarily their story to spin, skewed by political correctness and personality issues of today. This author did the right thing, showing the obvious \\"ugly\\" on both sides of the fence. This enables us simply to get the real story and decide for ourselves."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Being a big fan of Nathaniel Philbrick and his books \\"In the Heart of the Sea\\" and \\"Sea of Glory\\", I was very much looking forward to his next historical installment. I was not disappointed as I found Mayflower to be informative and engaging. Philbrick writes a fluid history of the early Massachusetts settlers and explores their relationship with the local Native American peoples. He treats the subject fairly discussing the positive and negative aspects of all people involved. The story goes into detail about the specific leaders of both the colonists and Native tribes, but the story of the larger groups of people never gets overlooked. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in history or looking for a good story. As a high school history teacher in Massachusetts, I would highly recommend this to other teachers and also students of early American History."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Excellent popular history of the Pilgrims in England and Holland before 1620, the voyage of the Mayflower, and their subsequent dealings and wars with the Native Americans through 1676, so the scope of the book is broader than the title would first indicate. Well-written, smoothly paced, interesting and reasonably objective. (The author comes down on the Indians' side, but only after exploring and evaluating the facts, careful deliberation and investigation, and is candid about his 51/49 sympathy for them. This is how conclusions are supposed to be reached, and even though I might disagree I do not fault his methods or writing as some reviewers do). I immediately bought his other books. Illustrations and maps are good; overall, a most enjoyable read for those who appreciate good history."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"The author has a lot of detail here and its evident that he had to track thru diaries of a lot of people from that time. There are two problems with this book--the images are not good enough. There should have been more photos of the remnants of the forts and some artwork/diagrams of the mayflower boat. Also--there is too much details of the fights/skirmishes between the Indian tribes and the colonizers. Its repetitive after a while."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I've been listening to the audio book and am now on Chapter 7. The author writes with too many words including descriptory adjectives that don't correctly portray the correct motive of many actions that occurred. I believe this work could have been better written.The author has done quite a lot of research or found someone(s) who has, as in a Ph.D. dissertation, and been able to have the work published and popularized which I believe is a good thing.Learning of history in this detailed format is fun and for that the book is recommended, if just to keep straight all the characters and events that occurred during those times. How we now live our lives in North America seems so easy and somehow extremely incongruous to then. For that comparsion I am truly thankful."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Philbrick has done another superb job in researching a little-known time and event. I read a review that said he spent too little time on the actual crossing of the Mayflower and hence I almost did not get this book. I am very glad I did purchase and read it. How little we all really know or can even imagine of the hardships faced by the brave Pilgrims. And how little we knew of the fate that befell the Native Americans. Both a heartbreaking and heartwarming book and I recommend it to any and all Americans."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This book is little about the Plymouth Colony; it is a survey of the early Indian wars of New England, particularly King Philip's War of 1675-76. I did not know that this conflict was so bloody and ultimately so destructive to the native population. The casualty rate for the English was about 8%. The Indians lost 60-80% of their people to war, disease, enforced slavery or dislocation.I wonder if the author shaped some of the incidents to resemble the Iraq debacle...or maybe I just have current events too much in mind. Anyway, the battle against Islamic radicals has many parallels with the Indian wars. In both cases a primitive culture with fundamental religious beliefs is attempting to stave off Western modernity. Both use their enemy's technology and revel in babarity. The West underestimates the anger and resolve of the natives, but attacks a harmless tribe or country because they are seen as a potential threat. Both the English colonials and the U.S. military shipped POWs to a Caribbean island to be rid of them- as slaves or permanent inmates. The colonials had all the arrogance, muddled thinking and ill-preparedness of our present leaders, but with their family's lives truly at risk, real leaders arose. Most are unknown to all but specialists. This isn't a cheerful book to read, but I appreciate the author's historical judgement."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This book is very informative.

I enjoy American history and realized I knew very little about the original Mayflower heroes. I bought the book, read it and was AMAZED what little emphasis is put in our school curriculum or put into the conversations we have of the history about these people. I did not know at least 90% of what I learned in Mayflower! But in addition to the \\"facts\\" I learned, it was such a good read, well written and held my attention throughout. I have new respect for these particular ancestors in additon to all the others I have read about throughout our amazing history. I learned about the events of this people on both their personal levels and as a group. Their experiences and challenges that literally shaped the foundation of our country are hearbreaking and inspiring.

He takes the story into the wars between colonists and native Americans in the 1640s when the Puritans became permanently planted. I have studied Puritan theology, but I enjoyed reading about them from this angle. Their theology, of course, is part of this story, and we see some of its negative effects on relationships with the land and native inhabitants. I found this book a fair treatment, pointing out the positives and negatives of the Mayflower community. The history is sobering, and reminds us how Christians be either salt or dung to their world."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"To one who enjoys historical people and places, particularly the adventures of early Europeans in America, Mr. Philbrick's book, Mayflower, is as delicious as ice cream and chocolate. This account of the Pilgrims' voyage to the east coast of the new world is incredibly rich with detail and day-by-day accounts of their landing and explorations beginning with the collection of Puritans gathered in Holland prior to their departure. The lives, illnesses, and death aboard trhe Mayflower before their arrival in the New World and the appalling hardships there, cause the reader to once more wonder at the bravery of these 17th century pilgrims who dared the unknown. Of particular interest to this reader are the intricate accounts of motives that lay behind the misunderstandings and cultural conflicts begtween Europeans and indigenous peoples.Their subsequent struggles creating the Plymouth Colony, the successes and failures at scratching basic requirements of food and shelter from the bare and often barren land that was to be their home. This book shines a light on the courage of our forefathers and mothers carving a place for themselves in an often hostile environment. Mr. Philbrick's careful presentation of these individuals, men, women, and children, faced with indigenous people's epidemic plagues and countless wars has perhaps never before been so well done.For the author's consummate scholarship (e.g., 50 pages of notes and 28 pages of bibliography) and his spare, elegant style, this book should be on the shelf of every American historian and humanities student."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This book was a wonderful read. It contained so much information that other history books left out. It also presented both sides (English v. Native American) of the story. The author's writing was clear, precise, and engaging.

What the Pilgrims and Indians endured captures the imagination."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I realized that a lot of what is written comprises of thick paraphrasing and prolific quoting from well-known as well as obscure primary texts. Philbrick just extracted the history from primary source material and dropped them into his own book. This book serves as a great primer, but reading the original accounts from people like Nathaniel Morton's New-England Memorial, Winthrop's Of Plimouth Plantation serves you one better with better results. Of Morton, here is a quote:\\"Which he desired. And having a confection [preparation] of many comfortable conserves &c.;: on the point of my knife, I gave him some; which I could scarce get through his teeth. When it was dissolved in his mouth, he swallowed the juice of it: whereat those that were about him, much rejoiced; saying, he had not swallowed anything in two days before.Then I desired to see his mouth, which was exceedingly furred; and his tongue had swelled in such a manner, as it was not possible for him to eat such meat as they had, his passage [gullet] being stopped up. Then I washed his mouth, and scraped his tongue; and got abundance of corruption out of the same.\\"After which, I gave him more of the confection; which he swallowed with more readiness. Then he desiring to drink; I dissolved some of it in water, and gave him thereof. Within half an hour, this wrought a great alteration in him, in the eyes of all that beheld him. Presently after, his sight began to come to him: which gave him and us good encouragement.\\"In the mean time, I inquired, How he slept; and when he went to the stool?\\"They said, he slept not in two days before; and had not had a stool in five.\\"Then I gave him [of the confection in the water]; and told him of a mishap we had, by the way, in breaking a bottle of drink; which the Governor also sent him: saying, if he would send any of his men to Patuxet, I would send for more of the same; also for chickens to make him broth; and for other things which I knew were good for him: and would stay the return of the messenger, if he desired.\\"This he took marvellously kindly; and appointed some, who were ready to go by two of the clock in the morning: against which time, I made ready a letter, declaring therein our good success, the state of his body &c.; desiring to send me such things as I sent for, and such physic as the Surgeon [Samuel Fuller] dursrt adminster to him.He requested me that, the day following I would take my piece, and kill some fowl [geese, ducks &c.;]; and make him some English pottage, such as he had eaten at Plymouth: which I promised.After, his stomach [appetite] coming to him, I must needs make him some without fowl, before I went abroad. Which somewhat troubled me, being unaccustomed and unacquainted in such businesses; especially having nothing to make it comfortable [tasty]: my consort [Master JOHN HAMDEN] being as ignorant as myself. But it being, we must do somewhat; I caused a woman to bruise some corn, and take the flour from it: and we set the grut [groats], or broken corn, in a pipkin; for they have earthen pots of all sizes.\\"]\\"Since I cannot quote from Mayflower, just check out pages 144 through 150.Kudos for Philbrick for bringing to light such great stories, but as researching goes, it is no more than scanning these well-known stories out of Google Books (which has digitized a vast majority of the sources used by Philbrick and made available to the public for free.)"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"'Mayflower' is the story of the Pilgrims that left England to find a place where their religious beliefs would not tbe oppressed.It was very interesting how unprepared the Pilgrims were, and how unlucky they were in regards to finding reputable people to help them. The planning of such an adventure was lacking at best. I understand during this period of time, there was unwaivering faith that God would deliver them and provide. I was a little surprised at how little effort was expended to better prepare for life in America.I found the story of the interaction (or lack there of) between the Colonists and the Native Americans great. Due to the lack of understand and tolerance the Pilgrims took help from the Natives, but them quickly turned on them for fears that were sometimes unwarranted.The treatment of the 'Praying Indians' reminded me a little of who the US treated the Japanese-Americans during WWII. Simply terrible. It shows how little we learn from history and seemed destined to repeat it over and over again.The book is very good and intersting.

Why this is not compulsory reading in schools is perhaps not surprising - it does mention God - but it should be. The people who came on the Mayflower may have been ignorant, racist, superstitious misfits but they had courage, bravery, discipline and selflessness. They are not responsible for what came after afterwards. America has been hijacked by the spirit of those who landed at Jamestown, not Plymouth Rock. Get this book and cherish it."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Author Nathaniel Philbrick has provided the reader with a detailed account of life among the Pilgrims from their crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, their settlement in Plymouth harbor, King Philip's War, and Plymouth, Massachusetts, today. The Native Americans and Pilgrims managed to live peaceably for 50 years until their descendants began to visualize a future that didn't include the other. The Pilgrims inadvertently stumbled onto the capitalistic society we have today by allowing each family to keep whatever crop they harvested. Prior to that a common storehouse was used, but some people were workers while others were shirkers. Pilgrims and Puritans were much the same as far as religious beliefs were concerned. Philip was the son of Massasoit and was given the nickname \\"King\\" because of his haughty attitude. Squanto, who was so valued by William Bradford for his ability to translate, may have been a victim of an assassination plot engineered by Massasoit. The author spends about 115 pages on King Philip's War which depleted the Native American population of New England by 50 per cent. The author blames both Philip and Governor Winslow for the outbreak of hostilities. The author concludes the book with a description of Plymouth and the history of the famous rock that serves as a tourist attraction. We all have some familiarity of this time period in history, but this book will fill in a lot of the details that your school history book omitted. I also found the maps to be especially helpful."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Nathaniel Philbrick succeeds here on all levels. He expertly manages to be historiclly acurate while creating a rivetting page-turner of a tale. This is the story of those who first settled in America and the many struggles they had. The author does not paint a glossy portrait of either the Pilgrims or the Native Americans they encountered.The book brings stodgy history to life, shattering both the idyllic and manicial revisionist versions we've heard over and over again. In doing so, he reminds us that the Pilgrims and the Natives were real live human beings with the same hopes, dream, aspirations, desires, deceits and sins we all share. I thought I knew the story of William Bradford and the Pilrims well but after reading this book I realized I only knew the headlines. Philbrick brings these men and women to life. A wonderrful read! A must-read for any American history buffs.Most of all, he reminds us that we read history backwards. These people did not know what would happen the next day and had to make life-changing decisions based on scant information. Their ability to survive borders on the miraculous.I never thought it possible that Nathaniel Philbrick could ever tell a tale as gripping as his wonderful book In the Heart of the Sea, but he has done it with Mayflower. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Philbrick takes the cherished American creation story and does wonders with it, bringing together an abundance of original sources, and compiling them in a way that lets the original actors tell an enchanting tale, often in their own words. In this case, the real story is vastly superior to the myths and legends told in classrooms everywhere around Thanksgiving time. Full of struggle and drama, triumph and failure, victory and defeat, uncommon valor and common foibles, of two cultures overcoming chasms to build bonds and bridged, just to see human bungling bring them crashing down again.And then there is Phibrick's postmodernist interpretation and commentary. Though only about 10% of the content, it's so painfully awkward and out of place it manages to spoil the great work and words of the Indians and Pilgrims of real history."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Well I finally finished Mayflower by Nathaniel Philbrick. This is a history of the Pilgrims that sailed to the New World on the Mayflower. Sounds pretty simple but the book is really quite different from that.The book starts out, as promised, telling the story of the Pilgrims decision to come to the New World and the struggle that it took to make it. That is where things change. Instead of continuing to give a detailed account of the pilgrims Philbrick skims over the first years in America and jumps into the next generation of settlers.Philbrick then gives a very detailed account of the first Indian Wars, specifically King Philip's War. The history of this war was amazingly detailed and very interesting. I learned a great deal about the relationship between the colonists and the native peoples and how the relationship became so divided.My problem with this book was that, in spending approximately half the book on King Philip's War, I felt that I was somewhat misled. I expected to read a complete story of the Pilgrim's journey and struggle to survive. Philbrick glossed over this part, almost as a nuisance that must be go through in order to get to the main story.Strangely, had Philbrick entitled his book differently (maybe \\"A History of Early American Settlers and Native Americans\\") I would have been completely happy with it."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"First of all, this book is not about the Mayflower - it is about King Philip's War, with a short introductory section about the Mayflower and the earliest days of Plymouth Colony.That would not be so bad - the material on the war is interesting and thought-provoking, and thus the three stars - if you could trust the scholarship.But Philbrick goes way beyond the available evidence.In his discussion of Stephen Hopkins, the Mayflower passenger, he says, bluntly, that the man of that name who was a passenger on the Mayflower is the same Stephen Hopkins who sailed to Jamestown, with an unplanned stop in Bermuda, in 1609.Now there is circumstantial evidence to support that, but it is far from the established historical fact that Philbrick implies.Then he goes on to say that this Stephen Hopkins spent two years in Jamestown and returned to England.If, indeed, the two Stephens are the same, there is no evidence whatsoever that the Jamestown Hopkins returned to England after only two years in Jamestown. If they're the same man, he could have returned any time between the date of the death of the Mayflower Hopkins's first wife in May 1613 (when weak circumstantial evidence shows that the Mayflower Hopkins may have been out of the country, i.e. out of England) and February 1617/18, when he married for the second time in London.One would think that one could refer to the notes to find Philbrick's source for this claim. But the notes are a mess. They are in narrative form, more of a summary of sources, with no indication of what source supports what statement in the text.If you're interested in yet another telling of the Mayflower story and an overview of the events of King Philip's War, then this book may interest you. But if you're interested in serious history, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"One of the most enduring myths of our national origins, that which set the religious tone and instilled this country with a high level of righteousness, was the founding of the Pilgrim settlement in New England. The myth of the Mayflower, Plymouth Rock, the First Thanksgiving, and the cozy relations between the Indians and the English settlers was not as roseate as previously believed.Nathaniel Philbrick, denizen of Nantucket and amateur sailor, has written a revisionist history of the period. He informs us that the Pilgrims landed not at Plymouth Rock, but at Plymouth, an Indian graveyard littered with the bones of those who had died from bubonic plague. Bubonic plague was the result of earlier contact with European explorers and fishermen. This confirms the observations of Charles Mann in \\"1491\\" and Jared Diamond in \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\". At the time of its orignal exploration in the 15th century, the North American continent was much more densely populated than at the time of the founding of Plymouth Colony(1620). European diseases had already decimated the ranks of the Indians in the intervening years.The first winter was the harshest for the Pilgrims, they had no draft animals and no experience farming. It was Massasoit, leader of the nearby Wampanoag tribe, who taught them how to hunt and plant corn. Massasoit not only joined them at the First Thanksgiving, but managed to keep the peace between the Pilgrims and the Wampanoags for the next 55 years.The last part of this book deals with the little-known King Philip's War - Philip was the English name of Massasoit's son. Although they initially had good relations with the Indians, after a few decades of prosperity and territorial expansion, the Pilgrims no longer needed them and in fact started to see them as an obstacle to economic growth. The more land the Pilgrims took the more hostile the Indians became. Philip only wanted to kill the settlers and tried to organize the tribes against them. The diminutive and bellicose Miles Standish only added fuel to the fire by his demonizing of the Indians. In the end, the war devastated both sides, with the Indians losing from 60 to 80 percent of their population.Philbrick shows how the traditional view of the Pilgrims symbolizing all that was good in America was actually a fantasy.However, he does not go to the other extreme, as many contemporary historians do, portraying the Indians as paragons of virtue, they too were vicious and deceitful. Both sides were distrustful of the other and plotted against the other whenever there was oppurtunity.Philbrick argues that certain key patterns of American thought were established here - and not all of them good. The Pilgrims were hardy, resourceful, courageous, ruthless, and intolerant. Their self-righteousness caused them to reject the Anglican Church of the Old World and it precipitated their struggle with the Indians in the New World. They considered themselves to be virtuous and god-seeking, but in reality they were mundane and self-seeking.This history of the Pilgrims and the Indians is very instructive, in that it is a good example of how mistrust and misunderstanding can lead to ethnic strife and ultimately ethinic cleansing. This is a refreshing revision of what was heretofore a sanitized and triumphalist version of the founding of Plymouth Colony."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I had high hopes for this book. I absolutely was enthralled and haunted when I read 'In the Heart of the Sea' by Mr. Philbrick a few years back. I was hoping that the same intensity, the same character building, would be in this book as well. Sadly, the 'Mayflower' lacked. I agree that there were interesting bits throughout this book, but while reading this book, I found myself mulling over which book I was going to read after I finished this one, which signalled things were not going well for this book. I felt 'disconnected' with the characters in this book. I really wanted Mr. Philbrick to bring Miles Standish and Benjamin Church to life, but for me, it never happened. He got close to bringing Church to life in his account of how Church, being surrounded and attacked by several hundred Indians, was able to escape the situation without any loss of life to himself or his men. The feelings provoked when I read that section was the fire Mr. Philbrick needed to sustain throughout the book. Lackluster is my summation of this book."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I would give this book 10 stars if I could. I listened to the Audio of this and when I got it I thought 11 disc's to tell the thanksgiving story? What I did not know is that I never REALLY knew the story of these people or the holiday they began. The holiday is not the story though. The story takes the cardboard characters we think of and are taught about in school and turns them into the living, high minded, pious, greedy and often very flawed people they were. This book reads like some of the best fiction out there and it tells a story that untill I read it I would never have imagined."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Philbrick possesses the narrative writing talent of a McCullogh, Chernow, and Caro so I had high expectations from Philbrick's newest book. Mayflower was also named one of the 10 best 2006 books by the New York Times, which provided the impetuous for me to purchase and read this book; however, Mayflower is false advertising pure and simple.Mayflower consists of 20-odd pages of narrative prior to the journey to America and a mere eight pages aobut the journey from the point of finally leaving Europe to reaching the shores of America. What you do get is hundreds of pages regarding the descendants of the Pilgrims, along with the Puritans and other colonials fighting a war with \\"King Philip\\", son of the great Indian leader Massasoit who was instrumental in ensuring the survival of the first Pilgrims. This book should have been titled \\"Philip's War\\", and while that tale is certainly interesting reading and provides a helpful link between the original Pilgrim generation and the next two generations of settlers, has little to do with voyage to America on the Mayflower."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"What a disappointment! The author goes out of his way to highlight the worst possible view of the Pilgrims. He almost ignores the fact that William Bradford was elected 31 times Governor of Plymouth Colony and during THOSE decades the \\"myth\\" of the Pilgrims was no myth -- it was true. Bradford was a fabulous leader and Chief Massasoit and Bradford supported each other in PEACE for all of their lives.The author is most critical of the Pilgrims decades AFTER Bradford and Massasoit were gone. He hardly mentions that Bradford for decades DID embrace our nations most treasured values -- democracy (gosh -- Bradford led with town meetings!), separation of church and state (no religious leaders held political office while Bradford was Governor), free enterprise (tossing the original socialist system overboard), and trial by jury (12 jurors). Bradford is the \\"grandfather of America\\" and all of New England, and many Natives, mourned his death.Bradford wanted a small community, and was OPPOSED to Europeans coming over the sea and grabbing land, but you'd never know it to read Philbrick's book.Philbrick suggests Bradford was naive, trusting the merchant backers, but he did so when there was no choice. Why did Philbrick omit the examples of Bradford's shrewdness ... when he personally uncovered a plot to overthrow Plymouth and exposed the plotters... or when the King sent a new governor and some at Plymouth wanted to overthrow the man, but Bradford wisely and correctly waited the man out, saying, \\"Governor Gorges hates it here, and he'll soon return to England\\" (which he did)? He omitted 90% of the positive facts about Bradford and the Pilgrims during the Bradford years.Philbrick makes a big deal of the Pilgrims stealing seed corn from the Natives. But they had just landed in the New World, had heard nothing but horror stories about the savages, and .. by the way ... after meeting and making peace with the Natives, PAID them back. The author mentions Bradford taking the helm of a fishing boat, but downplays his heroism -- the colony was about to starve and no one else would said the ship, so Bradford sailed into tracherous waters, at great personal risk (and with success).Bradford enabled the New World to become the United States. No Bradford, no US. The author seems to think it was easy for the Pilgrims and the many non-Pilgrims on the Mayflower to form a peaceful community; even after describing all the failed colonies, Philbrick hardly gives Bradford credit for building the houses, government, legal system, economic system, judiciary, and foreign relations. But Bradford pulled off a miracle, and he did it with courage, humility, tolerance, brilliance, honesty, and respect (of Natives and of the colonists who elected him 31 times).Plymouth was overrun by Puritans who, under Winthrop, was a nasty theocracy. The author criticizes Bradford's intolerance, yet he opened the doors to Quakers and others persecuted elsewhere. True -- he didn't want the Quakers to stay, becuase they were disruptive )stripping naked and screaming during their church services). But Philbrick doesn't mention this. This Week magazine, in the current issue, gives a scathing review of Philbrick, saying his history was unscholarly, and for some reason he calls a \\"hero\\" the white man who chopped the Indian leader into 4 parts. My criticism is that the author must have deliberately wanted to do a politically correct \\"hatchet job\\" on the Pilgrims, downplaying the wonderful human values and leadership strengths of Bradford, implying that he was responsible for evils by the colonists long after he left office.Philbrick pretends to be a historian, when in fact he deliberately ommitted positives in order to do his version of scalping the Pilgrims.Dr. B. Smart"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I talked myself out of buying this book when it first came out, and I wish I hadn't wasted so much time.

If you tend to like historical accounts, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect from 'Mayflower'. It had been rated as one of the best books of the year by a number of book sellers, but sometimes reading an historical novel can be quite dry and boring- who knew it could be this interesting!To begin with, I am certain so much of what is written in this book is unknown to most people. The story of the Pilgrims has become so commonplace and hackneyed that I don't think many of us even realize what the Pilgrims were really trying to accomplish by immigrating to North America. This book puts to rest any misconceptions, romantic notions or misperceptions about this group of people called the Pilgrims. It attests to the brutal nature of the world during that time and the sometimes-horrible things a people must do to survive. The fact that any of the Pilgrims actually lived through their first few winters on this continent is truly amazing and speaks to their strong stock.'Mayflower' begins by documenting the decisions faced by these people in England to start their lives over again in a totally different \\"world\\". Freedom of religion was their most overriding reason for wanting to begin anew. They needed a place to live and worship free from persecution. The horrific voyage and their landing on the North American shore are all laid out very vividly, and there are side stories and anecdotes about the people and their families, making it possible to have a real connection to the story. In writing about the Native American tribes in the area surrounding Plymouth Colony, it is obvious Nathaniel Philbrick has done his homework. He speaks in excruciating detail about these tribes, their leaders and particularly about their wartime strategies and nomadic ways. In addition, the relationship between the Pilgrims and the natives was so adversarial, it belies the tradition we know of the \\"Thanksgiving Meal\\". I also think most people do not realize that the Pilgrims abused their relationship with the natives and took advantage of them. It certainly shocked me, and I found myself thinking they were bloody thugs, not the cute little stovepipe hat/golden buckle wearing saints they are often depicted as. 'Mayflower' is not glamorous or enchanting, nor is it a homey and heartwarming story, it's a gritty, harrowing, bloody, real-world view of a group of people who had a hand in developing a country known as the United States of America."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"A book of interesting details and a good story, I was always interested. There was not a great deal of personality development, perhaps because there were not enough facts. Benjamin Church is a puzzle. Modern in thoughts, very lucky but I never could determine why he kept fighting. Both the Indians and pilgrims were treated fairly by the author in the portrayal of the time.It sometimes is hard to understand how gullible and unprepared a group (the pilgrims) could be and I found myself shaking my head at the helpfulness of the indians.The details of who came (they had already settled in Holland but were too unbending and strict to fit in), how they were cheated and the change in beliefs in the children were believeable details. The Plymouth that is visited today is much different then described in theis book yet it perports to represent actual people and how they lived. History has seldom been as entertaining."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"MAYFLOWER: A STORY OF COURAGE, COMMUNITY, AND WAR retells one of the important events to occur in American history. The book is a tale of war, disease, and survival that began in November 1620 and ends in 1676. It is also a history that emphasized the roots of freedom and democracy in the New World, which was linked with the Pilgrims and the Mayflower Compact.Plymouth colony was founded on religious freedom rather than trade and economic endeavors posed by the Virginia Company. Philbrick does not leave out the Pilgrim's Thanksgiving or other well-known stories, dancing around the Maypole, that were chronicled in William Bradford's narrative. but most importantly, he shows the ironic results that occurred between colonists and Indians that involved war and disease, which greatly decreased the Indian population within the region that stood at 30 percent in 1620 and dwindled to 15 percent by 1680.The bibliography and the layout of the book are impressive. The bibliographic listing may encourage curious to read more about Plymouth Colony. The illustrations are interspersed throughout the pages of the book, which accompany each chapter and its corresponding narrative, which show an array of artifacts, maps, and drawings.

It should be required reading for all Americans, old and young."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"The author has done a fine job of relating the story of the Old Colony and its first settlers in this book. The writing style lends itself to easy and leisurely reading, and the organization and progression of the content is logical.While this probably will never be considered the timeless, definitive piece of work on the Plymouth Colony settlers, it is an entertaining and educational work nonetheless. Reading this piece evoked in my mind a series of casual lectures given by an expert in the field. By this I mean the tone was conversational, and the reference to minute and possibly irrelevant details was minimal.My one area of disappointment with Mr. Philbrick's book is the amount of attention paid to the later years of Plymouth Colony's existence. The initial settling of the area seemed to be glossed over in comparision with the enormous amount of text dedicated to King Phillip's War. Granted, this war played a monumental role in shaping the history of New England. However, I personally had hoped for more in-depth coverage of the settlers' attempts to establish themselves in the New World instead of their actions after several decades of residence here.Think of this volume as a wonderful \\"get your feet wet\\" effort that offers a nice overview of the Old Colony and its inhabitants and neighbors."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Philbrick does an outstanding job of weaving an enthralling story from historical references.

Lots of information and food for thought."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"The author clearly wanted to write a history of King Philip's War, the cataclysmic confrontation between the New England colonists and the native tribes, but I have the image that he walked into his publisher's office with that idea, the publisher replied with: \\"Nobody will know what you are talking about. I can't sell that book. Why don't you write about the Mayflower, and then I can title it \\"Mayflower\\" and sell it?\\"SO... the book has a really strong beginning, talking about the Mayflower story in really fascinating terms and the first few years of the Plymouth colony, particularly their relations with the locals.AND... it has a really good military history of King Philip's War.The problem is that the middle 45 years are really badly documented. So are things like: \\"What was it like to live in Plymouth in the early years?\\" \\"Who are these 30,000 people showing up to start the Massachusetts Bay Colony?\\" \\"When did people start living in Connecticut and Rhode Island?\\" All these things are important to understand how the tiny colony of Plymouth morphed into an English Empire in North America.It's outside of the bounds of the narrative, yes, but if you are proposing to write a history of two completely disparate events... well... you have to at least try to fill in the blanks. What is there is good, and has a ton of great stories. I think the author took some of the period's authors a little too literally, particularly a passage where a half-dozen men with no ammunition supposedly held off hundreds of armed indian braves.

A group of Puritans escaping religious persecution set sail for America and land on Plymouth Rock. Unprepared for life in New England, most die the first winter from cold and hunger. Only when Squanto and his Indian friends show the Puritans how to plant corn are they able to survive and flourish in the New World. Together, the Pilgrims and Indians celebrate the harvest that forever is remembered as the First Thanksgiving. Imagine my shock, then, when I read Nathaniel Philbrick's book and discovered that hardly any of this is actually true. The first landing of the Pilgrims was not at Plymouth Rock, but across the bay in Provincetown Harbour. Squanto was not just a benign helper, but a politically ambitious player. These revelations and more make \\"Mayflower\\" an important and worthwhile read.I only wish that Philbrick had spent more time discussing the lives of the Mayflower voyagers, both on the journey and in the colony. Understanding who these figures were and their relationships to each other, what their day to day lives were like, and how they lived and died, would have made a fascinating study. Instead, the book is primarily a discussion of English-Indian relations through the early years of the colony and culminating in King Philip's War. The Indians are often portrayed as the \`noble savage' while the English are the cruel interlopers. Violence on the part of the Indians is always responsive or within acceptable boundaries; violence on the part of the Puritans, always aggressive and excessive. It would have been nice to read a more objective and less apologetic version of history; but Philbrick's \\"Mayflower\\" is still interesting and recommended for anyone who wants to know what \\"really\\" happened in history."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Nathaniel Philbrick really hit a home run with this excellent history of Massachusetts colonists between arrival on Cape Cod and the end of King Philip's War. He does a good job of delineating between the mentality and motivations of the Pilgrims led by Bradford and Standish who settled in Plymouth and the more commercial-minded Puritans under the auspices of John Winthrop.The Pilgrims were more motivated by religious freedom and the desire to live as a model Christian community. The colony was not without some irritations between themselves and the Native Wampanoag peoples. However, the Puritans led by Winthrop were more intolerant, exploitative in dealings with Natives, and motivated by commercial interests.Metacom (King Philip) finally had enough of the encroachment and deceptive dealings of the Puritans. The resulting war was brutal and featured awful atrocities committed by both sides. The casualties in this war were greater from a percentage basis of the population than any war in American history. The Native presence was all but wiped out at the end of this grisly war.Philbrick gives a detailed account of the main battles, personalities, and tragic events in King Philip's War. He gave a good overview of the geography of the conflict. For example, I am originally from Bridgewater, MA, and it was interesting to find out that there were battles along the Taunton River. I have walked frequently along the Titicut tribal lands of old and it fascinates me to know that I probably have walked on the same paths of the Wampanoag and Puritan warriors of old."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I've always loved Cape Cod, and this book helps me look at the sandy beaches and woods of the Cape with a whole new perspective.

Instead it provides insights into lesser known figures -- both newcomers and natives -- whose adaptive and maladaptive behaviors and occasional extraordinary actions fundamentally shaped the course of American and Native American history.It's always great to \\"discover\\" an author like Philbrick. Other readers obviously have long been acquainted with Philbrick's writing, but for me, this was the first book of his that I read (actually, I listened to the audiobook version).

The first Thanksgiving (in 1621) was indeed attended by Indians as well as Pilgrims, but they didn't sit at the tidy table depicted in Victorian popular art; they \\"stood, squatted, or sat on the ground as they clustered around outdoor fires, where the deer and birds turned on wooden spits and where pottages -- stews into which varieties of meats and vegetables were thrown -- simmered invitingly.\\"- Mayflower by Nathaniel PhilbrickHow many of us grew up with myths about the Pilgrims and about the first Thanksgiving? We all believed that the Pilgrims and the Indians sat at a beautiful table laden with turkey, cranberries and all of the fixings. Not only was that not the case, they certainly didn't set foot on Plymouth Rock.Philbrick puts these myths to rest. And he tells us about the beginning of our new country and what was the basis for its foundation. Our myths contained stories about Massasoit and Squanto, Bradford and Winslow and, of course, Miles Standish.One of the major accounts in the book was that of the King Philip's War. We learned that it really did not have to be. Both sides could have developed solutions which respected the goodness in each other as well as the differences.We learned about how the Indians were shipped off to foreign places during this war and were separated from all of their families and tribes....never to be heard from again (having been made slaves). Only a few ever made it back like Squanto, for example.Philbrick discusses why the war occurred after so many years of peace and why the descendants of Massasoit and of Bradford and Winslow came to see things differently than their fathers; losing sight of the faith and the respect for the individual that their forefathers had long revered. They also blocked out the memory of how they all needed one another to survive.The Mayflower Compact, we learn, is one document that laid the foundations for the country that America was to become. Yet, our forefathers had to live through a nightmare of a war (of their own making) where both sides suffered tremendously. It took many years after the war ended to ever recoup even a portion of what was lost.Philbrick's book is a story of courage, community and war on both sides as well as a story of how our forefathers lost sight of what the Indians had done for their ancestors and their fathers and what was owed to these people. In doing so, they also lost sight of the need for diplomacy and how to work together to come up with solutions that would be good for both the settlers as well as the Indians.MAYFLOWER has won many awards and the book deserves all of them. What I have come away with deals first with the myth. This was unraveled for me so that I could understand and gain knowledge of the facts of these early settlements. I learned what worked, what didn't work and why the peaceful compact fell apart. I also learned that we can gain a lot from understanding our past and that we do not have to make the same mistakes over again.Nathaniel Philbrick has given us hope that our future does not always have to resemble our past. He wrote, \\"When violence and fear grip a society, there is an almost overpowering temptation to demonize the enemy. But some on both sides refused to succumb. They were the ones whose rambunctious and intrinsically rebellious faith in humanity finally brought the war to an end, and they are the heroes of this story.\\"During the times that we face now, our heroes can continue to be those leaders and citizens who strive to focus on their faith in humanity; and celebrate our differences as well as our similarities in order to find solutions rather than reasons to turn away from each other.Four Stars: B+ (Recommend Highly)Bentley/2007Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"A smoothly written, extensively researched, and well-paced book chock full of big personalities and fascinating details.

Because you really don't know very much about that story until you've read this well-researched, fast-paced book.Nathaniel Philbrick's Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War is on one level a comprehensive history of the Plymouth Colony, from its inception in England and Holland through its integration into Massachusetts in the 1700s. However, it actually relates two important stories. The first is composed of the events of the famous landing on Plymouth Rock-- maybe-- and the horrible first winter that the Pilgrims endured. Included in this story is something most people know nothing at all about: The Native Americans who were living there were also in desperate straits that winter. In a very real sense, the Pilgrims and the Native Americans needed one another to survive, and each group exploited the other in a nearly symbiotic relationship.The second story the book relates is that of King Phillip's War, which broke out about fifty years after the landing. This was literally a struggle to the death between the settlers and the Native Americans, who were probably provoked into the war against their will and to the detriment of their better interests. Ultimately, the settlers prevailed and, in one of the more shameful incidents in American history, they sold thousands of Native Americans into slavery in the West Indies, mostly to recoup the costs of the war.Philbrick does a masterful job of storytelling here. He never lets the need for historical rigor get in the way of his narrative. On the other hand, he never lets the narrative diminish the historical rigor, either. It's quite a balancing act, but he pulls it off, apparently effortlessly.This really is a wonderful book that will more than reward the effort of reading it. I recommend it most highly."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"It took courage, determination and stamina for the Pilgrims to succeed in their settlement. Nathanial Philbrick writes interestingly and knowledgeably about the early years in New England the losses, mistakes and successes of those early settlers. The history of the Pilgrims' relations with the tribal leaders is comprehensive and gives more detail than most histories of seventeenth century life in New England."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Who would have thought that everything we were taught about Thanksgiving and the Pilgrims would be so intolerably glossy? From Thanksgiving dinner to the harmony in which the Pilgrims and Natives lived, the American myth machine has distorted. On one hand, I found this book upsetting. Is nothing sacred? Does every Santa Claus, Tooth Fairy, and Easter Bunny have to be killed in the name of reality? On the other hand, we, as Americans, must know the truth about the founding of our great country.To many like me, who wonder why we live in such a conservative country, we need to look no further than the Pilgrims. As Philbrick succinctly catalogues, the Pilgrims were religious zealots, hell-bent on establishing a pure and strict (fundamentalist) colony. Those of other faiths need not apply. Combine this Christian fundamentalism with a militant faction of colonists and the brutal conditions of living in a completely foreign ecosystem and it is not surprising that conflict with the Natives exploded into a wider war. The Pilgrims were also courageous and determined, as were the Natives.Philbrick presents the good and bad of both the Pilgrims and the Natives. He spares neither side from the truth, and the result is that his book is highly credible and fair. We would serve our children well to require them to read this book."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This book was a fast, action packed read. I read it on the heels of reading, \\"1491,\\" another great history book on this era. This book pushes you past your traditional views of Native-Americans and Thanksgiving. In many ways this book has expanded my view of this era of American history. The book is fair, not ultra-revisionist, and presents a balanced look at how the Native-Americans and Pilgrims interacted both in war times and peace times during the century where Plymouth was founded.I had no idea how much went into the relationships between the colonists and the Native-Americans. This book is a must read for any history buff, or people who just want to know more about how this country was founded & settled. You will enjoy it!JVD"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Nathaniel Philbrick's book Mayflower is a book that should be read by anyone interested in American history. For those who aren't history buffs--after reading this book, they will be.As the book states, it is a \\"Story of Courage, Community, and War.\\" Imagine the courage it took this small group of Englishmen, their wives and children, to leave everything that is familiar behind and travel to a distant, unknown country where all that awaited them was the harsh wilderness and the onset of winter. The 102 passengers aboard the Mayflower, and the crew, were hearty, strong people. One wonders if there is anyone like them today?Intent on making a better world for themselves, these pious families soon realized that in every people group, including their own, there are those who strive for personal gain and not the needs of others. Thus the intense struggle for survival and power begins between the Europeans and the Indians. Likewise, the reader will discover that there were many noble people on both sides.Mayflower is truly, as Nathaniel Philbrick states, \\"The Ultimate American Story!\\""},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Once again we have an excellent history book that digs beneath the legends and the myths about some cherished part of early American history. This time its the folks who colonized Plymouth, and who may or may not have landed on Plymouth Rock (I've seen this rock, and for some reason the date 1620 is carved into it!). We get the background of these hardy pioneers in Europe, their awful crossing of the Atlantic, and their \\"starving time\\" that first year. Then we see that they were really sustained by the local natives, who were much more compassionate and open than were their new neighbors. The history then takes us through King Phillip's War, a terrible tragedy for the natives, who were almost completely wiped out by the English settlers. It's revisionist history at its best, and I can never think about Thanksgiving in the same way again after reading this book!"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Nathaniel Philbrick's \\"Mayflower\\" is a wonderful rendering of the founding of the Plymouth Colony and its first half century.The book traces the founding event in 1620 to disaffection by a set of English Puritans. They moved to the Netherlands and sought to assure passage to the New World. The ship that they used for this adventure was, of course, the Mayflower.The book traces the difficult voyage of 102 passengers over two months. Living conditions were nasty. We meet some of the central characters early in this book: Miles Standish, the soldier; William Bradford; Edward Winslow, among others.Finally, the Mayflower gets to the New World and the ship looked for a proper landing area. After a number of adventures, they settled on what we now call Plymouth. The landing took place later in the year, so that conditions were challenging. Early on, the colonists benefited from a delicate relationship with the Native Americans led by Massasoit, who figured that his weakened tribe (depleted by illness) might gain by allying with the English to protect themselves from other Native American nations. Too, we meet Squanto, another Native American who worked with the colonists.The first part of the book spends much time describing how the colony stabilized and began to grow. The volume also discusses the relationship of Plymouth with the other colonies being developed in New England.The book also discusses in detail the tragic King Philip's War. After Massasoit's death, one of his sons, Philip, began war against the colonists in New England (not just Plymouth). It was a violent war, with much death and destruction among colonists and Native Americans' alike. The author notes that Plymouth Colony lost about 8% of its males in the war. This compares to about 4-5% death rate in the Civil War and about 1% in World War II. The death rate from war among Native Americans was 10%. The end result (page 345): \\"Fifty-six years after the sailing of the Mayflower, the Pilgrims' children had not only defeated the Pokanokets in a devastating war, they had taken conscious, methodical measures to purge the land of its people.\\"All in all, this book brings to life the challenges facing those who came over on the Mayflower. And it tells the ongoing story of the colonists for a half century after the landing at Plymouth. A very good read and a well recommended work."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Perhaps a mis-titled book, Mayflower is partly the story of a religious community seeking utopia in the New World, but mostly how their descendants engaged in a perhaps inevitable and bloody clash of cultures, highlighted by King Phillip's War. It is the latter story that has the most impact, and perhaps Philbrick intentionally used the Mayflower title and the Pilgrim's story to draw in the reader to his intended focus on the generation that followed. In the end, while I felt a bit fooled, I was grateful and enlightened.There are numerous English heroes of deserved fame, like Miles Standish and William Bradford of the Mayflower Pilgrims, or Benjamin Church who led the English in the later wars with the Natives. But there are also many ambiguous figures driven by base motives of revenge, fame, wealth, and power as well. Further, Philbrick does an admirable job of presenting both the heroes and devils of the Native Americans who engaged the English. The Native figures like Massasoit and his son \\"King\\" Phillip struggled just as the English did with whether to assimilate with, separate from, or to annihilate the other.Philbrick's descriptions of engagements between the English and the Natives range from raging battle scenes to intimate conversations within an Indian wigwam. Each of the stories are told with sufficiently vivid detail without losing the larger context. Philbrick balances his narrative in this manner to keep the reader stimulated with imagery and storyline without putting at risk the larger picture of engagement between cultures.Mayflower does not so much seek to explode myths about the early Pilgrims, but to put their stories in the context of what came next. Mayflower offers 21st Century educated readers a fresh glimpse of a period in early American history that is often overshadowed by myths and later colonial-era events. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Mayflower is simply a master work of history and Philbrick has demonstrated a definite mastery not only of the era of which he writes, but in particular the personalities who dominated the times. Philbrick pulls no punches and is not an advocate of any politically correct position. Both the English settlers and the Native Americans come into their own fair share of praise and criticism. This is not a rewrite of American history; he sets new standards as he explores much more than just the landing of the ship but follows with the establishment of Plymouth Plantation and eventually touches the point when the Native American dominance of the area vanished.It is amazing to see how 50 years changes so much. People today tend to think how quickly events shift their lives, but at Plymouth and the emerging towns around it, things also moved rapidly. The initial warmth which was extended to the Pilgrims diminished quickly after misunderstandings and cultural differences eroded the trust between peoples. Disease, almost to the level of plagues, devastated the native population. Friends became enemies and minor skirmishes and acts of violence led to wars and major blood letting and not only between the immigrants and Indians, but also between Native American groups who fell victim to the divide and conquer strategy of the Englishmen. This was really nothing new however, as these situations existed with Indian tribes before whites touched the land. The tribal differences were just cleverly exploited not just between Englishmen and Indians, but also between Indian tribes.Philbrick also expertly draws accurate and intelligent portraits of the major actors in this early American drama. We meet folks we imagined were one way and it turns out the most glamourous, sometimes were very imperfect people. Miles Standish definitely is a name hallowed by people even today, and it appears he was not much of a hero in many ways.This is an era I have studied much, but yet I learned much from this book and am going back to do further exploration. If you think our current version of Thanksgiving is even remotely accurate you should read this book. Yes the early years were tough, but the Pilgrims survived. What is little told, however is that the tables were turned later on and how the Native Americans virtually vanished from New England, because of this settlement in their midst.I would commend this book to all Americans. It is an easy read, the characters for the most part are recognizable to most who have a basic connection with our early history. But in most history courses, people abandon the Pilgrims after the first Thanksgiving and move right on to the French and Indian War. There was much between and that is this book'sshining light. Philbrick paints in the middle ground. I thank him for this book and for rousing me to re-explore an era which seems closed to so many. A great account of forgotten times."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"The decision that I would read Mayflower, a book that has made its way nearly to the top of the New York Times list of bestsellers, took only as long as was necessary for me to understand that it dealt with the Puritan pilgrims who arrived on the shores of American in 1620. The story of the arrival and early struggles of this group of immigrants is now the stuff of legend. But because this story has entered the realm of legend, it is difficult to know where reality ends and mere fantasy begins. Nathaniel Philbrick, who was awarded the National Book Award for his previous title, In the Heart of the Sea, believes that the oft-told tale of the first Thanksgiving, celebrated between the Pilgrims and the Indians, does not do justice to the history of Plymouth Colony. \\"Instead of an inspiring tableau of tranquil cooperation, the Pilgrims' first half-century in America was more of a passion play in which vibrant, tragic, self-serving and heroic figures struggled to preserve a precarious peace.\\" Tragically, that peace was shattered with in the events of the little-known King Philip's War. Mayflower is a story of courage, community and war. It is a story of the fragile peace that erupted into a brutal war.There are at least two things I find I need to watch out for when reading history. First, there is the constant danger of historical revisionism, a danger I feel is as prevalent today as at any time in the past. We live in an age when objective truth raises suspicion and, sadly, history has not been immune to the effects of relativism. A second danger is that of twenty-twenty hindsight. With the benefit of all of the facts before us, it can be far too simple for us to determine whether a particular action was right or wrong. But as history unfolds, those caught up in it rarely have access to all the information that would help them to make the best decisions. And so decisions that were made with the best information available and with the best intentions at heart, may appear foolish and immoral when printed in the history books.Mayflower begins with 102 sick, cold and wet passengers arriving on the shores of the New World. While their long voyage had been both costly and frustrating, it would prove no great trial compared to what awaited them. These men and women arrived at a time when the Native population was being decimated by Old World diseases which ravaged a population that had developed no immunity to such viruses. The two groups quickly forged an awkward friendship held together primarily by the efforts of the Native leader Massasoit and the Pilgrim military leader Miles Standish. This peace lasted for several decades, but as one generation gave way to the next, the peace disolved into the brutal and bloody conflict now known as King Philip's War.The cost of this war was horrifying. Though it lasted only fourteen months, the war was devastating in the loss of human life. During the Second World War, which lasted forty-five months, the United States lost just under one percent of its male population. In comparison, King Philip's war cost Plymouth Colony fully eight percent of its men. The nearby Indian population fared even worse, losing an estimated sixty to eighty percent of its population to battle, sickness, disease or slavery. The war also destroyed what had been a thriving economy and it would take decades for the New World to recover its wealth, status and infrastructure.Where the book begins with the Pilgrims arriving in their new land, it ends with a reflection on their losses and the losses of the Indian tribes. Philbrick attempts to make sense of the carnage and with the fact that this war has received little attention until recent years. \\"In the American popular imagination, the nation's history began with the Pilgrims and then leapfrogged more than 150 years to Lexington and Concord and the Revolution.\\" King Philip's war has become little more than a distasteful footnote in history.I do not often speak of \\"history coming to life\\", for I feel the phrase is far too commonly used. Yet Philbrick seems to have the gift of doing just that. As I read about the early days of Plymouth I could almost sense the bitter cold and feel the anguish as the Pilgrims mourned the death of another of their people. I understood the bond they felt and wanted them to succeed in building their utopia. History really seemed to come to life.In telling this story, it seemed to me that Philbrick generally managed to avoid falling into historical revisionism and relying too heavily on hindsight. Still, there were a few occasions when I felt that he was too quick to judge, too quick to assume. In particular, he seemed only too willing to judge the morality of the Pilgrims who fought in this war. Yet when it came to the Native Indians, he seemed less willing to do so. When the white men punish Native insurrection by enslaving parts of the population and shipping them to plantations thousands of miles away, he justifiably declares it an act that is morally repugnant. But he makes no statement about the Natives who ritually torture their victims or who kill men, women and children alike. In fact, the one time he does discuss Indian ritual torture in any detail, he does so in the context of a white man watching these horrible acts as an educational experience. Thus the white man, the spectator, is portrayed as the evil one. While not a constant theme throughout the book, the \\"noble savage\\" seems to provide a backdrop for Philbrick's understanding of victim and victor. The myth of the noble Native is just that, a myth. In this war, as in all others, there is blame enough to share among men of both sides. On both sides of the conflict were heroes and villains. Perhaps the greatest tragedy of King Philip's War was just how unnecessary it was and how easily it could have been avoided.Despite its few mis-steps, I enjoyed reading Mayflower and have no trouble recommending it to others, and especially those who enjoy the writing of other popular historians such as David McCullough or Stephen Ambrose. While the book may seem a little bit intimidating at 460 pages, fully 100 of those are endnotes and indexes, leaving it quite a manageable size. It is both an easy and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Once again Nathaniel Philbrick offers a well-organized and highly readable account of a pivotal period in American history - the founding of Plymouth Plantation and the 50 years of uneasy peace with the natives that culminated in the disastrous King Philip's War.From Philbrick's descriptions of the tiny, fetid Mayflower's storm-tossed, tension-filled voyage to the war's bloody scalpings, beheadings and slaughters, the writing is vivid, visual and often gut-wrenching.For me, the first three parts - \\"Discovery,\\" \\"Accommodation,\\" and \\"Community\\" - are the most absorbing. The last, \\"War,\\" details a downward spiral of carnage, bigotry and treachery that is as depressing as it is relentless and seemingly unavoidable.In telling this mythologized and often misunderstood story, Philbrick centers on a number of colorful, complex personalities, among them William Bradford, Massassoit and Squanto in the early days, then Benjamin Church and Massassoit's younger son, Philip, in the war years.Philbrick begins with the Separatist community's back-story. Bradford discovered Puritanism at the age of 12 after a long illness spent studying the Bible and joined a secret, illegal Separatist congregation in a nearby village. Persecution drove the Saints (as they called themselves) to Holland, a land of religious freedom (one Dutch trait the Puritans took advantage of, but certainly never practiced themselves). Their decision to journey to the New World was made mostly to maintain their English Puritan integrity, which was suffering inroads of Dutch toleration, and was accomplished only after setbacks that would have made a less fanatical people think again.From the beginning their goal was purity in isolation and while the Mayflower Compact separated Church and State, that was primarily to make a necessary accommodation with the \\"Strangers\\" (non-church members) who made up about half the ship's complement. The Saints never mixed and while their relations with the natives became friendly there was no intermarriage so trade formed their primary connection. It was never going to work, especially as the years passed and more and more land-hungry Europeans arrived.Bradford enjoys copious quotes since his chronicles are the only extensive contemporary accounts of colony life, but numerous others make up a counterpoint, particularly in Indian matters. The Pilgrims were surprised to find no Indians on their arrival, though they did find caches of corn and other native artifacts, which they freely helped themselves to (and later compensated the Indians for, under some duress). Indians had obviously cleared the empty land the Pilgrims settled on and all around them was evidence of native occupation - and death.In the three years previous the Indians had suffered successive waves of pandemics. probably bubonic plague acquired from European fishermen. When Squanto, who had been captured and taken to Europe seven years before, escaped and returned to his home, he found the whole village gone, everyone dead. Not only were their numbers devastated, the Indians were demoralized.Massassoit, who had had no good experiences with Europeans, feared being overrun by a rival tribe that had suffered less from the plague. His aid to the struggling colony - half of whom died in the first winter - was practical. He needed them as an ally. And he also seems to have feared -perhaps because of Squanto's devious translations - that the English would release the plague upon them again if they attacked or tried to drive the English out.But sickness - in the form of smallpox - did return in the coming years and while there were deaths on both sides, the Indians suffered much more. They also suffered from traditional inter-tribal disputes. Intrigues, raids, and shifting alliances played a large part in their relations with the colonists, as did their growing hunger for European goods like guns.As the colonies grew and gobbled up more Indian land (which they duly purchased) and tempers flared and self-interest trumped the long view again and again, Philbrick fleshes out his chronicle with cultural details - the Indian's view of land ownership, the origin and use of wampum, the colonists' adaptation of some Indian ways (beginning with corn) and rejection of others - and the contributions of individuals, from the tolerant Roger Williams and the hot-headed Miles Standish to the complicated, all-too-human Philip and the conniving John Sassamon, an Indian translator whose murder sparked war before Philip was ready.Though Philip avoided conflict for years (even though he believed the English had murdered his Sachem brother), the high-handed colonial government - now larger, further removed from want, and even more removed from the native population - continually injured his dignity and ate away at his authority until war became inevitable.The colonies lost 8 percent of their adult male population in the war's 14 months; more than any war since. The Indians, however, lost 60 to 80 percent of their total population. Many were sold to the Carribbean as slaves. In Philbrick's view the 50 year co-existence fostered by Massassoit and William Bradford had been squandered by the Pilgrims' children and grandchildren, who continued to pay the cost in numerous Indian wars and attacks over the next century. For the Indians, however, the cost was obviously greater.Philbrick's thoughtful, dramatic story is not the history you learned in school. Stripped of heroic mythology, it's a tale of human motivations, self-interest, and complexity, with a strong, inevitable air of tragedy and waste. Copious notes at the conclusion detail the research. The National Book Award-winning Philbrick (\\"In the Heart of the Sea\\") has another winner.-- Portsmouth Herald"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"The myth of the Mayflower legend usually covers the first brutal winter of the Plymouth Colony followed by the first Thanksgiving. Mr. Philbrick covers the first 60 years of the Colony from the days of starvation in 1620 to King Philip's War in the mid-1670's. His vignettes of familiar historical figures (Miles Standish, Squanto, etc.) are incisive while his biographies of later colonists will be vivid and new for most readers. Mainly the book re-counts wasted opportunities for peaceful co-existance until the fatal uprising of the Algonquian tribes against the English settlements of southern New England in King Philip's War which nearly destroyed both sides. For the reader desiring further information, there is \\"The Red King's Rebellion\\" (1990) by Russell Bourne and \\"The Times of Their Lives : Life, Love, and Death in Plymouth Colony\\" (2000) by James and Patricia Deetz."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Philbrick does a great service in writing the early history (about 60 years)of the Pilgrams and Puritans from the early Mayflower launch/arrival to the conclusion of the King Phillp wars that pitted the early European settlers and friendly indians against a number of indian tribes who sought to wipe out these early settlers. The title of the book \\"Mayflower\\" is more marketing than a discription of the content or theme -- the major focus of the book involves the King Phillip war (some 50 years after the Mayflower arrived.However, the book (for me) was a frustrating read in the sense that Philbrick adds his own interpretations throughout the story. I found most of his personal opinions based on his view that the Pilgrims were racist, too dependent on God, and just plain mean. The Indians were peaceful, smart and just plain victims of these early European setters.The history Philbrick so expertly captured from a multitude of references, just does not support his \\"black and white opinionated views\\". Reality (to me)is that the indian tribes viciously fought each other long before the arrival of the Mayflower, the Europeans also had a history of vicious fighting prior to coming to the new land; then bring a religous group of Europeans (50 survived) to the new world on the Mayflower, a continual influx of other Europens (some religious and some not, some are peaceful and some are trouble makers), and the variety of native indian tribes together (some peaceful, some not, etc) -- a realistic person might expect conflicts. However the author somehow believes that if the band of original 50 Pilgrims had done things \\"the authors way\\", all would have had peace in the US to this day.In my opinion the history scores a 5+ stars and Philbricks opinions score 1+ stars. But I give the overall book 4 stars because you get the great history if you can ignore the authors interpretations. In fact I will read this book a second time with a black marker so I can rid the book of opinions before passing it along to others as a great history read."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Every American knows the fairy tale version of the first Thanksgiving, but Nathaniel Philbrick shows through Mayflower that the story hardly begins and ends with one meal. Following the Pilgrims from the conditions that led them to flee Europe all the way through the deep ripple effect their arrival in the New World had on the local native communities, Philbrick uses many firsthand accounts to tell the true story of what happened. What results is hardly the fairy tale we know, but rather a narrative of the devolution of a social order as two societies blend together, new immigrants arrive with new ideas, and the tenuous peace we still celebrate with a feast in November proves short-lived as the two cultures spiral into warfare."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"What a story! This is everything my history teachers didn't teach me. Philbrick tirelessly recounts the details (and big picture) of the journey of the Mayflower and what followed.The remarkable story reveals so much courage, faith, villiany, weaknesses, loyalty, heroics and tragedy on the side of the English pilgrims and the Native Americans. The relationships between the English and the Native Americans were more complex that I had imagined. Philbrick follows those relationships from the landing of the Mayflower to the climax of \\"King Phillip's War.\\"The book highlights the leaders of Plymouth colony and the Indian Tribes. The person that astonished me as I read was Benjamin Church. His role in the colony's war with the Indians could stand alone as the subject of an interesting book. Philbrick also illustrates the conflicts among the Native Americans, some of which were loyal to the English and others loyal to Phillip. Philbrick confirms the Indians' role and importance in the survival of the pilgrims and in the victory of the colonists over the unfriendly Indians in the war that follows.Philbrick recounts the events objectively without trying to persuade or with an agenda, except to share history. I appreciate his skill in telling the stories. Learning about the people this in-depthly was a treat and I recommend the book to anyone.Shakespeare On Spirituality: Life-Changing Wisdom from Shakespeare's Plays"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I think Mayflower is named as it is because few words seem to invoke the American spirit as much as the name of the Pilgrims' ship. Nathaniel Philbrick gives us a glimpse of the first few generations of the English colonies and [I think] challenges the notions we may hold regarding who the Pilgrims were, why they were here, and what their relationships were like.Philbrick's style was very readable and enjoyable [which may be do to the fact that I was very interested in the subject matter]. I think that the words he's written are indicative of a man who has given much thought and study to the subject.What's most striking is the amount of detail the author gives in describing the Native Americans, their culture, and their relationship with the English. What he's done for me is to take a group of people [in this case, many groups of people] and to place a face, customs, dreams, and hopes along with them. In addition, he communicates why they became enemies so quickly and how a fragile relationship between nations can become so quickly broken.The span of time covered is a portion of the planning prior to the Mayflower departing Leiden with Plymoth's first English settlers to the end of King Philip's War. Again, what the author does so well is to describe the motives, the flaws, and the redeemable characteristics of most all who were involved. I think Philbrick does as well as anyone is able to avoid an \\"us\\" against \\"them\\" mentality and to lay out a somewhat transparent viewing of the colonists, the native allies, and the native enemies.There are few qualms that I have with the book, but one of them has to do with the fact that Philbrick sometimes falls prey to the very thing he's set to fight - that is creating a mythology of the history of the Pilgrims. One of the most glaring occurrences of this is the discussion he gives regarding the death of Dorothy Bradford [William Bradford's wife]. He first gives notice that there are no historical documents that give any indication of how she died and then spends quite a few paragraphs speculating that she may have committed suicide. Still, this was the most glaring occurrence and the others did not make for such a difficult read.Philbrick has created a scholarly and thoughtful work of the peace and war of our nation's early history [saying this with the understanding that our government, language, and customs were affected more by the English than any other European nation colonizing the \\"New World\\"]. I don't think you will learn much about the religious history and content of the Pilgrims, but you learn a great deal about their relationship with Native Americans during the time of early English colonization. Definitely worth your time!"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"excellent and readable - I had no idea that the Indians were as organized (albeit into tribes) -- guess I thought they hid behind trees and shot arrows. they were highly intelligent, and sadly, the white settlers treated most of them badly. The Mayflower contract had a lasting effect on our country's history.Living in New England it is interesting how many of the Mayflower family names are still around."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Nathaniel Philbrick brilliantly tells the simultaneous stories of two peoples: the Pilgrims and the American Indians.After reading this, you will never see the Pilgrims and the Indians in the same way you knew them earlier. Both showed extreme shrewdness and amazing incompetence in their doings with each other. Perhaps the Native People had fewer options than the new immigrants, but both fumbled on the many opportunities to work together, which led to the perhaps inevitable destruction of one culture by another.It wasn't all the White People's doing. Both sides failed to understand each other's needs and demands, with the result that both could find only the destruction of the other as a solution. I think that you will find Philbrick's treatment of \\"King Philip's War,\\" as the best illustration of why the conflict and destruction moved inexorably forward.For all who want to better understand the beginnings of America, this book is invaluable!"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War is a history of the Plymouth colony.

Philbrick does a great job of making the characters human and believable."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"If you want a complete understanding of the first 50 years of our American history, this is the book to read.It covers the motivation for the pilgrims move to the new world, the beginning days, how the colony was orginized, the relationship with the native indians, namely Massasoit, who without his cooperation and loyalty their likelihood of making it in the beginning years would of been slim or none. It covers every detail of the first 50 years and how the next generation spawned a spoiled set of settlers with new attitudes which inevitably led to King Philips war.Being a history buff, I had a pretty good understanding of this story to begin with, but this book completely puts it all together. It is written in a manner that is easy to assimilate and emphathize with the events. This allows me to remember names, places and important dates when discussing the events of our pilgrim ancestors. It doesn't glamourize anything and quotes directly from historic journals and maps.Anyone interested in early American history needs to read this book. After reading this book, I have a completely different perspective on Thanksgiving, the pilgrims and our ancestors. An interesting fact I recieved from this book is that one of ten people are descended from those 102 pilgrims. I happen to know my ancestors include 3 of them, most notably John Alden, who was my 9th great grandfather.If you REALLY want to know what life was like, what was the relationships like with the Indians, how they cooperated with other colonies and how religion played into to things, read this book!!!Well written.

The emphasis should be on the \\"hiSTORY\\" because that's how he writes - if all history books were written like this, I suspect we'd all have majored in history in college.Philbrook does a fantastic job relating the early history of New England, interspersing throughout (in just a sentence or two) archaeological findings, notes on how wigwams can be constructed, and so on.The writing is simple, clear and engaging. It's very hard to put this book down; I read all of it in three evenings.Frankly, this is the kind of book that I wish had been around when I was back in high school or college. Very, very well done."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"As with all Nathaniel Philbrick novels this one comes alive for the reader and gives the history of the Pilgrims, the one you do not see by a bus ride to Plymouth Plantation. Massachusetts residents who want to learn more about the land they now occupy and the peoples that came before them should read this fascinating account."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Nathaniel Philbrick's book \\"Mayflower\\" appears at first glance to be merely a recounting of the Pilgrims journey to the New World and their miraculous survival that first winter culminating in the first Thanksgiving, that's all here, but takes up only about 80 pages of the 450+ page book. In reality, Philbrick offers the reader a complete history of Plymouth Colony from 1620-1691 (when it was merged into Massachusets Bay colony) The bulk of the narrative focuses on King Phillip's War (1675-76) for my money one of the most fascinating and under-reported armed conflicts in American History. Philbrick chronicles the main engagements of the war, in a very evenhanded way, praising the colonists bravery when warranted, while at the same time not being afraid to call them the savage butchers that they clearly were. He also does a great job of guiding the reader through understand the complex maze of ever-changing alliances between the colonists and the various native tribes of the region, and analysing how the conflict's long-term consequences helped shape America today."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Starvation concentrates the mind, and drives men to extremes. Nathaniel Philbrick has demonstrated this historical fact aptly in two recent works, the superb \\"In the Heart of the Sea\\" and now with \\"Mayflower\\", a disciplined and engaging re-working of the legend of the first pilgrims. Philbrick seems interested in characters whose hunger transcends the corporeal, however. His portraits of the both the celebrated and more obscure scions of the Bradfords, Standishes, Churches and others all depict personalities who share an innate drive, an appetite for both worldly and divine discovery and conquest the propels them through direst misery and into the formidable portal of a wild new world.Philbrick lingers over the original patchwork motivations of the pilgrims, a mixture of economic and religious grievances that drove strange but determined alliances. In so doing he reveals main historical characters with a clarity of purpose and vision that would serve them well during their travails in the new world. He moves through the well-worn tale of the woeful journey and the first winter with dispatch, seeming eager to detail the far less examined story of the Indian alliances that motivated the benificent first feast and set the stage for the burgeoning and threatening European population that followed.With a historian's expertise and aplomb Philbrick narrates the relationships among Massasoit, Squanto, Bradford and Standish, but takes things much further, continuing the narrative through fifty years of settlement and war, up to an excellent recounting of the virtually forgotten King Philip's war. Sometimes the narrative gets bogged down and requires a couple of re-readings to get the names, places, battles, and relationships straight, but it's well worth it. This is a disciplined work, and requires a commitment on the part of the reader to meet the author half-way. That said, many of the anecdotes that sprout through the cracks of the story stand on their own, moments when the book comes to real, almost novelistic color.At the least anyone will come away with a valuable new perspective on this country's origins, in turn bloody, noble, and enterprising. The author's passion for the subject, always crucial for a work like this, shines through. And in the end, expect it to leave you hungry for more."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"As Nathaniel Philbrick has done in his other books, he tells a thorough and thoroughly enjoyable history in his book Mayflower. This is the story of the pilgrims, the whole story, from voyage through absorption by the Massachusetts Bay Colony after decades of carving a home for themselves in the new American wilderness.I had always wanted to know more of the pilgrim story after the initial landing and first winter survival. This book not only details the voyage of these English religious refugees as well as their landing, but also how they struggled to hew a home amidst Indians in a new and often unforgiving environment. The book also details how a relative situation of coexistence with the native Indians deteriorated into conflict and annihilation as a result of King Phillip's War.We see the Pilgrims landing and making their first forays along the coast in those tentative days after making landfall near Plymouth Rock (not at it, as popular history suggests), as well as the struggle to build a community and elbow some living room among existing and often warring native people. Philbrick tells the story of their building of community and government and of gradual expansion as more settlers are brought over to establish farms and satellite communities in the following years. This well told portrait of the very early existence of colonists will fill the gap for the average reader who usually skips from Jamestown and Plymouth right to the making of the Declaration of Independence in school and general histories.King Phillip's War was a seminal event in our nation's history. Although being squeezed by immigration, it was not dictated that at least a longer period of coexistence between European and American Indian cold not have occurred. When King Phillip took up war to strike at the encroaching colonists he lit a fuse that ended the Indian era in Massachusetts and coastal New England. That war united colonial settlements that had largely been sharing space in coastal Massachusetts but keeping to their own spheres and proved the downfall of powerful Indian tribes that had been holding onto their own areas through diplomacy and balance of power politics to some extent.Philbrick writes well and does an excellent job of giving voice to his characters as well as interestingly explaining the times and lives of these early settlers."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"To one who enjoys historical people and places, particularly the adventures of Early Europeans in America, Mr. Philbrick's book, Mayflower is as delicious as ice cream and chocolate. This account of the pilgrims' voyage to the east coast of the New World is incredibly rich in detail and day-by-day reports of their landing and exploration, beginning with the Puritans who had gathered in Holland working toward departure. The lives, ilnesses and death aboard the Mayflower before their arrival in the New World and the appalling harships there, cause the reader to once more wonder at the bravery of these 17th Century pilgrims who dared the unknown. Of particular interest to this reader are the intricate accounts of motives that lay behind misunderstandings and cultural conflicts between Europeans and indigenous peoples.Their subsequent struggles creating the Plymouth Colony, the successes and failures at scratching basic necessities, food and shelter, from the bare and often barren land that was to be their home. This book also shines a light on the courage of our forefathers and mothers carving a place for themselves in an often hostile environment. Mr. Philbrick's carful presenttion of these individual, men, woman, and children, faced with hostile indigenous peoples, epidemic plagues, and multiple wars has perhaps never been presented so clearly.For the authors's consummate scholarship (e.g., 50 pages of notes and 28 pages of bibliography) and his spare, elegant style, this book should be on the shelf of every American historian and humanities student."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This is a revelation about the founding of the Massachussets Bay Colony. One comes away with both more respect and more doubts about this dramatic undertaking. Along with the Revolution, Jamestown, the Civil War, and the opening of the West, this is one of the events which have shaped our nation."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"We all know the story of the Pilgrims and the First Thanksgiving: ride in a boat, step on a rock, grow some corn, shoot a few birds, invite the Indians for dinner - all is well.Well . . . perhaps not quite. Nathaniel Philbrick, noted author of IN THE HEART OF THE SEA, offers an engrossing history on the voyage of the Mayflower, the founding of Plymouth Colony, and the fifty or so years of the English settlement of New England. Combining extensive research with highly readable prose, the author fashions a history with the skills of a novelist, shedding needed light on an oft-misunderstood portion of colonial history.Pilgrims, Puritans, pirates, Native Americans, and others come alive, not as historical caricatures, but as flesh and blood, multifaceted human beings - men and women with strengths and weaknesses, virtues and vices, joys and sorrows, interacting with both good and evil intent.In addition to the extensive bibliography, Philbrick backs up the main narrative with comprehensive, yet interesting notations. MAYFLOWER is a worthy addition to one's library, and a terrific read."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I think it's safe to say that most Americans are now aware that the myths of our nation's origins cover over more than a little of the brutality of the process. Yet many of us don't know the details of the encounters whose echoes are still heard down the long halls of history.Nathaniel Philbrick's \\"Mayflower\\" goes a long way toward illuminating a seemingly familiar corner of American history, filling in the shadows with tales of heroes and scoundrels from both sides of the encounter. Philbrick mainly covers the period from 1620 -- the year the Pilgrims sailed -- through 1676 -- the end of the bloody work of extermination known as King Philip's War. This is roughly the period of the Pilgrims, their children and grandchildren. Yet while the period ended in a brutal mostly one-way slaughter, it also enshrined a 56-year period of relative peace, in which the two sides, ever needful of each other, managed to live in a version of harmony.Indeed, \\"Mayflower\\" is full of noble acts and savagery by both sides. The cohesiveness and piety of the Mayflower passengers both propelled them to the New World, and kept them together and sane once they arrived. The great sachem Massasoit, for his part, is depicted as moving beyond fear and prejudice to ally himself to the new colonists. For their part, the Pilgrims produced great leaders and diplomats like William Bradford and Edward Winslow who were able to keep the colony secure in spite of the terrifying newness that surrounded it. But scoundrels abounded as well. Miles Standish is portrayed as a genocidal maniac who delighted in killing Indians. The Wessagusset raid that he led is depicted in all of its duplicity, manic violence and betrayal of hospitality. Squanto, the Indian who helped the Pilgrims survive their first winter, is shown using the Pilgrims to advance his own leadership ambitions. Later in the saga, we are introduced to cowardly and ineffective King Philip, stalwart and humane Benjamin Church, doughty Indian captive Mary Rowlandson, cautious female sachem Weetamoo, warrior and praying Indians, and more. By the end of the tale, you will have become acquainted with John Alden and Roger Williams and comprehend what brought them to Plymouth and what drove them from it. You will learn the difference between Pilgrims and Puritans, Pokonokets and Narragansetts, sachems and powwows, flintlocks and matchlocks. And you will have witnessed a strange and wonderful tableau of the \\"first Thanksgiving\\" in 1621, including naked Indians and meat pottages boiling over open fires. You will also gain an appreciation of the mentality in 17th century New England that allowed such a horror as King Philip's war to break out. You'll understand how the Indian way of war was so different from the more lethal English variety.As a longtime cynic about the Pilgrims, I was surprised at their ability to reach beyond their insularity in time of need. Unfortunately, my preconceptions about the brutality and greed of the Puritans were only deepened. It's a tribute to Philbrick's honesty that he does not shy away from either description.For all the recent focus on the treachery and savagery of Europeans, I appreciated Philbrick's attempt to focus on the positive and peaceful coexistence of the two sides from the 50-odd years following the Pilgrims' arrival. However fleeting and tenuous that peace might have been, it stands as a testament to the possibility that recognition of mutual humanity and need can forge a relationship among the most divergent of cultures.Philbrick's style is easy, fast-moving and not at all pedantic. George Guidall's narration was suitably grave or upbeat and always full of wonder."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"\\"Mayflower\\" is a truly well written history concern the first few generations of european \\"pilgrim\\" settlers, and how they came to influence, and be influence by, this new continent.The first part gives us a greater understanding of an area familiar to most, the founders of Plymouth colony. We see their desire to settle and live as they wish, and the hardships they overcame. There despirations, conflicts and friendships are all well told.The second covers an area not well known, the period of the second and third generation, and their great conflict with the native american leader Phillip. Politics, heroism and fate all played an important part of shaping the results, results that would later shape a nation.This book is well suited to all interested in history, the latter parts for those particularly interested in military history."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Philbrick has the ability to write histories that not only inform, but that bring people to life in such a way that you think you're reading a novel. This particular history covers a period often glossed over in US history; the period after the Pilgrims landed. What makes it unique is its focus on the relationships between the Pilgrims/Puritans (Philbrick differentiates between the two) and the native population. Although it covers the conflicts it also covers the dynamic of how the two peoples coexisted in peace and how the leaders of both groups learned to work together. Unfortunately as increased immigration from England put pressure on Indian lands the coalitions and cooperation that had maintained the peace for 50 years fell apart leading to \\"King Phillip's War.\\" Again, what makes this book worthwhile is that it doesn't just focus on war itself but on how diplomatic relations between the two peoples were carried out during war and peace."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"This true story is one that takes you through the very being of what America was like in the 1600's. It tells of how hard those people had it and how much they needed the American Indian to make it thru the winters and we all no where it went from there.... land grabing !! Great book and written so that an 8th grader could read & understand everything going on."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Contrary to its title, this book is not primarily about the Pilgrims. It's actually about King Philip's War (1675-6), the Indians' war against the earliest English colonists in New England, and the events leading to that war, starting with the persecution of the Pilgrims in England.As usual among today's politically correct historians, the Pilgrims are portrayed as intolerant and racist. For example, they're charged with persecuting the Quakers (p. 177), although the author conveniently omits any mention of the early Quakers' habits of walking naked through the streets, of disrupting religious services by haranguing ministers, and of refusing to pay tithes or to take oaths of loyalty. He also fails to mention that the Puritans, Anglicans, and Presbyterians also \\"persecuted\\" the Quakers, or that the greatest Purtian, Oliver Cromwell, ultimately defended the Quakers.When King Philip's War broke out, the colonists (says the author repeatedly) were wrongly suspicious of all Indians, supposedly because the colonists were racists (e.g., p. 251). However, the war was started by the Pokanoket tribe, whom the colonists had trusted longest and most (Ch. 12, 13). And the Indians had a long history of intriguing against the colonists, starting with one of their first Indian friends, Squanto (Ch. 8).Because the Puritans (not the Pilgrims) attacked the Pequot tribe in 1637, the author charges them with \\"genocide\\" (p. 179). However, again, the author conveniently omits any mention of the Pequots' killing in 1634 of nine English settlers along the Connecticut River, and the Pequots' killing in 1636 of an English trader on Block Island, Rhode Island.You can demonize anyone by omitting enough exculpatory evidence. In his Epilogue, the author urges Americans not to demonize whole groups (Muslims) because of the actions of a few (terrorists), and to embrace \\"diversity\\" (pp. 347, 358). Yet his embrace of diversity doesn't extend to Christians, such as the Pilgrims. Indeed, according to the author, only by grace of the Indians were the colonists saved from the Pilgrims' \\"monolithic cult of religious extremism\\" (p. 347).By contrast, nowadays Indians are portrayed as peace-loving children who lived in harmony with nature. However, they did periodically burn the forests to create pastures (p. 87). They did maintain vast armies of warriors (e.g., p. 49). They did practice ritual torture of prisoners, which involved dismembering the victims alive (p. 320). They did massacre Europeans in Jamestown (p. 136) and elsewhere (e.g., p. 289-290). And they didn't scruple at massacring (p. 286), scalping, or dismembering (p. 337) each other.In his Preface, the author more accurately characterizes the relations between the Indians and the colonists: there was peace as long as each side needed the other (p. xvi). In war, the Europeans treated the Indians as the Europeans treated each other in war: harshly, by today's standards (p. 253).For a better history of the Pilgrims, see \\"Saints and Strangers\\" by George Willison, one of the author's references (p. 442)."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"Maylower is a very good book that dispassionately reviews what actually occurred from just before the Mayflower set sail to America through the King Philip War toward the end of the 17th Century. The Pilgrims' myths are largely, if not entirely, diposed of and the reality of a desolate land being settled by a higly religious, dare one say \\"fundamentalist\\", group of Christians. Nathaniel Philbrick brings to life the differing tribes of Native Americans and the interactions with their new \\"guests\\". He also clearly deliniates where both groups went astray and brought war to one another when living in a collective peace would have been beneficial to both groups - especially the new settlers of Plymouth. Where I felt Philbrick went astray was in the minute details of each and every conflict rather that putting the settlement in a broader perspective with what was going on in England and how this group of settlers, hardly the first Europeans to reach the New Worlds shores, influenced the very nascent stages of a group of Colonies that would, within 140 years, untimately rebel against their native land, essentially for the second time (the first being voting with their feet to establish a religious community as it's raison d'etre).The book is well worth reading as Nathaniel Philbrick does a remarkable job of bringing the reader into a reality where high school civics and college history classes seemed to have fallen woefully short."},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"I bought this book based on all of the positive feedback and accolades it received. I expected to read about the pilgrims preparation, their journey, the Mayflower, etc. The author spends about 40 pages covering these events and then spends 300 pages covering the blood and gore of King Philips War. He bashes the Pilgrims for their ignorance and intolerance. He compares King Philips War to World War 2 and the Civil War in terms of percentages of people killed. Lets be serious, King Philips War lasted a little over a year and 600 Pilgrims were killed. This pales in comparison to either of the aforementioned wars. The author minimizes the tale \\"First Thanksgiving\\" and aptly points out that it was Abraham Lincoln who declared it a Holiday in 1863. I was nave to expect this author to romanticize the Pilgrims journey and a pivotal point in the History of the United States. The book should be labeled King Philips War because that's what the vast majority of this book is about. Maybe it was just a marketing scheme because more people are familiar with the Mayflower and very few are familiar with King Philip's War?"},{"Title":"Mayflower : A Story of Courage, Community, and War","review":"As the title suggests, I expected more content discussing the Mayflower, her passengers, and circumstances within the first few years of the Plymouth settlement. Indeed , the first hundred pages or so does a fine job delivering on this expectation but then quickly moves beyond the pilgrims into the early years of the broader Massachusetts Bay colony and indian wars to follow. Perhaps there is simply not enough known of the Mayflower and her voyage to support a novel?I was annoyed by the continual focus (seems like a reminder every couple of pages) of the settler's callous disregard and ignorance of Indian lands, customs, and intentions.It seems too convenient, looking through a 21st century lense, to chastise the settlers for improper and callous treatment of the native people. This rings of an appeal to popularism which I find particularly distasteful when delivered by an author and researcher of Philbrick's caliber. Did the pilgrims misinterpret Indian intentions? Did they \\"over-react\\" in violent outbursts to Indian aggression? Did they perhaps diminish their fortunes by not embracing the native population more \\"correctly\\"? Perhaps so - but with the benefit of hindsight and nearly 400 years in the rearview mirror, these are convenient conclusions to draw.The new arrivals were not experts on indian populations (far from it..) and were trying their very best to further noble goals and survive in a hostile wilderness thousands of miles away and a zillion miles removed from the social morays and customs of 17th century europe. By all accounts, they did their very best to interpret intent and react to the native populations- and at the end of it they not only survived but thrived and went on to populate a great nation. Perhaps the horrors of indian encounters in Jamestown might have been repeated in Plymouth had they not behaved as they did.In any event, I'd still recommend a read through of the text. In true Philbrick style, I found the historical research of the early days of the Mayflower and her passengers to be extremely well informed. Like McCullough's \\"John Adams\\", The narrative does a fine job humanizing the pilgrims and softens the \\"buckles and hats\\" grade school images many of us have of this heroic group of men and women."},{"Title":"Peta and the Wolfe: Guardians of Time","review":"I have read various books by Sahara Kelly and loved them all. I enjoyed the first Guardians of Time novel and looked forward to reading the other parts of this scorching series. Peta and the Wolfe, Book Three in Guardians of Time, though it has a big storyline departure from Alana's Magic Lamp, is another exciting and erotic Kelly novel that I devoured in two sittings. Peta Matthews is a British woman who lives in New England and works in publishing. She one day has a car accident in which she is brought to the dimension of the Guardians of Time, men and women who focus on bringing out the erotic and wanton side in women. She is told that her time on earth isn't done and that her job is to protect Max Wolfe. Max is one of her underlings at work -- an incorrigible womanizer who is tired of his empty, oversexed existence and wants Peta more than anyone at the moment. These two characters come together in a story full of suspense, mystery and lots of eroticism. There are various twists throughout the novel.The thing that stands out the most in this novel are the smoldering erotic scenes. Kelly's descriptions are wonderfully palpable and well written, like in her other novels. Max is a very sexy, insatiable hero and Peta is an earnest, wonderful heroine who shatters all of her sexual inhibitions with Max. They have a lot of chemistry and I had fun reading their scenes together. Their relationship, like in most romanticas, start out sexual, but then feelings begin to develop between them throughout the course of the novel. The suspense aspect of the novel is quite entertaining if a bit confusing. Alana's Magic Lamp had a very different premise from this novel and I suppose that the storyline change strikes me as strange. Then again, I haven't read the second Guardians of Time book. All in all, Peta and the Wolfe is another winner by Sahara Kelly, who has become one of my favorite erotica writers. I look forward to reading more of her stuff in the future."},{"Title":"Bigger Than a Breadbox 1ST Edition","review":"Steve Allen was my hero, onr of the funniest and most talented men I ever knew.

Somerset Maugham)","review":"Just finished this book today. Like the previous reviewer I\`m a big fan of Maugham, but didn't know what to make this melodrama at first. Unlike her, I don't quiver with fear, outrage and self-righteousness when contemplating the views of others unfortunate enough not to have been born in my time and place.It was apparently written before 1900 but not published until 1907, so a young Willie at work here. Reads curiously like a playscript in many parts - characters will sometimes in their thoughts describe and set up a scene before the action starts, for example. A LOT of conversation here, too.Anyway, give this to a modern high school class and you\`ll lose your teacher's permit yesterday due to the eponymous hero\`s views - based on 15 years experience - on the general sincerity of native Africans when dealing with white men. This shocker takes place about page one and is where the aforementioned reviewer no doubt jumped up on a chair holding her skirts and screaming.The heroine of this tale is impossibly noble and strong, but yearns for the even more impossibly noble and strong hero to relieve her of the burden. They are both willing to sacrifice years of comfort and health and happiness for a noble end. On his part he risks life itself: Try to imagine hacking your way through malarial jungles, warring on Arab slavers, and fighting off wild beasts in the days before anti-biotics, for example.He is an Imperialist and a Tory. So is everyone else in the book. Horrors! It\`s the 1890\`s. Haven\`t they heard of Obama?!? He - as our aforementioned friend tells us - is a racist. And since he\`s a racist, he wipes out slavery in an area of thousands of square miles and sends several hundred Arab slavers to an unscheduled appointment with Shaitan while he\`s about it. Terrible man.His worst sin, perhaps, is that stiff upper lip. Can't he show his emotions like the brave honest creatures who grace our wonderful world today? Can't he weep on cue for the TV cameras when a bunny wabbit gets hurt?Alas, no. Things were different once, sad as that may be.What else? In what seems almost like another book, there is a clever and entertaining couple who might remind you of \\"Nick and Nora Charles\\" of Hollywood fame. They even seem to be taking over the story towards the end. A very uneven job Maugham made here.Anyway, after the original surprise (the earliest Maugham I've read) I continued with pleasure and interest. I say again I think it must have been originally written as a play because no one could talk and act the way hero and heroine do in an otherwise naturalistic novel, but no doubt often did on the London stage in the 1890's.Three stars 'cause Maugham was learning and experimenting, I guess."},{"Title":"The Explorer (Collected Works of W. Somerset Maugham)","review":"I am a fan of Maugham and I suspect this is his worst book. Written and set at the beginning of the 20th century, the explorer of the title is an anachronism, the sort of blood-and-guts 'pacifier of the natives' who invaded east Africa 20 years earlier in the 1880s. Yet he is the character we have to take seriously as the hero and the center of the heroine's life. A lot is made of the beauty of British suppression of emotion, which was practiced and glorified for many decades, thankfully no longer, and from which Maugham himself, especially given his sexual feelings for men, must have suffered a great deal. The heroine is an annoying cipher whose principle activity is clenching her teeth and not crying. Finally, there are two civilized creatures of leisure who befriend hero and heroine and presage Maugham's later witty couples, but here are only mutually insulting, not amusing. This must have been a bad time in the author's life."},{"Title":"Claudine's Daughter","review":"Wonderful book.

The many pictures within the book speak the silent language of the heart. Her heartfelt words point us in the direction that all great spiritual sages and mystics have pointed, to the inner room of our heart, the Holy of Holies. From generality to nuance Christina takes us by the heart and leads us into the way of silence. Silence is the universal language spoken by Lao-Tzu, the Buddha, Jesus, and all those other sages and mystics that have spoken to our hearts down through the centuries. Silence is the common denominator of the spiritual life, East and West. Lao-Tzu once said, \\"The Tao that can be described is not the eternal Tao\\". Silence was very important to the Master of Paradox, to the \\"Old Child\\". The \\"Buddha\\" didn't achieve Nirvana until he gave up on the noise of religion and sat down and quietly meditated. Jesus the \\"Christ\\" went into the desert for forty-days and forty-nights to meditate and pray in silent solitude. He then changed the history of the world. As Christina states, \\"Silence lies at the heart of all our great Spiritual traditions. The variety of forms of contemplation, prayer, and meditation meet in their reverence for silence\\". Silence is golden.Silence is the sound of one hand clapping. The sound of nonduality. The sound of God. It is both personal and impersonal. Silence is tangible, the bed from which the universal source of being is aroused. There is an intimacy that can only be known and shared in silence. The intimacy of absolute love. It is in quiet solitude that we come to realize that we are never truly alone. Silence is a field where love grows.\\"Awe\\" ('fear' is a poor translation) of the Source of our being is the beginning of wisdom\\". Proverbs 9:10. Christina quotes from a poem by the Zen Master, Basho, \\"Speechless before These budding green Spring leaves in blazing sunlight\\". Again, awe is the beginning of wisdom. Awe is an attraction, fear is a distraction. Zen poetry is a language of the heart. Zen Koans are irrational alarm clocks for waking us from our slumber, from our inattention. Silence is a refuge that offers sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of modern life. The still small voice of God is always near. Silence is a gift that we give ourselves so that we can give ourselves to others. In silence we strip down to our essence. There is a spark of Divinity within each of us. An essence that is a part of the essence of God. The Kingdom of God is a family. In silence we remember our permanent home address. We are part of God, and yet God is other, and in others. Pride would limit God to self. Humility knows otherwise. In silence there is the reconciliation of East and West, of self and other, of self and God.Christina points out that there are many different paths or ways to silence that we can chose to take. That in the end each of us must learn to travel our own path. As no two snowflakes are exactly the same, no two paths are exactly the same. As they say in Hinduism, \\"Though truth is One, the Sages know it as Many\\". Others can give us guidance, but we must make the journey of self-discovery ourselves. The Wizard can't give us anything we don't already have. We must learn to see with the eyes of our heart and discover our own way to stillness if we are to live lives worth living, to live examined lives. \\"I pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened...\\" Ephesians 1:18. This journey of self-discovery is available to each of us. One such way to enlightenment that Christina points out is to follow one's breath...I have only scratched the surface of the depths of this book with this review. If I had to limit my library to 10 books, this would be one of them. It is spiritually universal in its scope. A good used hardcover copy can be had for less than $5, though it is well worth its new price."},{"Title":"Silence: How to Find Peace in a Busy World","review":"I found Silence to be a wonderful part of my meditation and self-calming efforts in this all too tense and busy world. It is a beautiful book in its writing and its wonderful pictures. I was instantly calmed when I read the first section, and looked forward to reading more each night before sleep. I am buying copies to gift to my tense friends and family. I plan to reread my copy often. I would highly recommend this peaceful and beautifully written book to anyone seeking calmness and peace in their lives."},{"Title":"Silence: How to Find Peace in a Busy World","review":"I am loving this book! I borrowed it from my local library and started taking so many notes that I decided I'd better buy my own copy! Her insights are wonderful and true. The only reason I'm only giving it 4 out of 5 stars is because I am disappointed w/ the photographs (out of date, out of focus, color is off, not inspirational like photography books of late and HD photography), but again, the text IS inspirational. I've ordered the book in used condition, which makes it VERY affordable, as the words are what I want to be able to read and re-read. I read her insights through a Christian lens, with no problem. God wants us to live each precious moment, mindfully. This book is a guide towards living that way. It is repetitive, but not in a tiresome way...we often don't \\"get it\\" the first \\"read\\" anyway, so the more oftentimes she may reiterate thoughts, the deeper the idea of our need to live in moments of \\"silence\\" burrows its way into our psyche. \\"Used\\" you can buy it for as little as $5. If you like the idea of learning more about the spiritual disciplines of silence and solitude, you will love this book."},{"Title":"Silence: How to Find Peace in a Busy World","review":"It took me several turns of heart before I bought this book, and all because this book costs SGD 60.27 at Kinokuniya Singapore. It was clinged wrapped at first and I had the service people opened it for me. The cover was a simple jacket of gold with the words \\"silence\\" in striking gold. The subtitle and the author's name appear in white. As silent as the subject of the book, the cover design is simple and freeing - full of space. I was struck (as with all coffee table book) by the quality of printing, the paper quality and the quality of the pictures. I discover at the point of writing this review that the book was printed and bound by a printer in Singapore. It was typeset and laid out in graphic style, not like the normal print of a book.The author writes about silence as observed by different traditions and religions. I find, however, after reading the whole book, that the slant is somewhat towards Buddhism (not that this bothers me). Pictures of Buddhist monks featured in many instances in the book. What erks me is the deliberate large print of some of the words in each page of the book. I guess the author was trying to highlight words that are associated with silence, peace and love but where I first thought that the large print made the typesetting graphical, after a while I got distracted on occasions by the jarring big and bold words. I was also distracted by sentences and quotes that are set in landscape format and in faint font all over the book.In all fairness, I did enjoy the book and I could resonate with some words of wisdom that the author wrote. For example, \\"Silence is what frees us to listen well, to live with authenticity and discover wholeness within ourselves.\\" \\"The joy of silence teaches us to be more generous, caring and sensitive.\\" Having myself experienced the rewards and joys of keeping silent moments in each day, I found myself nodding with approval and consensus with the author that indeed it is in silence that we learn about ourselves, and if we respond to change ourselves first, then love will be manifested through us and love will reach other people.This book, costly no doubt, is one worthwhile keepsake and a beautiful one to line my bookshelf. Looking at the pictures in the book give me different perspectives of silence and how simple objects can be viewed creatively so one sees God alive in them."},{"Title":"Silence: How to Find Peace in a Busy World","review":"Silence is a beautifully written book about a subject often misrepresented. Feldman's writing is wonderful, as always. \\"Silence\\" took me to that present moment which is always happening for us all if we can just be silent for a few moments. Spiritually moving."},{"Title":"Silence: How to Find Peace in a Busy World","review":"A beautifully written book about how to be comfortable with silence and how it helps everything in your life make sense."},{"Title":"Silence: How to Find Peace in a Busy World","review":"Christina Feldman rocks my worldI haven't actually read this one, but so far, she is the most interesting speaker on meditation and buddhism and all that enlightenment stuff that I have ever heard, keep rockin Christina!"},{"Title":"Silence: How to Find Peace in a Busy World","review":"I have been attempting to read this book but haven't gotten very far. It has delightful pictures and the words are nice, however I can't tell yet if it is repetitive in content. It is different than I expected. I do think there is potential for it to be a book one would want to read when relaxation is a goal."},{"Title":"Commentary on Matthew","review":"I must admit that I thought that this book was out of print. I read Broadus' commentary on the book of Matthew in 1983 when attending Bible college. Since that time I have often borrowed a copy of the book from others for reference sake. This book details the first book of the New Testament with amazing scholarship. Broadus digs deep into the 1st Century A.D. and brings out the manners and customs of the day and uses the information to bring color to the Biblical story of Jesus Christ's life as recorded by Matthew. It also cross references to the other three gospels and puts together a detailed and complete record of Christ's journey on earth.I like the book because it takes the subject seriously and seeks to examine the very words in the Book of Matthew -- not just paraphrase it as I have often seen other authors do. It is not a novel -- it is a reference guide must for anyone serious about knowing the gospel according to Matthew."},{"Title":"It Crawled from the South: An R.E.M. (Rock Band) Companion","review":"Beyond compare. Aside, obviously, from his accomplishments in ammassing a wealth of information and trivia the chief outstanding feature of the book is the author's ability to convey his admiration and enthusiasm for the band while remaining somehow detatched and clear-sighted enough to criticise and poke fun of them. Volumes of this sort are typically so laden by melodramatic praise that the fawning writer makes his work unreadable. In short 'It Crawled From the South', is not only a break from the norm, but is also a spectacular piece when viewed out of context and in isolation."},{"Title":"It Crawled from the South: An R.E.M. (Rock Band) Companion","review":"I've read this book cover to cover and then gone back to read my favorite bits later. It was my introduction to the details of R.E.M.'s history, and I think it certainly served that purpose well. And I enjoyed the writing style and the commentary almost as much as I enjoyed all the insanely random little bits of information."},{"Title":"It Crawled from the South: An R.E.M.

Can be used as a reference, or novel-type of a read. Covers everything you wanted to know about R.E.M. and more. The revised edition is wonderfully thorough and well-researched. This is the R.E.M. Bible."},{"Title":"It Crawled from the South: An R.E.M. (Rock Band) Companion","review":"so it might be outdated. That being said, I do not care enough to find out if Mr. Gray's writing skills have improved since then, because, along with braces and eighties hair bands, it is not somehting I have any interest in enduring yet again. Lots of reseacch, plenty of insight (his analysis of &quot;Kahotek&quot; from Fables is extremely illuminating, but, man, what a miserable excuse for a writer...You'd be better off reading Talk About the Passion and the Rolling Stone compendium."},{"Title":"It Crawled from the South: An R.E.M. (Rock Band) Companion","review":"The one word that comes to mind when I think of It Crawled From the South is &quot;tome.&quot; It is a massive collection of REM-emorabilia, as opposed to a chronological history (a definitive REM-ography has yet to be written). I actually managed to sit down and read the whole thing like a novel when it first came out a few years ago. It has much more information about the band than any other book. It has no rival, even. The man who wrote it clearly loves their music and his passion really comes through loud and clear. And I guess that's what you're looking for when it comes to any book."},{"Title":"It Crawled from the South: An R.E.M. (Rock Band) Companion","review":"Vastly improves over the rambling 1st edition. Not so many annoying allusions and insights by the author and an index to boot. Less pictures though. Solidifies its place as the definitive work."},{"Title":"It Crawled from the South: An R.E.M. (Rock Band) Companion","review":"I treasured this book when I was in my jangle pop phase, spinning Let's Active, the DBs, Dillon Fence and REM all the time. Clearly REM were the best if not the most prolific of the genre, and their thoughtful music made an indelible mark outside that particular subset as well.This book covers REM right up until they utterly lost the thread -- after Bill Berry left and the self importance kicked in. There are some wonderful anecdotes included here, as well as enlightening little snippets from interviews. Most impressive is the collection of stage banter from a slew of shows the author attended. And did you know that Morrisey wrote \\"Found Found\\" about Micheal Stipe? Still not sure if I believe that.A nice companion for a band that made a lot of great music before Monster came out and ruined it all."},{"Title":"It Crawled from the South: An R.E.M. (Rock Band) Companion","review":"This book is full of inaccuracies. I can't believe other reviewers haven't noticed this.If I knew where it was, I would pull it out and point out some examples. But, since I can't, I will say from memory, that the author didn't know words to songs. He was quoting lyrics and trying to interpret songs, and quoting lyrics that were demonstrably incorrect.Like, oh, \\"Can't Get There From Here\\". There was a music video released for this song, that was captioned by the band. Many of the lyrics were there, in readable letters, for all the world to see. I thought, \\"This guy must have never seen the music video. That's kind of sloppy research, to have not seen the videos of the band that you're trying to write a book about.\\" Then, later, it became clear that he HAD seen this video, or at least had had someone else summarize it to him. And he still got the lyrics wrong. Mysterious, brain-shattering idiocy.That is just one small example. The book is full of garbage like that.And, god, the song interpretations. Laughable. Hilariously bad.Not to mention, what is up with the author's snobby, bratty attitude? Not a very good tone to take, when your research is so bad and incomplete, and frequently shoddy.The book is good for writing mocking notes in the margins. It's VERY good for that. It's also good if you like to circle or underline misinformation."},{"Title":"It Crawled from the South: An R.E.M.

It's an utter waste of time. The biology review section is hardly comprehendable, and concentrates on such minute and ridiculous details that it's far more frustrating than productive to read. The organic chem review section is a joke, and is only a few pages long. The practice tests have questions that are not representative of those appearing on the actual exam. The only section in the pratice exams that MIGHT be remotely useful is the verbal section. But even here, while the passasges are okay, the questions are not very representative of those on the actual exam. With horrible review sections and practice tests that are even worse, this book is a complete waste of your money. I got duped into buying it becasue the price was so much lower than the price on other review books. Now I know why.

The review of sciences was pretty in-depth. There was way more information in it and more complicated information than what was on the real MCAT. The 4 sample examinations were not good - nothing like the real MCAT. Science passages had a different format from the real thing - more passages based on prior memorized information than on-the-spot critical reasoning.

The review section is way too general, and the four &quot;model&quot; examinations are both too easy and do not accurately reflect the actual content of the real exam. For example in the biological sciences sections, there were no organic chemistry questions at all, but instead an overwhelming majority of questions about human physiology. Anyone planning to take the MCAT would be better served by buying A) the released MCAT tests available from the AAMC and B) a better review book like Kaplan."},{"Title":"How to Prepare for the McAt: Medical College Admission Test (Barron's How to Prepare for the New Medical College Admission Test Mcat)","review":"This book was a joke; if you plan on doing poorly on the MCAT waste your time learning from this book.

OK, I may have left out a few. But, he claimed that was his strategy for building a $8.25 per square foot house, when a contractor-built house costs more than 10 times that in most areas of the country. I was really expecting some practical how-to help, and his help was to tell me to go out and buy a lot of books written by other people. How weak! I'd like to know how he built his own windows, and what materials he used. Nothing past the exterior shell was described. How did he finish the interior and keep it so cheap? He admits leaving the upstairs unfinished, but how did he finish the main floor? No details at all. What a waste of time and money! By the way, it appears to have been printed on a poor quality copy machine, typeset on an old manual typewriter, and the bindings were probably done in the author's garage. He's obviously figured out how to apply tighwad principles, just not how to communicate them."},{"Title":"User Friendly English - Hebrew / Hebrew - English Dictionary","review":"I have been using the Inbal dictionary for my translation work on a regular basis and find it extremely useful.

I was frustrated by the lack of well known artists not represented in this volume and surprised by the inclusion of many lesser known artists. I do realize that not all artists can be covered in a single volume. In summary I believe it is well worth a quick view but for various reasons (one being its price) I would advise checking it out from the public library before spending $40 dollars purchasing this book.

The Real Woman's Guide to Meeting and Marrying (Capital Ideas)","review":"I read several dating self-help books when I was single and this was one of the very few that was helpful for me. It did make me look at my search differently, helping me change my approach. I actually followed the authors' suggestions and made files for the different types of men in my life, considering who was who, addressing each one's prospects and deciding how to go about meeting more eligible men. The best part is that I was about 40 when I read the book and had become somewhat bitter about my prospects. Because of the book I dug a little deeper, not nixing a potential guy who I felt chemistry with but who I initially believed wouldn't be able to give me everything I wanted (marriage). I watched how he handled me and his life rather than assessed him my previous way. He actually told me during early dating that he did not plan to get married again but did want a committed relationship, so I kept dating others and explained to him that I intended to meet someone who wanted to get married. I didn't play a game, I was just honest with him about what I was looking for and he got it, evaluating his needs and deciding he did want what I wanted. I am so glad I assessed him correctly because I am now engaged and about to be married to a man who far surpasses all of my expectations! Hooray!"},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"Bruce Stockler's I Sleep at Red Lights is a wondeful memoir which recounts Stockler's experience, for a couple years at least, of parenting triplets. Stockler's experience is a little different than most dads, however. While his wife is a high-powered lawyer at a Manhattan law firm, Stockler is the one who eventually stays home with the kids. They start out in Manhattan in a small apartment, but eventually move to the suburbs. Stockler's story is very funny and heartwarming. ONe of the things that makes this book work is Stockler's almost brutal honesty--he sugarcoats nothing--not his relationship with his wife or his feelings for his kids. His life has not been picture-perfect in the Norman Rockwell sense, but there is a lot of love in that Stockler family and Stockler shares it with us well. Enjoy."},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"I heard the author on public radio, talking about his crazy marriage and his book, and so I just bought it. It's a riot! I've never read anything by a man that's at once so funny and observant, but also so touching, emotionally revealing and meaningful. The best part is his brutal honesty--while still being funny--about how difficult marriage is. It's about being a man, being married to a man, juggling marriage and kids--and the chapters on taking his kids to the ladies' room and the supermarkets are classics. My only complaint is--no pictures! Except for the author--and the bags under his eyes tell me this is DEFINITELY a true story."},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"I'm an older, working, single mother of twins and this is a TERRIFIC book.

It's great to stumble across a book that really breaks new ground and I'm giving it to my husband and my girlfriends.

This guy is honest (example: he states that he loves his son more than he loves his wife early on in the book), can really turn a phrase, and loves, loves, loves his (older son) Asher and his babies. I would love to meet him at Starbucks and have a cup of coffee. He is a man who gets it! How about a sequel or two? The kids are only about 7 and 3 when it ends. God bless this lovely, human man."},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"I Sleep At Red Lights is one of those small, wonderful books that you give to your best friend. That's why my best friend did to me. I fell in love with it and immediately gave it to my book club. We read it together with &quot;AGAINST LOVE: A Polemic,&quot; By Laura Kipnis, and together the two books provide an amazing look inside marriage and family. Stockler's book is an unusually honest and provacative account of a role-reversal marriage in which he is the emotional backbone and his wife the provider. It's also a wonderful love poem not only to his children but from all fathers to all children. Kipnis's book is more academic but equally humorous, a scathing and profound attack on the obsolescent institution of marriage, but written from the outside. The difficulties in Stockler's marriage can be partially explained by Kipnis's analysis--both Stockler and his wife find themselves trapped in roles, even though they are reversed--and yet the humor and resiliency in Stockler's book clearly shows how one true life example can confound even the most intuitive, carefully-researched critique. Stockler's marriage shouldn't work, but it does. That doesn't detract from Kipnis's book; in fact, she would probably appreciate the quirky way the Stockler family adapts. Together, these two books make an irresistible reading group package that will keep you talking for weeks."},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"Wow, I can't remember the last time I laughed out loud when reading a book. I was reading this out loud to my wife and my brother. Stockler's book works on three levels--first, it's just a hilarious adventure story. The chapters on taking the kids to the ladies room (because the men's room is filthy, which he compares to The Andromeda Strain) and going to the supermarket, where the kids cause mayhem, are classics. But underneath all the comedy is a really incredible intelligence, always taking a step back and analyzing how his life works, what's important, and what it's like to be a man. It's also an incredibly honest look at marriage. Stockler admits that he ie emotionally closer to his kids than hiw wife, and, in his own quiet way, it's kind of a revolutinoary statement. He basically says that being married is harder than being a Dad. That takes a lot of guts--but this is one honest book. He also writes about the dynamics of the kids--they way the four of them have a whole spider-web of interlocking relationships--the the eyes for detail that Graham Greene had for his characters. And the third level is the journey he takes--how he folds in his parents and his childhood to deliver us to a discovery of who he is and where he came from. So it's also a very serious book. Much more serious than the cover would have you think. It's a more important memoir than any memoir I've read. While it's not as &quot;important&quot; or post-modern or self-conscious as Dave Egger's masterpiece, I think it is more honest and compelling, and much more true. It's also more insightful than the two Augusten Burroughs books. It's really a one-of-a-kind book and I'm glad I discovered it. Read this book. It will stay in your mind for weeks."},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"I absolutely fell in love with this book, a gift from a girlfriend. It's one of those books you pass along to people you love. It's unique--memoir, journey, humorous essay, exploration of marriage--and incredibly passionate. The book received almost no hype, which is a shame, because it's as good or better than most of the 2003 memoirs, large and small--Ambulance Girl, Jarhead, True Notebooks, Hillary Clinton, etc. It's 100 times the book that &quot;A Million Little Pieces&quot; is, but it's almost always about the advertising and the PR, not the book. A charming, intelligent and surprising book, for parents and non-parents alike."},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"I didn't have triplets, but I did survive colic. I was so relieved that someone out there was more sleep deprived than I was, that I told everyone about this book. Even if you have just one baby at a time, read &quot;I Sleep at Red Lights&quot; for a funny, honest look at the first years of parenthood."},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"The author is a humor writer who uses his skills to dig deep down inside the unique and chaotic situation of his home life--having triplets, losing his job, becoming a stay at home Dad, trying to work through a difficult marriage--by paying attention to the little details that make a story absorbing and pulling back to reveal how much energy it takes to change the course of your life. A really joyful, liberating look at fatherhood and family life that deserves a much wider audience than the baby book ghetto it has been lumped into."},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"I have never laughed so hard in my life, tears were coming out of my eyes & I couldn't even read parts aloud to my husband because I was laughing/gasping/snorting too hard. I'm a parent of a 5 y.o. and infant triplets so it was a lot of recognition, especially when he described the feelings of utter chaos, the state of the house slowly degenerating (housekeeping wise) and the constant, grinding sleep deprivation. His descriptions of being up all night as, one after the other, the babies scream, poop, vomit and demand something from him over and over are dead on, as are his descriptions of falling asleep in public places, uncomfortable positions and rationalizing deliberately taking naps at stoplights. (I have fallen asleep while using a breast pump, unfortunately the cones migrated as I snored and drooled all over myself and I ended up with hickeys on my rib cage, but... I got 45 solid min of sleep so overall a positive experience!)Best line ever: (after falling asleep on the toilet) \\"Daddy, what are you doing in here?\\" Sleeping son. Your father sleeps on toilets. Sometimes I take vacations in the sink.I have no idea why this guy isn't paid big bucks to be a writer for a professional comedian, with his deliciously snarky sense of humor and rapier-like turn of phrase he should be working for Jon Stewart or someone like that."},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"A fun and fast read about a world of discovery, both from the perspective of the new-parents and all four children as everyone discovers and rediscovers their individual challenges in finding family roles.For me, there were laugh out loud moments. However, those paled in comparison to the managed chaos of the everyday that the author lovingly portrays with a whisper-in-your-ear honesty that is refreshing in its confident modesty as he approaches an EVEREST of fear and revelation.This book seems a good primer for anyone expecting higher order multiples (as I am!). I continue to be terrified but am at least better informed that some terror is rightly founded. But, it also gave me great pause to know that it has been done and a healthy dose of humor mixed with constant honesty will guide the way."},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"I got my husband this back in 2005 when he was in Iraq and the triplets were infants. He laughed so hard and just loved this book! It made him feel like he wasn't alone and gave a lighter side life with triplets. It's not meant to bea triplet Bible or a \\"how to\\", but just a funny version of what one person's life is like with triplets."},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"This book drove me up the wall. There is not one single likeable person in this tale, including the kids, who are well on their way to becoming complete brats by the conclusion--thanks to their father's lack of discipline and their mother's constant absence. I didn't find it amusing that he let his kids run all over the place in public, or that bedtime was never enforced. Maybe Stockler is vicariously living his \\"wild child\\" side through them, but such selfish people do not make the world a better place. And spending time with them via this book is maddening."},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"I got this book when my triplets were about 18 months old. They're 4 years old now. After putting the kids to bed at night, I would read 3 or 4 pages before dropping off to sleep. I loved it. After finishing it, I would open it up randomly to just remind myself how funny parenting can be if you can find just a few minutes to reflect on your day. Stockler's honesty about all the dimensions of his life at that time makes this book very special."},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I felt like someone finally acknowledged the emotional roller coaster ride of being triplet parents.This is a must read for all triplet parents!"},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"This is a truly sad statement on today's society. People who go into debt to have children that they don't want to raise (the wife specifically) then cry poor the whole time while shopping at specialty markets and renting vacation houses. Please. They will parade their children around to boost their egos but when the time comes to actually parent, no one is around. The wife is especially disgusting - she can stay up at night to watch TV but can't help her husband take care of the fussy children. It is far from funny - more like pathetic."},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"If a woman had triplets and &quot;decided&quot; to stay home to care for them (mainly because she'd lost her job anyway), she wouldn't have a ghost of a chance of publishing a book about it. But a man does it, and he's supposed to be a saint? Give me a break. This book is boring and painful."},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"I was sorry I spent money on this book.

I give both books five stars for family humor!"},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"Wow -- this book really made my New Year start off with a bang. A girlfriend gave it to me for Christmas, and I read it straight through on New Year's Day. It is unbelievably charming and well-written, and the author takes the form of the memoir and a parenting book and makes them uniquely his own. My husband is a wonderful father, but much more reserved and old-fashioned when it comes to the emotional core of this book. I laughed out loud and cried, too. I'm definitely going to use it in my book club. And I'm giving it as my belated Xmas present to all my girlfriends. A great find -- pass it along."},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"My sister gave me this book for Mother's Day because I was complaining about how my husband would rather watch the Braves or Falcons than play with the kids. What an amazing and incredible book! The author is a magazine editor married to a lawyer, and they have a fairly typical role-reversal marriage--he takes care of the kid on nights and weekends, she does renovation projects--but their lives are turned upside down when they have triplets. The way he writes about his feelings for his kids, and his tensions with his wife, are incredibly honest and hilariously true. The author loses his job, becomes a full-time stay-at-home Dad, they move to the suburbs, they suffer a death in the family--it's really a roller coaster ride, and the writing is just beautiful. I laughed out loud and I cried. I read some reviews where they didn't like the wife, but I did--she's a real person, with good and bad sides, and not a black and white character like in most memoirs. I can't get my husband to read the book--but all my girlfriends have and I'm giving it to my mother-in-law for Xmas--my last hope. She'll understand!"},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"As the mother of two sets of twins born 3 years apart I can understand everything Bruce writes about. For all of you that wrote negative comments you probably haven't been there or done it so don't criticize his or Roni's parenting techniques. With so many kids the same age you have to do whatever keeps you sane, even if it is hiring a nanny to care for your kids. I loved this book and would recommend it to parents, especially dads of multiples."},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"I read one of the author's Op Ed pieces, saw the title of the book, and decided to give it a try. This book was the most wonderful surprise, as fresh as a smack across the face, as funny as Jon Stewart on a roll, as honest as a Norah Jones song. The author's relationship with his wife is rendered with amazing depth and complexity, but it's his pulsating awareness of how important his children are and how blessed every day is that makes the book such a joy to read. The only negative is the cover, which makes it look like one of those ooey-gooey baby books I never read. You should definitely give it a read."},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"This is a love story. The story moves so quickly, and so much happens to the author and his family, that it didn't hit me until the final pages how this book was really an elegant and deeply-felt love story of a man and his children. I was very moved by the author's brutal honesty about how difficult his marriage is and how his emotional relationship with his children becomes the central fact of his life. It's a wonderful book, I laughed and cried and was sad when it was over."},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"I'm a single woman with no children and could not be induced to read a book on \\"parenting\\" if it were the last tome left on a scorched earth after the last book-barbecue. Luckily that's not what this is. It is a love story told at an action-adventure pace about what happens to a relationship when two strong-willed personalities are faced with a spectacularly successful IVF attempt.Does everything end happily ever after? Hell no, there's a lot of headbutting and that 's what you've got to love about this book, Stockler is disarmingly honest about marital dynamics post delivery, about his neuroses and hers. These are two very strong characters who can really duke out those issues about the expectations of what \\"Mommy\\" does and what \\"Daddy\\" does that lurk right below the covers of most marriage of this generation with kids.The kids are characters and Stockler's descriptions of theiroddyssies through supermarkets and, in one of the funniest scenes from a memoir in modern memory, when Stockler takes the triplets and their slightly older brother to the ladiesroom at a mall (a chapter worth [$$$] on its own), but more interesting is the undlerlying relationship he has with his wife. Both are strong willed and awkwardly shuffling classicgender roles, challenging each other without a road map as the encounter some rough road -- corporate America may give lip service to the Little League Dad, but has no tolerance for a male primary care parent who needs toinvoke the same privileges woman have been afforded, Stockler finds.This guys is hilarious, but even more rare he is emotionally honest about family life which so often is suffused withmawkishness or self-conscious irony. Stockler is really trying to figure out how to live happily ever after.I read this book in one night!!!"},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"Bruce Stocklers story of life after triplets left me feeling that the joys of parenthood are what life is all about. From running through supermarkets, to mealtime and equal time, children are the fun and laughter of our lives. The book is also poignant. Stocklers description of bringing his older son into the healthfood srore to make fun of the funny foods, shows a sentitive and observant side that all children, whether they be a multiple, the oldest or youngest all deserve their parents time and energy. When he describes his tiny wife, bedridden and huge, its hard not to laugh at his desciption and cry for her predicament. Bruce Stockler says he realizes the sacrifices his wife made for him to be able to stay home and write and care for the children while she worked long hard hours, also shows a man who understands how lucky he is to have a wife who not only was able to support a family, but to sacrifice for their well being."},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"I am giving this wonderful, funny and clear-eyed book about family, marriage, love, career and the meaning of life to my sisters, girlfriends, my two aunts and the other teachers in my school for Christmas. Also on my Xmas list is Mitch Albom's &quot;The Five People...&quot;, which is more manipulative and sentimental, but, put together, a nice combination of a great book by a first-time author and an easy-reading best-seller."},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"I am ordering a few more copies to send to my friends who also have small kids because it is HYSTERICAL and so true to life - even if you don't have multiples. Please read this book!"},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"I really love this book. It's unique and &quot;special&quot; the way certain books are in your life--remember how &quot;Zen &amp; The Art of Motorcyle Maintenance&quot; made you feel? Or &quot;The World According to Garp?&quot; This isn't as literary as &quot;Zen,&quot; but it is extremely well-written. It also manages to be one of the most insightful and honest books I've ever read on marriage, being a parent, facing career choices and financial decisions--how all the complexities of life come together. (Ladies, it's also a rare insight into how men think. My husband's already getting aggravated hearing about it!) It's sneaky how the author makes the book seem like a comic adventue story, kind of a Please Don't Meet the Daises on speed--there's a lot going on, and the author keeps the book moving briskly, which I admire--but the moments of introspection, when he examines how is life is changing and how he is changing, are incredbly thoughtful. The book is rarely sentimental, but poignant about what matters most in life. The way he writes about his four children is so keenly observed, you don't notice he's really writing about our whole American life. What he's saying is, you don't have unlimited choices and time in life, and by learning how to shift your priorities--both in your head and outside yourself--you really grow. You can read this as a funny and smart beach book or look between the lines for the very hard-earned wisdom. I laughed and I cried--this is a book about ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances rendered with really evocative and passionate power. Buy one for your parents and your best friend and your book club."},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"Right after I gave birth to my son, Anne LaMott's Operating Instructions was my bible. It told very real, accurate and funny stories about the weird world we all occupy during our children's first year. This book does it times 3 or 4. I enjoyed Stocklers real-life tale of taking a small army to the grocery store or trying to find a clean bathroom in a shopping mall. Funny, touching and emotionally literate. This is what it's really like - the tremendous pride and happiness, the self-doubt, the humor that only sleep deprivation can produce. It's refreshing to read about the emotional experiences of a man who is a stay-at-home dad. He is ruthless in his observation of the corporate world and how truly family -unfriendly it is. This is a great baby present for any expecting family. Read it."},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"What a funny, funny guy Stockler is. I bought this book for my wife for her birthday and read it myself. This guy is way funnier and smarter than Dave Barry, but not as literary as David Sedaris (but more clued into reality)--he's right up the middle. This book made me laugh but also think. It's also paced like an adventure story, moves quickly. Lots of great characters in the book--the author, his eccentric wife, the babysitter, the crazy people he meets. A great read.

The trips+1 are lucky to have these parents.I was lucky to read this book. u will b2"},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"This is an extremely funny, and extremely well written book. It is also a light read. Anybody who has kids and has silently thanked God that they did not have twins or triplets themselves will enjoy Stockler's honest and witty rendering of what life with triplets is really like (i.e., chaotic and sleep-deprived).Unfortunately, my enjoyment of this book was marred by my increasing dislike of Stockler's wife. If Stockler described their relationship and her involvement as a parent honestly, I can't understand why he remains married to her and/or why she ever bothered to go through IVF in the first place. She is a high powered New York lawyer, who works until at least 10 pm most nights and often later. Stockler's book is a litany of all the important rites of passage that Roni missed because she was at work, as well as all the &quot;unimportant&quot; (but just as crucial from the perspective of a child) day in and day out moments that make up the bulk of child-rearing. I am a working mother myself, but I took unpaid leaves of absence for the first years of both my children's lives, and I gladly put up with lowered productivity (and hence salary) now in order to make my children my highest priority. I might have been more understanding if Stockler's wife was doing important, challenging work that she found fulfilling, but according to Stockler, she HATED her job and was there just for the money. And it was at that point I lost sympathy for both her and Stockler. There are more important things than money, and being there to raise your children well is one of them. Stockler acknowledged repeatedly through the book that Roni didn't have to endure that brutal work schedule, that they could have moved to a more affordable region of the country and gotten by on what she (or he) could have made in a more normal job with less brutal work hours. The big unanswered question in the book is why the heck they didn't, then.But Stockler wasn't much of a hero himself. As you read the book, his obvious love for his children shines through (although while I appreciate his honesty in pointing out his difficulties in bonding with the one girl, Hannah, I cringe to think of how she will feel one day when she reads this book), and you've got to admire his willingness to be not just Mr. Mom, but Mr. Mom of triplets and an older child. But I found myself wishing he would read a few parenting manuals, as some of his parenting tactics (offering bribes for good behavior, letting the children stay up as late as they want on school nights) leave much to be desired. I know it is hard to be firm and enforce rules, and it must be exponentially more difficult when dealing with three toddlers at once, but as every parent (except, apparently, Stockler) knows, giving in is easier in the short term but sets disastrous precedents for the long run. The giving in and bribes sure make for more entertaining reading, but I can't help but think that these are going to be some pretty out of control teenagers.I probably shouldn't criticize when I have not (thank God) had to deal with the breath-taking logistical problems of raising triplets. That Stockler has been able to do so while maintaining a sharp sense of humor is to his credit. However, I think it is fair to say that when I reached the end of the book, my memories of having chuckled through most of it were overshadowed by the sad realization that this book portrays the worst of modern American culture: when a big paycheck is more important than spending time with your children."},{"Title":"I Sleep at Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets","review":"You'll be laughing so hard that people will be staring at you. Hey, this guy is as funny as Dave Barry.

I love memoirs and biographies, but this book is one-of-a-kind. Stockler sees everything in his life--his marriage to his wacky wife, his 3-year-old, and the startling news that his small family is going to double in size--through a comic lens. But that lense is incredibly sharp and accurate--behind all the funny stories there is a very penetrating sensibility. He finds the drama in the most mundane--a trip to the bathroom with all four kids--and the humor in the dramatic--when he goes to the NICU to see &quot;Baby A&quot; after the C-section, and the NICU seems to have lost the baby. There are moments of chaos and craziness followed by dollops of wistful insight that are real epiphanies. I have little kids and reading this book is like seeing my life in a whole new light. Some of the thoughts Stockler comes up with I have had myself, and some are so clever and funny I'm jealous I didn't think of them. It's really an amazing book and you can't put it in a category--it's a new kind of memoir for our new world of working moms, stay-at-home Dads, fertility problems, careers that go wrong.

It is interesting to see them develop unique personalities and the parents should be commended on trying to make sure the kids (including the oldest, non-triplet son) grow up close to their siblings.But my enjoyment of the book was marred by several things. For one, the author is very clear about his favortism towards his sons at the expense of his daughter. I can't help but think about how she'll feel growing up and reading that one day. While the author worried about letting her be too much of a typical girl, because he thought he would spend sleepless nights worrying about her during her teen years, a more pressing issue are the sleepless nights he'll endure while she's out dating man after man trying to find the love and attention she didn't get from her father.Also I have to wonder what kind of man sits back letting his wife work 90 hours a week at a job she hates, fighting with her over who gets to wheel the stroller down the block to the coffee shop the few times she is home, and won't improve his wife's work/family balance by either getting a job of his own or moving to any one of the numerous places they could raise a family for less money. The only real reasons he gives for not moving are that their family is close (although they don't seem to see them that much anyway) and that he doesn't like change. Maybe not, but a change where your kids actually get to grow up with a mom would be a change worth making."},{"Title":"I do?: Being happy being married","review":"The author has written this book in a way so that it appears as if she is your best friend giving advece to you.

When my marriage was falling apart I had a Christian friend that had bought the book to read...I saw him with it and felt compelled to ask him if I could borrow it to read (he was somewhat aware of my marital issues)...he did and I read it in one evening. The further I read in the book that more I understood and realized how much I had/was hurting my wife, not in a physical way, but rather mentally & emotionally by the way I didn't treasure her and what she wanted to and was able to contribute to our marriage. By the second chapter my heart was broken with conviction and tears of sorrow were prevalent! To be honest...this was about the second step in God intervening in my life to help me realize that I could not be a good husband without His love fully a part of it. But, this book is one I have cherished and given to a number of friends (guys) who had struggling marriages, and have seen the reading of this book having very positive results! This is not a \\"religious\\" book per se, although the author acknowledges that the love God wants us to give our wives is unselfish, honest, and regularly dispensed. If you, as a husband, are not in a good/great marriage I would consider this book a MUST READ...if you have a good/great marriage, I still think this book is an excellent book to remind us of the treasure and gift that God gives us in our wives...and this book helps us all to consider this and inspires us to love our wives in the way they need and the way we should!"},{"Title":"Do Yourself a Favor: Love Your Wife","review":"After reading the reviews for this book, I ordered it (used) for my son.

It shares GREAT insight for men on HOW to love their wives and why their wife does the things they do and what she is expecting of her naturally as God intended. No other book that I have encountered teaches men the ins and outs of why they are where they are as this book does. It is a must read for all men looking to be what he is meant to be here on earth. It should be taught in school. The synopsis needs to be changed.

Often we get left wondering what happened when this woman ends up gone or, at best, leaves us alone in our own house. Many such marriage let downs could be eliminated simply through discovering and using the practicalities of marriage which abound within this book. Every man could use a dose of this stuff on a regular basis. A great book for real men."},{"Title":"Do Yourself a Favor: Love Your Wife","review":"THIS BOOK IS ONE THAT I WISH EVERY MAN WOULD READ AND RE-READ EVERY YEAR OF HIS MARRIED LIFE.

GREAT PRESENT FOR A NEWLYWED MAN...."},{"Title":"Do Yourself a Favor: Love Your Wife","review":"Having just finished reading this book, I must admit that at times I felt like the authur was way too hard on husbands and blamed them for all the problems in marriage. Surely wifes desire some blame in difficult marriages! Yet, the more I read and opened up, the more I felt his assessment is fair given our God given responsibilities as the head of the home. But, be warned; the lessons in this book will only work if you are committed to living a Christian lifestye. Although there are many type-o's throughout the book and it is a bit rambling at times, as my pastor says, \\"you need to eat the hay and leave the sticks\\". If you are able to be objective and set a side your natural defensiveness as a man, you will find many useful lessons in this book. Also, another excellent book on the subject is Loving Your Wife as Christ Loves the Church by Larry McCall. It is a kinder, gentler approach to the same subject.

He suggested every married couple should read this book. My husband has really enjoyed it and it has given him much insight. I lost my 1st husband to Cancer and me and my present husband reconnected (January 2011) after 21 years apart. We married 10 months after reconnecting and it has been WONDERFUL! I would highly suggest any couple to read this book!"},{"Title":"Do Yourself a Favor: Love Your Wife","review":"This book has to be God inspired the way it is so right on with the reasons behind a womans response.I have never been able to word it this well when I have tried.It does not get a woman off the hook either in her position, but truly explains why she reacts as she does.Woman are made to follow and serve and when we are not \\"able\\" to carry out what we were made for, we get very lost.We desire to be led, but our leadership must make sense with how we are designed, to our chidren also.Compassion and lack of pride is a foundation here, without it nothing will work peacefully.I am so thankful this book addresses it so clearly.It is alot for a man to swallow, but if you want things to work like they were designed, its the only way it will work peacefully."},{"Title":"Do Yourself a Favor: Love Your Wife","review":"I took the time to read this book and it was brilliant. Written by a man, but seen through the eyes of a woman. He knows exactly what a woman needs and wants in a man. Well written and to the point. All men should read."},{"Title":"First Air Campaign (Great Campaigns)","review":"This book is a good basic survey of the first campaign of aerial warfare, from the opening days when gentlemen amateur aviators threw bricks at each other to the highly systematized deployments of 1918.&quot;The First Air Campaign&quot; combines a substantial discussion of tactics, overall air strategy, and technological innovation with a surprisingly human touch. This last aspect of the book derives in part from several well-placed &quot;capsules,&quot; or vignettes separate from the text. This allows sample stories of individuals into the text without interfering with the main discussion's flow. I found a section on women pilots particular interesting and new.Finally, the book's photographic reproductions are superb. Connecting the black-and-white faces of young men whose voices the text recreates either as they rhapsodize about fighting like knights above the clouds or write resignedly of their (usually accurate) premonitions of death puts a power into this book that can't easily be described."},{"Title":"First Air Campaign (Great Campaigns)","review":"This is an excellent book with a great format. The authors created a chapter for each year of the war and then followed each up with a conclusion and a facts page/biography. Although not as indepth relating to those who flew, it gives an otherwise well encompassing look at WWI aviation. This book is definitely going to spark an interest in anyone who reads it."},{"Title":"First Air Campaign (Great Campaigns)","review":"I was really enjoying this book until I hit page 37. That is because I then realized there was no page 38. Or 39 for that matter. In fact, it does not resume until page 46, so I would say be wary of purchasing the softcover version of this book. To be fair it does seem like a nice introduction to this subject. I just have a preference for new books containing all their pages."},{"Title":"Midnight Cowboy","review":"The book has (I think) all of the movie covered, but gives more back story for the main character. Joe Buck's story is a largely tragic tale set in the late 60's or early 70's. I remeber liking the movie when I saw it several years ago and I liked reading this book too. Although, there is some sad content in many of the character's lives.Hoffman really did an amazing job playing the Ratso/Rizzo/Rico character. Such a good job that I kept imagining Rainman as Ratso when reading this. So I find that the book and the film are hard to separate.Reading the book was an enjoyable experience that brought back bittersweet memories of old \\"friends\\" that I had forgotten.No issues at all with the kindle version. Not certain if I would have paid for this...it was free."},{"Title":"Midnight Cowboy","review":"Not being an expert on the modern American novel, I'm reluctant to state that \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" is one of the great American novels, but I will, anyway. It's vastly superior to the film, a shallow and perverse adaptation. (Please see my Amazon review.)Herlihy's characters are so vividly realistic, and his writing so elegantly simple, that one is not immediately aware that the story is an attack on American society's grossly materialistic \\"values\\".The ending leaves the reader hanging. Joe has decided to abandon prostitution, to find a regular job and get Ratso the treatment he needs, but before he can do any of these things, Ratso dies. Lacking another human being to help -- and thus, no unselfed purpose in life -- what will Joe do?The implication is that Joe will fall back into a life of aimless prostitution (he's learned enough to know how to turn tricks), as he no longer has the motive -- a sincere personal relationship -- for changing. If Herlihy _wanted_ Joe to be \\"saved\\", would he not have shown it?Herlihy might be suggesting that we are what we are, and it is almost impossible to change our values. But that is perhaps reading too much into the novel's intent. Nevertheless, this is hardly an \\"uplifting\\" story. One might even interpret it as cyncial.However you interpret it, \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" is an exceptional novel, one of those rare books that rewards the time spent reading it. I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Midnight Cowboy","review":"Yes, I've seen the movie. We've ALL seen the movie, and heard the landmark 60's soundtrack from the film. Jon Voight's memorable portrayal of Joe Buck lingers on through the years. Reading the original novel is like entering a time machine, and finding yourself transported back to a gritty Pre-Disney Times Square, and meeting once again, the tired and greasy denizens of 42nd Street we used to step over and ignore back when we were foolish and young enough to bravely tramp along, confident in our youthful invulnerability.Meeting up with Joe Buck now, it's almost astonishing to see how he's, or we've changed.Can it be that poor simple Joe, was really a primordial Forrest Gump? Or is it we who've slipped further down the slippery slope of cynicism as we romp through author Herlihy's lushly descriptive, and yet hauntingly innocent text, lo these 30+ years later?Just as the cinematic Gump drifted as a cork over the waves of history, the literary Buck too, finds himself cast into a world niether he, nor we had any hand in making. Like our two fellows, we also find what we are looking for in the last place we look."},{"Title":"Midnight Cowboy","review":"THIS IS ONE BOOK I WISHED I HAD MY MONEY BACK FOR. THERE WAS BASICALLY NO REAL STORY LINE. IT MUST HAVE BEEN A BORING MOVIE."},{"Title":"Midnight Cowboy","review":"When it comes to books and films, one good guideline to go by is that the source material is better than the adaptation. For movies based on books, the books are typically the better of the two (although counterexamples can be found, which is why it's a guideline, not a rule). Midnight Cowboy is an excellent movie, well-deserving of the Best Picture Oscar it received (particularly noteworthy since it was the only X-rated movie to do so). Could the book it was based on be even better?The story in the movie and the book are pretty much the same, though the sequence and the pacing are different in places. The book follows Joe Buck, a twentyish Texan who hasn't had much life experience; he's also not that bright, the result more of parental neglect than any innate quality. His general ignorance about life leads to great dissatisfaction. With no family and few friends, Joe decides to exploit the one thing he has going for him: his good looks. He sets off for New York, intent on becoming a male prostitute.This is 1960s New York, a time and place when the city had more than it's share of sleaze, particularly around 42nd Street (near Times Square). This is the place that Joe will call home. His natural naivete makes it hard to make a living. Eventually, an encounter with the low-level thief Ratso Rizzo will lead to major changes in his life.If you've seen the movie, the book is still worth reading. It offers more insights into his early life, a different take on his early girlfriend Crazy Annie, and encounters with certain characters not in the film. So is it better than the movie? It's hard to say, but it is a great book nonetheless."},{"Title":"Midnight Cowboy","review":"The book itself is 5 stars. but the migration to Kindle was sloppy. Every few pages there is a sentence that loses its meaning to garbled words. Sorry, but this one needs to be read in paperback."},{"Title":"Midnight Cowboy","review":"So much has been said in these reviews about this work in far more eloquent words than I have.I just encourage everyone to read this book, it is a great American novel. Joe will haunt you, I read this in early 70's and the intense gritty story has stayed with me. (and considering the amount of books I read a book that has stood out that long in my mind, had to be special.)I just reread it on my kindle.. now at a more mature place in life I found it to be even more moving, I cried for poor Joe.Do yourself a favor >>>>> read this book!"},{"Title":"Midnight Cowboy","review":"Like many people if not most, I saw the movie first. Twenty years later I decided to read the book. Moving story. I think it's a known fact that books are usually much better than their films, and this in no different. I loved the film of course, this just goes much deeper. There's no doubt I thought of Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight many times as I read, but it didn't keep my imagination from working. I liked the writing here quite a bit. I felt the cold streets of New York and smelled the smoke when Joe lit a Camel. If possible read this before seeing the movie. The soundtrack is good too."},{"Title":"Midnight Cowboy","review":"Much bigger and exciting than the film, it should be a compulsory read in high schools.

This funny, sad, and philosophical masterpiece will never tire me. It shows exceptionally clear, how our life rests on probabilities of occurring events in surrounding us chaos."},{"Title":"Midnight Cowboy","review":"Midnight Cowboy is a book that moves quickly and clearly defines the intent of the story. No weasel words here. This book describes a desperate and lost sole. The mood is set from the beginning. A pleasant surprise from the bargain shelf."},{"Title":"Midnight Cowboy","review":"I read this one for a few reasons. I had seen the movie. it was a \\"classic book\\", and the price was right at the time. Honestly I was glad when I finished. It was such a downer of a book. The main character had a horrible life and that was pretty much the summary of the book. I guess its proof that just because a book was a \\"classic\\" does not mean it always good. Read it, but don't expect to come way refreshed."},{"Title":"Midnight Cowboy","review":"This movie was popular at a time when my mother thought it was too trashy for nice people, so I was excited at the prospect of reading the book - for free even.I hated it. Joe Buck is an arrogant loser and so stupid it makes you squirm. I just couldnt wade through this. I know the book has been called a great novel, but it wasn't even close for me."},{"Title":"Midnight Cowboy","review":"The book was ok. The movie was much better. I kept trying to finish and it was hard to do."},{"Title":"Midnight Cowboy","review":"I couldn't put it down, simply breathtaking!"},{"Title":"Midnight Cowboy","review":"I WAS EXCITED TO READ THIS BOOK BUT, I FOUND MYSELF YAWNING.

If only Joe Buck had been born a hundred years ago he could have taken his beauty out west and lived among a gang of horse-rustlers and been considered a romantic. I never saw the movie and hopefully never will."},{"Title":"Midnight Cowboy","review":"It's hard to understand why this '60s gem has become a difficult find. The film, a watered-down version saved by a great Dustin Hoffman performance, has certainly not been forgotten. Yet few people seem to have sought out the original work.This is a shame because the novel is much more satisfying than the one-note film. The background of the guileless main character, Joe Buck (first cousin to &quot;Being There&quot;'s Chance) is brought out in a series of mysterious incidents that put his fateful trip to New York into perspective.The book also benefits from a narrative voice that ranges from flat objectivity to the wise and knowing tone of a fable teller. This voice also manages to capture the benign anonymity of big-city life. Against this backdrop, we see Joe Buck wander in search of a truth he can not name.His destiny arrives in the person of a street urchin/criminal, Enrico Salvatore (Ratso) Rizzo. Those who have not read the book but have seen the film will be surprised that Herlihy's character is a boy -- though of course street-hardened beyond his years. This detail hardly detracts from Hoffman's performance in the film. Yet in the book it lends a poignancy to the character and his tragedy that the movie didn't capture.Post-modernists may be impatient with the streaks of '60s idealism that run through the book. For me, the book strikes just the right tone for our age: violence is juxtaposed with life-affirming ideals in the novel's summation.A neglected minor classic; highly recommended."},{"Title":"Midnight Cowboy","review":"Our pop culture offers us numerous, superficial views of lives lived like sit-coms or melodramas, clothed in Gap attire, well-groomed and comfortably normal. Here is a compassionate story of friendship among two fringe dwellers, ugly on the surface, and whom few would deign to look at in passing on the street. Joe Buck is a young, dumb narcissist who believes he can take New York by storm as a stud sought after by rich, lonely high-society women. His backstory comprises the first third of the book, a prosaic telling of an unwanted, unexceptional child whose only caretaker is a preening, whorish beautician who may or not be his mother or grandmother. Loneliness, neglect and some brutal encounters leave Joe to fantasize about finding his place elsewhere. He comes to New York. Once there, his consciousness about the world and his place in it dawn on him with painful awareness; his prized leather jacket becomes stained, his boots begin to smell, he bathes in public toilets and catches glimpses of himself in store windows which shock and depress him. Just as his very survival becomes in doubt he meets a city-bred troll aptly nicknamed, Ratso. Through all Joe's encounters with duplicitous street preachers, suburban molesters and, comically, neurotic New York women, his only bond and loyalty come incongruously to be shared with Ratso, left homeless by the tragedies of his own childhood. The redemption which comes at the end for both of them, is dark, bitter and grim, and yet it comes as a result of the moral choices which these two outcasts make in a world that is otherwise brutally immoral."},{"Title":"Midnight Cowboy","review":"I have just re-read Midnight Cowboy after reading it for the first time back in 1969, when the movie came out. I was startled once again by the gritty, desperate telling of Joe Buck's story. Joe is a complete loser, incredibly stupid, and seems to have no dignity. If anything, he becomes even more of an invisible non-person once he hits 42nd St. Things change when he pairs up with Ratso, a crippled swindler who is, perhaps, even more of a loser than Joe is. Together they form a team and a partnership, and for the first time, Joe is happy. Through their unlikely friendship, Joe finally has a center, and gains some limited insight into his true nature. The ending, though sad, somehow left me with a weird hope that Joe manages to make a life for himself after Ratso. I find myself wondering what happened to Joe- did he marry? have children? I look at Jon Voight 30 years after the landmark film, and imagine that he is still Joe Buck- weathered, aged, wiser, and maybe even content."},{"Title":"Midnight Cowboy","review":"I have watched the movie many times and recently, based on the reviews here, decided to read the book. While I am not a big reader of fiction, I could not put it down!!! Herlihy is one of those rare authors that can articulate the human condition in a way that resonates with everyone. I found myself reading certain paragraphs over and over because they were so beautiful. Joe is a symbol of loneliness and alienation. Emotionally stunted by a neglectful past, he becomes a full human being through a series of events that enable him to become aware of how broken he really is and what he really needs.If you loved the movie, I highly recommend reading the book -- you will never see Joe Buck or Ratso Rizzo the same way again."},{"Title":"Midnight Cowboy","review":"The movie was great, but the book WAS better. Joe Buck leaves his native New Mexico to &quot;lasso Manhattan&quot; Along the way he suffers the problems and indignations that many who come to the big city with a few dollars and no viable plan do. Buck meets up with local swindler Rico &quot;Ratso&quot; Rizzo and the two plan their adventures together. This book takes us back to a gritty, tough New York City. It creates a &quot;Noir&quot; mood that no other urban novel can. And this book was printed back in the mid sixties. I highly recommend this book"},{"Title":"Midnight Cowboy","review":"If you think that seeing the classic film is enough, please think again. The novel reveals dimensions of \\"cowboy\\" Joe Buck's personality and experience of the world that would be difficult to fully express on film. Read part one of the novel, pause reading, then watch or re-watch the film and you'll experience Joe in a whole new way. Continue reading afterward and you'll experience Joe and Ratso's friendship more profoundly.Midnight Cowboy is one of those rare and wonderful instances in which novel and film are on artistic par."},{"Title":"Midnight Cowboy","review":"I'll admit I was a bit skeptical when I picked up James Leo Herlihy's \\"Midnight Cowboy.\\" All I knew about it was that it was about a male prostitute and it was made into an X-rated movie (a publicity stunt, really; the movie was initially offered the R rating, and later re-released under the R rating). The back cover copy didn't impress me much: \\"Here comes Joe Buck, six-foot-one of eager erotic muscle and rarin' for action . . . Midnight cowboy, midnight son of three blonde tarts, white midnight stud. Midnight salesman, selling wares to whores, love to the unlovable, sex to the sexless, eternal youth to the old.\\" I expected a guilty pleasure at best, the sort of thing one simply can't put down as long as it lasts, but which leaves one afterward feeling as if one had been wallowing in a mud pit.Instead, I found myself wallowing in Herlihy's literary and psychological genius.Joe Buck is twenty-seven years old when he leaves Houston for New York. His life so far has been nothing special - one abandonment and betrayal after another. Joe has never really felt a sense of connection to anyone, except one of his grandmother's ex-boyfriends, a rancher named Woodsy Niles who imparted to him a fascination with all things Western. The one thing he's got going for him is his body: he's tall, handsome, and great in the sack. In New York, he's been told, most of the men are homosexual, and the women are terribly lonely. They'd pay good money to spend just one night with a real man . . . a man like Joe. Dressed in a swanky cowboy outfit that took him several months to buy on the meager salary from his dishwashing job, Joe gets on the bus, visions of his glamorous future dancing in his head.We've all heard the stories of the naive young thing trying to make it big in the big city, turning to prostitution just to survive. Joe Buck comes to New York aspiring to a life of prostitution - and yet, like so many other naive young things, Joe is destined to see his dreams smacked down by harsh realities. His first \\"client\\" manipulates him into giving HER money. A new acquaintance whom Joe pays to introduce him to an influential pimp delivers him instead to a holy-rolling street preacher and takes off with the cash. Even when Joe reluctantly gives up on his imagined rich-lady clientele and starts trying to catch the shameful glances of cruising males, he can't bring in enough money to keep a roof over his head.James Leo Herlihy is one of those writers with the rare gift of writing honestly about squalid, sordid things and bringing forth something of wisdom and great beauty. His fluent, lyrical prose does nothing to gloss over reality; instead, it scoops up great big handfuls of reality as only the most solid writing can, and flings them right into the back of your skull. You'll love Joe Buck, and you'll hate him, and you'll cheer him on, and you'll want to slap the stupid out of him, but most of all, for 200 pages, you will become him. You'll feel the fire, the disappointment, the hunger, and - most of all - the alienation. For alienation, loneliness, is Herlihy's great theme here. Everyone in this novel is lonely, an island in a sea of islands, drawn toward each other in desperate need yet never able to touch. There's a good deal of sex in this novel, but it's all selfish, grasping, impersonal; it fails every time to fill the emptiness and instead becomes a weapon, an expenditure of frustration, an amplitude of alienation in a sham of intimacy. Having never quite felt at home among human beings, I've been writing about loneliness, and seeing myself in lonely characters, as far back as I can remember, but I've never read anything like this: \\"He didn't know what it was based on, but there seemed to be something about him that no one wanted to be kin to. This feeling, always just below the surface, was one of many he did not know how to consider in his mind: the feeling of being a person with no real place in this world, an alien even under the red-white-and-blue of his birth, one who did not belong even in his own neighborhood. He had gone about always, even in these most familiar places of his life, with a slight frown of uneasiness, his head cocked for some clue to the true meaning of the language he heard spoken but which was clearly not his own, walking softly as if unsure of the very ground of this peculiar planet.\\" Indeed, Herlihy has an uncanny ability to articulate the sort of things we don't quite know how to consider in our minds. In Joe Buck, he has come as close to fashioning a living, breathing human being out of paper and ink as any writer ever has.\\"Midnight Cowboy\\" is a short, yet surprisingly hard-hitting novel that isn't for the squeamish or the overly sensitive. It is grueling, it is painful, it is deceptively complex, it is challenging, and it is breathtakingly beautiful. They say it's true that you never really know a man until you've walked a mile in his shoes; well, Herlihy gives us the chance to travel all the way across the country in Joe Buck's cowboy boots - and sure enough, we come away richer for the journey."},{"Title":"Midnight Cowboy","review":"I knew of this story and had heard references to it; but I had never seen the movie or read the book.

The movie, which I also loved, is faithful to the novel but not slavishly so, leaving enough room to carve out its own artistic vision and individuality. I found that the book did explain and clarify a few things which were left to the imagination in the film (especially about Joe Buck's backstory), and I liked that too. Really, a wonderful work of art and truly a great read. The formatting of the ebook is less than perfect, but the read is worth every one of those five stars.

Few others would have been as well-equipped to offer personal observations on well-known authors of this period.. . . . some have suggested that his wife, an outstanding literary person in her own right, may have been the source of more of his insights into the authors' thought than he acknowledges . . .(I have included below some excepts on the author, from Wikipedia, for the edification of browsers):Fields was the publisher of the foremost contemporary American writers, with whom he was on terms of close personal friendship, and he was the American publisher of some of the best-known British writers of his time, some of whom he also knew intimately. The first collected edition of De Quincey's works (20 vols., 1850-1855) was published by his firm. As a publisher he was characterized by a somewhat rare combination of keen business acumen and sound, discriminating literary taste, and as a man he was known for his geniality and charm of manner.In 1862-1870, as the successor of James Russell Lowell, he edited the Atlantic Monthly. In 1871 Fields retired from business and from his editorial duties, and devoted himself to lecturing and writing. He also edited, with Edwin P. Whipple, A Family Library of British Poetry (1878). His chief works were the collection of sketches and essays entitled Underbrush (1877) and the chapters of reminiscence composing Yesterdays with Authors (1871) in which he recorded his personal friendship with Wordsworth, Thackeray, Dickens, Hawthorne and others.

But as snazzy as the photos(or the real thing)are, they all have one failing- you are looking at the outside of the airplane. If you're a pilot, you're not going to be outside of the Bird while you're zooming fearlessly through the skies, but you ARE going to be looking at the instrument panel,depending it to help you figure out what's happening while you're zooming.....For the past six years, Dan Paterson, Donald Nijboer and the folks at Sellers Publishing have performed a signal service to the Aviation community by taking some truly gorgeous shots of cockpits and panels that most of us (non-Military) pilots will see only in our dreams,on the sheet above the monthly calendar. I keep my Cockpit Calender right next to my computer, so while the machine is booting up, shutting down, crashing or whatever,I have something nice to look at and study that my Wife doesn't complain about, and that also is suitable for showing to the Grandkids (something that can't be said for some nose-art calendars). And let's face it - how many times can you look at a B-25 at dusk,or a P-47 over clouds or whatever ? It gets boring after a while.From 2004 to 2008,this annual calendar featured cockpits from World War II. For 2009 the venue has been changed to display cockpits of the Cold War,a welcome change.The 12 X 12 format allows considerable detail of knobs, switches and instruments to be seen and appreciated.

The color is vivid, and true. The photos are sharp and focused. And in this depersonalized age of glass cockpits, it is nice to see the festival of steam gauges, manual knobs, and throttle setups. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Cockpit","review":"\\"Cockpit:...\\" is a collection of sharp, full-page color photos of WWII cockpits, accompanied by good quality period photos, a surprising number of which are also in color. A brief description of the aircraft is included along with a few paragraphs by a former pilot or other aircraft expert.Having a collection of cockpit photos from the major belligerants together like this illustrates the differences and surprising similarities in thinking about the pilot's environment.The two major gripes I have is that (1)there is only one view of each cockpit, which often leaves out considerable detail of the controls and indicators that are located on the left and right sides of the pilot and even behind him. (2) There is only one Russian type represented, just four Japanese aircraft, and no Italian machines.Recommended."},{"Title":"Cockpit","review":"Short summaries of each aircraft history - the brevity of which means there are inaccuracies through editing.The keys to instruments are generally accurate but not always. One or two artificial horizons are identified as direction indicators when the terms is used elsewhere in the book for the gyro compass.The pilot summaries of what it was like to fly the type and work in the cockpit are much more interesting.The pictures - the color pictures are beautifully shot!Buy it for the pictures."},{"Title":"Cockpit","review":"Great reference for aircraft interior from a pilots viewpoint. Excellent photography of a confined dark space."},{"Title":"Cockpit","review":"This collection of World War II Combat Aircraft cockpit photographs is one of the most interesting books I have seen in a long time. Along with the favourites (the P-51, Spitfire and Corsair), there are some of the more unusual examples such as the Me-410 or the Mitsubishi &quot;Betty&quot;. Along with a brief description of the aircraft, there is a pilot's report on the aircraft. The cockpit photographs were taken of museum and flying aircraft, so don't be surprised if you see a Bendix King GPS unit in some of the instrument panels.This book is just about perfect although I have two comments. The first is the inconsistency in the Pilot Reports. Some are from Combat Pilots, others are from people who fly the aircraft in airshows. I would have preferred combat summaries on each aircraft.The second is, and I think this would only be appreciated by someone that has sat in different cockpits, but the relative size of the cockpits has been lost. I am only commenting because I have had the priviledge to sit is some of these aircraft and the differences can be amazing. The relatively cavernous cockpit of the Corsair seems as like a hanger compared to the cramped one of the Spitfire's or the Mustang's. Now, after saying this, I have no idea how this could be conveyed in the photographs, but it was something that I noticed as I read through the book.These comments are just that and this book should be in the Library of anybody fascinated in World War II aircraft."},{"Title":"Cockpit","review":"Amazing! Long overdue. The colour photography in this book is truly remarkable. I haven't seen such large format colour shots of World War II cockpits before. The photos are so clear and crisp, it's almost like you're sitting there. I've been to a lot of aviation museums and I've always wondered what the cockpits looked like...now I know. This is a must have for pilots, aviation buffs, modellers and anyone interested in World War II aircraft.Damon, Toronto"},{"Title":"Cockpit","review":"Great book with large format color photos of WWII aircraft cockpits. All the classic Allied types, plus many Axis cockpits. Of special note are rare interior views of Japanese types. The only criticism I have is only one photo of each cockpit is included. Each largely shows only the instrument panel. Most are taken from a side angle so you do get some other features, but a wider angle or multiple views would provide additional details and a better perspective. In that respect, the scale modeler may have to go hunting elsewhere for those side panel details. The title should almost be &quot;Instrument Panel&quot; instead of &quot;Cockpit&quot;. Still, an enjoyable book and useful reference."},{"Title":"Cockpit","review":"I bought Gunner, an illustrated history of world war 2 aircraft turrets and gunpositions (by the same authors) first so I knew what to expect when I bought this book. Cockpit is probably the first book with amazing picture quality and in my eyes the standard for years to come. The pictures of the Hawker Typhoon and the Douglas A-20 Havoc are special to me because they are my favourite World War 2 airplanes. I've seen a few of these airplanes in real life but I didn't have the chance to see the cockpit up close. Because of the pictures of Dan Patterson it is now possible to walk in the footsteps of World War 2 pilots and try to imagine what it was like to fly these airplanes. I hope that the authors of these two magnificent books (Cockpit and Gunner) can find the inspiration to bring out more books like this, because these books are two of the finest in my collection.Patrick Koestal"},{"Title":"Cockpit","review":"I'm ... only giving it 4 stars. Nijboer and Patterson came up with a great idea, but missed a little in the execution. As a modeler, I'd like to see more details of the entire cockpit, not just the instrument panels. Also, I realize Mr Patterson is an accomplished professional photographer, but I was a little disappointed with the nature of many of the shots. I think he was trying for dramatic lighting effects, but ended up with many parts of the cockpit in dark shadow or nearly washed out by flash. ..."},{"Title":"Cockpit","review":"It's difficult to rate this because it depends upon what you expected this book to be. I had hoped that it would essentially be a reference for each aircraft showing all aspects of the cockpit with descriptions of the instruments and controls. This it is NOT. The photography is very nice but is strictly evocative and not really illustrative. It shows the instrument panels but in a way that hides essential details that I desire to see. Oh well, perhaps next time :-)"},{"Title":"Cockpit","review":"This book is based on WWII cockpits of the planes used. It focuses more on the pictures than the written content. All of the usual planes are here: Mustang, Spitfire, Me-262 and quite a few others. Instead of just showing you the exterior, like other books do, it shows you the pilot's view from inside the plane. Another feature of this book is the commentaries written by pilots who actually flew the planes. An excellent book."},{"Title":"Cockpit","review":"Other folks have weighed in on the content of the book, so I have no need to do that. My comment will center on the aspect of the photography that spoiled the book for me. The crew obviously had applied little colored circular stickers to the various instruments so they could be coded for the captions. That was all fine and well, but 75% of the photographs were taken with the stickers still in place. It was sloppy work. Carping, perhaps, but I expected better. The same comments apply to the volume dealing with Cold War aircraft."},{"Title":"Cockpit","review":"I felt this to be a good reference book for me as I build models of WW II aircraft. I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"Cockpit","review":"This book provides readers with a pilots view of the aircraft. The pictures and descriptions are phenomenal! Well Done!"},{"Title":"Virginia Woolf","review":"I've become quite enchanted with the Overlook Illustrated Lives series. None of these books are going to go down as great classics, nor will any be regarded as among the essential biographies of their subjects. Nonetheless, every book in the series that I have read is critically solid, lavishly illustated and quite handsome, and provides a great introduction or review (depending on the use to which one is putting the volume) of the writer under consideration.Virginia Woolf is an ideal subject for an illustrated biography. The background for her writing is a rich and varied one, and her acquaintances included a host of important writers and artists and intellectuals in their own right. The fact is that this book is less a treatment of Woold considered solely in her own right, as Virginia Woolf in her overall context, especially in light of Bloomsbury. As a result the focus of the book is less on her writing, and a bit more on her friendships with Roger Fry. The book also focuses a bit more on her realtionship with her sister Vanessa (a relationship presented as more mutually fulfilling than most other biographers do). The book therefore can function as a nice introduction both to Virginia Woolf as well as to Bloomsbury as a whole. There are helpful photos of all the major and many of the minor figures attached to the group.The weakness of the book is that it really doesn't take one very deeply into Woolf's writings. One gets more of a sense of Woolf's world than of her art. This is a problem the book shares with Mary Ann Caws's book in the same series on Marcel Proust. I like the way that Caws shows Woolf's great passion for life. She also has, however, a tendency to varnish over the negatives. Woolf famously suffered from serious mental illness, and Caws's account leaves her appearing less afflicted than does other accounts. It is a question of balance, and I must admit that the problem here is solely one of emphasis. She does a good job of detailing her relation with Leonard, who seems to have been as close to a perfect husband to Virginia as anyone could have been: the fact is that it was almost impossible for anyone to be Virginia's husband, and that Leonard managed to help her so much is nothing short of a miracle. He clearly provided her with an emotional stability she might not otherwise have enjoyed.These caveats aside, I do strongly recommend this book. It is very short and heavily illustrated so that it is possible in only two or three hours to enjoy a very plesant time reading both Virginia Woolf and her world. But for those seeking a very short biography, I can even more strongly recommend the volume in the Penguin Brief Lives series by Nicol Nicolson, the son of Woolf's close friend and sometime lover (and the model for the title character in ORLANDO) Vita Sackville-West and Harold Nicolson, and perhaps destined to be the last biographer of Woolf to have actually known her. Though it isn't delightfully illustrated like this volume, it provides a much richer and insightful portrait of this fascinating writer."},{"Title":"Piggins and the Royal Wedding","review":"Finally - Jane Yolen and Jane Dyer have done that truly rare feat. They've created a unique type story (series) that Adults and young children can enjoy together actively. This would be a delightful tale with deliciously detailed illustrations on its own. What makes this so wonderful is the placing of \\"illustrated clues\\" to the solution of the mystery (a theft at the title Wedding) throughout the illustrations. The pictures themselves are intricate and beautiful, it is a pleasure to review them over and over to spot the little details missed on the first read through. The girls liked this best at ages 5-8 but everyone, from baby Ben at age 3 to Nana at age 67 loved to participate. For a treat to pamper yourself (hopefully with a child at your side to help you spot any significant details you might miss), or as a gift to any family with young children who treasure a good read- I would recommend this book most highly. If you haven't read the original \\"Piggins\\"- be sure to put it in your shopping cart too!"},{"Title":"Piggins and the Royal Wedding","review":"The pictures and words of this book mold together flawlessly, and the illustrations can provide vital information. The world setting is bright and intriguing, and the characters are lovable and distinctive. The plot is not too long, and everything ties together beautifully. It left me smiling the first time that I read it, and it's even better the second time."},{"Title":"Into the Woods (De Beers Family 4)","review":"The V.C Andrews family really needs to get a new ghost writer.The older books were much more entertaining with original plotlines and attention to detail.These last few books are so poorly written its hard to finish."},{"Title":"Into the Woods (De Beers Family 4)","review":"I thought it would be intersting to read Grace's story, but you almost already know everything about her through the other books. I prefer all the books in the series to stay focused on one main character like Willow and not about her mother or her daughter. I read a lot but this book bored me! I just finished reading, EVEN ANGELS FALL by Sherry A. Mauro whose writing style is a lot like the old Virginia Andrews. I highly recommend this author to any VCA fans. You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Into the Woods (De Beers Family 4)","review":"First off I didn't have to finish the book because you know what happens if you read the rest of the Willow series (which was ok until the book about her daughter). This book goes more into Grace's story and what exactly happened to her. There were some interesting parts but then it got silly and you knew that her mother would change after the father's death and she would be misunderstood in Palm Beach.Unless you read all of her novels, this might not be the book for you. I agree with the other readers that either the ghost writer should stop using her name or go back the the stories taht are like Flowers in the attic and the Cutler series."},{"Title":"Into the Woods (De Beers Family 4)","review":"Having read the first three books of the DeBeers family, I found the fourth book to be perplexing. Why did they take us back in time to the life of Grace and her mother. Why not have made this the first book in the series?If one has read the other three books we are more than saturated with the story of Grace, her mother and Linden.What was this book's purpose. Seems it was made for the sake of another book in the series."},{"Title":"Into the Woods (De Beers Family 4)","review":"I have read every V.C. Andrews book and was so bothered by the incorrect timeline that I have not been able to finish the book. The time that Grace was a teenager would had to have been around 1965 at best. There weren't any DVD's CD's, legal abortions or date rape, as a matter of fact lasers were just becoming a reality. So when I began reading Into the Woods I was terribly disapointed. I really was looking forward to reading about Grace, but there were so many inconsistancies that the book now just sits in my bookself. I would only recommend this book if you've not read the series."},{"Title":"Into the Woods (De Beers Family 4)","review":"I actually enjoyed this book, it could stand on its own, and not belong to a series. But as it is part of a series it is all wrong. The time scale in it is totally incorrect, unless Hannah from the previous book was living many years in the future.I started to read Virginia Andrews (as she is adverised in the UK) back in 1980, when Flowers in the Attic was first published over here. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and have 40 books on my shelf at the moment.Over the past few series, the books have been much of a sameness, probably from Ruby onwards.I agree with other contributers that the current &quot;Ghost writer&quot; should be changed. Are the stories that are being written, still from ideas that Virginia left? Surely not. It is hard to believe.Also, the age group reading the books seems to be coming down, over here, I have bought book from a book club, where the books are advertised in the adult section and not in teenage, I notice from other reviews that many teenagers are now reading the books, I don't think that I would have read the books actually by Virginia Andrews when I was a teenager (quite a number of years ago, mind you) but the more recent books tend to lean towards a youger audience."},{"Title":"Into the Woods (De Beers Family 4)","review":"This book, Into the Woods is part of the VC Andrews' \\"Debeers\\" series and is very good. Following through the series, you begin to hate that the series is ending. You know the characters and what to know what happens after the book end. A great read!"},{"Title":"Into the Woods (De Beers Family 4)","review":"The Willow series started out rather weak, and this book only further emphasizes that weakness. After having already read the first three books, I didn't have really high expectations for this one, so I wasn't too disappointed.One thing that has ever bothered me since I read this was the timeframe it was set in. In Willow, she mentions the year 1999 as having already happened, so this book SHOULD happen before 1980. Yet references to modern culture are put in - Shania Twain and e-mail, to name two examples.In previous novels, we learned of Grace's rape from Kirby Scott resulting in the birth of Linden. Another thing that has always bothered me is that Kirby Scott never gets punished for what he did, even in Willow's time, he is still mooching off rich old ladies. He mooched off Jackie and to add insult to her, he hurt her daughter! Grace's father and (first) stepfather were both such nice guys, it's a shame Jackie fell for such a loser. Grace is a weak character, and I suppose that's why she eventually fell for Claude, since he himself was a weak character too, he didn't even make any attempt to find her after his wife died!The story would have been executed better with a more skillful pen and attention to detail. Unfortunately, neither are apparent, resulting in an entirely lackluster volume in an already disappointing family saga."},{"Title":"Into the Woods (De Beers Family 4)","review":"Okay, my feeling is pretty much that of many others who have posted here. The timeline is very off. The way I figured it, if Jackie Lee is Hannah's great-grandmother, then this book should have taken place around the 50's or so. The plot itself is good, but I'm not understanding how the timeline could be so off. Was it written in this time period so that younger readers could relate? I'm wondering if the ghost writer really knows what their doing. It doesn't seem like it. Another issue I have with this book is that Grace is 15 years old and at times speaks as if she's 50 years old. If the book is to take place in the present time, then a 15 year old should probably be speaking more like a 15 year old would speak. 15 year olds don't say \\"You frightened me.\\" 15 year olds say \\"You scared me\\". The dialogue is too formal for characters that are so young. Grace seems alittle too old for her age, yet she's hanging out with kids who smoke pot. That's just my take. But overall, if you've read the other books in the series, then this one is worth reading. I've loved the DeBeers series since I read Willow. Actually I wish more would be written. Certainly, more can be done with Hannah's character."},{"Title":"Into the Woods (De Beers Family 4)","review":"I can relate to how Grace is feeling in this book. I feel tempted to hide whenever the pressure is too much. I didn't blame Grace for mistrusting her fellow students in the private high school Winston enrolled her in. Jackie was too wrapped up in the wealth she married into. I believe Jackie needed a very rude awakening when Grace told her that Kirby assaulted her (G). I believe Grace found strength in loving her son Linden. Unfortunately Jackie wouldn't let her (G) be the mom she (G) wanted to be to Linden. I am sure that made her feel more upset."},{"Title":"Into the Woods (De Beers Family 4)","review":"&quot;Into the Woods&quot; was, as 2 readers pointed out...totally in the WRONG timeframe...i.e. the CDS, rufies, cars, computers, etc. but I found the story to be FAR more entertaining than Willow's story!!!!!

It's the best!"},{"Title":"Into the Woods (De Beers Family 4)","review":"I have been reading V.C. Andrews books for years. This was the kind of book that I could not wait to get back to.

Good reads.Swept into the world of growing up struggles, a Daddy's girl, with a Mommy who wants to be a sister or best friend instead of a mother wrestles with confusion and constant change in a world where growing up comes too fast for some and too slowly for others.Such is the stuff V.C. Andrews books are famous for. Flowery words with petal sweet imagery that help the reader to fall head first into the storyline and swallow all of it until the last page quenches the ravenous thirst...(Well, at least until the next book comes out).It may have been years since I read a V.C. Andrews' book, but years faded away while I read, &quot;Into the Woods&quot; and how cool is it for a soon to be fifty year old to be lost in a good book??? Two thumbs way up for V.C.!"},{"Title":"Into the Woods (De Beers Family 4)","review":"I understand what all the others are saying about the book. How the time warp thing messes up the reader.

It's story plot is a classic V.C. Andrews story minus the romance, and the main character goes crazy which was a little different. Like I said this won't stop me from reading more books.

Here's a little lession for everybody. Before you sit down to write a novel that takes place years and years ago, you do research. If you don't do research, your characters might be listening to Backstreet Boys cds in Ancient Rome or watching Survivor while traveling on the Oregon Trail. When that happens, it is called an ANACHRONISM. Thus, having Grace listen to Shania Twain in the '70's is an ANACHRONISM! Therefore, that makes for a sloppy book that shows the author does not care one whit about it.Why does the Andrews family keep this guy on? He stinks. Anachronisms galore, shoddy writing, characters nobody cares about or likes, and cliched plots - in short, a book that never even should have made it past the slushpile.

Into The Woods greatly redeems the V. C. Andrews ghostwriter! This is by far the most comprehensive, well-thought-out, and well written book he has done to date - with the exception of OLIVIA which will always remain one my favorites of the ghostwriter.I won't recap the book's plot but I instead want to point out Into The Wood's strengths! Most notably, in my opinion, this book plays out over seven or eight years -- not over a very short period of time -- and this is very similar to the original V. C. Andrews books. Also, this is an adult novel written for adult audiences and not just for teenagers - it is mature and is not about a young girl and her young girl school problems. Granted, while there is some of that, most of this story builds towards the climax and the committing of Grace Montgomery to the mental institution that will set everything in motion for the first book in the De Beers series - Willow.I cannot heartily recommend this book enough for anyone looking to a return of the original V. C. Andrews style. Suspense, intrigue, a young girl, an older man and a betrayal, a mother who becomes increasingly cold and wicked, and a shocking ending including a false pregnancy and a mental institution comittment!Let's hope this marks a return to the more in-depth books we have known to come and to love from V. C. Andrews and from the ghostwriter. Let's hope it is a preview of the next series or two to come. Is life grand or what? HEARTILY RECOMMENDED IF YOU LOVE V. C.

Why do they have the internet in her story, and rufies and a Shania Twain song playing on the radio? Is Shania Twain supposed to have existed and been popular through all three generations? She must be about sixty now and singing around dentures and dying her hair. OR, Hannah lives years and years in the future where everything is just the same as now. I find this almost insulting to the intelligence of the readers. Former VC Andrews books with the exception of Olivia, which carried writing and attention to detail which was just as bad, attempted to portray the history of a place through various generations of it's inhabitants. The place was a large part of the aptmosphere, whether it is an old plantation \\"The Meadows\\" or the wartime bayou add a large part to the story for me, and both the Landry series and the Cutler series was careful to portray a specific time frame. The real VC Andrews of course, was never as careless.

I thought that surely there must be a mistake, and if I read further that all would be explained. As I can see, there is no mistake.

As mentioned in the introduction, the book is extracted from a series of lectures the author gave; lets say, they are great lectures but without the session of Q&amp;A (questions and answers). Therefore, there is little communication with the reader's questions, the reader is required to investigate more in his/her own, e.g. no end of chapter problems or things like those.In short, I will strongly recommended it along with the traditional material of a General Equilibrium course (e.g. Mas-Colell et.al.). But do not expect a treatise, it is more a general overview."},{"Title":"Microeconomics of Market Failures","review":"A nice book.

Discerning and intelligent listeners will quickly discover that Jeff Paul is a massive self-hype guy, self-promoting his \\"marketing genius\\" by constantly referring to his own supposed successes -- yet, you never hear details on how he actually did something ... he has an amazing knack for beating around the bush!The worst aspect of his material is that he offers little substance or specific examples. He talks in vague terms, alludes to \\"big deals\\" he's made, but NEVER gets into the nitty-gritty, which is what people really want.In my opinion, I would not buy anything he offers until he starts producing concrete, organized, specific information on the topics he blathers on and on about.

This created much havoc -- triggering widespread volanic eruptions, rapid melting of the ice resulting in worldwide flooding, erosion of the ozone layer, destruction of much animal life, and perhaps adding a few degrees of tilt to the axis of our planet.The &quot;First Civilization,&quot; as author John Cogan calls it, was decimated but not destroyed when the 6 1/2-mile-wide asteroid rocked Earth. Cogan weaves into his theory plausible answers to several of unsolved mysteries including the legend of Atlantis, the ability of the Egyptians to build the pyramids, and the source of the Mayan calendar, to name a few.A lawyer living in the Seattle area, Cogan is a self-taught anthropologist who spent thirty years researching for &quot;The New Order of Man's History.&quot; It shows. The author had to become conversant in an assortment of scientific disciplines to pull this off."},{"Title":"The New Order of Man's History","review":"This book should be required reading for every high school student in America if not the world. John Cogan has presented a concise, chronological history of man drawn from conclusions using the facts available today from scientific data collection, not by adhering to standard dogma laiden with baseless assumptions carried down in today's &quot;academia&quot;.This text requires the reader to concentrate and follow the factual trail of the history of the earth and man's population of the world. It gives reasonable, believable accounts to his emergence, civilizations, migrations, decimation, and repopulations.John Cogan challenges many beliefs we cling to and hold as truth. Through his no nonsense approach to the current factual information regarding our history we can shed these burdens and move forward in our understanding of man's history.My training has taken me through the quagmire of current main stream paleohistory and archeology. John Cogan has shown me more in less than 200 pages. My hat is off to him and I hope this book opens the eyes and minds of many to follow. The New Order is the Right Order.

An outstanding and interesting book."},{"Title":"The New Order of Man's History","review":"The writer is on the right track but many of his 'facts' are wrong. Yes, an asteroid did hit but not when he says. Correlation with archaeological evidence, none of which he does, demonstrates a date about 700 years earlier than that which he identifies. Again, archaeological evidence shows that North Africa remained lush and green until about 5-6,000 years ago. Usually cites his conclusions without backing them up with any evidence whatsoever. Needs to rely on ice core samples from Greenland and Antarctica to support his claims about the Ice Age, many of whose particulars are in error. Obvious lack of knowledge about the development of cultures toward civilization 7-3,000 BC.His writing style is atrocious. Most chapters are only a few pages, and often repeat the same material from previous ones over and over and over. The book is 212 pp. Had he fleshed out his chapters with hard, supporting data and eliminated the redundancy, it would have been a much better effort.He's openly hostile toward religion. Odd, considering the emphasis placed on religion by Cro Magnon humans, whom he cites as being more intelligent than modern humans owing to their larger brain capacity.

Moreover, I could only find two recipes in which the contributor said why they were considered special.

After having read/studied nearly the complete book I find that in its 12th edition this book:1. Recycles itself with nearly no update of the material and text. E.g. \\"Recent studies found....\\" and the reference is from 1995. MANY times the text states that something is brand new or latest or recent etc. and the reference is like the Fortune Magazine from 1990. This is unprofessional and deceptive and serves both, students and teaches, badly. The authors are just harvesting $$$ on merits that are pasted.2. If you use Wikipedia once in a while you know that they label articles sometimes as containing \\"weasel words: are words or phrases that seemingly support statements without attributing opinions to verifiable sources, lending them the force of authority without letting the reader decide whether the source of the opinion is reliable.\\" Example: \\"Scientists say...\\". \\"Managers often do ...\\" \\"It is common that...\\"This textbook is peppered with such expressions.3. The presentation and the writing style is utterly unimaginative and inadequate for this day and age. Those authors haven't thought anyone anything real in a long time. A book that expensive should be held accountable to current standards.4. The author are incapable of synthesising the material in something the student can take with him/her. In fact they regularly complain themselves that all the theories and models they just wrote about are actually highly invalidated and critizised by other research that itself has trouble coming up with anything tangible. The result is a dead see of the unusable. If at least the presentation had something valuable but it is cumbersome and boring.5. Some of the case studies are likely written by the Brother Grimm or Scott Adams. Often they relate insufficiently to the text or are so unreal or crippled that it is agonizing to have to even read them, let alone handle them in homework.My recommendation is that if you have a choice, you better look around for something that will actually add value to your studies. I had no choice asit is the textbook for this course, but I will urge my uni to move forward.

It is written for clinicians, and so is free of some of the fluffier and more new age leanings of some other books on the subject. The potential buyer should be aware, however, that this is not a book with script ideas or lots of practical advice on how to phrase hypnotherapy sessions with pain patients. Rather, it provides an extensive overview of issues related to dealing with different kinds of pain patients and suggests how hypnosis is useful in these situations.One aspect of the book that bothered me was that it seems to suggest that pain without an obvious cause--which is often the case with chronic pain--is more likely to be psychosomatic in nature. In one passage it advises the hypnotherapist \\"to expect significant psychological factors in the maintenance of the patient's pain\\" if that patient \\"uses unusually colorful terms\\" to describe the pain, such as saying that it feels like \\"fish hooks\\" or \\"a red hot poker.\\" One should be careful in making such sweeping generalizations. Intense burning sensations that patients might indeed describe as hot pokers that comes without an obvious physical cause, or that lasts long after an initial injury, is a classic description of Reflexive Sympathetic Dystrophy pain, or what is more commonly now called Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. There are also many instances of inflammatory or nerve pain that is not easily diagnosed and that can feel like torture for the sufferer. It is extremely difficult, also, to describe different pain sensations. \\"Colorful language\\" or even odd descriptions that might not make a lot of anatomical sense is not necessarily a clue that the pain is largely psychological in nature. More recent developments in the study of chronic pain confirm this."},{"Title":"Hypnosis and Suggestion in the Treatment of Pain: A Clinical Guide (Norton Professional Books)","review":"As a lay person, I found that this book is not only a tool for clinicians, but also provides a valuable explanation of hypnosis for anyone with an interest in psychology. In his introductory chapter, Joseph Barber succinctly defines hypnosis and explains the phenomenon clearly and accurately. He makes the necessary distinctions to dispel myths about hypnosis and separate the hypnotic state from mere suggestion. Barber demonstrates a combination of sensitivity to human needs along with rigorous scientific grounding. It's fascinating reading, and one of the very few books that a novice would need to understand the true nature of hypnosis."},{"Title":"Hypnosis and Suggestion in the Treatment of Pain: A Clinical Guide (Norton Professional Books)","review":"This book goes beyond simple suggestion for pain.

Bass' 'Reinventing the Future' is no exception. There are 11 conversations with leading scientists, spread over 240 pages. That means that every scientist gets sufficient space to explore his or her ideas in depth. The selection of people is imaginative: there is a mix of discipline, gender, culture and character which is well judged. The conversations are invariably well crafted; it's obvious that Bass has done his homework very well. A number of chapters are so insightful that I keep returning to this book again and again. James Black, a pharmacologist who discovered cimetidine and beta blockers, offers a view on pharmaceutical Discovery research which, at the time of the interview (1989), must have been simply visionary. I also derived much insight from Thomas Adeoye Lambo's fusion of Western and traditional ideas on mental illness when studying psychotics and schizophrenics in the villages of his native Nigeria. As an update on important scientific theories this book is slightly dated by now. But as an account of how great scientific personalities work it remains as fresh and relevant as when it was written."},{"Title":"Reinventing the Future: Conversations With the World's Leading Scientists","review":"Exploring the state of the world, Bass spent hours, sometimes days, with 11 of today's ground-breaking scientists. He distilled the results, keeping the interview format and dispensing.He discusses sex and female strategies with behavioral biologist Sarah Hrdy, AIDS research with Luc Montagnier, the French scientist who first isolated the virus, space-age archaelogy with geologist and Apollo scientist Farouk El-Baz, artificial intelligence and selfish genes with zoologist Richard Dawkins. Many of the pieces naturally concern AIDS, medical breakthroughs and gene research.Perhaps the book's most thoughtful piece is \\"Plague,\\" the interview with Dr. Jonathan Mann, founder of the Global Program on AIDS. Mann's persepective on social and human rights implications is thorough, calm and flawlessly reasoned. His measured tone seems to rob the issue of its polarizing energy, fitting AIDS into the context of modern life and technological advances.Bass' interviews are well organized, integrating personal background with scientific method and discovery and speculations on future advances."},{"Title":"Leap of Strength: A Personal Tour Through the Months Before and Years After You Start Your Own Business","review":"Walt Sutton brings a real world perspective and down to earth practical advise to the reader.

They result in the same numbers: 95% of startups fail within the first year, 97% within five.Unlike other books on entrepreneurship, \\"Leap of Strength\\" takes you into the minefield and shows you how to avoid the most common traps. Walt Sutton provides practical advice on how to successfully identify and navigate many common risks.As a founder, many of the people around you may be cheerleaders who are there only in case you win. Their advice will almost always be biased towards their own interests. If you fail (and odds are you will), these same people won't be around. To mitigate risks, founders need to be aware of potential pitfalls. They need to be knowledgable enough about the aspects of their key decisions to be confident in them. Founders will likely have to defend their decisions to fellow founders, employees, advisors, board members, investors, family and friends. Good decision-making requires preeminent awareness of all factors - usually without enough time for study and analysis.Walt provides many specific techniques.

Besides the production problems noted by other reviewers (no colors, repetition, and expense), this book has conceptual and organizational problems.(1) Shaffer does not summarize human longitudinal studies, which illustrate some of the most difficult problems and long-standing findings in child development.(2) It would have been easy for him to summarize prevalence rates, age-of-onset, or effect sizes of various developmental sequences, problems, or interventions in social and cognitive development.(3) Shaffer overemphasizes the results of multicultural interventions (because they are trendy and \\"easy\\" to support?).(4) Only chapters 4 through 6 deal with development. The other chapters are about topical issues in development: need for achievement (but without countervailing emphasis from \\"newer\\" researchers); sex differences; aggression and antisocial conduct (what a great place to put studies of non-physical aggression like teasing and fashion-police in schools!); altruism and moral development; the family (but NOT from a developmental point of view [that is, the family develops and changes along with the child] or from an interactional point of view); and \\"extrafamilial influences\\" such as TV, computers, and peers.(5) Shaffer stumbles on his assessment of schools, which have both poor achievement records and are sites of covert and overt student aggression.Finally, (6) for Shaffer, personality and social development stop at the end of adolescence. There is very little on the concept of identity consolidation and life beyond 18 years old.The result is a book with a flawed design, and it is not really from a human development perspective, other than the three chapters I noted above. It is workman-like and well-referenced, and the writing is satisfactory (but quite wordy), so it does not earn more than 3 stars. Too bad! Human development is a fascinating, live, palpitating subject, and is well worth studying. I don't think this text will help college students appreciate the light and joy of children, adolescents, families, and the knowledge that has accumulated much over the past 100 years.Because of these problems, I found this book hard to read. A better textbook with a life-span and developmental tone is Grace Craig and Dan Baucum, Human Development, 9th Ed., Prentice-Hall, 2002. This book contains all that Shaffer's book has, is better organized, and well written."},{"Title":"Social and Personality Development","review":"While the text provides a lot of detailed information about research studies and theories, it is a bit tedious in rehashing the same information chapter after chapter. Basically, it tends to make the same points repeatedly throughout, and I found it somewhat boring to read. Also, the pages lack any hint of color, which only adds to the monotonous feeling."},{"Title":"Trails of the Lost Coast Map (Wilderness Press 15-Minute Map Series)","review":"A wonderful tool when hiking the gorgeous Lost Coast!"},{"Title":"Tulipa: A Photographer's Botanical","review":"In all of my years, I have never seen quite a unique and exquisite celebration of the maginificence of these natural wonders. Christopher Baker's eye portray's the simple elegance of these flowers with a passion that is fascinating. One can hardly appreciate the vast array of the tulips' varieties, surely never seen before. I congratulate Christopher on this masterful and clearly personal gift of his life's passion. The photography is gracefully complemented by reverant prose that both leaves much to the imagination, but skillfully engrosses the reader in these magical creations. I can only say this, while a rose may always be a rose, every tulip, since this wonderful publication, is truly it's own incarnation. Thank you, Mr. Baker."},{"Title":"Tulipa: A Photographer's Botanical","review":"In recent years, my approach to planting tulips and other small spring-flowering bulbs has been to dig down to the core ground underneath the raised bed I use for flowers, line the bed with composted cow manure laced with bone meal, and toss the bulbs in, letting them lie where they land. I usually buy an assortment of my favorite tulips including Negrita and Queen of the Night which I mix up, so come spring, I have a nice surprise when they emerge, but I cannot always tell which tulip is which.TULIPA by Baker and Lemmers will help me solve some of the mystery. With hundreds of tulip photographs I can use in the identity parade, plus some descriptive text, I should be able to sort out the riot of colors come spring. TULIPA is an exquisite art book, in which the authors have used the Netherlandish floral paintings of the Golden Age for inspiration for their photographs.Tulips are featured in all their splendor, many owing a single page, while others are arranged around a page as if in a loose bouquet. Some are open ala Georgia O'Keefe, others closed demurely. The text of the book is sparse, with short essays by Michael Pollen, editor and garden author; Christopher Baker, photographer; and William Lemmers , member of the Tulip Committee of the Royal Bulb Growers Association (KAVB) and the Royal Horticultural Society in London.Lacey frilly, and in some cases not unlike an ice cream sundae. What's not to like about tulips? Given it's price, this is not the book to buy if you only want a practical guide to growing tulips, but it will make a lovely addition to your art library."},{"Title":"Tulipa: A Photographer's Botanical","review":"This is not a practical &quot;how to&quot; book of gardening, but it is a simply gorgeous book to look through nonetheless. An excellant addition for an avid tulip enthusiast who likes to collect books on subject. Contains a comprehensive listing of tulips and has close-up pictures of many types not usually pictured in other tulip books. Gives historical information that is interesting but not really useful. Makes a great book for your coffee table and even my friends who don't garden always enjoy looking through this book. I rate it 5 stars because I think it is a beautiful book, but I do think it is over-priced and if you are looking for a book to give you practical tips on planting bulbs, this is not for you."},{"Title":"Baptist Briders Boloney","review":"This booklet is correct in standing against the silly doctrine known as the \\"Baptist bride\\" doctrine.

In Jesus NO! He believed he would have a son in his old age (as an example). Adam and Eve are not like us, anybody with common sense can see they are innocent and only need to worry in that dispensation to not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thats it!

As we have come to expect from previous volumes, the young men are comely, young and always photographed in flattering light. Some of them are in briefs while others are in their unadorned glory. Most of them are shot from the front; far too many of them from the rear. Many of them are smiling. But why wouldn't they? They are young, have perfect bodies and-- at these young ages-- believe they will never die.Mr. Carson opens this collection with a quotation from Shakespeare. Perhaps he should have quoted George Bernard Shaw who said that it is a shame that youth is wasted on young people.My first edition of FIRST EXPOSURE is now worth some bucks.

I got it in good time and in great condition. Very satisfied."},{"Title":"The Magician (Collected Works of W. Somerset Maugham)","review":"This is one of Maugham's least-read works, judging from its absence in most bookstores and libraries. Of Human Bondage, Cakes and Ale, The Moon and Sixpence are usually fairly easy to locate on most shelves. You must do a little digging to find this one, but it will reward your efforts.At the center of the book is Oliver Haddo, who, as you can tell from the other reviews here, is based entirely and without much thought of disguise upon Aleister Crowley, the London necromancer. The plot is indeed pure melodrama, the virginal fiance drawn irresistibly towards her doom by dark forces against which there appears to be no defense. Think of Bram Stoker, or Coppola if you haven't read the novel. Will our hero somehow find a way to overcome the great odds and emerge victorious? Will Haddo succeed in his plan of evil debauchery? Stay tuned for the heady conclusion.What saves The Magician from sinking into the morass of its conventional and even hackneyed plot is the quality of Maugham's writing. We are aware at all times that we are in the hands of an accomplished writer and artist, who can turn a tired theme into an event of wit and real pathos. At times the scenes are in fact quite chillingly rendered as well. There is real suspense here, as well as some startlingly weird and realistic depictions of the occult. The scene that comes most readily to mind is Haddo's creation of the homonculi, some home-grown little fiends he cooks up in a test-tube. Many of the scenes have a surreal edge to them, but are grounded in enough realistic detail to lend them plausibility at the same time.I would recommend this book to those who have read and enjoyed Maugham's other works, as well as to anyone who enjoys books about the occult or to fans of horror novels (of which there are legion). It's an easy and fun read and is frightening enough that it just might have you looking over your shoulder the next time you're dining in a London restaurant, double-checking to see if Haddo might not be sitting somewhere across the room. Then again, these days, a lot of women probably hope that he is."},{"Title":"The Magician (Collected Works of W. Somerset Maugham)","review":"This is possibly the strangest of all Maugham novels that I've read. It starts innocently enough with the type of sophisticated turn of the century Parisian characters that populate much of his fiction. The characters are lucidly established and we are slowly drawn into their relationships and longings in typical Maugham fashion. Then we are introduced to the strange eccentric character of Oliver Haddo and with each of his subsequent appearances the theme of lurking evil is masterfully developed. The plot then takes over in a way that I felt was unique for Maugham and this novel turns into a suspenseful page turner. It is in someways reminiscent of Dracula. The climax builds relentlessly and the last half of the book is virtually impossible to put down once it's begun. Wonderfully blends a horror tale with the cultural sophistication of all Maugham's writing."},{"Title":"The Magician (Collected Works of W. Somerset Maugham)","review":"Maugham's elegant prose, his mastery of dialog, and his uncanny ability to sketch living, breathing, three dimensional characters in a few sentences serve him well in this gripping tale of the life and crimes of the evil Oliver Haddo and the handful of unlucky nafs who fall under his spell in Paris at the turn of the last century.Unlike many of Maugham's other novels, the appeal of &quot;The Magician&quot; owes as much to the tight plotting as to the characterizations. In particular, the character of the deliciously wicked Oliver Haddo, based on the infamous Aleister Crowley, &quot;the wickedest man alive,&quot; jumps off the page. However, like Bram Stoker's &quot;Dracula&quot; (a book that in structure &quot;The Magician&quot; resembles more than a little) the plot can sag slightly when the villain is off-stage. Luckily, this is never for more than a handful of pages.Still surprisingly fresh and readable nearly a hundred years after its first publication, this book will appeal as much to the literate horror fan as to the typical &quot;Twentieth Century Classics&quot; reader."},{"Title":"The Magician (Collected Works of W. Somerset Maugham)","review":"Okay. First, if you want to read this because you have heard the magician is based on Aleister Crowley, it's worth reading--The magician Haddo comes across as a spoiled vengeful little boy who never grew up which seems pretty accurate based on Crowley's CONFESSIONS. If you don't know anything about Crowley, this is still a worthwhile read despite being occassionally dated and having some &quot;idiot moments&quot; (i.e., &quot;Why is the character doing that? He/She must be an idiot&quot;). The ending is particularly chilling and caught me by surprise."},{"Title":"The Magician (Collected Works of W. Somerset Maugham)","review":"This novel is based on a character whom Somerset Maugham met in Paris in 1897 called Aleistair Crowley. He was a liar, a boastful man and a voluminous writer of mediocre verse. He was also dabbing in Satanism, magic and occult. He inspired Somerset Maugham and served as a model for Oliver Haddo in &quot;The Magician&quot;.Arthur Burdon, surgeon of St Luke's in London, has just arrived in Paris to study the methods of the French operators. But he has also come there to see Margaret Dauncy with whom he is in love. It is Dr Porhoet, a lifetime friend of Arthur's, who introduces him to Oliver Haddo. This obese, fleshy-faced man with an imposing paunch claims to be a magician. At a dinner party, the guests can hardly believe the stories told by this charlatan. They wonder whether he is an impostor or a madman and how much he really believes what he says. Does he deceive himself or is he laughing up his sleeve at the madness of those who take him seriously? To Arthur's bewilderment, as he is about to marry Margaret, she falls under the spell of Oliver Haddo and flees with him. Yet Arthur can hardly picture into what abyss of horror and evil Margaret will be driven.A complex and perceptive novel. The theme of evil is perfectly woven into a story stunning for its action and vivid characters.I recommend the audio version from Audible.com.

Haddo is an eccentric character who is deeply occupied with occult mysteries and perhaps has dark powers of his own (or is he joking?)Arthur and Margaret take an instant dislike to Haddo, and when he and Arthur become enemies, strange things begin to happen...Soon the sensible and rational Arthur finds himself in way over his head in mysteries, when he tries to save the woman he loves from a truly horrible fate!The story is interesting and haunting, but the characters are a bit too rigid for my taste, and - except for Haddo - without much nuance. I'm aware that the themes they represent are the main focus of the novel, but I would have liked more &quot;3 dimensional&quot; characters (again except for Haddo).The plot is well constructed and interesting, and the explorations of the dark arts and it's practises are fascinating!I won't reveal too much of the story here, as it takes some interesting twists and turns along the way!

But whatever Maugham wrote, including pot-boilers like this one, was written extremely well.

Once I got beyond my thought of been there/seen this a million times in the movies and on t.v., I really enjoyed this work.

Admittedly, the work is definitely NOT Huysmans! Still, it is this humble reader's opinion it can only be commended for providing Occulture &amp; Literature with a historical treatise under the guise of fiction, painted in the magicKal colours of an up &amp; coming, much-esteemed author, &quot;who would go on to forge much finer works&quot;---at least, that is how the book is considered by &quot;official and established academia&quot;, somewhat embarrassingly, as well as hypocritically. I feel the work is underrated, as the majority of Maugham's thematics are present as well as explored; the difference lies in that it is composed by a young writer, not yet fully matured, but not suffering any artistic lack because of it; and for that stage in the charting of a writer's progression, he was functioning at peak capacity, completely absorbed by his cast and contents. Besides, a reconciliation of the author's progression is uncalled for and unessential to &quot;properly&quot; enjoy the journey through underground occult Paris we are taken on!"},{"Title":"An American Album: One Hundred and Fifty Years of Harper's Magazine","review":"One immediately knows they are in for an incredible treat perusing the table of contents.

However, the author provides good information for introductory strategy that will definitely save the novice player money. In a book of this nature, I think it is essential that there be information on which machines are statistically full-pay machines and which are not. For instance, if a jacks or better machine pays 9 to 1 for a full house and 6 to 1 for a flush, perfect play over the long run will yield close to full paybacks, while a machine that pays 8 and 5 to 1 respectively, is only a 94% payback machine.

Nettleship's book on the educational meaning of Plato's Republic is a most welcome publishing event. In the few lines that follow, I want to justify my insuppressible exultation. I will confine my remarks to the Republic itself, on the assumption that the value of Nettleship's contribution is by now so well appreciated that it hardly requires further elaboration. A full-blown critique is, anyhow, beyond the scope of this review.The Republic is a wonderful book. In this book, Plato explicates the idea of education. He takes a somewhat circuitous route though. He begins by inquiring into the nature of justice and asking why justice pays. Finding himself having a hard time answering this question directly, he adopts the strategy of tackling it by inquiring as to the nature of a just state. In the course of his deliberations, he is led to the suggestion that, to be just, a state has got to assign its inhabitants occupational roles that are consonant with their respective abilities. At this juncture, he is faced with the challenge of delineating the scope of occupational roles that need to be filled. As one such occupational role, he singles out state guardianship - suggesting that, to be effective, a state has got to reserve a place for people who will serve as its guardians. They are to be saddled with the responsibility to protect the state from incursions from its neighbors. They also need to prosecute certain offensive campaigns. Ultimately, this role is indistinguishable from statecraft.Plato is keen on making the point that this job is more arduous and formidable than all of the others. It, therefore, takes a particularly well endowed individual to properly qualify for it. Such an individual will, after all, be called upon to perform tasks that are exceedingly taxing. Plato now engages in a protracted discussion on how best to assure that the best qualified people will wind up serving in the capacity of state guardian - which has by now been elevated to the status of rulership.He adopts the twofold strategy of: a) devising a system whereby, in each generation, the best qualified crop of young citizens are channeled into the rulership pool; and b) delineating a training process that will make members of this pool fit to assume leadership positions. In other words, it is to provide them a proper education. For the better part of the remainder of the dialogue, Plato finds himself occupied in a deliberation of the basic constituents a guardian's education. What kind of education must one undergo in order to qualify for a state leadership role? It needs to be borne in mind that the state in question isn't any old state but a perfectly ideal one. It is to exemplify justice; and its leader has to be capable of making sure that it does. It follows, therefore, that Plato is not inquiring into the nature of education per se but, rather, into the elements of an education that render it superior to any other education. The task with which this education is charged is nothing less than producing an unusually good and well integrated person.It may thus occur to someone to question the relevance of Plato's model for the more mundane type of education that interests us today. But to think thus is to lose sight of the fact that, on the contrary, our present-day conception of education is predicated on the premise that education must unleash each and every one of our students' potentialities for self-realization. It needs therefore to be geared toward making everyone - regardless of race, gender, social class, etc - a superior person. Insofar forth, Plato's project speaks directly to our own educational interests, and is not to be cast aside as irrelevant.The compass of this review will not accommodate a full-dressed discussion of the view of education put forth and elaborated by Plato. We will have to content ourselves with achieving much less. We simply draw attention to the fact that, ultimately, the proffered education is a scientific education - but not in the sense in which we nowadays use this term. Today, science is identified with empirical investigation; but this wasn't so in Plato's day. What it connoted was essentially systematic comprehension: an all encompassing, intellectually satisfying theory of the world, grounded in rigorous contemplation. This theory was, for Plato, dominated by the idea of the good. Scientific inquiry had, moreover, to be carried out utilizing a certain methodology. It had to be conducted dialectically - which is to say, by pure concentration on abstract ideas alone and on their mutual relations. No sensibles were to be admitted, only intelligibles. Such detached mental activity had, Plato thought, the potential to deliver a degree of accuracy unrivaled by studies of a more empirical kind.The underlying tenet of Plato's conception did, to be sure, owe much of its impetus to results already achieved by investigations carried out by the Pythagoreans some years earlier. But Plato single-handedly made manifest its vital contours.In expounding his theory, Plato is at pains to drive home the point that education is about weaning the student off of a sensible diet and acclimating him to a more strictly intelligible one. To this end, Plato employs - invokes, if you will - the metaphor of the cave. The ultimate educational goal being acquiring an ability to engage in dialectic, this is precisely what you would expect. Dialectic is very much a spontaneous, inner directed activity, wholly impervious to the machinations of spoon-feeding. It requires self-discipline and analytical, creative originality at its best, as much as anything else.Now, again, I don't claim thoroughness for this outline of Plato's view of education. I'll leave that to the others writing reviews. I mean merely to accentuate that Plato laid the groundwork for the conduct of educational activity as we conceive it today. In our attitude toward education, we are far from the Humanism characterizing the period of the Renaissance. We are, rather, in the shadow of the Enlightenment and, indeed, of the post-Enlightenment. And as such, we cling to an education rooted in hard facts, not in lofty modes of expression. Like Plato, we aspire to objectivity and shun sophistic relativity and ornamental rhetoric. Granted, the day may be fast approaching when Enlightenment is displaced by postmodernism as the dominant intellectual zeitgeist, and the constructive critique of a Richard Rorty-like personage carries the day and holds sway. But for the moment at least, Plato's Republic remains very much in vogue and serves as an apt foundation of education."},{"Title":"The Chewing-Gum Rescue and Other Stories","review":"Someone recommended this to us when my children were 6 and 3; now they are 9 and 6 and decided to listen to it again this week . . . for at least the fifth time. A wonderful deadpan narrator for these extremely funny, extremely strange stories. Even I never tire of them. There is nothing else quite like them."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"As a Business Systems Analyst in the financial services industry, I found the book insightful into the thoughts and practices of one of the most revered strategy consulting groups in the industry.

I definitely plan on using quite a few of its recommendations."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"As of one of the architects for a major online bank, I read this book to learn about Mckinsey as they are heavily utilized within the organization.

Or, in my case, six hours (I read it twice!). Anyone who thinks consulting is easy only needs to read this book to find out how wrong they are. The McKinsey Way gives you the answers to questions you never realised you should be asking until you read the book and find out what you've been missing. The book has something for everyone: If you have lots of business ideas, but don't always get buy-in, read Part 3. If you want to know how to come up with the ideas in the first place, read Part 1. If you can do both of those, but you always fly by the seat of your pants, Part 2 is for you. If you fancy a job at McKinsey, don't do it - until you've read Part 4."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"I always wondered what earned McKinsey those high fees, and such cache among my business school colleagues. Now I know! Very interesting."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"I have the same opinion with the reader from Philadelpia.I think this book has just very simple, common rules of McKinsey and some rules is already well known to public. The book doen't explain good method, tools Mckinsey has.There are no details. When he introduces 'MECE', he should have explained the 'Logic Tree' in detail. But he didn't.I think the rank of sales results from only the name value, 'Mckinsey' and marketing effortsSo I would not like to recommend this book."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"This book is smooth, crisp, clean, clear and efficient. The details themselves aren't really the point. Anyone with a decent education should understand the basics of working with others.But knowing some basic facts isn't the same thing as presenting them well. The book's main strength is a careful and evenhanded tone which is a great model for copying. Sure, you could pay someone from McKinsey a hefty fee to teach you, but buying the book is a better deal. It's a pretty good way to pick up polish and sophistication."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"This book is a sad example of bad and desperate marketing. It is an unbelievable collection of boring examples, poor analysis, repeated well-known frameworks, and lots of consulting self-esteem!"},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"Being a management consultant myself - I found the book to be relevant but not too detailed. For instance, there should be more examples of the first 3 principles : fact based, structure of problem solving and hypothesis driven. Albeit this, it is an easy-to-read book and it does outline the pains and gains of a consultant's life with particular spotlight on the McKinsey and Co, which is undoubtedly an impressive firm. It is a great book for the uninitiated who wants to catch a glimpse at McKinsey - but it may not be as useful to insight-searching-people who have been in the industry for some time (or managers in that sense)."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"I read this book this afternoon (big print, wide spacing).The author describes the 80-20 pattern often found in work &amp; life (a phenomenon already familiar to most by which 80% of your business comes from 20% of your clients, 80% of your time is spent on 20% of your to-do list, etc.)The author demonstrates this chestnut with a book that is 20% useful and fresh and 80% no-brainer advice and shameless McKinsey advertising (we are CONSTANTLY reminded of how smart and ethical all those McKinsey consultants are; all consulting anecdotes have happy endings - unless the client screwed up; real quotes: &quot;As any good McKinsey associate would, this young man applied himself tirelessly and diligently to his task&quot;, or &quot;Hank knew his area of the bank inside and out and was probably as smart as any member of the McKinsey team&quot;... high praise indeed.) McKinsey's approving editors have all the subtly of China's Xinhua propaganda agency. Trouble is: many of us know people at McKinsey...Still, the 'waterfall' chart is among the 20% that make this book worth perusing (but not buying)."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"This effort was a great disappointment. I picked it up hoping to find a succinct, high-value description of the Firm's proprietary approach to share with colleagues; instead I found an overwrought, verbose set of cliches, factoids, and frameworks that, at best, only superfically discuss the McKinsey way. (How important is it to know that one McKinseyite considered it vitally important to carry Coca-Cola with him on every engagement?) Rasiel packs no more than three pages of the actual &quot;McKinsey way&quot; into 187 pages. Light on substance and heavy on trite, generic general advice, it is difficult to believe that someone who actually worked for the Firm could deliver such a dubious effort. (Perhaps this book gives insight into why the author lasted the minimum two years at McKinsey.) To be fair, the book does offer some insight into the way the Firm works (e.g., the Rule of Threes, engagement work planning, interviewing, etc.). If you are looking for a comprehensive, informed treatment in this area, I recommend &quot;Client-Centered Consulting.&quot;"},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"If your looking for specific case studies or a &quot;drilled down&quot; discussion, you generally will not find it with this book. It does, however, give some good general guidelines for conducting research, problem solving, presenting, and client interaction. As with most general or somewhat abstract models, this book provides general principles that can be applied specifically to your current situation. For example, the processes involved in data collection, brainstorming, issue analysis, hypothesis construction, etc., can be applied to any topic in any area. I found the writing style easy to read and concise, with minimal amounts of obfuscation. Basically, it seems to me, the bedrock of the Mckinsey way is long hours, data distillation, and thorough and exhausive data collection. All told, I found it a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"McKinsey has quite a reputation as a consultancy company, and I had hoped to be impressed by perhaps a great new insight or some extensive examples. Although a lot of tips are given to improve your performance as a consultant, explanations are not always clear and little background is provided. Perhaps this has to do with the fact that - of course - no real world project of McK's clients could be used as an example. The cases that are presented are not very detailed - it must be hard to come up with good and detailed case material. Often I had the idea, that the chapter (or subject) was already over by the time I just got interested. As in the chapter on putting project teams together: the author tells you that you cannot just put any group of people together, but then fails to analyse this a bit, or provide some good example of what might go wrong otherwise. And in the rare case of a detailed example, the author is not always clear. For example: the author stresses the importance of making good charts for presentations, and actually introduces a new type of chart (this much is obvious). However, I could not follow his explanation of the chart, so now I'm left with no more than a rough idea of what is meant. So, the book contains the right issues, but there it stops."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"McKinsey & Company is a world-famous strategic consulting company, also known as \\"The Firm\\". Ethan Rasiel worked at McKinsey & Co. for several years and provides a quick, clear introduction into management consulting firm's problem solving methods. \\"I wrote this book with the goal of communicating new and useful skills to everyone who wants to be more efficient and effective in business. ... In addition, this book will give any executive woho works with management consultants, whether McKinsey or elsewhere, some insight into how these strange beings think.\\"The book is split up into five parts. In Part I, Ethan Rasiel explains the McKinsey-way of thinking about business problems. The author explains that the solution of the problem needs to be fact-based (facts are friendly), rigidly structured (MECE = mutually exclusive), and hypothesis-driven (solve the problem at the first meeting - the initial hypothesis). In addition, the author explains how McKinsey-ites approach business problems and apply the McKinsey problem-solving process to maximum effect. There is also a short introduction into a number of rules which McKinsey-consultants use for problem-solving purposes: the 80/20-rule, find the key drivers, the elevator test - sell in 30 seconds, make a chart every day, look at the big picture, say \\"I don't know\\", and don't accept \\"I have no idea\\".In Part II, the author introduces the McKinsey-way of working to solve business problems. The author explains the selling process at McKinsey (the Firm does not sell, it markets), how to structure an engagement, and assembling of a team. Then the author comes to the most important part of the book, doing research, conducting interviews (the author insists on reading Chapter 8 - Conducting Interviews - \\"If you read no other chapter of the book from start to finish, read this one.\\"), and brainstorming.In Part III, the author, and the McKinsey-way of selling solutions. This part discusses the way McKinsey makes presentations, which is one of the strongest parts of McKinsey according to the author, displays data with charts (read Gene Zelazny (1985), 'Say it with Charts'), and the way to work with clients.In Part IV, Rasiel gives some lessons how \\"McKinsey-ites\\" have learned for coping with the stresses of life at the Firm, and in Part V, the author recounts the lessons he learned at McKinsey and shares memories of various ex-McKinsey-ites. Both Part IV and V are 'a waste of paper' in comparison to the first three parts, but gives a little insight into what goes on behind the scenes at McKinsey & Co.Yes, I can understand that some readers are disappointed by this book as it gives just an introduction into management consultancy (and McKinsey & Co). The author introduces the various problem-solving methods and tools, but does not discuss them in great detail. The author has responded to these criticisms by publishing The McKinsey Mind in 2002, which addresses this issue somewhat. However, for more details on the problem-solving methods and tools you will still have to read some other literature. I recommend you purchase The McKinsey Way if you want an introduction into management consultancy, and The McKinsey Mind if you want an introduction into problem-solving methods and tools."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"If I could have given it a zero, I would have. I've worked for McKinsey for the past twelve years, and I was stunned at the lack of insight in this book. Even the few observations the author got right are out of date, as the Firm has changed quite a bit in the past few years and this author left McKinsey quite a while ago. I can't imagine how he ever sold this one to a publisher. Vaporware."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"Like the firm itself, the draw of this book is the McKinsey name, and the perception that they *must* know something special. Content-wise you could do better with the user manual for your HP 12C calculator. If the book serves any useful purpose it's to strip a little more of the paint off the McKinsey facade.

Rasiel is a very easy-to-read, somewhat informative, but ultimately uninsightful book. I think persons interested in the consulting industry would benefit the most from this book. Nevertheless, as a business book in a general sense, most of the material is rather fundamental. In other words, if you purchase this book, I would caution against doing so with lofty expectations.MECEWhen the folks at McKinsey examine a problem their client is having, they develop a Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive list of issues to bring clarity to the problem under their analysis. The MECE list is to be concise, intelligible, and generally contain no more than three items.ELEVATOR TESTAs a general rule, whether you're finding conclusions for a client or generating proposals for a new project, you want to employ the elevator test. The elevator test is simply the ability of being so prepared and thoroughly researched that you can explain yourself and your position comprehensively in thirty seconds. I think in business there is a lot of truth to this elevator test.TEAMSI think the author appropriately emphasizes the importance of team bonding with dinners, movies, ballgames, and so forth. I think the reason why McKinsey functions so effectively as an organization is that its teams function exceptionally well, and that is perhaps a result of the numerous bonding opportunities on the company's dollar.CONDUCTING INTERVIEWSI actually found the section on how to conduct interviews to be fairly useful. If you are a researcher, perhaps even a journalist, and a portion of your job involves conducting interviews, I do not think you would waste your time reading this section in the book. However, read it closely.WHY THREE STARS?I believe many of the ideas presented for the reader's applications, as typical with consultants, are idealistic. That is, the methods and procedures covered in the book are not always feasible or pratical for an organization to implement. Furthermore, the book did not provide the insights I was perhaps looking about the company. I think, one perhaps would hope, the author had a lot more information he could have provided his readers. I think the author actually hints at the above point. Furthermore, I think some advice is actually harmful, particularly on achieving work and life balance with taking work from the office to the home with you.CONCLUSIONIf you are a consultant, considering becoming a consultant, or plan to hire a consultant I think you might find this book to be of some value to have a concept of the processes involved in the consulting business. However, if you are looking for insights into McKinsey or ideas to improve your business, I am not confident that The McKinsey Way will be adequate."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"Very readeable book that was enjoyable and and showed insights into the workings of McKinsey.

It's length is perfect for today's managers. At 178 pages, it can be consumed on a round-trip flight. More importantly, the book contains many practical concepts that can be applied to any problem encountered in business. Rasiel opens the book by providing insight into the methodologies and processes employed by McKinsey &amp; Co. Because of the secretive culture of the world's most elite managment consulting firms, Rasiel shares the basics of how the most brilliant problem-solvers at McKinsey approach issues, and shows how the reader can apply the same steps at his or her own organization. The book also contains many business lessons learned by many McKinsey-ites that again can be used by all. Whether you hire consultants, aspire to be a consultant, or just want to sharpen your business knowledge and problem-solving skills, The McKinsey Way is for you.

It outlines some practical steps togather information, motivate teams, think proactively, market services and ensure customer satisfaction. Although many of the ideas are common sense, I recommend this book strongly for people who are paid to solve problems. Some highlights:1) After gathering the relevant facts, segregate the issues so they are MECE (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive). This will help make sense of the chaotic data and help clarify the problem. (pg 10) In fact, sometimes the problem that the client brings you is not even the real problem.2) Use hypotheses and analysis frameworks (Porter's five forces etc...) but do not fall in love with your original hypothesis.3) Consulting work is not in a vacuum. Be aware of the internal politics and remember that a good recommendation is one that can realistically be implemented.4) To increase the customer's ROI, focus on the main problems (80/20 principle) and stop analyzing when you have the answer or you see diminishing marginal returns. As the author quaintly put it, \\"Don't boil the ocean.\\" (pg 32)There are many others, but let's not spoil the book. ;)"},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"The book details every important aspects of being a world class management consultant.

This book really helped by raising the analysis up a level to better understand what the actual problem and business drivers are. Too often we apply Six Sigma or Lean tools to a problem when another problem solving method is more appropriate. Much like using a hammer when one needs a screwdriver.

McKinsey are clearly the worlds most secretive consulting firm. However, Raisel's interpretation of their uniqueness is somewhat limited by his experience. For those readers out their who have worked in a consulting or professional services firm you will find alot of motherhood in this book which has been jazzed up as wow factor genius of McKinsey.That said there are a few gems in this book too. For those who have heard of McKinsey methods such as the hypothesis driven approach, and the elusive waterfall diagram this book explains all."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"This book's worth reading if you are a consultant or wish to become one. Don't expect the mystique and dark secrets of McKinsey to be revealed. The \\"way\\" is quite simple and obvious to experienced consultants; but probably what new consultants need to accelerate their technique.The style of the book is a little frivolous for my liking in places. It could do with a decent editor. Grammatical mistakes abound and some of the content could do with it's own medicine - MECE. Waffle and padding abound.In summary: it's worth reading, but take note that the author only spent 3 years at McKinsey and, based on an average engagement length of 6 months, that means about 6 engagements (assuming one engagement at a time). Is that enough to qualify as an authority on the Firm & its \\"way\\"? And then there's this constant reference to one consultant named McDermott - shouldn't he just have written the book himself?"},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"As with other readers and reviewers, I was quite disappointed by this book. It does not provide the insight into the McKinsey company that I was hoping and expecting. Sure it tells you that they work very hard and burn out very fast, while learning at the clients expense. But, it does not really talk about the company, instead it focusses on how to do consulting.I did think that there were some interesting insights into the way the company undertakes assignments and the structure that they apply to them. There were also a number of other small take aways that at least justified the team in reading it - just! But if you are looking to learn about the company, its history and success then this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"As you probably know if you're reading this, if you search for anything \\"McKinsey\\" or \\"consulting\\" this book is often at the top of your search results, and as you also probably know if you've been looking for a good book on McKinsey, nothing else promises what this provocative title does. I read the reviews and I thought I knew what to expect. Many people said the book was filled with generalities and wasn't useful to anyone with graduate or real world business experience. I took that into consideration but being a 2nd year undergrad I thought I should find at least a few enlightening ideas. Some people even recommend it as useful for the \\"16-21\\" crowd, but I would charge even for the average achiever in college the book falls short of expectations and is not worth owning. I'd recommend skimming a borrowed copy though, just to satisfy your temptation for a glimpse at the \\"McKinsey Way\\"."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"The book provides an complete and structured overview of key elements of consulting and McKinsey's approach. It covers most important concepts and approaches on 1) how to frame problems 2) how to organise and run a project 3) how to present outcomes of a project and 4) how to work as a consultant in McKinsey.As mr Rasiel goes through the elements of consulting, he unfortunately does not go in much depth. For example, he talks about running a project in specific phases, but does not explain elements such as workplanning, types of analysis or scope management in any depth. He basically mentions them as important. A key element that I believe is missing from the book is the concept of feedback and performance discussions. Consulting can offer the excellent learning exactly because it offers raw, data-driven and honest feedback. You will hear from your managers things you may not want, but may well need to hear. It is my belief McKinsey has more to offer than what mr Rasiel describes.Furthermore, the tone that mr Rasiel strikes may put some clients and even (potential) employees off. The feeling I got as I was reading the book was that senior clients are often considered difficult in their demands and client team members more often than not a pain to work with. Unfortunately, many of the comments seem to confirm prejudices that clients have against strategy consultants."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"The real McKinsey way remains safeguarded within the steadfast walls of this secretive company, but this book deals out many ideas that any strategy conscious businessperson should be mindful of.

Accommodating tips are provided to help identify a problem, communicate with team members and jump-start research on a problem-solving project. Other great guidelines, such as ideas for brainstorming, effective messaging and structured presentations are included.The author writes about his own and others' experiences while working for this competitive business consulting firm. Its employees are trained to aim for perfection, sacrifice long hours of overtime while giving their best at the job. Sharp analytical ability is essential in being a part of the team.

Well, he is a person in Mckinsey to consult for the clients, not a person in Mckinsey to manage the employees of Mckinsey, and not a person who guides Mckinsey.So, you can learn how to do things more effective and more efficient from this book, if you can integrate all the valuable methods into your daily work. Maybe some of those items are not fit for you, it doesn't matter, of course you cannot put all of your hope on a single book. Never let a book occupy your brain, but use your own head to read them.All in all, it's a book for those who want it to improve his daily work, but not for who want to know why it's Mckinsey, not the others.And more you use the methods provided to improve your life, more useful the book is.And you will feel satisfied with this book if you don't over-hope it. :-)"},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"I bought this book hoping to get an insiders view on how McKinsey continues to demonstrate value to the top leaders in the world of business- what I got was a simplistic, egotistical view with no practical takeaways.

It's a fairly short read and I was engaged throughout the entire book."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"Hundereds to thousands of aspiring MBAs dream of working for THE FIRM. But a few know what it is to work at THE FIRM. Fortunately, the life and work at THE FIRM are impeccably brought to fore in The Mckinsey Way. The Mckinsey Way of problem solving, dealing with issues and the practices at one of the world's best consulting firms' are told in a most simplistic manner.The book is filled with real life examples and the narration has a touch of humour. The series of topics ranging from defining problem, hypothesis creation to the techniques of data collection, derving solutions to presenting the findings to the client are communicated effectively. The authors' stint at Mckinsey further lends credit to the book. Summing up, the book is a must read for a business studnet aspiring to be a consultant. My recommendation - a must buy for consultants and consultants to be."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"I read both of Raisel's McKinsey books. If you can cut through the McKinsey arrogance and the endless references to the number of hours McKinsey consultants work, it is pretty good reading.The books are written for line managers and are appropriately prescriptive and basic. As an organizational consultant I have never sat down to write out my diagnostic analyses and outputs. This documents many of the analyses I use and will help me better communicate with my clients. These books will help people in HR, IS, Training, and other functions who are looking to become value-added &quot;business partners&quot; collect data and analyze problems as internal consultants. If another book comes out I will read it as well. But please, no more references to late night Chinese dinners."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"This is a good start if you want to get to know the industry, the company, and a little bit of structured thinking. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, but it left the need for more..."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"This book is arranged in many extremely brief sections, each of which makes a point or two at a very general level. A useful collection of approaches that a novice may find helpful, but without tough case studies or any special insight into McKinsey.I found the last two sections quoting the most important and the most memorable experiences of various McKinsey employees the most interesting parts.Read it if you are interested in management consulting and want a book you can scan in short sessions."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"This is an okay book. It tells you a few tips about how Mckinsey works and the tools they use to get answers. It is simple stuff but you can see why it works. If you were thinking about working at McKinsey this book would be of great help. They work new staff to the bones (80 hr work weeks are the rule) and staff are away from home all the time. The plus of this is you learn an enormous amount about business. It would be like being in the Marines. You can do it when you are young and then it is great when you get out."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"The McKinsey Way has a great title but the content fails to live up to it. The book has 178 pgs but could have been covered in 60 pgs, and without the bad jokes (please). The book could be summarized as (1) break problems down into components systematically, (2) use facts but don't overload yourself with too much information, and (3) if you work for McKinsey you'll have no life. Do not buy the book, just flip through it in a store."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"As you scan the other reviews you'll notice that they are heavily weighted toward both extremely high and low reviews. WHAT'S GOING ON?....The McKinsey Way is all about uncommon sense: the stuff that leaves you saying &quot;Well, duh,&quot; but may not have occured to you otherwise. Regard the low investment (&lt;$20.00) as an option on your mind: you may actually learn of a new way to look at problems. If so, the book is worth well more than the low price and may actually pay dividends throughout your career; If not, the book is a quick and entertaining read and, in the end, you're out less than the price of a tank of gas.Recommendation: Take a chance, read this book!!!"},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"This book is a shameful exploitation of the McKinsey name. The title would give the impression that you would receive at least a couple nuggets of wisdom. Unfortunately the information presented is less than an Introduction to Management course from a local university and not much more than common sense. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!"},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"When you see the name McKinsey in the title and the author promises he'll tell you how the world's most prestigious consulting firm does it, you expect a lot. But unfortunately this book does not deliver. As so many other Amazon reader/reviewers said, save your money. There are so many other good management books that provide far more advice and practical information."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"Pretty straight forward stuff. McKinsey's success is based on it's network and it's reputation for brainiacs. Period. They've been long known for not getting their hands dirty with actual &quot;implementation&quot; -- an image they're trying to change.A couple of things that I wish to correct about this book.1) The reason they keep their client names confidential is not because they're guarding top-secret information. Simply put, what client wants it getting around that they have to pay a fortune for outside help to run their company?2) The author never mentions the real reason that McKinsey doesn't have to sell: McKinsey actively encourages officers and consultants to join other firms in order to expand their network. This is how they market. McKinsey alumni become CEOs and CEOs request McKinsey's services.On another note, I disagree with McKinsey's promotion criteria which is bases merit upon &quot;raw intelligence&quot; over a person's ability to manage client relations and cause change to happen (i.e. people with flat personalities and large craniums reign)."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"There is very little information in this book that would justify its purchase. Interestingly, even if the author's only goal was to provide an entertaining account of life within McKinsey, he would fail. Basically, there is no actionable information for the practicing consultant nor any material for a third party looking for insights into the consulting world or McKinsey."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"Possibly a good book for someone fresh out of school, with little management experience or someone just assigned their first consulting type project. Any moderately experienced manager will not likely learn much from this book. Do we really need a list of things to pack for a business trip. Best quote, \\" Remember that the interviewee (client) probably knows a lot more about her business than you (consultant) do...\\" p.84 and almost the same statement on p.80."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"After reading this book, I would never hire McKinsey if any of those associated with the book showed up for the engagement. You can get more business wisdom from Chicken Soup for the Soul books (my mom keeps them near the toilet for reading)."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"On a positive note, this book is a quick read, on the downside, there's nothing in here worth reading. I've been in consulting for 8 years, not at McKinsey but for the Big4 consulting firms and now with a boutique firm where I frequently engage in strategy consulting, similar to what you would find at McKinsey. Anyone who has been in consulting for even a couple years can tell this is rudimentary and no-brainer type stuff.The level of depth this author goes into is pretty pathetic in my opinion. And I guess no wonder, the guy only worked there for 3 years. McKinsey has been around for eons and this guy thinks he has the secret sauce after working there for just 3 years? Which also means he was probably at best an analyst or an associate (the lower 2 levels). Clients pay out their ass for strategy consulting services from McKinsey, to boil down the secret sauce into the simple rules and approaches outlined in this book is laughable.I would not waste my time with this book. If you're interested in consulting, chances are you're at most 2 degrees away from someone that actually knows what consulting is about, you're better off learning from that person."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"Ever wonder the purpose of going to college when you don't remember or use most of what you learned? At the very least, you are supposed to have gained general problem solving skills. This book titled 'The McKinsey Way' is actually nothing but a systematic approach to managing the most common problems you will run into while working in Corporate America. These are the tested and proven success techniques that have worked for the consultants at McKinsey explained in very simplistic terms.If you have a college degree, the chances are that you are already aware and exposed to a lot of these techniques. Nevertheless, it is definitely worthwhile spending a few dollars to own a copy of this book. The observations made in this book are those that are universal and don't necessarily change with time. So, the benefits of reading this book and applying these techniques can be very long lasting.The author's writing style makes it very easy to read and understand the different topics presented in the book. The chapters can be read independently and so can the different sections in each chapter. Hence, you can read the book a few pages at a time and still benefit tremendously.You can start applying these techniques right away so the benefits of reading this book can be seen immediately. It may be hard to believe that McKinsey is known to charge up to $800/hour for just doing these simple things but they do accomplish valuable results. And that's why corporations are willing to pay such a high price for McKinsey's consultants.Have fun reading this book and I hope you benefit from reading this book as much as I did! Did I mention that it has proved to be a great conversation piece?"},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"This book shall be useful to beginners/intemediates (1-3 yrs experience) in business planning/analysis/consultation work. It is simple. Not technical. With ample examples about people engagement. You can add on your personal experiences to make the learning more interactive &amp; effective."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"Those of you interested in consulting careers might consider reading the McKinsey trilogy of books written by ex-McKinsey-ite, Ethan Rasiel. Within ten years of writing his first book on McKinsey, entitled \\"The McKinsey Way,\\" Rasiel has witnessed \\"the Firm\\" double its number of professional consultants to 9,000, and increase its number of locations by almost 20% to 89 offices globally. McKinsey continues to thrive in up and down markets that included the tech bubble bursting, 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the worst economic recession since the 1930's. If you want to join this illustrious firm, then according to Rasiel, getting hired is simple:\\"Be of above average intelligence, possess a record of academic achievement at a good college and a top business school, show evidence of achievement in all previous jobs, and demonstrate extraordinary analytical ability. [And] If you manage to clear all those hurdles, the key to joining the Firm may be the case interview\\" (p. 161).But you don't have to work for McKinsey to benefit from applying its approach to your own business problems. The cornerstone for getting inside the McKinsey mind is the MECE (pronounced \\"me-see\\") mantra - an acronym that stands for \\"mutually exclusive, completely exhaustive.\\" And this doesn't refer to the hours you'll be working as a consultant. Although they will also be mutually exclusive, completely exhaustive!The process begins once the client comes to you with a problem. You must first dissect the problem into its simple constituent parts. For example, if the client says, \\"We need to make more money,\\" then you should immediately respond, \\"Well, how do you currently make your money?\\" When the client answers that they make money by selling product X, then the obvious question becomes, \\"How do we sell more of product X.\\" Next, to make this initial root question conform to MECE standards we exhaustively look at ALL the factors that might effect sales of product X, including production costs, distribution channels, and marketing. Then, re-phrase the question(s) into \\"action statements.\\" For example, \\"We can increase product X sales by: reducing our unit costs, changing the way we sell to customers, and improving the way we market to customers (this construct can be teased out further by constructing an \\"issue tree\\").Once organized into this framework, we can form our initial hypotheses on how to solve the problem(s). Finally, we test our hypotheses by verifying them against the facts (\\"trust, but verify\\"). Facts trump all else. Ethan Rasiel warns us, \\"Hiding from the facts is a prescription for failure - eventually, truth will out\\" (p. 5). The McKinsey system relies heavily on the availability and accuracy of these facts, some of which are gathered through its proprietary \\"PDnet\\" system - a collection of recent \\"client engagements,\\" and internal research & publications (\\"The McKinsey Quarterly\\"). Such an analytical framework that breaks propositions down into their \\"atomic facts\\" would make the logical positivists of the 1920's that occupied Oxbridge very happy.Having studies philosophy during college, it seems that a background in philosophy would be great training for being a consultant, because you must be a generalist, yet also possess the analytical ability to delve into the nitty-gritty. Rasiel quotes one Engagement Manager who said, \\"You have to be fundamentally skeptical about everything\\" (p. 2).Another feature of McKinsey that can benefit other organizations is their \\"free-flow of information\\" philosophy that is nurtured through a lateral hierarchy. While there exists a clear pecking order: Director of Client Services (DCS), Director, Partner, Senior Engagement Manager (SEM), Engagement Manager (EM), and Associate, McKinsey adopts an open-door policy. You MUST keep others \\"in the loop.\\" Sometimes the best ideas come from your teammates, Rasiel advises, \\"Keep an open and flexible mind. Don't let a strong initial hypothesis become an excuse for mental inflexibility\\" (p. 21). There will be times, however, when even the best ideas (no matter who comes up with them) just cannot be implemented for the client due to \\"political reasons, lack of resources or inability.\\"Rasiel also discovered several other useful rules while working as an associate at McKinsey (from 1989 to 1992) that might help you. For example, for some unknown reason the 80/20 rule - that 20% of the work is responsible for 80% of the results - seems to apply to many facets of life, including business. As alluded to earlier, it is also important to consult your co-workers, rather than have to re-invent the wheel. And if you're chatting it up with your EM, then you better be familiar enough with the client solution to be able to articulate it in the 30 seconds it takes to ride down in an elevator with him. A final useful point to remember is that on your quest to discovering the holy grail (big picture) be sure to go after little victories by \\"picking the low-hanging fruit.\\" While you don't need to work at McKinsey to develop this analytical frame of mind, the Firm is filled with such people, and the lessons are universal in their application."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"The cost of retaining McKinsey & Company is probably prohibitive for most organizations. Therefore, when a book appears which purports to explain the \\"way\\" of the most prestigious management consultant firm, it is certain to attract a great deal of attention and this one did. Having been involved in a number of strategic alliances over the years, ones which also involved McKinsey executives, I really expected much more from this book than it does in fact deliver. (I have the same opinion of its sequel, The McKinsey Mind, which I do not intend to review.) I recall a period years ago when the Boston Celtics were consistently winning NBA championships. At the annual All-Star game, the East squad ran Celtic plays because they were the only plays everyone knew. Lombardi's Green Bay Packer teams ran the same offense and defense season after season while winning NFL titles. What's my point? Perhaps what differentiates McKinsey from all other major management consulting firms. (whatever that \\"what\\" or \\"way\\" is) cannot be explained in a book and will only be revealed over time in direct and frequent contact with McKinsey executives. This book may be of some value to middle managers but there are so many other books which offer more and better guidance. Ironically, many of those books were written by former McKinsey partners."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"In this book, the writer puts you through a McKinsey Boot-camp and shows what it means to be fact-based, structured, and hypothesis-driven. However, dont expect this book to provide anything extraordinary from any other management consultant's methods and perspectives just because its got the McKinsey name on it. Perhaps what the writer is trying to convey is exactly that -- a successful consultant is not just someone with the knowledge but the ability to share that knowledge in the most simplest form in assisting to solve clients' problems.The basic techniques shared is well-written and can be effective if well implemented. It provide managers and business owners some guidance on techniques of handling problems and tough strategic issues for those who cant afford the real McKinsey.The intro states: &quot;Think of this book as a sampler...read whatever items interest you&quot; Well, that's exactly what it is -- straight and simple!"},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"If I were the CEO of AT&amp;T and this was the wisdom of McKinsey's approach, I'd be asking for a refund. As a long time strategy consultant who has competed with McKinsey and come in after McKinsey, I can tell you that I've never seen that McKinsey has any real differentiation from any other consultant's methodology. There have a lot of smart consultants, but so do any number of other firms. So why are they so successful? Don't expect this book to give you any insight."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"Being keen to better understand McKinsey's formula for success, I was rather underwhelmed: very basic information which might be useful to a new graduate, but hardly earth shattering (check out the team building section for example, the summary for which amounts to 'treat your people nicely if you want them to keep working for you'). On the other hand, you do get some sense of McKinsey's internal workings (eg. getting assigned to a project, career development, etc).It's an easy read, a few hours at most, but unfortunately the true amount of useful information could be summarized in a first semester MBA student's 4-page book report."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"Rasiel gets you with the McKinsey Brand; that's the real story here. Good job of marketing, but the book is way too shallow to be of any use. Rasiel hints at McKinsey secrets but never scratches the surface (my friend who works at McKinsey thinks no one will publish the \\"reality\\"). The book may be interesting for someone who would like to get a romanticized version of what it is like to be a respected consultant, but that's probably it- the book is more of a feel-good rahrah than anything truly unique and inspiring. It seems as though Rasiel wants us to believe that McKinsey was the first to use the scientific method and engage in creative thinking... his examples leave me dissatisfied and are too general- in the end it sounds like he is sitting for an interview rather than exposing the secrets behind a well-respected company (then again, maybe he is looking for a job now?!). In conclusion, at least the book doesn't give any really poor advice and it wouldn't hurt a younger (read 16-21) reader to brush up on the tips he throws out."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"Nothing special in this book -- I would be more than happy to send my copy to anyone that wants it."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"... There is very, very little useful information. Much ofbook centers around how selective McKinsey is, which is commonknowledge. There is almost a total lack of how strategies particular to McKinsey can be applied to solving business problems. END"},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"This book is devoid of any real consulting nuggets. If McKinsey would like to take credit for the 80/20 Rule, as the author implies, perhaps they should take that up with Pareto who first suggested the relationship in 1897. In a rapidly moving business world, there simple is not enough time to waste on lightweight books like this. Tom Peters is a much better representative of McKinsey and his books will give a clearer, more useful picture of the quality work done by that consulting giant."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"There are a couple of really good books on general consulting process - much better than Mr Rasiel's. Mr Rasiel has just cheated the customers in getting them to purchase the book by putting the 'McKinsey' name on it. Other than on the cover, there is no'McKinsey way' inside the book. Its a fraud.I have a better mind than to agree with the author about the McKinsey Way! I am sure McKinsey is much better than what Mr Rasiel's book says. The author needs to be sued, for misleading the readers. I guess, he is a disgruntelled employee of McKinsey and very subtly made money off his employers organization and in the process, achieved his objective of tarnishing its image."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"I bought this book because I am considering a career change from molecular biologist to management consulting and McKinsey &amp; Co. is one of the firms that I am targeting.

It was truly an embarrassing read!"},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"The need for consulting help in most companies arises due to various factors. Whatever the reason, it involves a business problem that needs a solution. Managers who have put in several years of service in the industry are often capable of finding the solution; yet the need for help from outside. The external consultants are expected to approach the problem with a open mind, analyze the issues in detail and give recommendations that are unbiased and implementable. Consulting is a demanding profession that needs multi-dimensional skills, the ability to work under stress and meet strict deadlines.Most consulting firms have their own style and methodology. It is important to note that there is no best way since each problem on hand is different. The knowledge gained in one assignment is systematically stored for reuse and reference for future, while ensuring that the confidentiality of the client information is maintained.To be successful, consulting requires above average IQ coupled with excellent people skills and highest level of professional integrity- A combination that is hard to find. It is this rare combination with excellence in each trait and the exceptional quality of work that has made Mckinsey one of the most admired and respected firms till date. The ability to collect enormous amounts of data, analyze it using structured techniques, working long hours for six days a week, interviewing people, steering clear of organizational politics seem to be a way of life at &quot;the Firm&quot;.Ethan Rasiel deserves credit on three points - Simplicity, frankness and clarity with which he has written this book based on his own experience at &quot;the Firm&quot;.I recommend this book to three categories of people- Managers, students and consultants.I recommend reading this book three times - Read, understand and practice.Yes, I seem to have picked up the habit of &quot;three&quot;.

Otherwise, if you are only interested in business advice and presentation skill enhancement, there are countless other books to read."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"Raisel provides one of the most superficial accounts of strategy consulting I've ever seen, and does a great disservice to aspiring b-school grads looking to learn more about the firm (or to clients who'd like to get some validation that the fees are really worth it).Instead of providing a detailed perspective on methods and approach, we get some laughable frameworks that put everything in perspective: Case in point -- Raisel notes that McKinsey recommendations are 'fact based.' Wow, what a revelation -- I'm sure that opens everyone's eyes! He spends the early part of the 'book' (that is a generous term here, the text might fill a 50 page deliverable, at best) discussing the importance of hypothesis development and issue trees. All fine, except this is consulting 101 -- every consultant gathers initial facts, develops potential rationales for the issues a client might face (or an hypothesis), then goes off to see if their thoughts are correct, and finally develops go-forward recommendations.Raisel stays at such a high level throughout the book, that there is no way to get beyond the pleasantries of 'base your conclusions on facts,' and 'adjust your hypothesis based on new facts.' Instead, he sounds like a washed up high school athlete most of the time -- recounting war stories, eating chinese food at the office, and working until 2am every night! This all gets old pretty quick, though he tops it off with chapters on how to travel (bring a sweater for long flights!) and how it's a good idea to carry on your luggage to save time at the airport.I really don't see how this book stays in print, but I do understand how Raisel only lasted 3 years at McKinsey -- this sort of supercial blather is just the sort of thing that McKinsey despises."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"This is the first time I have felt the need to write a review in many, many years of buying books on Amazon. I think most of the points raised by others who have written scathing reviews capture the crux of why this book is such a poor investment so I won't repeat them. What summed the book up for me is the advice on page 148 of the edition I wasted my money on. We are told that 'treating everyone with respect' is, 'possibly the best advice in this book'. REALLY? If you want to be told the blindingly obvious, feel free to buy this book. If you want to learn anything of any value that you will be able to use in the workplace, you should avoid this book like the plague."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"This quick read provides confirmation to the way consultants handle many everyday challenges, what they think they already know, but have never been officially told. Rasiel does this through short sections and chapters alike. He cuts right to the chase. I think this is maybe why some other readers commented so negatively, maybe they were seeking out in depth methodologies or had extensive experience of their own to already draw from.I enjoyed the bite-sized chucks of information and ear-marked many of the pages to use during future conversations with proteges.I think the real key with this book is it should be targeted at traveling consultants with less than 5 years experience seeking to move up the ladder."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"After a very bad experience hiring a McKinsey team, I was hoping that the quality of the firm under other circumstances would be better. However, if this book reflects the depth and insightfulness of that firm consulting worldwide, I am convinced that these people do not have anything new to offer to the corporate world."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"This book reminded me of term papers I used to write: wide margins, lots of white space, big font, and much repetition. I bought it because I thought it might provide insight, instead I was bombarded with conventional wisdom.

This book caught my attention and once I started reading I couldn't stop. I started Saturday afternoon and finished Sunday afternoon.The book gives simple yet very good advice. It's probably not advice you couldn't get elsewhere, but the writing style of the author makes it very enjoyable to read and I think even simple messages deserve repeating. I particularly enjoyed the stories from actual experiences at the firm. I found them fascinating.Quite a few people have nitpicked the book with negative reviews. My opinion is that they either don't have a sense of humor (and missed the jokes) or they are probably already above average consultants and therefore weren't the target audience.If you're not an experienced consultant, or if you're an average one, then this book could teach you a few things that make it well worth the price of the book.In summary, if I learned one thing from the book it is this: any problem can be solved with a good approach based on hypothesis, facts, and asking the right questions."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"This book is nothing special because it contains no revolutionary\\\\evolutionary business concepts that are unique. To be sure, it contains lot of good business anecdotes you will find in most business books. But if you want to find out what makes McKinsey's business practice so special and so much better than its competitors, the book leaves a lot wanting. Furthermore, the book is full of generalities, for example, the chapter on interviewing for facts was nice, but again, nothing special. You would be far better off buying specialty books on such matters. I think this would be a good book to buy if you want to enter into consulting or are looking to work for McKinsey. For others, however, the book does not break any new ground nor provides any brainstromy insights. Rather, it is full of nice business generalities and suggestions."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"This is a good book about what it is like to work as a management consultant, but not a very good book about how to think like one. I liked a lot of this book, such as his explanation of how to conduct an interview. I also liked his discussion about working late producing documents.However, many parts of this book were useless (the section on charts basically tells you to read the book &quot;Say it with Charts&quot;), and others were wrong (the example used for MECE was actually not mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive). Additionally, as a consultant who didn't travel or work very much at client sites, Rasiel couldn't give a complete picture of the consulting lifestyle.In short, this is an interesting read if you are thinking of joining a management consulting firm; it does a decent job describing one person's experience. But it isn't a good book on business in general, or even on the history of McKinsey."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"Almost everyone is asked to be on a team in order to solve a problem. Few are prepared for the experience. The McKinsey Way is a good primer for anyone placed in this situation for the first time, because it simply explains a workable methodology for getting organized, identifying the issues, solving the problem, getting consensus and going on to implement successfully. A lot of this will be intuitive, but what is not intuitive is what will help you. You can probably best use this as a checklist to be sure you are not skipping steps. If you buy this book to be your own consultant expecting to get McKinsey-like results, you will probably not succeed. Drawing on lots of experience, skill, and smart people allows McKinsey to use this kind of methodology for best results. But you will certainly get better results than if you ignore the methodology, and few can afford McKinsey. Professional firms in other fields (such as accountants and lawyers) would do well to review this book to create a sense of urgency about having a methodology. My main regret is that the book is authored by someone who was an associate for three years rather than one of the firm's all-stars. Perhaps another McKinsey alum will be encouraged to share her or his views of the firm's approach. That would be nice for us all."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"Like many others, I bought the book because I thought I might learn something about McKinsey. What I found was a tired set of recycled &quot;ideas&quot; and stories that have little or no application to my business life.I checked Amazon.com's Purchaser Circle to see what McKinsey folks are buying and this book is Number One on their list -- for me, that is the 13th stroke of the village clock that casts doubt on the preceding 12!I read a hundred or more business books a year. I'm sorry I wasted my time on this one."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"Mr. Rasiel has written a book on consulting for 3rd graders. It is full of fluff and cliches. At the beginning of each chapter, he outlines its contents in 2 paragraphs, and spends the rest of the chapter illustrating his \\"points\\" with weak, unengaging, and not even remotely entertaining anecdotes.His solution for a member of the client team who would leaf through the presentation booklet at the beginning of a meeting and then tune out? Staple the pages of the book together! Gee thanks, Mr. Rasiel... priceless advice.Here are some other gems that I found especially helpful:+ \\"No one ever said life was fair.\\"+ \\"Sometimes a little politeness goes a long way.\\"+ \\"When all else fails, have a doorman. Then, at least, you'll come home to clean laundry.\\"The only valuable information I gleaned from this book is that if Ethan Rasiel is anything like the rest of the McKinsey-ites, I would last no longer than 2 years at the Firm myself. I found myself gritting my teeth at the nauseating tone and pointless content of this book. Save your time and read something (anything) else."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"This book is a good, if dated, introduction to the basics of strategy consulting in general and McKinsey in particular. If you are interested in strategy consulting this is a must read. It is very concise and generally well-written; although at times the author can come off as trying too hard to be amusing. It is a quick read and a fairly short book; shorter than the page numbers suggest because the font size is fairly large. This is a must-read not only if you are going into strategy consulting but if you are interested in high-level business thinking. For example, if you are planning to attend a top-tier MBA program, read this book. I found several useful bits of advice, esp. regarding how to structure your argument or presentation, especially the MECE principle: Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive. Overall, this book is worth the read."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"Not much more to say other than the book has very little insight into what management consulting is. Don't waste your money and your time."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"I picked up the book with a hope of picking some cool fundas in Consulting and was very disappointed. I would put the book as a small collection of \\"Common Sense\\" and none of the methods to be really extra ordinary. But as people say \\"Common Sense is not so common\\", one can just quickly go through by borrowing the book. One thing I liked in the book is the importance of facts in Consulting. Couple of points mentioned at the begining justifying the need to focus was facts was interesting"},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"\\"The McKinsey Way\\" is a marvellous and useful book that provides insights on how the very successful and world renowned Mckinsey & Company tackles challenges which are faced by their clients. McKinsey & Company is one of the first choices for the large corporates that may need assistance. I am one of those that are getting started in the consultancy business and therefore found the ideas and insight provided by the author to be very useful and practical.Consulting firms and other businesses can learn from the wide range of subjects covered in the book ranging from problem solving, team building, interviewing techniques, selling, communication skills, effective selling, among others. Individuals should also benefit from the tips and techniques for effectively working and surviving in a highly pressurised working environment.The book is well written in an easy to read and understand style. The guidelines provided are simple and straightforward.It is interesting to note the consultancy fees of up to $800 per hour that Mckinsey charges and still has clients flocking for their services."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"If you are wondering about consulting (or implementation) work, read the book - it's all true. And not only about McKinsey."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"I was expecting much more insight about what it's like to work at McKinsey. For the most part, I thought this book was a waste of time."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"I strongly recommend this book to many of the people with whom I work. I have purchased multiple copies to give as gifts and loaners.The book is a very practical guide to problem solving, concise communication and organized thinking. It has tactics that anyone can use to improve their performance and effectiveness.I have read many business books and the McKinsey Way is on top of my list because it is so practical and has time tested wisdom."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"Ethan M. Raisel describes the problem-solving process used by McKinsey &amp; Company, a well-known corporate consulting firm. The book offers easily digested tips. The insightful section on conducting interviews and the tips on building teamwork are particularly useful. However, because the author and other McKinsey consultants are prohibited by confidentiality agreements from discussing the specifics of their cases, the book lacks real-world examples of the firm's problem-solving approaches. We [...] recommend this book to managers seeking useful information and problem solving techniques."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"I agree with what the other reviewer was saying -- I would like to see more elaboration of the 3 principles. But other than that, it's one of the best business books I have read in years. Being an environmental consultant myself, I could relate some of the experiences the author and the &quot;Firm&quot; had. A good read for everyone in the business."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"The book fails to delve in depth the ways of McKinsey Consulting. Lot of fluff. Very dissappointing reading."},{"Title":"The McKinsey Way","review":"The book has a few good points, but lacks detail. It reads more like an advertisment for McKinsey than an objective or useful book."},{"Title":"Call to Arms: A Civil War Tale of Trauma, Tragedy, Triumph and True Love","review":"Call to Arms is one of those books that literally takes you on a journey back in time. The civil war error is brilliantly portrayed on many levels, including the emotions, challenges, romance, and spiritual relevance of a time in history that changed the destiny of individuals as well as our nation. The colorful characters and plots capture your interest and allows you to live the story with them. It would be wonderful to see this story of love and faith come to life on a movie screen!A Texas friend and fan."},{"Title":"Call to Arms: A Civil War Tale of Trauma, Tragedy, Triumph and True Love","review":"This is a wonderful story set amid the dramatic mid 1800's backdrop of our nation's Civil War. I appreciate how Mr. Wayne has weaved a realistic drama into the pages of this historic time period, while incorporating both the tragedy of the many battles and the trials, tribulations and indomitable spirit of those who were both on the front lines and on the home front. While set predominantly in the South, it offers a comprehensive look at both the North and the South, and the issues that were of concern to the people who lived during that time - all the while remaining true to historical facts. It is primarily a love story, with bits of humor and strong spiritual faith blended in, while being an uplifting educational read - and at the same time offering a profound perspective on life itself."},{"Title":"Call to Arms: A Civil War Tale of Trauma, Tragedy, Triumph and True Love","review":"\\"Call to Arms\\" is a must read and spellbinding novel. It has all the elements needed for fascinating reading - a book you will not want to put down until it is finished. It is a haunting, true life depiction of Civil War times. There is something for everyone; charming true love, hilarious comedy, hope, beauty, sadness, joy, and historical accuracy of the mid 1800's. This is the perfect book for giftgiving for those who read for pure pleasure. It would make a wonderful movie with a musical score to create that \\"Old World Charm.\\""},{"Title":"At Close Quarters PT Boats in the United States Navy","review":"Gives a very in-depth look at all MTB operations in both the pacific and european areas.

It became confusing when he went from the Pacific Theater to the Med."},{"Title":"At Close Quarters PT Boats in the United States Navy","review":"The facts that are presented in this book are great. The only problem I have is that they spend a lot of time naming everyone on each boat and each event.

Should have been more written about the sailors who manned these craft instead of just what boat commanded by what officer went where."},{"Title":"At Close Quarters PT Boats in the United States Navy","review":"This book is a thorough history of American PT boat operations in World War Two. It covers all battle actions of the boats and what they accomplished in all theaters that the boats operated in -- the South Pacific, the Aleutians, and in Europe and the Mediterranean, an area of the PT boat war that, for some reaon, has had much less coverage than what these boats did in the Pacific. It also details the origins and developements of the boats, and the vastly complicated logistical problems covering huge distances that often bedeviled the boats and their crews. The book features many photographs of the boats and their crews and how they lived, as well as a complete list of every man killed or wounded on a PT boat during the war, as well as the numerous medals awarded to pt boat crews. It is a great record of these versatile boats and their courageous sailors.Yet, it is a dry history. There is little or nothing about the men that sailed these boats into harm's way. Where did they come from? Why did they choose the dangers of a PT boat? What led them to go up against destroyers in plywood/mahongeny boats? A little bit of that and it would have been a fantastic account of the pt boats. Still, for anyone that loves naval history this is an incredible book."},{"Title":"At Close Quarters PT Boats in the United States Navy","review":"My father was a PT sailor during World War II in the Solomon Islands, then stateside for the last 2 years of the war. He gave me this book when it first published in the 1960's. It is the cornerstone of my library of PT boat books.It is not the easiest book to read, but it is simply loaded with information about all PT's during the war. This book and PT 105 will give you an excellent overview of both history, and what it was like to be there."},{"Title":"At Close Quarters PT Boats in the United States Navy","review":"Virtually a comprehensive work of all significant actions involving PT's. Does not describe the boat configurations at all though. This would have been a good supplement. Overall very interesting."},{"Title":"At Close Quarters PT Boats in the United States Navy","review":"This is a rare book. By that I mean the author has not just used the after action reports of the various boats but also given a detailed listing of awards received, casualities listed individually, and the short life history of each boat. As a historian I can tell you this is a monumental work in research. I knew a little about the boats being used to put intelligence teams in, my Dad was one of them when he commanded the 41st Infantry Div Reconnisance Troop. All he ever told me about working with the PTs was they were good men to work with, from him that was a high complement. While for many people may this book may seem dry, to those of us that have studied World War II it is far from it and I strongly recommend this book to anyone that is intrested in the little known facts of the US Navy in World War II."},{"Title":"At Close Quarters PT Boats in the United States Navy","review":"This book opened my eyes to the fact that there was more than one PT Boat, the 109, employed during WWII. Forthose interested in the employment of PT boats during the war, this is a good start.The book also covers the various makes and models of PT boats. The book covers how the various models weretested before acceptance by the Navy, the different equipment installed on the various boats as the warprogressed and their missions changed. It also covers some of the missions the boats carried out withtheir success or failure."},{"Title":"At Close Quarters PT Boats in the United States Navy","review":"I bought this for my Dad who was on PT-224. This book is awesome as it mentions PT boats and squadrons by specific number. I even matched up stories my Dad would tell us with excerpts in the book!"},{"Title":"At Close Quarters PT Boats in the United States Navy","review":"While I don't like to be critical of any author's work, I'm sorry to say that this book did not delivery what I expected. Essentially it's a collection of blow-by-blow descriptions of every PT boat ever commissioned with such facinating details as; when it was commissioned, when it joined a squadron, names of crew members, when they got promoted, etc. Granted some of this information was interesting but after 3 or 4 chapters is becomes quite repetitive and dull. Some of the combat narratives start to bread up the monontony but I found them few and usually brief. I would say this book is ideal for the dedicated Naval historian. If it's important to you to know when 'Joe Blow' got promoted to Captn' or Commander, and when it was decided to move squadron X from island A to island B, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"At Close Quarters PT Boats in the United States Navy","review":"Excellent book overall. It gives a complete story of the actions of PT Boats in all the theaters of operations. i personally never really knew much about the actions of PT boats in other places than the Solomon's.

Everytime a boat goes out through out the entire book, the author quotes the captains full name and rank to the point your eyes glaze over.
